1
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,203
<i>When you were here before</i>

2
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,834
<i>Couldn't look you in the eye</i>

3
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,799
<i>You're just like an angel</i>

4
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,637
<i>Your skin makes me cry</i>

5
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,144
<i>You float like a feather</i>

6
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,273
<i>In a beautiful world</i>

7
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>And wish I was special</i>

8
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,160
Come on, Drax. Dance.

9
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,703
Only idiots dance.

10
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,583
<i>And I'm a creep</i>

11
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,006
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

12
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,802
<i>What the hell am I doin' here?</i>

13
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,976
<i>I don't belong here</i>

14
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,612
<i>I want to have control</i>

15
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,286
<i>I want a perfect body</i>

16
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>I want a perfect soul</i>

17
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,797
<i>I want you to notice</i>

18
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,386
<i>When I'm not around</i>

19
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,392
<i>You're so very special</i>

20
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,062
<i>I wish I was special</i>

21
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,944
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

22
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,737
Hey! Uh-uh.

23
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,200
I told you
a million times,

24
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:05,162
you keep your grimy
raccoon hands off my Zune.

25
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,209
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

26
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,961
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

27
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:22,596
<i>When I don't belong here</i>

28
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,516
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

29
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:31,897
Again?

30
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,324
<i>Ah, she's runnin' out</i>

31
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:49,415
<i>She run, run, run, run</i>

32
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,675
<i>Whatever makes you happy</i>

33
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,930
<i>Whatever you want</i>

34
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,141
I love you, Gamora.

35
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,645
<i>You're so very special</i>

36
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,026
<i>I wish I was special</i>

37
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,740
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

38
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:30,247
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

39
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,919
<i>What the hell am I doing here?</i>

40
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,716
<i>I don't belong here</i>

41
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,847
<i>I don't belong here</i>

42
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,978
So, what are you
gonna do about Quill?

43
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,939
Me? Why not you?

44
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,108
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,485
Why are you on the ceiling?

46
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,278
I wanted to see if
these new gravity boots

47
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,363
worked on a slope.

48
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,578
Here we go.

49
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,174
- Oh.

50
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,761
Sorry.

51
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,770
<i>Bozhe moi, Kraglin.</i>

52
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,647
You must know
you will never learn.

53
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,982
You think you could do better?

54
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,109
<i>Da.</i>

55
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,236
<i>Davaj.</i>

56
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,880
Telekinesis
is cheating!

57
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,924
That's a stupid little pebble!

58
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,093
I could do that
with my dang finger!

59
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,013
- You're a bad dog.

60
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,764
Do not say that to me.

61
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,349
You are. You're a bad dog.

62
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,559
Take that back.

63
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,311
Come on, that's not cool.

64
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,563
Nebula, did you hear?

65
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,356
He called me a bad dog,

66
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,816
and he refused
to take it back.

67
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,443
I don't care, Cosmo.

68
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,612
- Is Peter okay?
- I don't know.

69
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,948
What are you going to do?
- Me? He's your brother.

70
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,242
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

71
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

72
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,496
She's not dead.

73
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,165
She just doesn't
remember anything

74
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,249
from the past few years.

75
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,626
Nobody tells me nothing.

76
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,628
Mantis, why don't you
just touch him and,

77
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,796
- you know, make him happy?
- I am Groot?

78
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,964
- Dude!
- Gross!

79
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,967
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

80
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,553
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

81
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,847
'Bout that time you made me
fall in love with my sock?

82
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,307
Well, that was funny.

83
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,893
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

84
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,186
Maybe we should draw straws.

85
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,188
No one ever meant that, Drax.

86
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,004
<i>If we still have time
We might still get by</i>

87
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,634
<i>Every time I think about it
I wanna cry</i>

88
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,388
<i>With bombs and the Devil
And the kids keep comin'</i>

89
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,183
<i>No way to breathe easy
No time to be young</i>

90
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:47,194
<i>But I tell myself
That I was doin' all right</i>

91
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,406
<i>There's nothin' left
To do at night</i>

92
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,164
What was that?
What was that?

93
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,958
What the hell?
Oh, my God!

94
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,167
- Is he okay?

95
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,302
Hey!

96
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,139
Where did you go, squirrel?

97
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,148
On the ground!

98
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,545
No, stop! Don't!

99
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,090
Stop, please! No!
Stop, please!

100
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,300
Please!

101
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,043
- Who is that maniac?

102
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,587
Some super douche
with ray gun hands,

103
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,005
I don't frickin' know.

104
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:08,794
Who threw this thing at me?

105
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,879
- Shut up.

106
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,215
Baby.

107
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,858
Pick on someone your own size.

108
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,385
Peter!

109
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,138
- Peter!

110
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,472
We need Med-Paks!

111
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,863
- Nebula!

112
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,947
Piss off.

113
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,469
- Ooh.

114
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,973
Rocket.

115
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,411
That hurts.

116
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,497
What a pity.

117
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,598
No!

118
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,020
All I did was
activate the Med-Paks!

119
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,647
Get them off! Now!

120
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,191
Oh, hell.

121
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,360
We need to get him
to the Med-Bay!

122
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,279
It was destroyed.
There's one on the ship.

123
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,287
Lill ol od for today.

124
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,208
Stitch him up and transfer him
in with the rest of Batch 89.

125
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,575
It's okay.

126
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,577
You're here with us now.

127
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,955
Hey! It's a new guy.

128
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,791
What kind of thing are you?

129
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,627
You've got, like,
a mask on your face.

130
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,508
Mask, eyes,
face, mouth,

131
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,301
does it words?

132
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:31,014
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

133
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,105
Hurts.

134
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,713
It's okay.

135
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,260
You're gonna be okay.

136
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,681
A kill switch?

137
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,891
A device set to destruct

138
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,768
if anyone goes
poking around inside him,

139
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,145
or even if we use
the Med-Paks.

140
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,021
And why would Rocket
have a kill switch?

141
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,274
Apparently, someone considers
him proprietary technology

142
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,860
and sent that golden lunatic
to get him.

143
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,528
So, he'll die
if we operate on him?

144
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,612
And he'll die if we don't.

145
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,947
There has to be some way
to bypass it.

146
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,240
It looks like
there's a passkey

147
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,575
that could override
the kill switch.

148
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,952
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

149
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,328
He won't talk about it.

150
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,747
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

151
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,958
And there's a code
on all of it,

152
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,669
89P13.

153
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,754
He's got maybe 48 hours.

154
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,425
Where are you going?

155
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,968
OrgoCorp have to
have records, right?

156
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,261
Maybe they'll have
a way for us

157
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,263
to override the kill switch
and save Rocket.

158
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,806
They won't just
give us that information.

159
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,308
Well, that's why
we're gonna break in.

160
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,393
We kill anyone
who gets in our way!

161
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,228
Not kill anyone.
Kill a few people.

162
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,354
Kill no people.

163
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,815
Kill one guy, one stupid guy
who no one loves.

164
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,650
Now you're just making it sad.

165
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,116
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch

166
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,868
<i>over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.</i>

167
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,453
- Aye, Cap'n.
Aye, comrade.

168
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,372
Take back what you said,

169
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,874
- that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

170
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,210
I know you don't really
think I am a bad dog.

171
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,753
Can you please take it back?

172
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,837
I will not.

173
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,883
I located the coordinates
for OrgoCorp.

174
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,384
I think I have
a contact near there.

175
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,719
Maybe they can help us get in.

176
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,012
Contact him.

177
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,431
Let's go save our friend.

178
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:57,327
<i>I get the same old dreams
Same time every night</i>

179
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,497
<i>Fall to the ground
And I wake up</i>

180
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,210
<i>So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head</i>

181
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,838
<i>Thoughts flyback
To the break-up</i>

182
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,508
<i>These four walls
Are closing in</i>

183
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,761
<i>Look at the fix
You've put me in</i>

184
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,639
<i>Since you been gone</i>

185
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,890
No, no, no.

186
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,767
<i>Since you been gone</i>

187
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,104
<i>I'm out of my head
Can't take it</i>

188
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,608
<i>Could I be wrong
But since you been gone</i>

189
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,861
<i>You cast the spell
So break it</i>

190
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,617
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

191
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,454
It's good to have friends.

192
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,833
<i>Since you been gone</i>

193
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,423
Oh, my poor baby.

194
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,925
It hurts.

195
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,013
- Do you have it?
- He does not, sire.

196
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,890
I tried to warn you,
High Evolutionary.

197
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,435
These Guardians are
more powerful than you think.

198
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,604
Or perhaps you simply
overestimate your own value,

199
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,189
High Priestess.

200
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,943
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

201
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,946
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

202
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,906
Beautiful numbskulls.

203
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,118
But your egos have run wild.
Say, "Ah."

204
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,537
- Ah.
- And this one

205
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,247
was meant to be the Warlock,

206
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,915
the apogee of their people.

207
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,376
You removed Adam
from his cocoon early,

208
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,544
my liege.

209
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,212
He's still a child.

210
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,797
No, there's something
wrong with him

211
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,965
even outside all that.

212
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,633
Yes, there's something
wrong with me!

213
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,053
I was stabbed,
you extraordinary phallus!

214
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,222
He doesn't know any better.

215
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,724
We shall do whatever
you require, my liege.

216
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,269
You knew of 89P13's existence
for years without alerting me.

217
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,271
That's not what I require!

218
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,401
I'm sorry, my liege.

219
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,571
Find 89P13
and return it to me,

220
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,240
or I will destroy
your entire civilization,

221
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,743
as is my right as your maker.

222
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,578
Do you understand?

223
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,794
Do you understand?

224
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,254
Yes, sire.

225
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,840
Toodle-do.

226
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,596
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

227
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,181
It was always clever, sire.

228
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,100
Yes, that's exactly why
I want it now.

229
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,851
- Of course.
- Its brain.

230
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,229
That is the only reason, sire.

231
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,649
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

232
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,317
They're merely a backup.

233
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,361
I believe I know
where they're going.

234
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,980
It's bio-formed.

235
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,649
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

236
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,693
The structure is surrounded

237
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,237
by three impenetrable
plasmic security shields.

238
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,321
It's not going to be easy

239
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,739
to break into this place,
Star-Lord.

240
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,824
Doesn't have to be easy.

241
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,742
I was a professional thief,
remember?

242
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,286
I'll jam the signals
one at a time.

243
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,290
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

244
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,541
She's always mad

245
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,461
- at everyone.

246
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,254
It's because I was drunk.

247
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,632
She's right.

248
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,800
If I hadn't been drinking,

249
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,887
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

250
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,389
It's okay.
He's your best friend.

251
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,807
Second best friend.

252
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,770
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

253
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:53,938
Gamora isn't dead.

254
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,024
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

255
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,234
Thank you.

256
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,948
First shield set.

257
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,285
Three, two,

258
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,121
one.

259
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,836
- Peter.
- What?

260
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,088
You had family on Earth,

261
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,090
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

262
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,092
No, you're my sister.

263
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,928
That's all the family
I want or need.

264
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,013
Besides, it was really
just my grandpa, okay?

265
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,598
- He was a pretty hard guy.

266
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,517
Still. Don't you think he...

267
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,352
What?

268
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,937
You were abducted by Ravagers

269
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,064
the same day
he lost his daughter.

270
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,565
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

271
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,983
My mom died,
he screamed in my face,

272
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,151
he pushed me out of the room!

273
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,570
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

274
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,364
- What are you talking about?
- What?

275
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,615
I'm talking about the people
in my life who died,

276
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,699
and you're talking about this?

277
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,784
Second shield set.

278
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,620
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

279
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,751
I'm only saying,

280
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,212
you've never even
gone to see if he's okay.

281
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,672
He could still be alive.

282
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:04,592
My grandpa? He'd be, like,
90-something years old.

283
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,177
So he could still be alive.

284
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,054
People on Earth die
when they're, like, 50.

285
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,847
They die when they're 50?

286
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,641
I don't know.
Something like that.

287
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,434
What's even
the point of being born?

288
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,271
- Exactly!
- Are you about to die?

289
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,232
I'm not 50!

290
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,402
- The point is,

291
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,779
I wasn't talking
about any of this.

292
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,740
Third shield set.

293
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,743
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

294
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,579
Well, not everything

295
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,414
is about
what you are talking about.

296
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,749
And I'm only saying
you are upset

297
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,835
because so many of the people
you cared about

298
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,086
- have left you...

299
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,796
...but you also left someone.

300
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,132
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

301
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,217
It's too late.
They're all gone.

302
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,398
Why didn't we go through?

303
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,487
We did. It's not the shield.

304
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,035
Oh, hell.

305
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,539
Ravagers.

306
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,417
<i>Hey, guys,
you're about to be boarded</i>

307
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,044
<i>by the United Ravagers.</i>

308
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,295
<i>You can surrender
and turn over</i>

309
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,880
<i>any stuff
worth anything and live...</i>

310
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,882
<i>- ...or you can die.</i>

311
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,008
<i>Totes up to you.</i>

312
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,692
- Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

313
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,860
- Mwah.
- Guys, it's me,

314
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,111
Peter Quill, I'm one of you,
remember?

315
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,113
Hold on!
We have an appointment!

316
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,948
- We have an appointment.
- With who?

317
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,159
- With Gamora.
- With Gamora.

318
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,703
- What?
You're early.

319
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,179
What are these?

320
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,682
OrgoCorp uniforms.

321
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,060
You're gonna have to wear
these to move through the Orgo

322
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,354
without attracting attention.

323
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,689
This isn't my color.

324
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,443
What did you say?

325
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,195
It clashes with my eyes.

326
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,159
Put it on!

327
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,371
Nebula, why would you
not tell me

328
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,373
that you've been in contact
with Gamora?

329
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,958
Because I didn't want you
to get freaked out.

330
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,126
Freaked out how?

331
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,335
Like that.

332
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:45,920
Let me in there.

333
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,046
I don't wanna be trapped
out here, I can't...

334
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,049
Gamora, we are grateful
for your help.

335
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,719
Oh, I'm not doing this out
of the kindness of my heart.

336
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,263
I'm doing this
for the hundred thousand units

337
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,556
my sister promised.

338
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,225
- So, you're a Ravager now?

339
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,810
Put on the uniform.

340
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,562
Never pictured you
as the Ravager type.

341
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,106
Who are you again?

342
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,691
- Oh, man.

343
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,986
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced

344
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,989
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy,

345
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,119
<i>so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.</i>

346
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,748
<i>Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock,</i>

347
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,000
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

348
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,963
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records,

349
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,340
where maybe
you can find the passkey

350
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,718
to override the kill switch

351
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,887
and help you
save the hedgehog.

352
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,306
But if you get into trouble,

353
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,768
we will not
be able to bail you out.

354
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,244
Yes.

355
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,164
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

356
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,794
His functioning
has skyrocketed.

357
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,132
That's correct, P1 3.

358
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,550
Very good.

359
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,266
That's the new world.

360
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,726
Counter-Earth.

361
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,813
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

362
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,189
It blue.

363
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,357
That's the sky.

364
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,858
Sky.

365
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
Rocket.

366
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,739
Yes, it is.

367
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,867
- What sounds?

368
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,495
That's music.

369
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,579
We like it?

370
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,122
We do.

371
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:49,252
This recording
is over 5,000 years old.

372
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,922
"Mo Ergastee Förn, Mo Ergalone Förn Nort."

373
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,217
Which, translated, is,

374
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,846
"Be not as you are,
but as you should be."

375
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,098
It's our sacred mission,

376
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,017
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us

377
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,271
and turn it into a song.

378
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,650
To take an imperfect clump

379
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,528
of biological matter
such as you

380
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,614
and transform it
into something

381
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,283
perfect.

382
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,746
And we're halfway there,
aren't we?

383
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,586
Come with me, P1 3.

384
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,713
I'd like to show you
something.

385
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,011
<i>We have but a single quest,</i>

386
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,930
to create the perfect species

387
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,099
and the perfect society.

388
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,685
You, P1 3,

389
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,187
are part of Batch 89.

390
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,648
But here with Batch 90,

391
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,193
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

392
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,863
any organism
through millions of years

393
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,532
of programmed
evolutionary changes

394
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,534
in a moment.

395
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,277
See, now, there's the rub.

396
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,821
- For some reason,

397
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,075
these specimens
are also over-producing

398
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,954
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems,

399
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,747
causing them to be, well...

400
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,999
Violent. We don't like it.

401
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,251
A utopia
can't have its denizens

402
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,962
murdering one another, can it?

403
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,254
It can'ts.

404
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,173
Can't.

405
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,466
Can't.

406
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,842
Theel.

407
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,891
They're programmed
to be peaceful. Like you.

408
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,436
But for some reason,
it's not catching.

409
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,231
Hyptonic filters.

410
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,315
What?

411
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,403
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

412
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,571
And then boop-boop-boop,

413
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,032
halfcystine residual
be formin',

414
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,618
and then, they make, um...

415
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,203
What do you say?

416
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,330
Loligo
beta-microseminoproteins.

417
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:32,957
Yeah, thems.

418
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,793
And then, angry turtleses.

419
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,798
Huh.

420
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,287
<i>Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooooh</i>

421
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,460
<i>Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooooh</i>

422
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,381
<i>Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooooh</i>

423
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,428
<i>There. That's
the decompression chamber.</i>

424
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,055
<i>Lock in.</i>

425
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,018
<i>Andin the end
We shall achieve in time</i>

426
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,312
<i>The thing they call divine</i>

427
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,315
<i>When all the stars
Will smile for me</i>

428
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,441
<i>Go.</i>

429
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,571
<i>When allis well
And well is all for all</i>

430
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,615
<i>And forever after</i>

431
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:53,079
<i>Well, maybe in the meantime
Wait and see</i>

432
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:57,291
<i>We love the all
The all of you</i>

433
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:03,589
<i>Where lands are green
And skies are blue</i>

434
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,803
<i>When all in all
We're just like you</i>

435
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,473
<i>Activate gravity boots
and gloves.</i>

436
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,855
<i>And when I cry for me
I cry for you</i>

437
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,233
<i>Nebula, go.</i>

438
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,819
<i>For all the days
You've still to come</i>

439
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:30,616
<i>And did I ever say
I'd never play</i>

440
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,577
<i>Or fly toward the sun</i>

441
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:39,291
<i>Maybe in the meantime
Something's wrong</i>

442
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:43,087
<i>We love the all
The all of you</i>

443
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:48,801
<i>Where lands are green
And skies are blue</i>

444
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,812
<i>So, you really don't
remember anything?</i>

445
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,896
<i>Like what?</i>

446
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:02,815
<i>'Bout your time with us.</i>

447
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,942
<i>No.</i>

448
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,279
<i>- Huh. We were...
- We weren't anything.</i>

449
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,655
<i>You and me...</i>

450
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,325
<i>That person was some alternate
future version of me.</i>

451
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,911
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

452
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,497
<i>We loved each other.</i>

453
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,959
<i>I don't think so.</i>

454
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,421
<i>I know you don't remember
any of it.</i>

455
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,050
<i>You were everything to me.</i>

456
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,305
<i>And I miss you...</i>

457
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,141
<i>so much.</i>

458
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,560
<i>And, maybe...</i>

459
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,022
<i>maybe, if you
open yourself up to it...</i>

460
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:45,983
<i>there's a possibility...</i>

461
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,651
<i>I don't think so, Quinn.</i>

462
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,862
<i>Quill.</i>

463
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,030
<i>Quill.</i>

464
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,158
<i>I don't think so.</i>

465
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,367
<i>Well, what
I'm trying to say...</i>

466
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,786
<i>Peter, you know this is
an open line, right?</i>

467
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,996
<i>What?</i>

468
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,623
<i>We're listening to everything
you're saying.</i>

469
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,708
<i>And it is painful.</i>

470
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,001
<i>And you're
just telling me now?</i>

471
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,336
<i>We were hoping
it would stop on its own.</i>

472
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,712
<i>But I switched it over
to private!</i>

473
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,172
<i>What color button
did you push?</i>

474
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,341
<i>- Blue, for the blue suit!
- Oh, no!</i>

475
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,259
<i>Blue is the open line
for everyone.</i>

476
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,094
<i>- Orange is for blue.
- What?</i>

477
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,680
<i>Black is for orange,
yellow is for green,</i>

478
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:19,266
<i>green is for red,
and red is for yellow.</i>

479
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,809
<i>No. Yellow is for yellow,</i>

480
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,561
<i>green is for red,
red is for green.</i>

481
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,271
<i>- I don't think so.
- Try it then.</i>

482
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:26,982
<i>Hello!</i>

483
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,236
<i>You were right.</i>

484
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,196
<i>How the hell am I supposed
to know all of that?</i>

485
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,572
<i>Seems intuitive.</i>

486
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,033
<i>Can we get back
to saving our friend?</i>

487
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,495
<i>Get that jammer
ready to change the shield.</i>

488
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:14,947
<i>Guys?</i>

489
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,865
I mean, you wanna talk
about a sweet ride?

490
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,034
The acceleration
will crush your spine.

491
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,703
It's got that brand-new
fusalix core.

492
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,787
You know
what I'm talking about?

493
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,871
Oh, yeah.

494
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,206
Really? 'Cause I just
made that up.

495
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,750
Oh, I thought
you said somethin' else.

496
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,794
Master Karja.

497
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,464
- No, you didn't.
- I... I did.

498
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,259
Master Karja, there appears
to be a physical breach

499
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,510
<i>in the white wing somewhere.</i>

500
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,095
<i>- Could it be a glitch?
Maybe.</i>

501
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,020
I'm accessing the eye.

502
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,604
I'll see if I can locate it.

503
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:20,846
There's some sort of anomaly

504
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,057
<i>in the decompression chamber.
Best you check it out, Master.</i>

505
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,141
On it.

506
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:26,727
Hurry.

507
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,698
Where do we put these?

508
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,244
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

509
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,503
Hurry!

510
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,313
What the hell was that, guys?

511
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,818
- What, are you kidding me?
- What?

512
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,321
A neutro-quark
just hit the satellite.

513
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,739
It's burning a hole
through the wall.

514
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,950
You geniuses,
you just throw the door open

515
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,327
without any proper
precautionary procedure?

516
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,787
What procedure, bro?

517
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,332
Oh! You want us to read
the manual for you too, bro?

518
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,626
You could have killed
everyone in the wing!

519
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,920
Exactly! You idiots!

520
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,422
I'm angry too!

521
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,673
Oh, no.

522
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,924
I mean, can't you see

523
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,717
these authentic
mechanic uniforms

524
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,052
that we're wearing
on our bodies?

525
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,513
That blend in with some of our
skin-tones better than others?

526
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,432
Excuse my friend.

527
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,684
He is the boss' nephew.
He's a little...

528
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,397
Oh. Oh.

529
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,192
Yeah. I...
I got one of those too.

530
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,070
I mean, this one?
This one I love.

531
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,238
I'm so proud.

532
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,865
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

533
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,783
But this one, I just...

534
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,584
Everything he does
drives me crazy.

535
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,668
Yeah.

536
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,752
I thought you said
something else.

537
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:16,837
Shut up.

538
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,630
I swear
I'm gonna throttle him.

539
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:19,882
I'm gonna go to jail
for murder.

540
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,175
- I am.

541
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,634
How'd you guys
get here so fast?

542
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,470
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in

543
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,513
before it burned all the way
through, thankfully.

544
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,307
Ah. Good thing you were here.

545
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,934
- All right, guys, wrap it up.

546
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,519
Looks like
we're all clear here.

547
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,692
Our spacesuits!

548
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,364
You threw them
in the contamination bin.

549
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:47,201
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

550
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,995
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago.

551
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,080
Damn it, Mantis,
why don't you ever think?

552
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,333
Are we pretending
to be angry again?

553
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,667
Mantis, you asshole!

554
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,212
Guys, just focus
for two seconds.

555
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,630
We'll find another way
out of here.

556
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,758
Right now,
we need to save Rocket's life.

557
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,385
Nebula, Quinn, and I

558
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,387
will get to the records
and get the passkey.

559
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,472
Bug and Doofus,

560
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,182
access the spaceport
through the elevator

561
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,518
so Tree can land
and get us out of here.

562
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,186
Apologies.

563
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,270
No problem.

564
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,481
Go.

565
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,163
Not my fault
I don't know something

566
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,665
if no one ever tells me.

567
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,375
I didn't even wanna come here.

568
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,001
I'm gonna need to see your...

569
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,087
You're hopelessly in love

570
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,838
with him.

571
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,173
Oh, no.

572
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,175
- Hey.

573
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,260
Hey.

574
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,679
How you doin' today?

575
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,014
I'm all right.

576
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,435
What was... What was
your name again?

577
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,105
- Drax the Destroyer.
- Oh.

578
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,524
- That is such a lovely name.

579
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,817
Oh.

580
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,151
I'll get the door for you.

581
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,030
I'll be here when you
come back out, okay?

582
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,115
Sure.

583
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,534
Every single time.

584
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:14,329
My name is Bletelsnort.

585
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,833
<i>Welcome
to OrgoCorp headquarters.</i>

586
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,876
<i>For over 300years,</i>

587
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,629
<i>OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants</i>

588
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,257
<i>and genetic upgrades
across the universe</i>

589
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,760
<i>under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.</i>

590
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,346
That warning we got today,

591
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,098
don't those two
match the description?

592
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,517
Attention, all Orgosentries,

593
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,147
That manager should
have access to the records.

594
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,859
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

595
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,278
All right.
I'll handle this one.

596
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,487
How?

597
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,865
Pure Star-Lord charm.

598
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,950
I'm excited for you
that you get to see this again

599
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:53,201
for the first time.

600
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,377
Hi, Yura.

601
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,462
Ura.

602
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:05,088
- Oh. Ura.
Hi.

603
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,215
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

604
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,969
I've been noticing you
for quite a while,

605
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,846
and the way
that you smile to yourself

606
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,931
when you think
nobody is looking,

607
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,059
it makes my every day
a bit brighter.

608
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,102
We need your hand.
And it's your choice

609
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,604
whether it's on your body
or not.

610
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,980
What are you doing?

611
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,649
She was never
gonna fall for that.

612
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,900
Dude, she was
totally into me, man!

613
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,485
I kind of thought
you were a douchebag.

614
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,028
- Oh, come on.
- We need a file.

615
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,322
- What file?
- 89P13.

616
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,698
- Could that be something?
- No.

617
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,325
Then your use to us

618
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,202
- is over.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

619
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,495
It sounds like a species tag.

620
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,789
Show us!

621
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,627
<i>All of
our research supports</i>

622
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,672
<i>the High Evolutionary's
altruistic objective</i>

623
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,466
<i>of creating a utopian society.</i>

624
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,218
That must be
the spaceport.

625
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,974
Whoa.

626
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,227
What is all this?

627
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,772
Species patented over
the years using OrgoCorp tech.

628
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,233
Every species
OrgoCorp has created

629
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,068
has its own individual file.

630
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,778
I'm so sorry about this.

631
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,905
Listen to me, this is not
the kind of thing we do.

632
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,157
Oh, please, stop it
with the subtle jabs!

633
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,742
Old you would have
never done this.

634
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,119
You had a purpose
higher than yourself.

635
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,370
- A calling to help people.
- Give me a break.

636
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,122
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

637
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,707
Except, I didn't
form the Guardians.

638
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,000
Sheesh.
- And I barely left Thanos.

639
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,670
Whoever it was
that you were in love with,

640
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:28,922
it wasn't me.

641
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,966
It sounds more like her.

642
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,050
- Her?
- What?

643
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:33,885
- That's ridiculous!
- Do not bring me into this.

644
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,595
- Don't even...

645
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,560
- Knock it off!
- What?

646
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,061
Don't look at me
like a lost puppy

647
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,271
needing a soft place

648
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,605
- to lie down.
- I didn't say anything!

649
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,778
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

650
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,867
They were replaced
by my father

651
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,077
as a method of torture.

652
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,663
He... He picked a pretty set.

653
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,459
There.

654
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:09,087
That's the file for 89P13.

655
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,090
Heads up, heads up!

656
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,635
Ugh.
Okay.

657
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,724
What?

658
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,948
Oh, no.

659
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:39,409
Walk!

660
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,954
Move it, move it!

661
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,670
Stand down!

662
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,215
Drax, we should
make a run for it.

663
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,382
Or we could fight.

664
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,467
- Run.
- Fight.

665
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,093
- Run!
- Fight!

666
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,054
- Take 'em!

667
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,601
What are we gonna do?

668
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,521
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

669
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,105
All of you, come with me...

670
00:44:09,523 --> 00:44:11,983
Everybody, lower your weapons,

671
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,652
or I blow
this woman's brains out!

672
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:14,861
That's the plan?

673
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,948
- You're a kitty cat.
- Meow.

674
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,077
You feel like dancing.

675
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,580
Violent rage.

676
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:32,838
Lower your weapons!

677
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,552
Let's kill that one
that looks like a carrot

678
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,928
to show we mean business.

679
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,639
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

680
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,684
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

681
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,435
We are not killing anyone!

682
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,520
Back off!

683
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,900
<i>Groot, bring the Bowie
to us. Now.</i>

684
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,621
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

685
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:07,789
Oh, please.

686
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:11,376
We're here to save the life
of our friend, that is all.

687
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,088
We paid her to help us get in
and get out.

688
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,631
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you

689
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,258
"do it in a way that
no one knows it's happening."

690
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,760
But no, what she means is,
"I'm gonna shoot people.

691
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:22,470
- "Threaten people's lives."
- Shut up!

692
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,556
And I know
you're probably asking,

693
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,141
why would I trust her?

694
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,059
Well, that's a good question.

695
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:31,521
The answer is,
we used to be in love.

696
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,690
Yeah. She was my girlfriend,

697
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,817
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

698
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,736
Because her dad threw her off
a magic cliff and she died,

699
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:38,904
and then I lost my temper

700
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,822
and nearly destroyed
half the universe.

701
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,741
Then she came back,
out of the past.

702
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,159
And there she is.

703
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,119
Everyone else who died in
the past stayed dead, not her.

704
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,455
Why? Was it the magic cliff?
I don't know.

705
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,957
I'm not some fricking
Infinity Stone scientist.

706
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,462
Just some dumb-ass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love,

707
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,464
that girl died,

708
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:00,133
and then came back
a total dick.

709
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,221
He left out
some important information,

710
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:07,849
but that is the gist of it.

711
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,649
Get to the security hub!

712
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:16,733
Okay!

713
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,370
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

714
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,121
Hey, hey, hey,
we don't want any...

715
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:31,790
No! Oh, my God

716
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:32,958
- Oh, my God! No!

717
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,669
Come on! Would you please
stop doing that?

718
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:52,727
<i>Now, I'm craving your body
Is this real</i>

719
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,231
<i>Temperature's rising
I don't want to feel</i>

720
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,192
<i>I'm in the wrong place
To be real</i>

721
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:02,404
Yeah!

722
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,571
Hey!

723
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:07,784
<i>And I'm longing to love you
Just for a night</i>

724
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:19,796
Run.

725
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,579
Drax!

726
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:58,084
Get on the ground
and show me your hands now.

727
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:08,595
Ura?

728
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,555
Please listen to me.

729
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,849
We need to get out of here
with this

730
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,309
to save my best friend's life.

731
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,061
If you could get us
into the system

732
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,187
of those sentries out there,

733
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,190
they are good people,
like you. I'm certain of it.

734
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:21,524
And if I just had
an opportunity

735
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,609
to speak to them...

736
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,277
They're corporate shills,
you idiot.

737
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,361
They're not gonna
listen to you.

738
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,322
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

739
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,407
Ura.

740
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,451
Please.

741
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,212
Hey!

742
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,759
Come out now!

743
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,761
- Damn it!

744
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,519
You are in.

745
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,021
Tell them your truth.

746
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:01,564
Yeah, I'm not that big
of an idiot.

747
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,108
I just needed to get
into the system.

748
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,985
Move it.

749
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,873
Told you she was into me.

750
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,229
I am Groot?

751
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,357
Yeah, that looked cool.

752
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,910
Is sky?

753
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,328
No.

754
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:01,082
That's not sky,
that's a ceiling.

755
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,044
But sire's making a new world
for all of us,

756
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,213
and when we get there,

757
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,174
there will be sky,

758
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:13,052
and it will be beautiful
and forever.

759
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,554
Wow.

760
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,431
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

761
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,934
I have been thinking.

762
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:21,686
'Bout what?

763
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,189
Oh, nothing in particular.

764
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:28,276
But I thought, since you guys
are my closest friends,

765
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,153
and my only friends,

766
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,946
you might
be interested in knowing

767
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,741
that I have been thinking.

768
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:36,367
That's cool.

769
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,870
I've been thinking, too,

770
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,581
about something more singular.

771
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,834
When sire moves us
to the new world,

772
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:46,836
we're gonna need names.

773
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:48,796
I mean,

774
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,840
89Q1 2,

775
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,342
it's not really a name,

776
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,847
so I would like
my name to be...

777
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,183
Lylla.

778
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,101
Lylla.

779
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:03,978
Lylla.

780
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,396
Lylla.

781
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,649
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

782
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,109
Thank you.

783
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,572
I think my name
shall be Teefs,

784
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,867
because, although
we all do have them,

785
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:21,120
mine are definitely
the most prominent.

786
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,123
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

787
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,416
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

788
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:31,339
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

789
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,509
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

790
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,345
Yes!

791
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,723
- Floor.
Floor.

792
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,642
What about you, friend?

793
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,148
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly,

794
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:53,069
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together

795
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,656
into the forever
and beautiful sky.

796
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:59,534
Lylla, and Teefs,

797
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,787
and Floor, and me...

798
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,415
Rocket.

799
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,252
Rocket.

800
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,755
It really is good
to have friends.

801
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:14,757
Yeah.

802
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,639
<i>Start the incision here.</i>

803
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,768
<i>Keep calm.</i>

804
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,732
<i>- Hold it still.
I can't!</i>

805
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,443
<i>- It won't stop moving.</i>

806
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,821
Why did he never tell us
about any of this?

807
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,699
This is worse
than what Thanos did to me.

808
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,703
Well, what about
the passkey? Is it there?

809
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,418
No. But a file
was removed today.

810
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,502
Downloaded and deleted,

811
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,004
a million characters
in length.

812
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:57,633
The biometrics say it was
this man. Recorder B2H6.

813
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,135
I saw this guy
outside of records today.

814
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,428
Hmm.

815
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,931
Looks like one of the
High Evolutionary's recorders.

816
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,933
The High Evolutionary?

817
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,269
The founder of OrgoCorp?

818
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:10,271
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments

819
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,273
that lie outside
intergalactic laws.

820
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,400
He's created whole societies.

821
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,986
Xeronians, the Ani-Men,

822
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,488
- the Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

823
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,615
Corners of the universe
consider him God.

824
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,618
I am Groot.

825
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,702
Yes.

826
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,037
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

827
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,039
He said maybe this man
downloaded the passkey

828
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,457
into the computer on his head.

829
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,541
Huh?

830
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,211
That could
store the passkey.

831
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,046
We find him, we save Rocket.

832
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:37,757
The High Evolutionary's
coordinates.

833
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,551
Put the coordinates
in the nav.

834
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,719
Wait a minute.

835
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,930
Are you kidding me?

836
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:47,350
What he wants is that gutted
badger in the Med-Bay,

837
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,268
and you're gonna bring it
straight to him?

838
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,062
It's almost certainly a trap.

839
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,106
Trap isn't a trap
if you know the trap

840
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:54,690
is trying to trap you.
It's a face-off.

841
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,151
A face-off is a trap
if you're facing off

842
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:00,113
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

843
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:03,157
Do you know
who the High Evolutionary is?

844
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:06,536
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

845
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,496
- Second best.
- The High Evolutionary

846
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,623
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

847
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,625
We won't think about it
when we do it.

848
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,627
You know what? I don't care!

849
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,920
Just drop me off
with the Ravagers,

850
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,964
and you go do whatever it is
that you wanna do.

851
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,257
We don't have time for this.

852
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,968
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now!

853
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,929
"Your people"? The Ravagers
aren't your people.

854
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,931
I'm a damn Ravager.
You aren't.

855
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,060
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

856
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:32,728
But my Gamora,
the one I loved,

857
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,230
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals,

858
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,523
she found it with us.

859
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,775
People who care about you.

860
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,236
I know
that's who you still are.

861
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,280
Somewhere inside of you...

862
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:48,119
What are you so afraid of
in your self

863
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,413
that I need to be
something for you?

864
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,624
I don't give a shit
about your Gamora.

865
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,126
Life made me me!

866
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:58,796
I have a few upgrades

867
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,756
courtesy of that gutted badger
in the Med-Bay,

868
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,175
and we are not
risking his life

869
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,676
to make yours more convenient.

870
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:04,969
I'm family.

871
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,554
- So is he.

872
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,268
Screw you.

873
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,564
Screw all of you.

874
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,703
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

875
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,913
pirating supply ships.

876
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,082
I do appreciate this,
good sir.

877
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,251
And I appreciate
your generous contribution

878
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:39,337
to the Orgosentry
retirement fund.

879
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,671
Your associate,

880
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,967
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

881
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,260
You ain't getting
nothing from me.

882
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,846
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

883
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:51,098
Adam.

884
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,601
Adam.

885
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,769
Yes, Mother?

886
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,145
Show him we mean business.

887
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,044
I said show him
we mean business,

888
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,254
not disintegrate him!

889
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,880
What more business
could we have shown him?

890
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,507
But now he's of no use to us!

891
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,716
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

892
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,510
Friend?
You think that's a friend?

893
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,719
It's an animal!

894
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,515
He looks sad.

895
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,101
I really don't enjoy

896
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,227
how that's
making me feel, actually.

897
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,523
- Your friend's a moron.

898
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,358
I got one of those too.
I get it.

899
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,528
<i>Outpost?
This is Gamora, you there?</i>

900
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:49,407
<i>Fitz-Gibbonok.</i>

901
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,491
Come in.

902
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,331
<i>Outpost, come in.</i>

903
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,959
Yes,  Gamora.

904
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,003
Salutations.

905
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,421
<i>May I help?</i>

906
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,965
Well, I need you guys
to come pick me up.

907
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,466
<i>I'm gonna upload
the location-link</i>

908
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,843
<i>to the craft I'm on.</i>

909
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,429
Oh, I think
we can arrange that.

910
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:34,577
<i>Do you realize</i>

911
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:42,627
<i>That you have the most</i>

912
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:46,964
<i>Beautiful face?</i>

913
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:51,344
<i>Do you realize</i>

914
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:01,687
<i>We're floating in space?</i>

915
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:06,275
<i>Do you realize</i>

916
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:11,280
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

917
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,157
Why don't you just say it?

918
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,493
No one ever listens to me.

919
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:21,040
<i>Do you realize</i>

920
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,046
<i>That everyone...</i>

921
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:31,550
Quill,

922
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:33,886
life is a pond,

923
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,430
and you've spent
your entire life

924
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,140
leaping from woman to woman

925
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,518
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

926
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,521
Perhaps, what you need
to do, Quill,

927
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,524
is learn to swim.

928
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,571
- That actually made sense.
- Yes, it made sense.

929
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,865
No, I mean,
that's sort of an analogy.

930
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:56,826
And I didn't know
that you were capable

931
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,828
of that type of thought.

932
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:00,538
I know
lots of analogies, Quill.

933
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,207
Analogies, metaphors,
et cetera.

934
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:05,459
For instance,

935
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:10,256
Gamora's head is like a
lily pad because it is green.

936
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,925
Analogy.

937
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,094
And also stupid-looking

938
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,512
- and flappy.
- Flappy?

939
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,056
Because her skin
is made of a leaf.

940
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,641
Metaphor.

941
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,059
Is it?

942
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:25,312
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

943
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:29,275
Even my butt is capable
of making an analogy.

944
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,238
Oh.

945
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,411
What's happening?

946
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,830
The fluid
is in his lungs.

947
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,791
P1 3?

948
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,210
P1 3.

949
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,088
Sire.

950
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,466
P1 3!

951
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,259
My lord,
might I suggest that we...

952
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:57,678
Must...

953
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,346
Ooh. Ooh.

954
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,931
Sire was in
the middle of his treatments

955
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,517
when we had a breakthrough
with Batch 92.

956
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,394
Perhaps then we should
resume tomorrow, yes?

957
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,480
"We shall
resume tomorrow," no!

958
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:08,898
P1 3!

959
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,441
Oh. Ooh.

960
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,194
There you are.

961
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,246
Hello.

962
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,342
How did you know

963
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,429
about the microseminoproteins,
P1 3?

964
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,205
What happened in there?

965
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,123
Why?

966
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,460
How did you know, P1 3?

967
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:13,546
Uh, it was
too little filtration...

968
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:16,257
In the hypotonic, yes,
we know, we fixed that.

969
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,967
But how did you know?

970
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,011
I made you!

971
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,347
How did you know?

972
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,644
Because it worked.

973
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,069
It... It worked.

974
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,907
Their rage is gone.

975
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,536
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought,

976
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,289
ready to inhabit
the new world.

977
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,877
We're going to the new world?

978
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,712
Oh.

979
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:56,463
We?

980
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:00,259
Look at you.

981
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,802
As if you were

982
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:04,597
cobbled together
by fat-fingered children.

983
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,600
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

984
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:11,812
You're simply a medley of
mistakes we could learn from

985
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:14,607
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

986
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:21,155
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P1 3.

987
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,116
You could figure out
the complex workings

988
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,702
of cytoplasmic
filtration systems,

989
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,746
but you couldn't
figure out that?

990
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,293
But that brain.

991
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,671
That, I'd like
to study further.

992
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,512
Prep it for surgery
and removal in the morning.

993
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,474
What about the rest
of Batch 89, sire?

994
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,646
Incinerate them.

995
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,073
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

996
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,283
- We don't have long.

997
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,078
<i>We've arrived.</i>

998
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,046
<i>We care a lot</i>

999
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,719
That looks just like...

1000
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:27,972
home.

1001
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:36,313
<i>We care a lot</i>

1002
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:39,858
<i>About disasters, fires
Floods and killer bees</i>

1003
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,403
It's like
a replica of Earth.

1004
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:43,862
It makes no sense.

1005
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:46,991
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

1006
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,284
<i>We care a lot</i>

1007
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:53,539
<i>About disease, baby, rock
Hudson, rock, yeah!</i>

1008
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:04,341
<i>Oh, it's a dirty job
But someone's gotta do it</i>

1009
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:12,599
<i>Oh, it's a dirty job
But someone's gotta do it</i>

1010
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,143
<i>We care a lot</i>

1011
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,484
<i>We care a lot</i>

1012
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,201
<i>We care a lot</i>

1013
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:34,496
<i>About the gamblers
And the pushers and the geeks</i>

1014
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,622
<i>We care a lot</i>

1015
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:39,043
<i>About the smack and crack
And whack that hits the streets</i>

1016
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:40,711
Hello.

1017
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,172
We mean you no harm.

1018
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:55,642
Listen to me,
he was just trying

1019
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:56,977
to throw her back her ball.

1020
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59,021
- Ow!

1021
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,690
- Hey!
Ow, ow.

1022
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:03,859
- Come on! There's no reason...

1023
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,403
- Hey, hey.

1024
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,322
Groot, full Kaiju!

1025
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,824
Not full Kaiju!
- I am

1026
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,284
- Groot!
Back up.

1027
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,744
No, not Kaiju!

1028
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:15,162
Groot, down!

1029
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,789
There's no reason
to be afraid.

1030
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,834
Get down, Groot!

1031
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:22,961
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

1032
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,171
Hey. Hey, hi.

1033
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,839
We're not here to harm you.

1034
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,841
Okay.

1035
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:29,802
See? Here.

1036
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,179
For your knee.

1037
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,183
We just need
to save our friend.

1038
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,190
Filthy.
It doesn't belong here.

1039
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,069
I will train it in the ways
of the Sovereign.

1040
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,448
I will train him
not to do that.

1041
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:53,826
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

1042
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,286
Kill it. Now.

1043
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,288
I am the Warlock, Mum,

1044
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,833
and I am done
with being ordered around.

1045
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:03,377
Gamora is here.

1046
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,256
Which means
the squirrel is also.

1047
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:08,340
To save ourselves,

1048
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,675
we must bring it
to the High Evolutionary

1049
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,718
before his own people do.

1050
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,119
Yeah, yeah, sit.

1051
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,871
Let's sit. Okay.

1052
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:49,798
I am Groot.

1053
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,758
It's not rude.
It's what it's here for.

1054
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:53,260
Drax, sit up!

1055
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,344
Idiot.

1056
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:57,472
- Thank you.

1057
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,020
Thank you.

1058
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,565
Our friend...

1059
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:09,234
He's dying.

1060
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:10,652
Uh...

1061
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:18,327
We love our friend.

1062
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,246
But he is dying.

1063
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,501
That's not dying,
that's already dead.

1064
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:28,045
They'll think
he's already dead.

1065
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,130
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

1066
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:31,965
Drax, sit up.

1067
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:33,133
That's what it's here for!

1068
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:34,384
Drax, it isn't.

1069
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,094
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder

1070
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,179
right next to each other.

1071
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,263
Get your boots
off her pillows.

1072
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:39,473
I find it hard to believe

1073
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,724
it doesn't have
multiple purposes!

1074
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,560
I'm sorry.
My friend is a dumb-ass.

1075
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:46,313
That's the same as your dying.

1076
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,106
Why do you
criticize everything?

1077
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,524
Well, why is it oblong then?

1078
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:50,984
It was
a totally different sound.

1079
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,403
No, it wasn't.  Dying.
Dumbass.

1080
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,322
- See? It's the same.
- All right, guys!

1081
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,991
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

1082
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,534
Drax, I see you!

1083
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,579
I understand that none of this

1084
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,249
makes any sense
to you right now.

1085
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,918
We need your help

1086
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,671
in finding a man.

1087
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,965
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna draw.

1088
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:15,259
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

1089
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,679
Like this.

1090
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,889
You see the thing on her head?

1091
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,518
- He has a thing like this.
- That is delightful. Mm.

1092
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,061
There you go.

1093
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:29,314
Have you seen this man?

1094
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:32,567
That's very good.

1095
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:34,778
Can I have that later to hang
in my apartment, please?

1096
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,613
Yeah. Thank you.

1097
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:38,156
<i>Mowtio.</i>

1098
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,992
<i>His name...
His name is "Mowtio"?</i>

1099
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:41,535
<i>Eo, eo. Uh...</i>

1100
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,507
<i>Mowtios-ek lolo.</i>

1101
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,637
<i>- Many mowtios.
- Oh.</i>

1102
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:01,888
- There?
- Oh.

1103
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:03,432
- At the pyramid.
- Oh.

1104
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:08,812
Is that your car
in the driveway?

1105
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:11,690
<i>Oh.
- Eo.</i>

1106
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,778
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

1107
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,155
Watch him.
That's who they're coming for.

1108
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,489
- I wanna come.
- No.

1109
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,616
Mantis, watch Drax.

1110
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,869
Groot, you know
what to do with these.

1111
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,378
- Push down on it.
- What?

1112
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,589
- Push it down.
- I am pushing down on it.

1113
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,049
Push the button.

1114
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,092
It looks like
you're pushing the keyhole.

1115
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,427
The what?
- There's a button

1116
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,971
under the handle,
press that in.

1117
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,016
Okay. Now what?

1118
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,559
Open the fucking door.

1119
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:51,730
That is
a stupid design,

1120
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:54,649
and your instructions
were very unclear.

1121
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,527
Let's get that passkey
and save our friend.

1122
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:05,577
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

1123
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,661
Why would I know any more

1124
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,038
about driving one of
these things than you do?

1125
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,873
- Don't see you volunteering.
- You want me to drive?

1126
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:10,957
- No.
- I'll drive.

1127
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,751
I don't want you to drive.
I got this.

1128
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,534
<i>Just a wild goose chase</i>

1129
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:49,830
<i>And my dreams
Have all been denied</i>

1130
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,584
<i>Why have I always
Been a failure</i>

1131
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,754
<i>What can the reason be</i>

1132
01:10:57,838 --> 01:11:00,173
You must be a really loyal pet

1133
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,760
if they're willing to do
all this for you.

1134
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:21,403
<i>Chasing rainbows</i>

1135
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:27,159
<i>Watching clouds drifting by</i>

1136
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:37,085
<i>My schemes are just like
All my dreams</i>

1137
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:45,510
<i>Ending in the sky</i>

1138
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:50,891
<i>Some fellows look
And find the sunshine</i>

1139
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:54,853
<i>I always look
And find the rain</i>

1140
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,024
<i>And some fellows
Make a winning sometime</i>

1141
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:10,327
<i>I'm always chasing rainbows</i>

1142
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,873
This is the perfect society?

1143
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:36,603
Sire.

1144
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,897
This one has been running
for two hours

1145
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,482
without breaking a sweat.

1146
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,275
- It's incredible...
- They can survive

1147
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,652
on 30 calories a day,

1148
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,655
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy,

1149
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,823
and they can rewire
a carbenetrix core

1150
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,825
in under two minutes.

1151
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,912
But will she be ready
for the new colony?

1152
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:56,498
Sire, they're here.

1153
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,256
Here we go.

1154
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,390
We're here to see...

1155
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,059
The High Evolutionary
is expecting you.

1156
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,310
Which means it is a trap.

1157
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:18,520
It's a face-off.

1158
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,105
She stays here.

1159
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:22,190
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry,

1160
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:23,692
and your arm is a gun.

1161
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,490
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

1162
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,117
Hey.

1163
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,703
It'll be okay.

1164
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,933
Move it!

1165
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:17,537
Are you okay, Rocket?

1166
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:37,182
Me Rocket play now?

1167
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:38,308
I can't right now, Floor.

1168
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:47,108
What are you doing?

1169
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,818
They ain't gonna set us free.

1170
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:50,904
Yes, they are, Rocket.

1171
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,947
We're going to the new world
any day now.

1172
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:57,911
No, that can't be true.

1173
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:58,995
It is.

1174
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:01,581
They wanna kill us all
in the morning.

1175
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:03,208
- What?
What?

1176
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:05,377
But I'm gonna fix it.

1177
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:12,425
What is that?

1178
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:13,927
It's a key.

1179
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,805
I'm gonna use it
to get us all out of here.

1180
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,891
I don't know
if that's wise, Rocket.

1181
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:22,227
- Mm.
Me Rocket leave!

1182
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,688
Hooray time forever!

1183
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:28,358
Just down that hall,
there are ships.

1184
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,653
I know.
And if we can get to one,

1185
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,113
I can pilot it.

1186
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,825
And then we'll all fly away
together, the four of us,

1187
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,244
just like
we always said, okay?

1188
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,081
Okay?

1189
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:51,131
Whoo-hoo! Yippee!
Rocket! Sky, sky, sky!

1190
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,864
- You did it!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1191
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:16,990
You did it!

1192
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,867
You did it, you did it,
you did it!

1193
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,097
You did it!

1194
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,391
- You did it.

1195
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:46,519
It really is good to have...

1196
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:06,790
Yes, I imagined
you'd do something like this.

1197
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,459
Back in the cage, P1 3.

1198
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,008
Sky.

1199
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,816
Rocket, Teefs,
Floor go now.

1200
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,567
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1201
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:36,528
Q1 2 and P1 3

1202
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,279
- escaped from their pens.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1203
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,490
- Q1 2 is neutralized...
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1204
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,617
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- ...but P1 3 is still out,

1205
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,744
- so I'll need assistance.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1206
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,831
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1207
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:49,958
Remember not to bruise
its brain.

1208
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:52,210
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1209
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,670
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1210
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,300
All right, P1 3!

1211
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:02,303
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1212
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:08,059
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, let's go!

1213
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,144
Let's go! Rocket, please!

1214
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:12,730
Rocket! Rocket!

1215
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:16,734
Down here. Hurry.

1216
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:16,002
Hey, there it is!
Get him!

1217
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,754
Get back here!
Get it!

1218
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:19,005
He's getting away!

1219
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:04,592
What are you doing?

1220
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:06,177
I got a bad feeling
about this.

1221
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,137
Peter just told you
to stay here.

1222
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,347
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1223
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,890
He should know by now
that I never do

1224
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:12,684
anything that anyone
ever tells me.

1225
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,519
We need to protect Rocket.

1226
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:16,145
Yeah, that's right.

1227
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,524
So, hop on and we'll ride
back to the ship.

1228
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,275
Just right over there?

1229
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:22,902
Yeah.

1230
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,416
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1231
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,551
You!

1232
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,344
Hey, yeah, you!

1233
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:51,055
I take it the passkey,

1234
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:52,223
it's in that thing
on your head.

1235
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,851
I would advise
against aggression.

1236
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,562
Oh. Got time for me now?

1237
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,232
Your friend
once took advantage.

1238
01:21:01,816 --> 01:21:03,151
I learn my lessons.

1239
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:07,321
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity

1240
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,198
back in my own direction,

1241
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:12,368
and now, gravity itself
serves my whims.

1242
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,954
- War Pig.

1243
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:16,164
<i>Now.</i>

1244
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,836
You must find
Counter-Earth familiar.

1245
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,004
Counter-Earth?

1246
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:25,214
I visited your planet
many years ago.

1247
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,050
Earth hasn't been my planet
in a long time.

1248
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,259
Your people had

1249
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,970
- wonderful spirit.
- Mm.

1250
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:32,847
The art and music
and literature

1251
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,183
were some of the finest
in the universe.

1252
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,269
Earth would be
a fabulous place,

1253
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,688
were it not for
the ignorance and bigotry.

1254
01:21:40,772 --> 01:21:42,857
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create

1255
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,525
- Counter-Earth.
- I don't care.

1256
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,194
All of the good
and none of the bad.

1257
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:49,322
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob

1258
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:50,740
whose mother didn't love him

1259
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,326
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1260
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,245
I'm not trying
to conquer the universe.

1261
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:57,997
I'm perfecting it.

1262
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:05,505
What the...

1263
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:25,858
Hey!

1264
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,819
Drop the badger.

1265
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,993
- I just want the passkey.
- Then bring me 89P13.

1266
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:37,453
I am Groot.

1267
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:39,956
He says, "Suck my..."

1268
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:41,249
Why are you so angry?

1269
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,209
Because I know
what you did to our friend.

1270
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:44,961
Anything I've done,

1271
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:47,130
I've done for the betterment
of the universe.

1272
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,631
Newsflash, Einstein.

1273
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,133
Better universes
generally don't include

1274
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:51,801
a bunch of octopuses
selling meth

1275
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,636
to guys with cockroach heads.

1276
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,013
They do not.

1277
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,475
Which is why,

1278
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:01,853
as I have done
many times before,

1279
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,147
I'm going to have
to raze it all

1280
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:05,940
and start again.

1281
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,150
What?

1282
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,577
I got 89P13,

1283
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,245
<i>and I'm on my way.</i>

1284
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,663
We're in possession
of the subject.

1285
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:34,427
- Ow!

1286
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,649
Oh, my God.

1287
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:00,453
I am Groot?

1288
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:01,621
Kill 'em all.

1289
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,542
- Stay.

1290
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,128
Uh-uh. I said "stay."

1291
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:11,881
What, did you want me
to leave you back,

1292
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,341
so that Mother
could fillet you?

1293
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:15,509
Stay.

1294
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:16,594
What the hell?

1295
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,930
We're working
for the same boss.

1296
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:21,098
Yes, but I need
the credit, chum,

1297
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:23,184
to save
my entire civilization.

1298
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:27,313
So be a good creepy... thing

1299
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,981
- and back off.

1300
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:38,908
No.

1301
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:20,616
Mother.

1302
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:46,517
Mother!

1303
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:52,940
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1304
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,109
Mantis? Drax?

1305
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,861
<i>Uh, hey.</i>

1306
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,196
I need you to bring
the ship here now!

1307
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,866
<i>Well, we can't
do that exactly because...</i>

1308
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:03,659
<i>we're not at the ship.</i>

1309
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:04,910
Then where the hell are...

1310
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:34,648
Nebula, come in.

1311
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,692
Gamora! Take off now!

1312
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:38,944
Get yourself and Rocket
off the planet.

1313
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,659
What kinda ship is this?

1314
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:50,581
It's amusing, really.

1315
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,124
How stupid are you, hmm?

1316
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,918
It was so obviously a trap.

1317
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,962
It's not a trap.
It's a face-off.

1318
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,215
Now kill them all.

1319
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:01,675
What do you have in your hand?

1320
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,014
Grenade!

1321
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:48,431
I am Groot!

1322
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,547
No! Don't!

1323
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:25,009
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1324
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:26,927
Please, spare me, please.

1325
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:33,392
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1326
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,519
- That'd be premature.
- Huh?

1327
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:37,438
- No, no, no...

1328
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,201
Quite a novel escape plan,

1329
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:52,745
jumping headfirst
into an exploding planet.

1330
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,502
You'll kill us both!

1331
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,045
Not both.

1332
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:18,270
Why are we doing this?

1333
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:19,522
Quill and Groot are inside.

1334
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:21,315
- We have to get them out.

1335
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,220
Groot.

1336
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:09,488
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1337
01:30:09,572 --> 01:30:11,407
The steering
mechanism is stuck.

1338
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,117
Well, pull harder!

1339
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:20,040
- Let's go. Come on.

1340
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,062
- It's hard to breathe.

1341
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,905
We are entering space.

1342
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:17,973
<i>Joob joob?</i>

1343
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:19,642
Oh, piss off.

1344
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:31,487
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1345
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,156
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I don't know!

1346
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:39,620
- Gimme.
- Here.

1347
01:31:41,372 --> 01:31:43,040
Ha! You're lucky I was able

1348
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,583
- to knock down that door...
- Rocket and Gamora

1349
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,502
are probably dead
because of you!

1350
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:48,462
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1351
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,422
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse

1352
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:53,258
of being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing,

1353
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:55,469
and the rest of us having
to carry your slack!

1354
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:56,887
Don't push him!

1355
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,263
You don't have the right
to push him.

1356
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,140
And you! You're no better.

1357
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:02,017
The only thing
we can count on you for

1358
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:03,435
is when someone
shows weakness,

1359
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:04,978
you'll be right there
to support it.

1360
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:06,480
Fine, I don't care.

1361
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,774
I know you need to find fault
in everyone else

1362
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,442
to make yourself feel okay,

1363
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:13,070
- so find it in me.
- Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1364
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,947
But you don't have the right
to push him!

1365
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:17,616
It's not his fault
he's stupid.

1366
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,785
- He's a liability.
- He makes us laugh

1367
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,746
and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1368
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,624
All you care about
is intelligence and...

1369
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:27,000
and competence.

1370
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:29,128
Not sure I appreciate
this defense.

1371
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:30,546
He has sadness,

1372
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:33,465
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1373
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:35,843
So I don't care
if he's stupid.

1374
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,095
You think I'm stupid?

1375
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:40,472
Yes.

1376
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,060
Forget.

1377
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,857
Ha! You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door

1378
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,442
with my incredible strength.

1379
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:53,694
Quill?

1380
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,696
- Quill? Quill, are you there?

1381
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,574
<i>Joob joob...</i>

1382
01:32:59,867 --> 01:33:02,244
That language
isn't in my translator.

1383
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,048
Okay. Here we go.

1384
01:33:36,487 --> 01:33:37,905
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1385
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:39,740
Go.

1386
01:33:57,174 --> 01:33:59,593
Lylla?

1387
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:02,387
Friend.

1388
01:34:05,432 --> 01:34:07,059
Okay, okay.

1389
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:08,143
Okay, here we go.

1390
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:12,981
This isn't right.

1391
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:16,318
No, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1392
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,611
It needs to be faster.

1393
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:23,158
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1394
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,161
Rocket.

1395
01:34:26,245 --> 01:34:27,579
I let you down.

1396
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:29,915
I got you killed.

1397
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,084
I got everybody killed.

1398
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,961
We were right.

1399
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:38,257
The sky is beautiful,
and it is forever.

1400
01:34:38,841 --> 01:34:41,677
And I've been flying
with our friends.

1401
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,358
Can I come?

1402
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,110
Yes.

1403
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:08,704
No, no, no!

1404
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,163
No!

1405
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:11,373
Come on.

1406
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:13,625
- Come on!
- Quill.

1407
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:18,046
No!

1408
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:20,424
No!

1409
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,677
Quill.
- No!

1410
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,054
Quill.
I'm not gonna lose him.

1411
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:27,264
He's gone.

1412
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,017
I'm not letting him go!

1413
01:35:32,436 --> 01:35:33,437
Come on.

1414
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:47,534
But not yet.

1415
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,454
You still have a purpose here.

1416
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:52,998
A purpose for what?

1417
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,042
They made us for nothing.

1418
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:57,711
Stupid experiments
to be thrown away.

1419
01:35:58,879 --> 01:36:00,923
There are the hands
that made us,

1420
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:03,967
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1421
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:10,432
Mm.

1422
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:13,352
My beloved raccoon.

1423
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:16,480
This story
has been yours all along,

1424
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:17,898
you just didn't know it.

1425
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:24,071
- I'm not a raccoon.

1426
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:32,204
The passkey's
going through!

1427
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:50,806
Quill?

1428
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,576
Where's Nebula?

1429
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:19,042
Sh... She's, uh...

1430
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,254
Because her code
is on the comm behind you.

1431
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,052
What? Nebula?

1432
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:31,054
- Where are you?
- Oh, thank God!

1433
01:37:31,138 --> 01:37:32,472
We're here
to get you out of here.

1434
01:37:32,556 --> 01:37:34,141
<i>- Out of where?
The High Evolutionary's ship.</i>

1435
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:35,767
No, I got off the ship.

1436
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:37,227
<i>- You what?
Wait, where are you?</i>

1437
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,395
On the ship!

1438
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,896
<i>- On the ship?
I didn't lie.</i>

1439
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,314
Why are you on the ship?

1440
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:42,649
To save you, obviously.

1441
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:43,859
<i>No, I told you to go back.</i>

1442
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:45,527
You gotta know by now
I always figure out

1443
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:47,446
an incredibly clever way
to get out of a fix.

1444
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,322
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1445
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:51,074
Tell him we're coming
to save him.

1446
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:52,909
Pay attention
or play with the kids.

1447
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:54,202
<i>One or the other.</i>

1448
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:55,370
"Play with the kids"?

1449
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,914
- How did you get out?
- That's not really important.

1450
01:37:57,998 --> 01:37:59,332
I am Groot.

1451
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,877
Jumping a thousand feet to
your death without a parachute

1452
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,003
is a clever way

1453
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,921
<i>- of getting out of a fix?</i>

1454
01:38:05,005 --> 01:38:07,007
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1455
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:08,508
The important thing is

1456
01:38:08,592 --> 01:38:10,135
<i>we're all okay.</i>

1457
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:14,389
Rocket?

1458
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:16,975
Yeah, he's here.

1459
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:18,143
And he's okay.

1460
01:38:24,441 --> 01:38:28,528
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1461
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:30,614
Well, that makes you
the idiots then.

1462
01:38:30,697 --> 01:38:31,907
<i>He's right about that.</i>

1463
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,494
- Back in your cages!

1464
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:40,874
Nebula?

1465
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,502
Nebula, come in!

1466
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:51,927
So, you'd like to joust,
would you?

1467
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:56,515
Go to hell,
you sick son of a bitch.

1468
01:38:56,598 --> 01:38:58,141
<i>You killed
all of those people.</i>

1469
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:00,060
As I will your friends.

1470
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:02,771
<i>I'm sending you
the coordinates.</i>

1471
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,440
They will die
unless you bring me

1472
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:06,608
<i>what is mine!</i>

1473
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,695
Screw you, you stretch-faced,
Robo Cop-looking,

1474
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:12,239
Skeletor wannabe,

1475
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:14,324
purple-nurple piece of...

1476
01:39:17,494 --> 01:39:18,578
He hung up.

1477
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:22,499
You think?

1478
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:27,420
1966.

1479
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:30,090
The Soviet put me on a rocket,

1480
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:33,260
knowing full well I'm never
to return and I will die

1481
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:35,178
in a fiery ball of death.

1482
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:38,431
But one thing
even mudak Soviets never do

1483
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,767
is call me bad dog.

1484
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:43,270
Oh, my God!
Could you just let it go?

1485
01:39:43,353 --> 01:39:45,981
Kraglin, please,
just take it back.

1486
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:47,399
This is killing us.

1487
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,318
I can't take it back
if she is, in fact,

1488
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:52,445
- a bad dog.

1489
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:53,530
Kraglin!

1490
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:55,699
Oh,
it never stops hurting.

1491
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:56,992
<i>Kraglin.</i>

1492
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:58,827
Oh, hey, Pete.

1493
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,662
We need to save
Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,

1494
01:40:00,996 --> 01:40:02,622
and we need your help.

1495
01:40:02,706 --> 01:40:03,832
Me?

1496
01:40:07,294 --> 01:40:09,171
You're the one who lost it,
you twit.

1497
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:11,381
The Hellspawn had it,
sire, but...

1498
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:13,842
But, but, but! But!

1499
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,512
That rancid word.

1500
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,851
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser

1501
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,394
to go directly
to the new colony

1502
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,438
and not engage
in unnecessary conflict.

1503
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:30,317
They can rewire a carbenetrix
core in under two minutes,

1504
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,693
but what is that, Vim?

1505
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:33,612
Rote memorization.

1506
01:40:33,695 --> 01:40:35,447
Rote memorization!

1507
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:38,325
In hundreds of years
of our creations,

1508
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:41,578
only one has known
true invention.

1509
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:42,662
One.

1510
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:49,377
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1511
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,298
Yes, sire.

1512
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:58,553
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought

1513
01:40:58,637 --> 01:41:00,263
will die on the vine.

1514
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:03,725
We need 89P13's brain,

1515
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,312
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures

1516
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:09,397
before we go
to the new colony.

1517
01:41:09,481 --> 01:41:11,524
Nothing else matters.

1518
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,046
How did
they get down here?

1519
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,339
<i>Joob joob.</i>

1520
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:38,260
Peter will be trying
to get to the spaceport.

1521
01:41:38,885 --> 01:41:40,387
He doesn't know
about the children.

1522
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,180
- You!

1523
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,725
We need you to let all the
other children on board know

1524
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:47,435
to stay away
from the starboard walls.

1525
01:41:49,062 --> 01:41:50,272
<i>Joob joob?</i>

1526
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:51,439
They know three frickin' words

1527
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:52,941
<i>and two of them are "joob."</i>

1528
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:56,152
<i>- Joob joob.
- No! Listen to me!</i>

1529
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,239
You need to talk
to the other children,

1530
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:01,992
all of them here,
and tell them

1531
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:04,077
to stay away
from the freaking...

1532
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,787
What the hell
are you doing, Mantis?

1533
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,456
Explaining it, dickhead!

1534
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:14,546
<i>Joob joob eo!</i>

1535
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,174
<i>Joob joob eo!</i>

1536
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:20,885
You're scaring them.

1537
01:42:26,933 --> 01:42:28,310
Hello, dumb idiots.

1538
01:42:32,856 --> 01:42:34,190
I had a little girl like you.

1539
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,609
You know what
she used to like?

1540
01:42:37,027 --> 01:42:39,029
She liked when
I made monkey noises.

1541
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,700
Beep.

1542
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:45,327
Beep, beep. Beep.

1543
01:42:49,706 --> 01:42:51,041
How is that a monkey?

1544
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:53,209
Beats me.

1545
01:43:03,136 --> 01:43:04,679
- Boop.

1546
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,850
- Boop.

1547
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:11,144
- Boop.

1548
01:43:26,785 --> 01:43:28,161
<i>Eo, eo. Joob joob.</i>

1549
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,537
<i>- Joob joob.
Yeah.</i>

1550
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:31,039
<i>Joob joob.</i>

1551
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,165
<i>Yeah. Joob joob.</i>

1552
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:34,667
<i>Joob joob.</i>

1553
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:35,835
They're gonna tell
the other kids

1554
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:37,128
to stay away
from the starboard wall.

1555
01:43:37,212 --> 01:43:38,213
Why didn't you tell us

1556
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:40,090
you knew their language
this whole time?

1557
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:41,925
Why didn't you ask?

1558
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:47,931
This could be futile,
Quill. He's too powerful.

1559
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:49,849
Well, then I guess
we'll die trying.

1560
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:52,519
What is "dying trying"
gonna accomplish?

1561
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:54,187
Or we can just give him
the badger?

1562
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,773
Our thing is dying trying.

1563
01:43:56,856 --> 01:43:57,941
I am Groot.

1564
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,734
I know who you are already!

1565
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:02,529
Feel free to stay behind
in the cargo area.

1566
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:05,573
I'm not leaving my sister
with that jackass.

1567
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:06,950
This you?

1568
01:44:07,033 --> 01:44:08,660
Fell out of your bag.

1569
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:11,996
Let's do this.

1570
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:40,775
<i>Well, you didn't wake up
This morning</i>

1571
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:42,485
<i>'Cause you didn't go to bed</i>

1572
01:44:42,569 --> 01:44:45,780
<i>You were watching the whites
Of your eyes turn red</i>

1573
01:44:46,406 --> 01:44:48,867
<i>The calendar on your wall</i>

1574
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:50,285
Wait.

1575
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:53,079
Wait.

1576
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:55,915
<i>Reading some old letters</i>

1577
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:57,000
<i>You smile...</i>

1578
01:44:57,876 --> 01:45:01,421
You almost
have to admire their pluck.

1579
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:03,548
- Sire.

1580
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:12,599
<i>Across the clear blue sky</i>

1581
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:16,519
Howdy there,
you freakin' creep.

1582
01:45:16,603 --> 01:45:19,564
<i>Your life will surely change</i>

1583
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:22,901
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1584
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:25,069
<i>When things fall into place</i>

1585
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:26,696
You're on, Steemie.

1586
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,490
First barrel.

1587
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:30,533
<i>This is the day
Your life will surely change</i>

1588
01:45:30,617 --> 01:45:31,826
Second barrel.

1589
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,245
Third barrel.

1590
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:35,455
Fourth barrel.

1591
01:45:36,581 --> 01:45:38,500
<i>When things fall into place</i>

1592
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:44,005
<i>This is the day</i>

1593
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:45,715
Hard starboard.

1594
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:46,841
Hard starboard.

1595
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:50,053
<i>This is the day</i>

1596
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:52,931
<i>Your life will surely change</i>

1597
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:54,599
And fire!

1598
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:56,059
<i>This is the day</i>

1599
01:46:03,066 --> 01:46:04,359
They've breached
the spaceport.

1600
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:06,945
One of them holds
subject 89P13.

1601
01:46:07,028 --> 01:46:08,696
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1602
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,448
Sire, the Hellspawn
were created

1603
01:46:10,532 --> 01:46:11,658
solely to defend
the new colony

1604
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:13,159
Do it now!

1605
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:14,911
Get me 89P13,

1606
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:18,248
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1607
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,204
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n,

1608
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,914
<i>but that old missile's
all we had.</i>

1609
01:46:59,998 --> 01:47:03,459
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1610
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:18,474
What the hell?

1611
01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:34,949
Aw, come on!

1612
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,939
Kraglin,
we have been infiltrated.

1613
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:10,568
Open the pit.

1614
01:48:10,652 --> 01:48:13,279
Sire, our bargaining power
will be gone.

1615
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:39,472
Abilisks!

1616
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:48,439
Good God!

1617
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:56,072
This way!

1618
01:50:02,013 --> 01:50:04,056
One more step
and this weird thing gets it!

1619
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,767
- Don't be rash.

1620
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,453
What were you programming?

1621
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,829
A self-destruction code.

1622
01:50:44,847 --> 01:50:46,057
What are you doing?

1623
01:50:49,352 --> 01:50:50,436
It's okay.

1624
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,687
Mantis, stop!

1625
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:55,191
They eat batteries,

1626
01:50:55,441 --> 01:50:56,609
not people.

1627
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:01,572
Maybe they're just scared of
what we are gonna do to them.

1628
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,122
We're not gonna hurt you.

1629
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,211
Everything is
going to be okay.

1630
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,184
Use your heart, boy.

1631
01:53:03,319 --> 01:53:04,695
A dog!

1632
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:05,947
Yeah.

1633
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,332
She's a good dog.

1634
01:53:20,753 --> 01:53:22,964
I knew you believe
I am good dog.

1635
01:53:23,047 --> 01:53:24,882
All right, all right,
get off me, you idiot!

1636
01:53:28,803 --> 01:53:31,472
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1637
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,265
The spaceport has intruders.

1638
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:36,310
Go! See if one of them
is 89P13.

1639
01:53:36,394 --> 01:53:38,521
Sire, you have an irrational
obsession with this animal.

1640
01:53:38,604 --> 01:53:40,022
You must stop, for God's sake!

1641
01:53:40,106 --> 01:53:41,816
There is no God!

1642
01:53:42,066 --> 01:53:44,151
That's why I stepped in!

1643
01:54:12,722 --> 01:54:17,143
<i>Controller, I am taking
command of the Arête.</i>

1644
01:54:17,226 --> 01:54:21,647
Disengage all damaged sectors
of the ship,

1645
01:54:22,023 --> 01:54:24,191
- and retreat.

1646
01:54:49,133 --> 01:54:50,217

1650

<i>Get me 89P13,</i>

1651
01:55:05,191 --> 01:55:06,650

<i>No sleep till</i>

1653
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:17,703
We go in there, we get Mantis,

01:55:17,787 --> 01:55:19,288
- Nebula, and Drax.

1655
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,916
We move in, we get 'em,
and we get out.

1656
01:55:33,511 --> 01:55:34,720

1657
01:55:41,727 --> 01:55:43,104
Did that look cool?

1658
01:55:43,813 --> 01:55:45,564
Okay, new game plan.

1659
01:55:45,648 --> 01:55:47,566
We get the hell
out of here now.

1660
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:49,401
There are thousands
of creatures on the ship.

1661
01:55:49,485 --> 01:55:50,694
Many of them are children.

1662

- Huh?
- It means friends.

1664
01:55:55,908 --> 01:55:58,327
If we wanna live,
we have to leave now.

1665
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,205
This whole rig is gonna
go down any second.

1666
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:03,666

02:06:10,397 --> 02:06:12,482
How dare you think
you are more,

1773
02:06:13,525 --> 02:06:17,070
89P13?

1774
02:06:20,574 --> 02:06:21,783
The name's Rocket.

1775
02:06:22,701 --> 02:06:25,078
- Rocket Raccoon.

1776
02:06:45,098 --> 02:06:47,184
Hmm.

1777
02:07:05,243 --> 02:07:06,369
His face came off!

1778
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:07,871
It's a mask.

1779
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:12,125
Look what you did to me.

1780
02:07:12,959 --> 02:07:14,461
For what?

1781
02:07:14,544 --> 02:07:16,630
All I wanted to do

1782
02:07:17,088 --> 02:07:18,757
was to make things

1783
02:07:19,424 --> 02:07:20,509
perfect.

1784
02:07:21,384 --> 02:07:23,595
You didn't wanna
make things perfect.

1785
02:07:23,678 --> 02:07:26,056
You just hated things
the way they are.

1786
02:07:26,473 --> 02:07:27,557
Kill him.

1787
02:07:34,231 --> 02:07:35,232
Why?

1788
02:07:36,024 --> 02:07:38,985
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1789
02:07:40,195 --> 02:07:42,614
We have to get outta here now.

1790
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:43,740
We have to save them.

1791
02:07:43,824 --> 02:07:44,908
We've got all the kids
on board.

1792
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:45,992
No, Pete.

1793
02:07:46,785 --> 02:07:48,411
The rest of them.

1794
02:07:54,209 --> 02:07:56,336
Come on!
Come on. Whoa!

1795
02:07:56,837 --> 02:07:57,921
Move!

1796
02:07:58,004 --> 02:07:59,464
Move it, bird!

1797
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:01,258
- Whoa!
Come on!

1798
02:08:04,803 --> 02:08:05,804
Come on!

1799
02:08:05,887 --> 02:08:07,472
- Come on, come on, come on!

1800
02:08:10,934 --> 02:08:12,143
Thought we were
limiting ourselves

1801
02:08:12,227 --> 02:08:13,228
to the higher life forms?

1802
02:08:13,311 --> 02:08:15,188
Yeah, well, me too.

1803
02:08:15,272 --> 02:08:17,524
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1804
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:24,656
Go, babies.

1805
02:08:24,739 --> 02:08:25,991
Go, babies.

1806
02:08:26,074 --> 02:08:27,617
Go!

1807
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:30,370
I cannot hold much...

1808
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,711
Run!

1809
02:08:37,794 --> 02:08:38,920
Go! Go!

1810
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,601
Quill! Hurry!

1811
02:09:35,685 --> 02:09:38,730
Peter!

1812
02:10:45,255 --> 02:10:46,423
Peter!

1813
02:10:52,429 --> 02:10:53,930
Did that

1814
02:10:54,014 --> 02:10:55,473
look

1815
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,475
cool?

1816
02:11:00,645 --> 02:11:01,646
Come on.

1817
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:16,828
- Cosmo! I'm okay.

1818
02:11:54,699 --> 02:11:56,159
I am Groot.

1819
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:59,204
Thanks. Just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1820
02:12:04,834 --> 02:12:06,211
I am Groot.

1821
02:12:08,088 --> 02:12:10,799
Yeah. It was good
working with you, too.

1822
02:12:18,598 --> 02:12:21,101
Hey, Gamora.
Are you ready?

1823
02:12:21,768 --> 02:12:22,894
Yeah.

1824
02:12:29,109 --> 02:12:30,735
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1825
02:12:32,737 --> 02:12:33,738
I know.

1826
02:12:35,115 --> 02:12:37,242
But who you are ain't so bad.

1827
02:12:57,178 --> 02:12:58,888
I bet we were fun.

1828
02:13:04,144 --> 02:13:05,895
Like you wouldn't believe.

1829
02:13:12,443 --> 02:13:13,486
Okay.

1830
02:13:27,417 --> 02:13:28,835
You okay?

1831
02:13:30,753 --> 02:13:32,922
I think I need to talk
to everybody.

1832
02:13:35,008 --> 02:13:37,218
So, you're gonna leave?

1833
02:13:38,887 --> 02:13:40,889
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old,

1834
02:13:40,972 --> 02:13:43,141
and I have been running
ever since.

1835
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:46,352
I'm gonna need
to take some time...

1836
02:13:48,438 --> 02:13:50,148
and learn how to swim.

1837
02:13:52,775 --> 02:13:53,776
I as well.

1838
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:01,242
I love you all. I do.

1839
02:14:05,413 --> 02:14:08,541
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted,

1840
02:14:09,083 --> 02:14:11,878
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1841
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:15,965
I need to go out
and discover what I want.

1842
02:14:16,049 --> 02:14:18,176
- I'll come with you.
- No, Drax.

1843
02:14:18,259 --> 02:14:19,510
That's the whole point.

1844
02:14:19,594 --> 02:14:21,137
But you need someone
to protect you.

1845
02:14:21,221 --> 02:14:23,306
- I don't.
Not in a bad way.

1846
02:14:23,389 --> 02:14:24,849
Just because of
your incredible weakness.

1847
02:14:24,933 --> 02:14:26,434
Oh, my gosh,
you're so frustrating!

1848
02:14:26,517 --> 02:14:27,644
Drax.

1849
02:14:28,311 --> 02:14:29,479
I need you here.

1850
02:14:30,313 --> 02:14:31,773
We're building a new society.

1851
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:33,900
I need all the support
I can get

1852
02:14:33,983 --> 02:14:35,109
for those children out there.

1853
02:14:36,277 --> 02:14:38,863
Today, I saw who you are.

1854
02:14:40,073 --> 02:14:41,866
You weren't born
to be a destroyer.

1855
02:14:43,826 --> 02:14:45,203
You were born to be a dad.

1856
02:14:49,749 --> 02:14:51,709
So, you'll lead
the Guardians then?

1857
02:14:52,335 --> 02:14:53,336
No.

1858
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:55,421
I'm gonna lead the city,

1859
02:14:56,172 --> 02:14:57,924
make it the type of home
I never had.

1860
02:15:00,677 --> 02:15:01,970
So, that's it?

1861
02:15:03,471 --> 02:15:04,931
The group's over?

1862
02:15:05,473 --> 02:15:06,641
No.

1863
02:15:06,933 --> 02:15:09,102
Well, the Galaxy
still needs its Guardians.

1864
02:15:10,311 --> 02:15:13,064
And you will make a better
leader than I ever was,

1865
02:15:13,898 --> 02:15:14,899
Cap'n.

1866
02:15:35,336 --> 02:15:37,088
I love you, guys.

1867
02:15:45,138 --> 02:15:46,222
For you.

1868
02:16:22,091 --> 02:16:28,431
<i>Like a train on a track</i>

1869
02:16:31,476 --> 02:16:33,936
<i>Coming towards her</i>

1870
02:16:35,063 --> 02:16:41,527
<i>Stuck still, no turning back</i>

1871
02:16:43,404 --> 02:16:49,369
<i>She hid around corners
And she hid underbeds</i>

1872
02:16:49,452 --> 02:16:54,749
<i>She killed it with kisses
And from it she fled</i>

1873
02:16:56,084 --> 02:17:01,506
<i>With every bubble
She sank with a drink</i>

1874
02:17:02,673 --> 02:17:08,388
<i>And washed it away down
The kitchen sink</i>

1875
02:17:09,013 --> 02:17:12,183
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1876
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:14,268
Hmm.

1877
02:17:15,228 --> 02:17:18,064
<i>The horses are coming</i>

1878
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:21,442
<i>So you better run</i>

1879
02:17:21,526 --> 02:17:24,904
<i>Run fast for your mother
Run fast for your father</i>

1880
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:28,282
<i>Run for your children
For your sisters and brothers</i>

1881
02:17:29,784 --> 02:17:31,035
<i>And your longing behind</i>

1882
02:17:31,119 --> 02:17:34,372
<i>You can't carry it with you
If you want to survive</i>

1883
02:17:34,455 --> 02:17:37,583
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1884
02:17:40,711 --> 02:17:42,338
<i>Can you hear the horses</i>

1885
02:17:42,422 --> 02:17:43,423
Yeah!

1886
02:17:43,506 --> 02:17:44,507
Oh, yeah!

1887
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:50,179
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1888
02:17:50,263 --> 02:17:51,639
Welcome home.

1889
02:17:51,722 --> 02:17:53,599
<i>The dog days are done</i>

1890
02:17:53,683 --> 02:17:56,686
<i>The horses are coming</i>

1891
02:17:56,769 --> 02:17:59,730
<i>So you better run</i>

1892
02:17:59,814 --> 02:18:03,109
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1893
02:18:06,446 --> 02:18:09,532
<i>The horses are coming</i>

1894
02:18:22,128 --> 02:18:29,135
<i>And I never wanted</i>

1895
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:33,055
<i>Anything from you</i>

1896
02:18:34,348 --> 02:18:39,854
<i>Except everything...</i>

1897
02:18:39,937 --> 02:18:42,231
I think I might be
at the wrong, uh...

1898
02:18:43,316 --> 02:18:44,817
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1899
02:18:45,026 --> 02:18:46,152
Uh, yes.

1900
02:18:46,611 --> 02:18:47,862
Come in.

1901
02:18:49,071 --> 02:18:52,200
<i>Happiness hit her</i>

1902
02:18:52,283 --> 02:18:53,826
<i>Like a bullet</i>

1903
02:18:53,910 --> 02:19:00,208
<i>In the back</i>

1904
02:19:01,667 --> 02:19:04,712
<i>Struck from a great height</i>

1905
02:19:06,005 --> 02:19:07,006
Pete?

1906
02:19:07,089 --> 02:19:08,883
<i>By someone who should know</i>

1907
02:19:13,471 --> 02:19:14,472
Pete.

1908
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:20,811
- Hi, Grandpa.

1909
02:19:20,895 --> 02:19:23,231
<i>Can you hear the horses?</i>

1910
02:19:23,314 --> 02:19:26,776
<i>'Cause here they come</i>

1911
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:42,708
<i>Run fast for your father</i>

1912
02:19:44,126 --> 02:19:45,586
<i>For your sisters and brothers</i>

1913
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:48,589
<i>Leave all your love
And your longing behind</i>

1914
02:19:48,673 --> 02:19:50,424
Yes! Yes!

1915
02:19:50,508 --> 02:19:52,218
Yeah! Yeah!

1916
02:19:52,301 --> 02:19:55,179
<i>The dog days are over</i>

1917
02:19:55,263 --> 02:19:57,557
- Yeah!

1918
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,183
Yeah!

1919
02:20:31,716 --> 02:20:36,554
<i>How young are you?
How old am I?</i>

1920
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:42,935
<i>Let's count the rings
Around my eye</i>

1921
02:20:48,774 --> 02:20:53,654
<i>How smart are you?
How dumb am I?</i>

1922
02:20:54,947 --> 02:20:59,577
<i>Don't count any of my advice</i>

1923
02:21:00,703 --> 02:21:05,416
<i>Oh, meet me anyplace
Or anywhere or anytime</i>

1924
02:21:05,499 --> 02:21:08,419
<i>Now, I don't care
Meet me tonight</i>

1925
02:21:08,502 --> 02:21:12,465
<i>If you will dare, I might dare</i>

1926
02:21:17,595 --> 02:21:21,390
<i>Call me on Thursday
If you will...</i>

1927
02:21:23,684 --> 02:21:25,519
Okay, how about
your favorite musical act?

1928
02:21:26,145 --> 02:21:27,229
Phyla, you first.

1929
02:21:27,688 --> 02:21:31,776
Um... Britney Spears and Korn.

1930
02:21:32,193 --> 02:21:33,277
Good choices.

1931
02:21:33,361 --> 02:21:36,072
I gotta go with the man.
Garth Brooks.

1932
02:21:36,155 --> 02:21:39,367
The Carpenters do not
have a single bad song.

1933
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:40,660
Adrian Belew.

1934
02:21:40,951 --> 02:21:44,205
Both solo and his work
with King Crimson.

1935
02:21:44,955 --> 02:21:46,123
What about you, Captain?

1936
02:21:46,207 --> 02:21:47,625
Uh, this one's
kind of special.

1937
02:22:06,227 --> 02:22:07,770
Guess they're here.

1938
02:22:07,853 --> 02:22:11,607
Well, I can handle this
by my lonesome

1939
02:22:11,691 --> 02:22:13,526
if y'all wanna chill.

1940
02:22:13,609 --> 02:22:14,610
Nah, nah.

1941
02:22:14,694 --> 02:22:16,445
It'll go faster
if we all do it together.

1942
02:22:17,113 --> 02:22:18,114
Groot, wake up.

1943
02:22:19,824 --> 02:22:21,867
<i>Nothin' the matter
With your head</i>

1944
02:22:23,035 --> 02:22:26,580
<i>Baby, find it
Come on and find it</i>

1945
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:31,293
Do you ever feel
a little sad for them?

1946
02:22:31,377 --> 02:22:32,461
Yeah, sure.

1947
02:22:32,545 --> 02:22:34,505
But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

1948
02:22:35,256 --> 02:22:36,924
<i>On your word, Kapitan.</i>

1949
02:22:37,007 --> 02:22:39,218
<i>Come and get your love</i>

1950

1952
02:22:46,809 --> 02:22:47,810

With you feel right</i>

1956
02:23:02,408 --> 02:23:05,578
<i>Don't you feel right, baby</i>

1957
02:23:05,661 --> 02:23:08,497
<i>Hail, oh yeah</i>

1958
02:23:08,581 --> 02:23:13,085
<i>Get it from the main vine
All right</i>

1959
02:23:13,836 --> 02:23:17,089
<i>I said-a find it, find it</i>

1960
02:23:17,173 --> 02:23:21,969
<i>Go on and love it
If you like it, yeah</i>

1961
02:23:23,804 --> 02:23:26,223
<i>- Hail
- Hail</i>

1962
02:23:26,307 --> 02:23:30,895
<i>It's your business
If you want some, take some</i>

1963
02:23:30,978 --> 02:23:33,230
<i>Get it together, baby</i>

1964
02:23:33,314 --> 02:23:36,108
<i>Come and get your love</i>

1965
02:23:37,985 --> 02:23:40,863

<i>You better get it straight
Darling</i>

2026

I wanna find out what I got</i>

2029
02:27:07,528 --> 02:27:11,740
<i>Well I believe in the love
That you gave me</i>

2030
02:27:11,824 --> 02:27:15,703
<i>I believe in the faith
That could save me</i>

2031
02:27:15,786 --> 02:27:20,165
<i>I believe in the hope
And I pray that some day</i>

2032
02:27:20,249 --> 02:27:23,961
<i>It may raise me above these</i>

2033

<i>Badlands, you gotta

<i>Hmm, hm-hm-hm-hm</i>

2042
02:28:26,732 --> 02:28:30,611
<i>For the ones who had a notion
A notion deep inside</i>

2043
02:28:30,694 --> 02:28:34,323
<i>That it ain't no sin
To be glad you're alive</i>

2044
02:28:34,406 --> 02:28:38,202
<i>I wanna find one face
That ain't looking through me</i>

02:28:38,285 --> 02:28:39,912
<i>I wanna find one place</i>

2046
02:28:39,995 --> 02:28:42,498
<i>I wanna spit
In the face of these</i>

2047
02:28:42,581 --> 02:28:45,793
<i>Badlands, you gotta
Live it every day</i>

2048
02:28:45,876 --> 02:28:49,838
<i>Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay</i>

2049
02:28:49,922 --> 02:28:51,965
<i>Keep movin'
Till it's understood</i>

2050
02:28:52,049 --> 02:28:55,969
<i>And these badlands
Start treating us good</i>

2051
02:28:56,053 --> 02:28:57,930
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2052
02:28:58,013 --> 02:29:01,850
<i>Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

<i>Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2054
02:29:05,771 --> 02:29:09,483

<i>Badlands, whoa whoa whoa whoa</i>

2056
02:29:14,530 --> 02:29:16,532
I mean, if she needs help
mowing her lawn, I'll do it,

2057
02:29:16,615 --> 02:29:18,367
but I kinda feel like
her son should help.

2058
02:29:18,951 --> 02:29:21,286
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

2059
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:23,288
Like, he's a 45-year-old man,

2060
02:29:23,372 --> 02:29:25,332
able-bodied,
and I'm mowing his lawn.

2061
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:26,625
- It just feels weird.
- Mm-hmm.

2062
02:29:26,708 --> 02:29:28,252
Don't get me started.

2063
02:29:29,837 --> 02:29:31,630
Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

2064
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:33,924
Now I kind of want to know.
