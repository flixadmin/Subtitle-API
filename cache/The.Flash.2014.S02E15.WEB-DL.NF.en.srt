the heads-up, Barry.

160
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,645
About what?

161
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,689
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody.

162
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,356
Goes by the name King Shark.

163
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,775
King Shark?

164
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,986
You mean, the half-man, half-shark
that tried to kill you months ago?

165
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,196
I thought he was dead.

166
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,865
That's what A.R.G.U.S. wanted you
to believe when they snatched him up.

167
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,284
But believe me,
this half-shark is very much alive.

168
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,120
And his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing,

169
00:08:58,495 --> 00:08:59,997
that's kill you, Barry.

170
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
(SCOFFS)

171
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,835
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

172
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,420
(SIGHS)

173
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,885
So how do you know about King Shark?

174
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,846
As the new director of A.R.G.U.S.,

175
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,473
Lyla's job is to clean up
Amanda Waller's messes.

176
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,642
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

177
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,185
And it appears under her directives,

178
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,313
A.R.G.U.S. had been monitoring meta-human
activity for the past two years.

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,065
-Why?
-Well, to see if any of those powers

180
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,900
could be exploited.

181
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,401
Weaponized.

182
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,614
How do you know that he's coming after me?

183
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,617
While in our custody,
he kept saying the same thing.

184
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,744
"Zoom wants The Flash dead."

185
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,622
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,625
the readings we did receive show
that he was headed towards Central City.

187
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,792
Let him come.

188
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,919
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

189
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,505
We just came here to warn you, man.
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

190
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,090
No, I can't do that, Dig.

191
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
I'm sorry, but all year,

192
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,595
we've been sitting ducks for Zoom
and all his Earth-2 henchmen.

193
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,096
This is the last one.

194
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,933
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.
I'm going after him first.

195
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,226
I owe that to Jay.

196
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,772
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

197
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,191
Real name is Shay Lamden.
He was a, get this, marine biologist

198
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,861
before my particle accelerator
changed him into King Shark

199
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,030
and Zoom put him under his control.

200
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,365
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

201
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,450
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

202
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,994
I just followed.

203
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,831
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.
Can you find King Shark, too?

204
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,167
-I can try.
-All right.

205
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,964
(SIGHS) Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

206
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
There must only be a few hours

207
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,468
before he needs to get back into the water
to re-oxygenate his blood.

208
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,764
I can take the waterfront.
Can you have your team handle the rest?

209
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,974
-I'll get them on it.
-All right.

210
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,852
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelgänger?

211
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,478
Maybe he could help us somehow.

212
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,980
{\an8}Or not.

213
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,983
{\an8}Um, looks like he died when the
particle accelerator exploded.

214
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,484
{\an8}What about next of kin?

215
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,821
{\an8}Uh, he's got a widow, Dr. Tanya Lamden.

216
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,989
{\an8}<i>She's a research scientist
at Nautilus Labs,</i>

217
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,159
and she studies, wait for it, sharks.

218
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,953
Okay, well, maybe the two of you can go

219
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,789
and see if she's discovered anything
in her research that could help us?

220
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,207
-Yeah.
-Sure.

221
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:07,499
Great.

222
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,087
-Hey, Dig.
-Yeah.

223
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,715
-How's that helmet treating you?
-It could use some improvements.

224
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,507
I'll get to work on it.

225
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,968
Hey, Joe, what's up?

226
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,510
Hey, Barr, I talked to Wally.

227
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,346
-He wants to meet up with you.
-All right.

228
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,849
He's working on his engineering project
at our place tonight.

229
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,517
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

230
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,354
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry.
Right now is kind of a crazy time.

231
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,688
Why? What's going on?

232
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,692
Remember that meta-human shark
that Patty was after and attacked me?

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,821
-He's back? I thought Wells, you know.
-Yeah, me too.

234
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,073
But apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him
and he escaped.

235
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,699
And now he's heading for Central City.

236
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,911
I get it. Uh, I'll tell Wally
some other time.

237
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,706
Hey, you know what? Um, it's all good.

238
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,584
I'll make it work.
Tell him tonight should be fine.

239
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,920
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

240
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,089
<i>-Thanks, Barr.</i>
-Yeah, bye.

241
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:58,550
(SIGHS)

242
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,302
Why?

243
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,683
It's been two years
since your particle accelerator exploded.

244
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,271
Seems a little late to be asking questions
about my husband, doesn't it?

245
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,899
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

246
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,567
I suppose you could say that.

247
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,446
It only took three days for every cell
in his body to grow uncontrollably.

248
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:25,077
Whatever cancer he had,
it turned him into something not human.

249
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:26,954
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

250
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,664
There's a meta-human in Central City

251
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,501
whose body seems to be mutating
in the same way as your late husband.

252
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,671
But he didn't die,
he became a dangerous monster.

253
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,924
My husband was no monster.

254
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,842
That's not what she was implying.

255
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,677
What does this have to do with me?

256
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,096
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

257
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,390
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
I've had some encouraging results.

258
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,100
Although, still preliminary.

259
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,685
We need to see it.

260
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,270
I beg your pardon?

261
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,105
Your research. All of it.

262
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,942
What my colleague means to say is that

263
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,610
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

264
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,989
it could help us stop this meta-human
from hurting anyone.

265
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,616
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.

266
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,368
I'm just supposed to trust you?

267
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,415
Please, Mrs. Lamden.
This could help save lives.

268
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,836
I'll e-mail you what I have.

269
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,504
Thank you.

270
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,344
A little harsh.

271
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,678
I was being direct.

272
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,056
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

273
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,809
You've been acting differently toward me
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

274
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,811
What's your problem, Cisco?

275
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,731
Nothing.

276
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,483
Let's just go.

277
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,411
AGENT 1: <i>Grid one, negative.</i>

278
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,040
AGENT 2: <i>Grid four, negative.</i>

279
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,965
Status check, grid two.

280
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,341
AGENT 3: <i>Grid two, negative.</i>

281
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,593
-Anything?
-No, man. Nothing yet.

282
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,595
So far, nothing on our end, either.

283
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,931
I just hope Wells is doing
better than we are.

284
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,017
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

285
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,895
I'm not gonna lie, Barr.
It was pretty rough there at first,

286
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,772
but you know Felicity, she's tough.

287
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,026
Yeah. She's just not
returning any of my calls.

288
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,361
She has a lot going on right now.

289
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,448
But hey, I'll ask her if she can give you
a call when this is all over.

290
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,118
I just want to catch this thing, man.

291
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,537
If everything to do with Zoom and Earth-2
are put behind us,

292
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:34,206
we could just move on with our lives.

293
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,708
You're starting to do that thing
Oliver does, Barry.

294
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,211
Carry the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

295
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,673
You gotta stop that, man,
or it's going to slow you down.

296
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,301
Still nothing.

297
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:47,469
Status check, grid six.

298
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,346
AGENT 4: <i>Hold on,
I think we got something.</i>

299
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,270
(GROWLING)

300
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,195
LYLA: So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

301
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,487
We don't find King Shark soon,

302
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,489
someone's going to be
cleaning up after mine.

303
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,408
We'll find him, Lyla.

304
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,745
All right.
I searched the whole area, he's gone.

305
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,247
He couldn't have gotten far.

306
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,085
Still, he knows we're here now.
We lost the element of surprise.

307
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,837
Not if Wells can figure out a way
to track him.

308
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,506
-In the meantime, we'll keep looking.
-All right.

309
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:28,385
I'll meet up with you guys later.
I gotta go see Joe's son.

310
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,846
Okay. I thought our relationship
was hard to follow.

311
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,432
-(SCOFFS)

So, this is what I got so far

316
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,789
for my project essay to get into
CCU's engineering program.

317
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,045
Turbine supercars?

318
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,547
Turbines. Like jet engines?

319
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,633
Yeah. Yeah, it'd use
an engine like the ones

320
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,719
they have in some helicopters,
only it'd run on biodiesel.

321
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,347
-Cool.
-It's very cool.

322
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,267
Yeah, you're gonna wanna address
the fuel economy issue here.

323
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,103
I mean, it is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

324
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,730
Yeah. That's why I wanna use biodiesel.

325
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,857
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

326
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,654
Okay, we also got a sound issue.
Gonna wake the neighbors for sure.

327
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:30,781

00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,543
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

333
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,673
I mean, it looks really good.

334
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,095
All right, let's start over, okay?

all together? Work it out.

in Dr. Lamden's research

340

to tell us how to find King Shark.

341
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,378
Maybe I should take a look?

342
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,215
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor
with a specialty in biochem.

I'm just saying maybe you could use
another set of eyes, considering...

344
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,762
Considering what?

345
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,639
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

346
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,391
What does that mean?

347
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,852
You are not yourself, Caitlin.

348
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,731
And it's freaking me out
'cause you have this icy look in your eye

00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,595
Okay, fine! Yes, I met your doppelgänger.

362
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,390
She's a coldhearted ice queen
named Killer Frost.

363
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,309

00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,731
Great. Now Harry's gonna kill me
and throw my stuff across the room.

366
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,277
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

367
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,030
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting
just like she did over there.

368
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,325
You're being shut off,
you're being detached,

369
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,119
you're being cold.

370
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,078
Because I have to be right now.

371
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,292
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes.

372
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,212
Just when I was starting to
feel normal again.

373
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,756
Just when I was beginning to love him.

374
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,303
So if I let myself feel,

375
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,140
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

376
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,309
it's never gonna stop.

377
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,311
And that's not going to help me, either.

378
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,604
So let's just get back to this research

379
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,815
and figure out how to find King Shark.

380
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,817
Okay.

381
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,247

Yep, just like back home. Always working.

383
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,336
I'm trying to relocate this King Shark.

384
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,171
He's here? On this Earth?

385
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,466
Yes. It turns out, our friend
Zoom brought him here

386
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,384
to kill The Flash.

387
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,678
Looks like he's stuck here
just like we are.

388
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,014
Yeah, it looks like he is,
and so I have to figure this out

00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,100
before more people get hurt, Jesse, so...

-Partial matching strategies, yes.

but now that I am,

396
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,702
you don't want me here.

397
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,705
Just let me help. Please.

398
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,587

399
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,217
Yeah, okay.

00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,263
WALLY: <i>Hardest part was amping the torque
without increasing drag.</i>

401
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,889
A heavier engine would only
slow things down.

402
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,724
But this streamlined version
should optimize

403
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,726
both the torque and the horsepower.

404
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,647
Yeah. I'm just worried
it won't be enough still.

405
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,064
Here, let's do this.

406
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,652
Use a one-to-one transfer gearbox
to drop the output shaft of the engine.

407
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,239
Reverse rotation and send more power
to the torque converter.

to just do it for me.

00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:34,305
Dad, you need to talk to him.

473
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,058
No, it's fine. I get it.

474
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,270
Look, I know you guys love me,

475

but please stop telling Wally
all this great stuff about me.

476
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,817
Start telling him the truth.
I'm not perfect.

477
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,319
I make mistakes
that even The Flash can't fix.

478
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,571
Okay.

479
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,325
What happened with you on Earth-2?
The truth.

480
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,998
I shouldn't tell you guys this, but, um,

481
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,251
I met your doppelgängers.

482
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,422
You were the cop in the family.
A good one, too.

483
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,300
(LAUGHS)
I told you I would've made a good cop.

484
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:11,802
Don't get any ideas.

485
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,722
-What about me, then?
-You were a lounge singer.

486
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,184
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually.

487
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,312
Um, but you didn't like me at all.

488
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,190
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop.

489
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:30,486
Said that she only became one
to help her selfish husband's career.

490
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,908
Wait, we were married?

491
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,285
Mmm-hmm.

492
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,038
<i>We went to go see Joe perform.</i>

493
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,751
And that's when everything went wrong.

494
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,549
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up.

495
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,720
They were looking for me. They knew
that I wasn't supposed to be there.

496
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,389
And they attacked, and

497
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,852
you got caught in the crossfire and

498
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,229
you died.

499
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:11,319
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,

500
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,946
but

501
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,244
watching it happen in front of me,
living that?

502
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:23,915
It didn't feel any different
because it was all still real.

503
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,880
And Jay warned me not to get
emotionally sucked in when I went there.

504
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:33,717
And then that's exactly what happened.

505
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,763
And now Joe West on Earth-2 is dead,

506
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,640
because I showed up.

507
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,271
Barr, that's not your fault.

508
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,982
Yeah, it is my fault.

509
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,567
It's all my fault.

510
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,278
Zoom,

511
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,781
this King Shark,

512
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,700
Jay's death.

513
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,952
It's all because of me.

514
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:07,292
And then I just left an entire world
at Zoom's mercy.

515
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,559
Just when you thought it was safe
to go back in the suburbs,

516
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,644
King Shark shows up at your house.

517
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,146
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

518
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,148
It's not like I was The Flash
while I was at home.

519
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,233
-Must be a reason.
-Yeah.

520
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,319
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?

521
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:38,031
No. I don't have enough information
to create an accurate location algorithm.

522
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,325
What about Dr. Lamden's research?
Anything that can help us?

523
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:41,534
I didn't think so at first,

524
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,704
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

525
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:45,538
Sharks are predators.

526
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:46,790
In order to track their prey,

527
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,167
they use what's known as
passive electro location.

528
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,419
-Passive electro location?
-Yes, it's how they sense

529
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,339
the bioelectric potential
around a fish's body.

530
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,800
King Shark senses electricity
in Barry's system.

531
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,635
Okay. That explains how
King Shark can track Barry.

532
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,387
But how is that going to
help us track him?

533
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,514
We flip it.
Instead of King Shark being the predator,

534
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,018
we make him the prey, and we track him
using active electro location.

535
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,438
We reprogram our satellite to
generate a specific electric field

536
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,440
and then measure any
electrical distortions

537
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,943
that correlate with a one-ton,
walking shark.

538
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,903
(CHUCKLES) That'll help us get him.

539
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,323
-You'll help me out?
-Sure.

540
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,204
Great. Let us know when you locate him,
and we'll take it from there.

541
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,705
Okay.

542
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,207
Let's get the team ready.

543
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,251

00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,092

545
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,221
DIGGLE: What exactly is that?

546
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,058
That, my friend, is bait.

547
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:48,977
You made a Flash lure?

548
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,562
It's the best I could come up
with given the time frame.

549
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,900
It's rigged to mimic and enhance
the electric field Barry's body generates.

550
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,736
King Shark takes one whiff of that,
cue the Jaws soundtrack.

551
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,238
And I also stuffed it with enough tranqs
to knock him out for a month.

552
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,407
Which should make him
a lot easier to reel in.

553
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,911
And that container, strong enough
to hold him once he's sedated?

554
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,997
It's made of promethium metal.
It's impenetrable.

555
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,291
Meanwhile, we'll be able to keep track
of King Shark with this

556
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:13,584
and the cameras that are on the lure.

557
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,670
Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.

558

You know Quint dies, right?

563
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,651
Water is this monster's natural habitat.

564
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,321
He's gonna be a lot stronger here.
You sure about this?

but you're insulting my intelligence
with this, okay? I know.

(SIGHS)

627
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,602
Well, thanks a lot, Dig.

628
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:24,479
Hey, I gotta thank you, Barry.

629
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,524
Got Lyla her first win.
I got to watch you run on water.

630
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,693
It was biblical.

631

(SIGHS)

632
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,118
Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,
I lost a lot of friends.

633
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,035
Brothers.

634
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,288
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.

635
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,083
Question yourself,

636
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,085
blame yourself for his death.

637
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,172
And that guilt, it can tear you apart.

638
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,300
Trust me, man,
you gotta get control of it,

639
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,345
or it'll rip you up inside.

640
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,432
Use this, man. Let it guide you,

641
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:03,476
so it never happens again.

642
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,895
-All right, thanks, man.
-You got it.

643
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:08,273
-Say hi to everyone for me, all right?
-I will.

644

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

645
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,617
Yeah, okay, that's kind of freaky.

646
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,494
Yeah, yeah. See? I told you.

647
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,828
Hey, Oliver, what's up?

648
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,461
You're a really slow reader.

649
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,298
(LAUGHING)

650
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,220
-So?
-I want one of these supercars.

651
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,515
I mean, especially if I can run it off
the bacon grease I collect.

652
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:47,312
-(LAUGHS)
-Man, Wally, I'm so impressed.

653
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,816
Thanks. But Barry gave me
a lot of help, so...

654
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:55,486
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea.
This is all your hard work.

655
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,905
It's all you.
Barry would say the same thing.

656
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,241
Would he?

657
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,745
Look, Wally.

658
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,334
Iris and I took Barry in

659
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,252
when he was 11.

660
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,921
And the reason he came to live with us
is because

661
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,965
his mother was murdered,

662
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,344
and his father was
wrongfully imprisoned for it.

663
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,764
And I have been overprotective
of that kid since that day.

664
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,810
We gave him all the love

665
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:30,855
and support he needed
to get through that tragedy

666
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:34,275
and become the man he is now.

667
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,528
So that pride

668
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,031
you see when Iris and I
are talking about him

669
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,160
is because things could have gone
very differently.

670
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,332
But he's not perfect.

671
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,711
And he's not favored
over you, or Iris, or anybody else.

672
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,047
So you have nothing to worry about.

673
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,134
He's my son.

674
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,221
Just like you are.

675
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,018
What are you doing with those?

676
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,980
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger to
see if I can get these to work over here.

677
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,024
So you can catch some breachers?

678
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,736
(WINCES) Dear God, Caitlin,
your hands are freezing!

679
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,282
"Caitlin." I've always hated that name.

680
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,742
Oh, no!

681
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,745
No, no, no. It's starting.
You're starting to become...

682
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,372
Killer Frost?

683
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,083
(LAUGHS)

684
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,295
That ain't right.

685
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,630
That ain't right. That's just rude.
Who put you up to this?

686
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,633
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?
Oh, I should've known.

687
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,427
-You two are...
-Cold?

688
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,719
Yeah.

689
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,390
You deserve it for thinking that
I could ever become like her.

690
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,601
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

691
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,729
I may be sad, I may want to be alone
for a little while,

692
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,189
but I promise you

693
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,818
Killer Frost will never exist
on this Earth, okay?

694
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,447
Besides, you tested me.
I don't even have the meta-human gene.

695
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,699
So please stop worrying about me, okay?

696
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,369
Okay. (SOFT CHUCKLE)

697
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,996
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

698
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,418
For real though,
you gotta work on that circulation.

699
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,753
You might have Raynaud's or something?
You know what Raynaud's is?

700
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,088
I'm a doctor, Cisco.

Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

702

What's good?

703
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,347
(SIGHS) Uh...

704
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,851
I need to apologize to you all.

705
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,312
Um...

706
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,734
Last year, I made a choice
to go back in time

707
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,402
and save my mother.

708
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:45,280
And that choice had

709
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:49,159
a lot of consequences that will haunt me
for the rest of my life,

710
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,287
just like I know
it haunts all of you, too.

711
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
Zoom.

712
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,921
Jay's death.

713
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,467
It's all because of me.

714
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,513
But I own those choices.

715
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,015
We're the ones
who opened the door to Earth-2.

716
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,975
We're the ones who brought Zoom here.

717
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,854
But we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

718
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,314
How?

719
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,485
How are we going to stop Zoom, Allen?

720
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,363
I don't know yet.

721
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,996
But those breaches aren't closed forever,
and we're not done with Earth-2.

(SIGHS)

723
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,424
Jay's death was not in vain.

724
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,469
We will meet Zoom again.

725
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,763
And the next time,

726
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,557
I will beat him.

727
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,976
Whoever that monster is.
