1
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,662
When I was a child,

2
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,789
my brother would tell me
a bedtime story...

3
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,044
about the man
who murdered our father.

4
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:11,049
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

5
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:14,052
Who sat down on the Iron Throne
and watched

6
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,679
as his blood poured onto the floor.

7
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,932
He told me other stories as well.

8
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,228
About all the things
we would do to that man...

9
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,733
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms
and had him in our grasp.

10
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:34,197
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,323
She did.

12
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,700
I don't see an army.

13
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:41,329
I see one man, with one hand.

14
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,081
It appears your sister lied to me.

15
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,919
She lied to me as well.

16
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,590
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

17
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:57,470
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

18
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,974
The Golden Company from Essos,
bought and paid for.

19
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,976
Even if we defeat the dead,

20
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,038
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

21
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,563
"We"?

22
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:12,026
I promised to fight for the living.
I intend to keep that promise.

23
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,801
- Your Grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

24
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,955
He came here alone, knowing full well
how he'd be received.

25
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,250
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

26
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,378
Perhaps he trusts his little brother
to defend him,

27
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,755
right up to the moment
he slits my throat.

28
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,842
You're right.
We can't trust him.

29
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,886
He attacked my father in the streets.

30
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,473
He tried to destroy my house and
my family, the same as he did yours.

31
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,559
Do you want me to apologize?

32
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,685
I won't.

33
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,062
We were at war.

34
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,565
Everything I did,
I did for my house and my family.

35
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,733
I'd do it all again.

36
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,111
The things we do for love.

37
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,558
So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

38
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,125
Because this goes
beyond loyalty.

39
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,213
This is about survival.

40
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,232
You don't know me well,
Your Grace.

41
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,727
But I know Ser Jaime.

42
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,437
He is a man of honour.

43
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,565
I was his captor once.

44
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,151
But when we were both taken prisoner
and the men holding us

45
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,654
tried to force themselves on me,
Ser Jaime defended me.

46
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,366
And lost his hand because of it.

47
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:49,624
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

48
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,418
He armed me, armoured me,

49
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,379
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

50
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,382
because he'd sworn an oath
to your mother.

51
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,890
You vouch for him?

52
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,936
I do.

53
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,818
You would fight beside him?

54
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:21,823
I would.

55
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,120
I trust you with my life.

56
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:33,417
If you trust him with yours,
we should let him stay.

57
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,884
What does the Warden of the North
say about it?

58
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,475
We need every man we can get.

59
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,070
Very well.

60
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,050
Episode 2 - A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms.

61
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,259
Thank you, Your Grace.

62
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,717
Either you knew Cersei was lying
and let me believe otherwise,

63
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,135
or you didn't know at all.

64
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,220
Which makes you
either a traitor or a fool.

65
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,556
- I was a fool.
- Not for the first time.

66
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,643
Cersei still sits on the throne.

67
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:17,355
If you can't help me take it back,
I'll find another Hand who can.

68
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,906
I suspect one of you will be
wearing this before it's all over.

69
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,163
Coal's coming through.

70
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,253
Don't you have something better to do?

71
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,171
You make my weapon yet?

72
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,759
Just as soon as I'm done
making a few thousand of these.

73
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,469
You should make mine first.

74
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,388
And make sure it's stronger than this.

75
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,433
It's strong enough.

76
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,648
It's going to be safer
down in the crypt, you know.

77
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,943
Are you going to be
down in the crypt?

78
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,987
- No, but...
- But you're a fighter.

79
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,322
I've done my share.

80
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,909
You've fought them?

81
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,162
I did. Some of them.

82
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,497
How many?

83
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,623
A few.

84
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,334
That was enough.

85
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,714
What are they like?

86
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:08,758
Bad.

87
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,385
Really bad.

88
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:13,137
"Really bad"?

89
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,976
Even a smith's apprentice
can do better than "really bad."

90
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,854
What do they look like?
What do they smell like?

91
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,106
How do they move?
How hard are they to kill?

92
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,775
Look, I know you want to fight.

93
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,153
And I know you're not scared
of rapers or murderers or...

94
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,946
This is different. This is...

95
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,407
This is death.

96
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,411
You want to know what they're like?
Death. That's what they're like.

97
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,587
I know Death.

98
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,466
He's got many faces.

99
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,888
I look forward to seeing this one.

100
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,107
- My weapon?
- I'll get right on it.

101
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,059
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

102
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,898
You weren't sorry then.

103
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,193
You were protecting your family.

104
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,114
I'm not that person anymore.

105
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,492
You still would be, if you hadn't
pushed me out of that window.

106
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,163
And I would still be Brandon Stark.

107
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,916
- You're not?
- No.

108
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,793
I'm something else now.

109
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,213
You're not angry at me.

110
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,841
I'm not angry at anyone.

111
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,010
Why didn't you tell them?

112
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,596
You won't be able to help us
in this fight

113
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,222
if I let them murder you first.

114
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,021
What about afterwards?

115
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,107
How do you know
there is an afterwards?

116
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,911
Next up.

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,294
Put a marker in the ground!

118
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,131
Bring it up to the wall!

119
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,467
Up onto the wall. All right.

120
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,230
- All right.
- All right.

121
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,306
Well, here we are.

122
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,849
Yes, here we are.

123
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,392
Together again.

124
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,856
And the masses rejoice.

125
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,860
How do they feel
about their new queen?

126
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,403
She's your new queen too.

127
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,115
They remember what happened

128
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,534
the last time Targaryens
brought dragons north.

129
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,247
They'll come around
once they see Daenerys is different.

130
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,791
And she is? Different?

131
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,251
She is.

132
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,503
- You're sure about her?
- I am.

133
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,255
She didn't seem sure about you.

134
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,340
It's hard to blame her.

135
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,051
I made a mistake
common to clever people.

136
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,971
- I underestimated my opponents.
- Hmm.

137
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,807
Cersei told me the pregnancy
had changed her.

138
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,393
A chance for you both to start again.

139
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,019
And I believed her.

140
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,232
Was she lying about the baby too?

141
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,902
No, that part is real.

142
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,242
She's always been good
at using the truth to tell lies.

143
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,036
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

144
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,663
She's fooled me more than anybody.

145
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,583
What?

146
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,211
She never fooled you.

147
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,880
You always knew
exactly what she was,

148
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,299
and you loved her anyway.

149
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,936
So...

150
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,482
we're going to die at Winterfell.

151
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,236
Not the death I would've chosen.

152
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:44,283
I always pictured myself
dying in my own bed,

153
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,076
the age of 80,

154
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,411
with a belly full of wine and

155
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,164
- a girl's mouth around my
- A girl's mouth around your

156
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,171
At least Cersei
won't get to murder me.

157
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,342
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction
denying her that pleasure

158
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,386
while I'm being ripped apart
by dead men.

159
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,350
Maybe after I'm dead...

160
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,729
I'll march down to King's Landing
and rip her apart.

161
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,814
You will see
the Army of the Dead.

162
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,993
Good.

163
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,256
Good.

164
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,595
Good.

165
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,763
Yes, aim.

166
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:51,975
Don't rush.

167
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,102
Come forward.

168
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,814
- Come on.
- Ser Jaime.

169
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,940
Lady Brienne.

170
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,866
He's come a long way.

171
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,161
- He's all right.
- One more time. Come on.

172
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,373
- Still has a lot to learn.
- I'm sure you'll teach him.

173
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,999
Better, better.

174
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,085
I've been told you're commanding
the left flank.

175
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,670
I am.

176
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,423
It's, uh... It's good ground.

177
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,549
It is.

178
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,219
The rise, it should give us
some advantage.

179
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,022
If we can keep a tight formation,
we might be able to beat them back.

180
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,558
Yes, I think you're right.

181
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,977
- What are you doing?
- What?

182
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,771
- I think you know.
- I truly don't.

183
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,857
We have never had a conversation
last this long

184
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,775
without you insulting me. Not once.

185
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,943
You want me to insult you?

186
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,194
- No!
- Good.

187
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,120
I came to Winterfell because...

188
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,377
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

189
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,216
But I'd be honoured to serve under
your command, if you'll have me.

190
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:16,977
I better get back.

191
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,167
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

192
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,338
Have you done something to offend me?

193
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,547
Many things.

194
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,883
Long ago and long forgiven.

195
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,510
But you did forgive,

196
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,095
despite my failures.

197
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,976
When I heard you'd named Tyrion
your Hand,

198
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,646
it broke my heart.

199
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,108
When I named him Hand, I didn't
know if I'd ever see you again.

200
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,237
You made the right choice.

201
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,614
I wasn't under the impression
you liked him very much.

202
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,074
I didn't.

203
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,993
His mouth hardly stopped moving
between Volantis and Meereen.

204
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,037
It was all I could do
not to throw him in the sea.

205
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,503
But the mind behind all those words...

206
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,674
He's made mistakes.

207
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,217
Serious mistakes.

208
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,262
As have we all.

209
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,348
He owns his

210
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,976
and learns from them.

211
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,105
You're advising me to forgive
the man who stole your position?

212
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,816
I am.

213
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,445
And one other suggestion,
if you'll allow me.

214
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,075
The moment we can get the last
infantryman out onto the field,

215
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,618
we should shut the gates.

216
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,704
Keep them open
for as long as you can.

217
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,665
There are still people coming in
from the countryside.

218
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,881
Lady Sansa, I was hoping
we could speak alone.

219
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,944
I thought you and I were
on the verge of agreement before.

220
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,237
About Ser Jaime.

221
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,826
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.

222
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,494
I trust her more than anyone.

223
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,123
I wish I could have
that kind of faith in my advisors.

224
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,668
Tyrion is a good man.

225
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,379
He was never anything but decent
towards me.

226
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,342
I didn't ask him to be my Hand
simply because he was good.

227
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:58,305
I asked him to be my Hand
because he was good, and intelligent

228
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,724
and ruthless when he had to be.

229
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,061
He never should have trusted Cersei.

230
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,147
You never should have either.

231
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,402
I thought he knew his sister.

232
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,031
Families are complicated.

233
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,326
Ours certainly have been.

234
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,622
A sad thing to have in common.

235
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,834
We have other things in common.

236
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,961
We've both known what it means
to lead people

237
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,382
who aren't inclined
to accept a woman's rule.

238
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,677
And we've both done a good job
of it, from what I can tell.

239
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,934
And yet, I can't help but feel
we're at odds with one another.

240
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:46,812
Why is that?

241
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,734
Your brother.

242
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,364
He loves you, you know that.

243
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,242
That bothers you?

244
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,870
Men do stupid things for women.

245
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,997
They're easily manipulated.

246
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,003
All my life, I've known one goal:

247
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,380
the Iron Throne.

248
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,467
Taking it back from the people
who destroyed my family,

249
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,969
and almost destroyed yours.

250
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,638
My war was against them.

251
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,225
Until I met Jon.

252
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,063
Now I'm here, half a world away,

253
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,607
fighting Jon's war alongside him.

254
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,777
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

255
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,581
I should have thanked you
the moment you arrived.

256
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,333
That was a mistake.

257
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,255
I'm here because
I love your brother...

258
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,258
and I trust him...

259
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,762
and I know he's true to his word.

260
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,724
He's only the second man in my life
I can say that about.

261
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,727
Who was the first?

262
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,520
Someone taller.

263
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,652
And what happens afterwards?

264
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:23,074
We defeat the dead,
we destroy Cersei.

265
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,702
What happens then?

266
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,830
I take the Iron Throne.

267
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,043
What about the North?

268
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,215
It was taken from us,
and we took it back.

269
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,718
And we said we'd never bow
to anyone else again.

270
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,428
What about the North?

271
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,563
Apologies, my lady.
Your Grace...

272
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,398
What is it?

273
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,839
My queen.

274
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,298
Your sister?

275
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,969
She only has a few ships,
and she couldn't sail them here.

276
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,013
So she's sailing
to the Iron Islands instead,

277
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,015
to take them back in your name.

278
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,350
But why aren't you with her?

279
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,526
I want to fight for Winterfell,
Lady Sansa...

280
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,904
if you'll have me.

281
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,061
My lord, we're not soldiers.

282
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,438
You are now.

283
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,486
Look, I made it through
most of my years

284
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,530
without ever getting near a fight,

285
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,699
but then I survived
the Battle of the Bastards.

286
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,492
Right outside these walls.

287
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,787
If I can live through that,
you can live through this.

288
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,125
They'll outfit you with weapons
at the forge.

289
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,251
Right that way.

290
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,338
Thank you.

291
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,735
When the time comes,
you'll be down in the crypts.

292
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,344
They're the safest place to be.

293
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,054
Through that archway
right over there.

294
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,139
Thank you.

295
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,311
Hey, hey, who's next, lads?

296
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,896
Thank you, sir.

297
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,274
Which way should I go?

298
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,989
Which way do you want to go?

299
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,577
All the children will be going below
when the time comes.

300
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,664
But both me brothers were soldiers.

301
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,292
I want to fight too.

302
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,924
That's good to hear.

303
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,385
I'm going to be in the crypt
with my son,

304
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,471
and I'd feel a lot better
with you down there to protect us.

305
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,890
I'm sure a lot of people would.

306
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,023
All right.
I'll defend the crypt, then.

307
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,369
Riders coming in!

308
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,396
- My little crow.
- I thought we'd lost you.

309
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,857
Almost.

310
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,105
Put them in the stables.

311
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,535
How did you find each other?

312
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,579
We met up at the Last Hearth.

313
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,456
The dead got there first.

314
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,919
The Umbers?

315
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,921
Fighting for the Night King now.

316
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,675
We had to travel around them
to get here.

317
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,470
Whoever's not here now

318
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,637
is with them.

319
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,765
How long do we have?

320
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,310
Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

321
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,485
The big woman still here?

322
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:12,864
<i>They're coming.</i>

323
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:14,824
Next.

324
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:18,745
<i>We have dragonglass
and Valyrian steel.</i>

325
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,168
<i>But there are
too many of them.</i>

326
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,587
<i>Far too many.</i>

327
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,508
<i>Our enemy doesn't tire.</i>

328
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:34,844
<i>Doesn't stop.</i>

329
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,555
<i>Doesn't feel.</i>

330
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,060
We can't beat them
in a straight fight.

331
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,561
So, what can we do?

332
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,566
The Night King made them all.
They follow his command.

333
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,735
If he falls...

334
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,239
Getting to him
may be our best chance.

335
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,950
If that's true,
he'll never expose himself.

336
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,868
Yes, he will.

337
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,746
He'll come for me.

338
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,168
He's tried before, many times,
with many Three-Eyed Ravens.

339
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,254
Why?

340
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,506
What does he want?

341
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,174
An endless night.

342
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:19,097
He wants to erase this world,
and I am its memory.

343
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,980
Well, that's what death is, isn't it?

344
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,227
Forgetting.

345
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,106
Being forgotten.

346
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,860
If we forget where we've been
and what we've done,

347
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,611
we're not men anymore.

348
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,780
Just animals.

349
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,533
Your memories don't come from books.

350
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,578
Your stories aren't just stories.

351
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,290
If I wanted to erase the world of men,
I'd start with you.

352
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,377
- How will he find you?
- His mark is on me.

353
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,213
He always knows where I am.

354
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,425
We'll put you in the crypt,
where it's safest.

355
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,968
No.

356
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:00,430
We need to lure him into the open
before his army destroys us all.

357
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,599
I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

358
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,392
You want us to use you as bait?

359
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,186
We're not leaving you alone
out there.

360
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,979
He won't be. I'll stay with him.

361
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,565
With the Ironborn.

362
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,862
I took this castle from you.

363
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,530
Let me defend you now.

364
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,751
We'll hold off the rest of them
for as long as we can.

365
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,462
When the time comes,
Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,

366
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,505
to give you the signal
to light the trench.

367
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:38,176
Ser Davos is perfectly capable
of waving a torch on his own.

368
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,552
You'll be in the crypt.

369
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,264
Your Grace, I have fought before,
I can do it again.

370
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:46,017
Alongside the men and women
risking their lives.

371
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,062
There are thousands of them
and only one of you.

372
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,231
You can't fight as well as they can,

373
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,025
but you can think
better than any of them.

374
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,236
You're here because of your mind.

375
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,946
If we survive, I'll need it.

376
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,035
The dragons should give us
an edge in the field.

377
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,829
If they're in the field,
they're not protecting Bran.

378
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,998
We need to be near him.

379
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,043
Not too near,
or the Night King won't come.

380
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:13,771
But close enough to pursue him
when he does.

381
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,213
Dragon fire will stop him?

382
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,507
I don't know.

383
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,217
No one's ever tried.

384
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,433
We're all going to die.

385
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,230
But at least we die together.

386
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,694
Let's get some rest.

387
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,453
Your Grace.

388
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,595
Do you need help?

389
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,722
No.

390
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,474
You've had a strange journey.

391
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:10,601
Stranger than most.

392
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,397
I'd like to hear about it.

393
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,569
It's a long story.

394
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,654
If only we were trapped
in a castle...

395
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,158
in the middle of winter,
with nowhere to go.

396
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,349
Hello.

397
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,297
When Daenerys takes her throne...

398
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,040
there will be no place for us here.

399
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,794
I am loyal to my queen.

400
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,880
I will fight for her
until her enemies are defeated,

401
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:24,634
but when the war is over
and she has won...

402
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,515
do you want to grow old
in this place?

403
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,603
Is there nothing else you want to do,

404
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,730
nothing else you want to see?

405
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:40,942
Naath.

406
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,153
I'd like to see the beaches again.

407
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,325
Then I will take you there.

408
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,035
My people are peaceful.

409
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,080
We cannot protect ourselves.

410
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,833
My people are not peaceful.

411
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,293
We will protect you.

412
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,770
Have you told her yet?

413
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,983
No.

414
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,527
Mmm-hmm.

415
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:26,904
Being careful.

416
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,451
Biding your time.

417
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,496
Waiting for the perfect...

418
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,510
And now our watch begins.

419
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,892
Gilly? Little Sam?

420
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,563
They'll be safe down in the crypt.

421
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,649
If you want to join them...

422
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,156
To protect them.

423
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:13,051
Everyone seems to forget that I was
the first man to kill a White Walker.

424
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,411
- I've killed Thenns.
- Thenn.

425
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:16,787
I've saved Gilly more than once.

426
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,916
I stole a considerable number
of books from the Citadel library,

427
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,792
survived the Fist of the First Men.

428
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,795
You need me out there.

429
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,381
Well, if that's what it's come to,
we really are

430
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,176
Well, calling you,
wouldn't be strictly accurate.

431
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,015
Samwell Tarly.

432
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,851
Slayer of White Walkers.

433
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,436
Lover of Ladies.

434
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:44,607
As if we needed any more signs
the world was ending.

435
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,611
Think back to where we started.

436
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,492
Us, Grenn, Pyp.

437
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,828
Now it's just us three.

438
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,541
Last man left, burn the rest of us.

439
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,420
I wish Father were here.

440
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,854
I would love to see
the look on his face

441
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:27,900
when he realizes his two sons are
about to die defending Winterfell.

442
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,282
That would be something to see.

443
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:44,041
I remember the first time
we were here,

444
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,835
the first time I saw this hall.

445
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,546
- Mmm.
- You were a golden lion.

446
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,632
I was a drunken whoremonger.

447
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,759
It was all so simple.

448
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,179
It wasn't so simple.

449
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:01,642
I was sleeping with my sister
and you had one friend in the world

450
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,603
who was sleeping with his sister.

451
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,313
I was speaking in relative terms.

452
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:09,734
- Do you miss it?
- Of course I miss it.

453
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,571
Well, my golden-lion days are done,

454
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,198
but mongering
is still an option for you.

455
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,326
It's not.

456
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,204
Things would be easier if it were.

457
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,460
The perils of self-betterment.

458
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,343
Oh!

459
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,761
My lady.

460
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,596
Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

461
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,439
We were just looking for
somewhere warm to...

462
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:44,518
To contemplate your imminent death.
You've come to the right place.

463
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,021
You want some of this piss?
It's not bad.

464
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,448
- It's not good either.
- Thank you, my lord.

465
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,359
I don't think that's wise.

466
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,985
The battle might start at any moment.

467
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:57,740
Half cup.

468
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,078
- And you?
- No, thank you.

469
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,496
I should try and get some sleep.

470
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,332
You really think any of us
are going to sleep tonight?

471
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,959
Join us.

472
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,129
All right.

473
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,547
Just a bit.

474
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,740
Well, what do we have here?

475
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:22,973
Ser Davos, join us.

476
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,183
No, none for me, thanks.

477
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,768
Came here for this.

478
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:31,190
I figured I could wait to die
freezing my balls off out there

479
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,984
or wait to die nice and warm in here.

480
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:40,157
It could be our last night
in this world, you know.

481
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,577
Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

482
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,372
Here fighting with us.

483
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,416
Glad you survived Eastwatch.

484
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,000
Would you like a drink?

485
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,128
Brought my own.

486
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,303
They call you "King Killer."

487
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,181
I'm sure someone does.

488
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,309
They call me "Giantsbane."

489
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,687
Want to know why?

490
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:23,075
I killed a giant when I was 10.

491
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:28,748
Then I climbed right into bed
with his wife.

492
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,544
When she woke up,
you know what she did?

493
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:41,635
Suckled me at her teat
for three months.

494
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,345
Thought I was her baby.

495
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,474
That's how I got so strong.

496
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:49,602
Giant's milk.

497
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,034
Mmm.

498
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,915
Maybe I will have that drink.

499
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:52,289
You never used to shut up. Now you're
just sitting there like a mute.

500
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:56,961
Guess I've changed.

501
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,721
What are you doing up here?

502
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,765
What's it look like?

503
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,601
No, I mean,
what are you doing up here?

504
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:16,897
You joined the Brotherhood.

505
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,775
You went beyond the Wall with Jon.
You're here now. Why?

506
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,780
When was the last time
you fought for anyone but yourself?

507
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,077
I fought for you, didn't I?

508
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:42,464
Oh.

509
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,216
May as well be at a bloody wedding.

510
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,679
My lady.

511
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,055
It's good to see you again.

512
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,225
I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

513
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,020
Was he on your list?

514
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,272
For a little while.

515
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,649
That's all right.

516
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,112
The Lord of Light
has brought us together all the same.

517
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,575
This is his moment.

518
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,702
- When light...
- Thoros isn't here anymore,

519
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,704
so I hope you're not
about to give a sermon.

520
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,457
Because if you are,

521
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,209
the Lord of Light's gonna wonder
why he brought you back 19 times

522
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:22,046
just to watch you die when
I chuck you over this wall.

523
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:37,811
Where are you going?

524
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,983
I'm not spending my final hours
with you two miserable old shits.

525
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,367
Hmm.

526
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,509
That for me?

527
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,108
This'll work.

528
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:30,990
Last time you saw me,
you wanted me to come to Winterfell.

529
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,659
Mmm. Took the long road, but...

530
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,496
What did the Red Woman want with you?

531
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,545
She wanted my blood
for some kind of spell.

532
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:47,047
Why your blood?

533
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,300
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

534
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:53,846
I didn't know until she told me.

535
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:57,766
She tied me up, stripped me down,
put leeches all over me.

536
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,521
Was that your first time?

537
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,941
No, yeah, I've never had leeches
put all over my

538
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:07,943
Your first time with a woman.

539
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,069
What?

540
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,573
I... I didn't... I wasn't with her.

541
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,533
Were you with other girls before that

542
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,076
in King's Landing?

543
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,202
Or after?

544
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,375
You don't remember?

545
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,171
- Yes, I was.
- One?

546
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,798
Two?

547
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:32,009
- Twenty?
- Well, I didn't keep count.

548
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,262
Yes, you did.

549
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:39,600
Three.

550
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,941
We're probably going to die soon.

551
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,614
I want to know what it's like
before that happens.

552
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,330
Arya, I...

553
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,660
I'm not the Red Woman.

554
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,411
Take your own bloody pants off.

555
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,397
It's strange, isn't it?

556
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:14,027
Almost everyone here's fought
the Starks

557
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:16,446
at one time or another.

558
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:20,868
And here we are in their castle,
ready to defend it.

559
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,202
Together.

560
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,040
At least we'll die with honour.

561
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,590
I think we might live.

562
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,720
I... I do.

563
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,057
How many battles
have we survived between us?

564
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:46,685
Ser Davos Seaworth.

565
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:51,899
Survivor of both the Blackwater
and the Battle of the Bastards.

566
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:54,276
All without a shred
of combat ability.

567
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,360
Mmm.

568
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:59,239
Ser Jaime Lannister,
fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.

569
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,783
Fabled loser
of the Battle of Whispering Wood.

570
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:02,910
Hear, hear!

571
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:05,913
Ser Brienne of Tarth.

572
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,998
Defeated the Hound in...

573
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,376
Pardon me, Lady Brienne.

574
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,462
She's not a ser?

575
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,630
You're not a knight?

576
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:17,507
Women can't be knights.

577
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:19,551
- Why not?
- Tradition.

578
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:20,719
Tradition.

579
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,931
I don't even want to be a knight.

580
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:29,853
I'm no king.

581
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:31,730
But if I were,

582
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,483
I'd knight you 10 times over.

583
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,153
You don't need a king.

584
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:42,199
Any knight can make another knight.

585
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:48,247
I'll prove it.

586
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,002
Kneel, Lady Brienne.

587
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,940
Do you want to be
a knight or not?

588
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,306
Kneel.

589
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:01,028
In the name of the Warrior,

590
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,822
I charge you to be brave.

591
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,993
In the name of the Father,

592
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,288
I charge you to be just.

593
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:15,876
In the name of the Mother,

594
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,546
I charge you to defend the innocent.

595
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,807
Arise, Brienne of Tarth...

596
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,644
a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

597
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,705
Ser Brienne of Tarth!

598
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,958
Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

599
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,720
We have all we need
to win this war.

600
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:11,556
I have trained my men,
women and children.

601
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,475
I have fought before.
I can fight again.

602
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,770
Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

603
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,231
I don't need you
to remind me of that.

604
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:21,793
You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting...

605
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,402
I will not hide underground.

606
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:26,822
I pledged to fight for the North,
and I will fight.

607
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,591
I'm meant to relieve you.
You got it?

608
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,450
Yeah, I got it.

609
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,913
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

610
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,081
It's all right.

611
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:38,708
We're done here.

612
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,591
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

613
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,886
Thank you, my lady.

614
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,973
- My lady.
- My lady.

615
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,478
What have you got there?

616
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:01,523
It's called Heartsbane.

617
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:04,901
It's my family sword.

618
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,653
You still have a family.

619
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,574
Yes. And I'd love
to defend them with it.

620
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,453
But I can't really hold it upright.

621
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:20,459
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

622
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,211
How to do what's right.

623
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:26,923
This is right.

624
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,346
It's Valyrian steel.

625
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,641
I'd be honoured if you'd take it.

626
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:51,823
I'll wield it in his memory...

627
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,038
to guard the realms of men.

628
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,918
I'll see you when it's through.

629
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:16,598
I hope we win.

630
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,693
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.

631
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:30,070
We're out of wine.

632
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,786
How about a song?

633
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,997
One of you must know one.

634
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,834
- Ser Davos?
- You'll pray for a quick death.

635
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:50,090
Ser Brienne?

636
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:58,598
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm.

637
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,939
<i>High in the halls
Of the kings who are gone</i>

638
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:11,319
<i>Jenny would dance with her ghosts</i>

639
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:16,992
<i>The ones she had lost
And the ones she had found</i>

640
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:21,121
<i>And the ones
Who had loved her the most</i>

641
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:27,836
<i>The ones who'd been gone
For so very long</i>

642
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:32,215
<i>She couldn't remember their names</i>

643
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:38,763
<i>They spun her around
On the damp old stones</i>

644
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:43,810
<i>Spun away all her sorrow and pain</i>

645
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:49,232
<i>And she never wanted to leave</i>

646
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:55,488
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

647
00:51:55,572 --> 00:52:00,535
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

648
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:05,081
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

649
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:11,463
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

650
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:17,469
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

651
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:02,097
Who's that?

652
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,268
Lyanna Stark.

653
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,112
My brother Rhaegar...

654
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:24,244
everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

655
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:25,578
He liked to sing.

656
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:28,873
Gave money to poor children.

657
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,044
And he raped her.

658
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,172
He didn't.

659
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:41,219
He loved her.

660
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:50,061
They were married in secret.

661
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,357
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,
she had a son.

662
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:59,070
Robert would have murdered the baby
if he ever found out,

663
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,238
and Lyanna knew it.

664
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:03,616
So the last thing she did...

665
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,287
as she bled to death
on her birthing bed

666
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,247
was give the boy to her brother...

667
00:54:10,874 --> 00:54:11,916
Ned Stark...

668
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,837
to raise as his bastard.

669
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:20,508
My name...

670
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:24,512
my real name...

671
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,434
is Aegon Targaryen.

672
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,397
- That's impossible.
- I wish it were.

673
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,233
Who told you this?

674
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:39,319
Bran.

675
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,530
- He saw it.
- He saw it?

676
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:44,365
And Samwell confirmed it.

677
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,410
He read about their marriage
at the Citadel

678
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:49,078
without even knowing what it meant.

679
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:52,415
A secret no one in the world knew...

680
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,419
except your brother
and your best friend.

681
00:54:57,921 --> 00:54:59,088
Doesn't seem strange to you?

682
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,176
It's true, Dany.

683
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,137
I know it is.

684
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:13,144
If it were true,

685
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:17,065
it would make you the last male heir
of House Targaryen.

686
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:24,113
You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

687
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,876
Form up!

688
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,964
Get yourselves back!

689
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:46,529
<i>High in the halls
Of the kings who are gone</i>

690
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:51,868
<i>Jenny would dance with her ghosts</i>

691
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:54,746
<i>The ones she had lost</i>

692
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:59,083
<i>And the ones she had found</i>

693
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:05,173
<i>And the ones
Who had loved her the most</i>

694
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,889
<i>The ones who'd been gone
For so very long</i>

695
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:18,186
<i>She couldn't remember their names</i>

696
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:24,609
<i>They spun her around
On the damp old stones</i>

697
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:29,781
<i>Spun away all her sorrow and pain</i>

698
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:35,787
<i>And she never wanted to leave</i>

699
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:41,542
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

700
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:47,423
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>

701
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:52,220
<i>Never wanted to leave</i>
