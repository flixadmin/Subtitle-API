1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,261
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,180
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,137
But secretly with the help of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,190
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,647
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,321
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,446
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,699
I am The Flash.

9
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,489
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:35,918
There is indeed a hole in our universe
which leads to his Earth.

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,215
Meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

12
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:44,261
Do you think we've reached
the goodnight-kiss stage?

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,097
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,975
He has been sending
meta-humans from your world

15
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,677
through the breaches to fight me.

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,725
Her name is Dr. Light.

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,976
Hello, gorgeous.

18
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,185
What do you want from me?

19
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,229
Your life.

20
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:01,978
I saw myself.

21
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,780
It sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

22
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,278
Where are you?

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,948
I'm right here.

24
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,784
I'm here to kill you, Flash.
So get ready to fry.

25
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:18,540
Bring it on.

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,995
Hmm.

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,978
Told you.

28
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,944
Zoom always wins.

29
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:57,371
Zoom sent me here to kill you.

30
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,536
But I didn't want to.

31
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,629
But you were fine with killing Linda Park.

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,754
It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

33
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:10,014
Leave her body for Zoom to find.
He'd think I was dead and I'd be free.

34
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,266
How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

35
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,306
Just let me go.

36
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,645
Let me disappear.

37
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,191
You would spend the rest of your life
looking over your shoulder,

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,893
never knowing when Zoom is coming.

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,147
Okay.

40
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,437
And what's your great idea?

41
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,524
How were you supposed to contact him
after you killed me?

42
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,700
I was supposed to get something.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,204
Something I could only get
if you were dead.

44
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,076
And then throw it through
the breach as proof.

45
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,537
And then what?

46
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,668
Then he'd come for me.
Confirm the kill and bring me home.

47
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,621
- Why do you want to know?
- Because I want to find him.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,876
You really don't.

49
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,290
He's gonna keep coming for me.

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,635
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like
you, forcing them to do what he wants.

51
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,057
I have to stop him before more people die.

52
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,675
You can't stop Zoom.

53
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,058
Yes I can. I will. But I need your help.

54
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,853
Zoom wants Dr. Light to send him
your new emblem?

55
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,653
Yes. We need it for bait.

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,984
If we can get Dr. Light to take
my emblem, throw it through the breach,

57
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,036
then Zoom will come to collect my body
and we can trap him.

58
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,034
You know it took a lot of work
to make that emblem, right?

59
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,491
This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

60
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,954
in order to escape Zoom, but now
she's willing to help us catch him?

61
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,377
She knows it's the only way.

62
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:29,710
Before I left Earth-2, lworked on a
serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

63
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,138
All we would need is for Ramon
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

64
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:35,635
Oh, great, that could be
this year's cold gun.

65
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,593
Maybe another criminal can get it
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

66
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,725
I would never let that happen.
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,105
Are we forgetting how much more powerful
than Barry Zoom seems to be?

68
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,981
I mean, if Barry can catch bullets,

69
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,405
what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

70
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:53,824
Surprise, the element of surprise.

71
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,746
All we would do is rig a projectile to
fire as Zoom crosses into the breach.

72
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,788
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

73
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,120
That's great - Thanks.

74
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,955
Joe, voice of reason here?

75
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,960
We need a plan, that's as good as any.
As long as he can deliver.

76
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,340
Don't underestimate me, Detective.

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,633
Oh.

78
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,805
Patty needs us back at the station.
I'll meet you there, all right?

79
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,773
Are you just forgetting everything Jay
told us and supporting Wells now?

80
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,475
Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

81
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,935
I just want to see what he's up to.

82
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,019
I figure, we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

83
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,230
Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

84
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:36,526
Look, my hunch after interrogating
suspects all these years,

85
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,615
something's not right with this dude.

86
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,617
Barry told me about this thing you can do?

87
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,829
- Oh, God.
- Vibing.

88
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,038
Just relax.

89
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,454
Can you do it with Wells?

90
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,750
I can try.

91
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,016
Incapable?
Well, let me tell you something.

92
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,846
If you're
incapable of aligning the quantum helix,

93
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,524
and by the way, the sole purpose
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

94
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,858
could you save me some time and effort,

95
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,029
could you go out there and find someone
who can actually do your job for you?

96
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,240
There it is.

97
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:18,906
Work voice.

98
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,531
When I was little, and you used
to bring me to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,831
it used to freak me out,

100
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,910
how differently you talked here
than when you're at home.

101
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,004
You and your mother, both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

102
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,668
I graduated high school
when I was 15, Dad.

103
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,170
Right.

104
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,547
I can miss a day of college.

105
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,675
Ah, that's my Jess, always so quick.

106
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,386
So?

107
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,137
So.

108
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,433
Is it true?

109
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,600
Is what true?

110
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,855
What The Flash said about you
at the press conference,

111
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,187
that your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

112
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,072
- It is... Jesse...
- Look, why didn't you just tell me?

113
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,406
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

114
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,161
is much faster at assigning blame
than he is at actual heroics.

115
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,367
- Dad, The Flash is a hero.
- Uh-huh.

116
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,750
Hey, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much.

117
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,958
But now I know it's because he knew
what you'd done.

118
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,384
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs
is change the world, Jesse.

119
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,555
Unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

120
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:23,177
And when you don't have
the key to the lock,

121
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,968
Sometimes you have to kick in the door.

122
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,435
You should get to school.

123
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,685
Don't worry. I got my education today.

124
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,074
You're myjoy, Jesse Quick.

125
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,336
- All right. Talk to you later.
- See you, Joe.

126
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,047
Great, you're here.

127
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,377
Good morning to you too, Patty.

128
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,629
Yes, I was up all night
working on the Dr. Light case.

129
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,461
I've been trying to anticipate
all the powers she might throw our way,

130
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,048
you know, on the premise
that she can manipulate light energy.

131
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,552
- I appreciate it, but...
- Did you know

132
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,055
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

133
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,810
I mean, that doesn't even
sound like a thing, but it is.

134
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,016
- Seriously, Patty...
- No,

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,853
and on the other end of the spectrum
is invisibility.

136
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,899
Look, it's just hypothetical,
but I think that...

137
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,603
The Dr. Light case is closed.

138
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,237
Oh. Uh...

139
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,028
Okay, can you tell me why?

140
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,201
No.

141
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,283
No?

142
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,204
- Okay.
- Hey.

143
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,910
- Hi.
- Are you good?

144
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,292
Yeah. I'm fine, your dad just shut me down
in a big way.

145
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,043
What do you mean?

146
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:42,755
I don't know, it just... You don't think
it's because you and I kissed?

147
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,720
No, I don't think he knows.
I didn't say anything.

148
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,634
But I can talk to him if you want.

149
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,139
No, no, no. I'll talk to him.

150
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,096
You know, he's my partner,
we should have trust and communication.

151
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,978
Are you sure?
I don't mind talking about that kiss.

152
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,228
It was a good kiss.

153
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,819
Yeah, yeah. Although, the memory,
it's a little foggy.

154
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,947
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

155
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,822
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

156
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,824
Okay.

157
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,589
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,754
Have you had any word from The Flash
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

159
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,507
No. Not yet.
But I know he's working on it.

160
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,009
You know, maybe I could talk to him.

161
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,892
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

162
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,687
Look, Larkin is dead,
which makes it really hard for me

163
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,484
to concentrate
on field goals and doping scandals.

164
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,734
I don't want to sit around being told not
to worry my pretty little head about it.

165
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,698
I get that. Believe me, I do.

166
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,118
Then tell him lwant to help. Please.

167
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,033
I can't let this woman who looks like me
hurt anyone else.

168
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:55,661
I'll ask again. But trust me,
Flash has everything under control.

169
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:05,841
Crap.

170
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,197
Dr. Light's gone invisible!

171
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,448
Lock the doors!

172
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,534
Shut the doors!

173
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:38,168
The door is not responding. None of
the security protocols are responding.

174
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,000
She's hacked the system.

175
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,664
Barry, Dr. Light is escaping!

176
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:48,671
Where is she?

177
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,267
Dr. Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

178
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,854
The whole building runs on fiber optics
that operate on pulses of light.

179
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,565
So, she turned off the dampeners
and used her power.

180
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,865
I told you how dangerous she was.

181
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,363
You should've listened to me
and sedated her.

182
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,614
I thought I had convinced her

183
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,991
that helping us was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

184
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,243
- Well, you thought wrong.
- Yeah.

185
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,744
Okay, look. Dr. Light is gone.

186
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,081
So, instead of assigning blame, let's try
to figure out what we're going to do next.

187
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,870
Do you think she's going to try
and take Linda again?

188
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,923
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,
just in case, to keep an eye on her.

189
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,750
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

190
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,255
I think we isolated the composite.

191
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,678
And we're modifying the dart
the Arrow used to take down Wells.

192
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,722
He's not Wells, I'm Wells.

193
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,971
Whatever, Harry.

194
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,596
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

195
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,432
Until we try it, no.
This will be a field test.

196
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,144
So, can we end this scintillating
staff meeting and get back to work?

197
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:41,600
Or how 'bout I say
what everybody's thinking.

198
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,559
Maybe it's a good thing
that Dr. Light is gone.

199
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,520
Maybe it's the universe stopping us
from doing something really stupid.

200
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:51,075
No. No. Keep going. I'm gonna figure out
another way to get Zoom.

201
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,572
Hey, slow your roll. I wanna talk to you.

202
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,533
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

203
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,368
Okay, I don't.
So why don't you clue me in?

204
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,171
I'm trying to stop Zoom.
I thought you were on board with that.

205
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,623
I'm keeping my options open.

206
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,379
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

207
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,005
Zoom wants me dead.

208
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,677
The meta-humans
that he's sending from Earth-2,

209
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,552
they don't care
how many innocent people get in the way.

210
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,677
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

211
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,976
He was just collateral damage
in Zoom's war.

212
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,100
The next time, that could be you, or Iris.

213
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,023
I'm just wondering
if going after him now is premature.

214
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:23,941
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

215
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,147
Wells does.

216
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,562
You're putting a whole lot of faith
in the man

217
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,361
wearing the face of your mother's killer.

218
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,696
I think we should find Jay,
get him to help us on this.

219
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,364
Nah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't wanna help get me killed.

220
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,621
And we can't just sit around and wait
for Zoom to make his next move anymore.

221
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,244
We can't.

222
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,746
Aren't you the one who told me
life isn't about playing defense?

223
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,169
Sometimes the only way to succeed
is by working the offense?

224
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,048
I think at the time we were talking about
your high school football tryouts.

225
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,674
You said you'd never bring that up again.

226
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,428
Hey.

227
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,514
I just wanted to say,
using the, uh, tungsten composite

228
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:06,692
to dampen vibrations,
that was... It's pretty brilliant.

229
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,027
What are you doing?

230
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,692
I'm congratulating you.

231
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't touch me.

232
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,822
Wow! Try to give a guy a compliment...

233
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,034
You're not trying to give me a compliment.

234
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,417
You're trying to meddle into things
that are none of your business.

235
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,750
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

236
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,828
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

237
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,047
God. Why? What's there to vibe on?

238
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,549
Don't touch me.
If you have questions, ask them.

239
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,423
Otherwise, stay away from me.

240
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,315
So?

241
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,687
God.

242
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,946
You'd think the serial killer version
would've been the biggerjerk.

243
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,235
Uh, what happened when you touched him?
What did you see?

244
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,445
Oh, I didn't see anything.

245
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,653
Well, go touch him again.

246
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,697
No. He's onto me now.

247
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:02,244
Well, you have to keep trying.
I mean, I think Joe's right.

248
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,870
Something must have happened between
Wells and Zoom that made this personal.

249
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,509
The hero of
Starling City, formerly known as The Hood,

250
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,638
has been unmasked
as billionaire Robert Queen.

251
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,062
Robert was marooned on an island
when his boat went down in the Pacific,

252
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,186
an accident that ended
with the tragic death of his son, Oliver.

253
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,854
Robert Queen was thought dead when...

254
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,438
Excuse me, I'm receiving word...

255
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,106
There has been an attack
at Central City College.

256
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,283
The science building is the focus
of another meta-human attack.

257
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,201
We are just receiving video.
Please be advised.

258
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,283
We're being told that the footage
you are about to see is...

259
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,209
Hey, Jesse, it's Dad. Can you...

260
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,753
I, I Just... I saw on the news...

261
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,254
Just call me, all right? Let me know
that you're okay, that you weren't...

262
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,967
Witnesses report
that The Flash arrived on the scene,

263
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,389
but not before the hostile meta-human
escaped with a hostage, a female student.

264
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,092
We have not yet lD'd her
and there is no indication

265
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,394
as to why she has been
specifically targeted.

266
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,980
No.

267
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,596
Joe... Detective, can we talk for a minute?

268
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,054
If this is about Dr. Light...

269
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:45,350
No. Yeah. No. Uh, maybe.

270
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,302
But, okay, look, I think I figured out

271
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,355
why you've been a bit shut down
the last couple of days.

272
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,307
- Really?
- Yeah,

273
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,317
I feel like you're not being
completely transparent with me,

274
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,696
but I think that it's my fault.

275
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,490
Look, you're a great, excellent,
wonderful detective,

276
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,695
and I think you could sense I'm not being
completely transparent with you.

277
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,620
And you're right. Look, we're partners.

278
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,541
We need to be completely honest
with each other, no secrets.

279
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,413
- Patty?
- Barry and I kissed.

280
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,881
There's something
to being too transparent.

281
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,423
No. No, no, no, lthinkthat it's great.

282
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,846
Everything is just out there,
right out in the open.

283
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,017
Whatever you and Barry do in private,
is your own business.

284
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,886
Okay.

285
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,644
So, you're not mad at me?

286
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,227
I promise you, I could care less.

287
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,109
Great.

288
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,947
I feel so much better.

289
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,956
Is there anything, you know,
maybe you've been meaning to tell me?

290
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,494
We're partners,
totally transparent with each other.

291
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,000
Uh...

292
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,044
Nope.

293
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,841
Cool.

294
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,018
- Hey.
- Hey.

295
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,769
Are you guys having a dinner party?

296
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,020
You would think.

297
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,777
I know, I know.

298
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,609
It's just,
sometimes cooking helps me to relax.

299
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,282
Have you heard anything
about Dr. Light?

300
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,488
Am I still in danger?

301
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:25,947
Um, we're not really sure.

302
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,120
Come on, I'm going crazy here, Barry.

303
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,326
Yeah, she is.

304
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,493
That is the cake. Hope you're hungry.

305
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,837
She's not kidding. There's enough food
in there to feed an army.

306
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,381
She must be terrified.

307
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,385
Uh, more like furious.
Larkin died trying to protect her.

308
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:46,047
And it only makes it worse if the person
who did it looks just like her.

309
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,308
I mean, trust me, if Linda had
Dr. Light's powers right now...

310
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,892
What?

311
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,232
I just... Linda and Light,
they're identical,

312
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,605
so identical that Light even thought
she could fool Zoom.

313
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,321
And now we have Light's suit.

314
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,692
You don't have to say anything,
I know, it's a terrible idea.

315
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,152
No, no, no, it's not.

316
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,538
We make Zoom think
that Linda is Dr. Light

317
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,490
and use her to draw him out.

318
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,203
It's too dangerous, right?

319
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,035
Let Linda decide.

320
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,128
I mean, she's desperate
to catch the person

321
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,955
who's responsible for Larkin's death.

322
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,541
And she deserves the chance to help us.

323
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,422
Okay.

324
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,432
I still don't understand why we're here.

325
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,102
I thought your dad said
not to leave the house.

326
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,055
Someone wants to talk to you.

327
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,476
Who?

328
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,567
Ms. Park. I need your help.

329
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,066
Whoa!

330
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:56,993
Dude. How long
you been sitting on this?

331
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,453
It's important to have hobbies.

332
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,088
This is ridiculous.

333
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,263
No, it's not.
You look just like Dr. Light.

334
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,633
And with these gloves
that Cisco rigged up,

335
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,469
you'll be able to do what she does.

336
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,724
Don't worry, they are totally safe.

337
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,396
- Ish.
- "Ish"?

338
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:23,229
Oh, come on, it's gotta be believable,
so they really do fire and explode things.

339
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,564
And you are gonna have to
let her hit you with those blasts,

340
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,777
once she gets the hang of it.

341
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,409
Who exactly came up
with this terrible idea?

342
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,738
Okay, it's nota terrible idea.

343
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,572
The suit can absorb the blasts.

344
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,493
For real or "ish"?

345
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,201
What does a terrible idea
look like to you, Cisco?

346
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,414
Okay, you know what?

347
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,127
I like to think
I can see the bright side of things, okay?

348
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,840
Positivity, people.

349
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:52,765
All right, all right.
So, just hit the ones of me, okay?

350
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,346
- Got it.
- Great.

351
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:57,598
I'm Dr. Light.

352
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,101
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

353
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,146
Uh, you know what, I'm just gonna
adjust those a little. Screwdriver.

354
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,192
Coming! Coming. It's just...

355
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,864
Okay. So, um, do the opposite of that.
And we'll have it.

356
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,508
It's on fire!

357
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,519
Ooh, sorry.

358
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,643
My bad.

359
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,047
- I did it! Did you see that?
- Yeah.

360
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,431
Y'all good? You okay?

361
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,730
Sorry.

362
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,566
Okay. No offense to Linda,
but there is no way she can pull this off.

363
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,114
Well, maybe if she didn't scream
every time she fired.

364
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,488
Yep! Linda, had a rocky start,
but she can pull this off. I know she can.

365
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,278
All right, did you find someplace
near a breach

366
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,492
where we don't have to worry
about civilians getting in the way?

367
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,907
Yeah, there's a place by the docks
that's usually deserted at night.

368
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,496
Awesome. How are we doing
with the speed dampener?

369
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,327
My tests indicate that it should work.

370
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,380
It will work. I'll tune up Ramon's gloves,
make sure they work better.

371
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,627
Okay, great.

372
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,838
Hey, we're actually gonna go through
with this?

373
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,010
Yeah, we're doing this.
I'm gonna have Iris get Linda ready.

374
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,634
Yeah, I'll go talkto him.

375
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,518
Barry, hold up.

376
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,355
Hey. what?

377
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,477
You saw what happened in there.
Linda's not ready.

378
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,403
She is, she's ready enough.

379
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:12,692
Why are you pushing this?

380
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,615
Wait, why do you think? I want to get him.

381
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,907
Get who exactly?

382
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,611
Is that a real question?

383
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:22,288
You tell me.
I'm not sure this is even about Zoom.

384
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,663
It's starting to feel like
you're still chasing the Reverse Flash.

385
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,661
Reverse Flash is dead.

386
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,838
Yeah, but after all he did to you,
you weren't the one that stopped him.

387
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,382
We all worked together.

388
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,548
Yeah, and Eddie got him in the end.

389
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,344
I mean, did that make you feel cheated,
like you didn't get your revenge,

390
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,508
and stopping Zoom is the next best thing?

391
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,689
Look, all I'm saying is, if you're gonna
ask people like Linda to risk their lives,

392
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,017
you better be sure
of exactly why they're doing it.

393
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,583
Look, I'm sorry
I'm a terrible super-villain.

394
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,667
I don't need you to come here
and make me feel worse.

395
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,627
That's not why I'm here.

396
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:16,301
It doesn't matter. I... I can't do this.
I Just don't have it in me.

397
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,795
That's not true.

398
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,006
You're one of the strongest women
I've ever met.

399
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,260
You can do anything.

400
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,726
And you know that about me
based on what, exactly?

401
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,978
Linda,

402
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,106
you are trusting me.

403
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,519
So, I need to trust you, fully.

404
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,276
I know that you can do this...

405
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,661
Because I know you.

406
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,412
Holy crap.

407
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,923
I've made out with The Flash.

408
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:16,230
Listen, I Just want to bury the hatchet
and say thank you for all your work.

409
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,563
You're welcome.

410
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,903
Okay.

411
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,411
I think maybe the trigger mechanisms
are just sticking.

412
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,585
- I think it's just a little bit of...
- Lt's not the... Don't. No, it does not...

413
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,746
I'm just gonna
clean this up really quick.

414
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:35,797
- Do not touch me!
- I'm just trying to help!

415
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:54,855
I know Wells went to the other Earth. Why?

416
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,398
I don't know. I swear.

417
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:04,365
Your loyalty is admirable, Jesse.

418
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,997
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,132
Joe. Dr. Light.

420
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,807
- I thought we settled that.
- No, we didn't.

421
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,516
She's still out there on the loose.
A meta-human whojust murdered a man.

422
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,180
Why aren't we doing something about it?

423
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,773
Look, none of this makes any sense,
and you're not talking to me.

424
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,352
All right, all right, all right.
Look, it's a bit complicated,

425
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,354
but we're not going after Dr. Light
right now.

426
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,488
I need you to trust me, Patty,
for a few days or so.

427
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,823
Are you somehow involved in this?

428
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,575
If you're asking if I'm dirty, no.

429
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,750
But I need some time
to take care of some things.

430
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,625
Itrust you, I do.
I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't.

431
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,507
But this is about you not trusting me.

432
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,130
Patty, I trust you.

433
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,756
Not enough.

434
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,092
A few days?

435
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,931
- Hey.
- Hey.

436
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,308
Do you wanna maybe grab dinner tonight?
I could use your opinion about something.

437
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,190
- I can't tonight, I'm sorry.
- Sure.

438
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:25,820
Iwould. Joe and I actually... Joe and I
have a thing that we've got to do tonight.

439
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,446
Some other time.

440
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,077
Iwould much rather
be spending the evening with you.

441
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,657
Seriously, if I could cancel these plans,
I would.

442
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:35,742
But can we do dinner tomorrow?

443
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,290
Yeah. I would like that.

444
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,750
All right. I'll see you.

445
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:41,548
Uh, good luck with your thing.

446
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,630
Thanks. I think I'll need it.

447
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:02,944
I'm here to kill The Flash
and no one can stop me!

448
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,443
How's that?

449
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,196
Uh, it's a little too much.
Uh, stop messing with the earpiece.

450
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,778
Yeah, you don't want to dislodge it.

451
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,992
Right. You, you told me that. I'm sorry.

452
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,871
No, no. You're doing great, Linda.

453
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,588
All right, Dr. Light. Here I am.

454
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,416
But we're gonna skip the part
where you say you're gonna kill me

455
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,798
and go right to the part
where I don't let you.

456
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,174
I'm here to kill you, Flash.

457
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:31,301
Wait, what are you doing?
We're skipping that?

458
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,846
Yes.

459
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:40,066
I am loyal to Zoom, so get ready to fry.

460
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,814
Next time we're doing this,
I'm writing better dialogue.

461
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,190
"Next time"?

462
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,317
Uh...

463
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,824
Gotcha!

464
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,328
- Yeah, you did.
- Real good.

465
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,576
All right.

466
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,246
Bring it on.

467
00:26:58,407 --> 00:26:59,454
Hmm.

468
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,355
Told you.

469
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,191
Zoom always wins.

470
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:31,490
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

471
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:32,739
I had to make it look good.

472
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:39,666
Here it is, Zoom! I did what you wanted.
Now bring me home!

473
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,236
Come on. Come on, come on.

474
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:25,836
This is everything he wants, right?

475
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,963
Come on, Zoom.

476
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:34,846
Hey, stop fidgeting.

477
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,798
I'm sorry. It's been an hour and I landed

478
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,634
in a ridiculous position.
My foot fell asleep.

479
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,761
He's probably just waiting
to see if you're really dead.

480
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,938
Any minute now, he's gonna strike.

481
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:47,730
No.

482
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,201
I'm sorry. I probably screwed up somehow.

483
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,324
No, Linda, you did great.

484
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,256
So, Wells ain't taking this well.

485
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:10,877
- Mmm-hmm.
- How about you?

486
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,050
Yeah, it just sucks, you know.

487
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,884
But you were right, a little bit,
about this not being just about Zoom,

488
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,933
about it being about the Reverse Flash.

489
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,603
- Okay.
- But not for the reason that you think.

490
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,396
Not because I didn't beat him.

491
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,019
It's... Wells,

492
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,733
he said something to me on that video
before he confessed to my mom's murder.

493
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,567
He said that even if he was dead,

494
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,779
that he still won because I wasn't happy.

495
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,786
That I'd never really be happy.

496
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,574
How the hell would he know?

497
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,785
He knew me. He knows future me.

498
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:49,586
That's future you.
This is the you here and now.

499
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,289
I still think that Wells was right.

500
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,545
Ever since I went back to that night
and I didn't save her,

501
00:29:55,751 --> 00:30:00,007
I didn't save my mom, I Just...
There's just been this void in me.

502
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,934
You know, I Just feel like
that is always gonna be there.

503
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,979
For better or worse. Wells, he knew me.

504
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,143
Better than I know you?

505
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,396
He may have stalked you for 15 years,
but I raised you.

506
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,857
Look, Wells said what he said to you,
to mess with you.

507
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,409
To get in your head one last time.

508
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:22,157
If you listen to him, you let him win.

509
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,488
I know. I don't want that.

510
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,115
You're responsible
for your own happiness, Barry.

511
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,535
Forget about Wells.

512
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:32,080
Think hard about what you want
and what makes you happy.

513
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,343
Go out and get it. It's as simple as that.

514
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:39,471
- All right?
- Yeah.

515
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,771
And look at their eyes. Amazing.

516
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,352
- Good to see you guys.
- Bye, Patty.

517
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,151
Hey, have you seen this video
of babies' expressions

518
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,328
as they go through tunnels?
Their faces are priceless.

519
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,701
I'm not baby crazy or...

520
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,056
What did I do to deserve that?

521
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,137
I've just been thinking
about what makes me happy,

522
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,221
and getting to know you makes me happy.

523
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,223
We should do more of that then.

524
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,080
Hey.

525
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,496
You know, lwish I could have
kept the gloves. At least.

526
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,373
What would you have
done with them?

527
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,130
Raves. Duh.

528
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,961
That is not what you were thinking about.

529
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,923
I was thinking about a lot of things.

530
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:04,256
Like how everything that's happened to me
in the past few days,

531
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,432
is the best story I can never write.

532
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,384
Ooh. Tell me about it.

533
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,057
Do you ever get used to it?

534
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,266
Keeping a secret that big?

535
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,897
No.

536
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,644
It's pretty heavy.

537
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,487
I need a good night's sleep.

538
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:25,990
I'm gonna head out.

539
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,075
I'll see you tomorrow.

540
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,459
Oh, hey, if we're gonna
be The Flash's sidekicks,

541
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,502
we should probably
join CrossFit or something, you know?

542
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,332
- Oh. Yeah, girl.
- Yeah.

543
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,586
Bye.

544
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,689
Linda!

545
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,105
There you go.

546
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,365
It's like you think these things just grow
on trees or something.

547
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,534
And we threw away
the last one for nothing.

548
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:09,866
You have been going over this footage
dozens of times.

549
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,998
Everything went exactly according to plan.

550
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,538
If it had, Zoom would have shown up.

551
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:17,621
Maybe Light was wrong.
Maybe he can't see through the breaches,

552
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,297
or maybe he finally decided to give up.

553
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:25,511
Hey, Iris, slow down,
I can't understand you.

554
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:31,175
Zoom has Linda.

555
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:32,551
He's on the roof.

556
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,776
- Put her down.
- You like to fish with bait?

557
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,656
I do too.

558
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,837
You need to get out of here. Okay?

559
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,711
No. You can't fight that thing.
It's a monster.

560
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,967
Just go.

561
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:32,570
Zoom cannot be human.

562
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:34,371
He is. Or was.

563
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,574
How the hell is Barry
supposed to defeat that?

564
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,248
Why is he running away?

565
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,670
He's not. He's not scared.

566
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,931
Oh. He's gonna thunderbolt him.

567
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,306
- What?
- Jay taught him how to throw lightning.

568
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,905
Did you guys see that?

569
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:21,460
See him catch a bolt of lightning
with his demonic claws? Yeah, I saw that.

570
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,755
Jay was right. He cannot do this alone.

571
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,206
He's not alone.

572
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,715
Run, Barry.

573
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,260
No. I'm gonna see
if Wells' speed dampening serum works.

574
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:32,300
What do you want from me?

575
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,010
Everything.

576
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,266
You want to be me? Is that it?

577
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,518
You want to be a hero?

578
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,976
Heroes die.

579
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,648
Only if you can catch them.

580
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,489
How is Barry gonna match Zoom's speed?

581
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,244
Genius. He's not going to match it,

582
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,875
he's going to take it out of the equation
altogether.

583
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,418
- What are you talking about?
- Terminal velocity.

584
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,005
The highest velocity
attainable by a falling object.

585
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,581
- Falling through the air?
- Yeah.

586
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,840
Free-fall fight.

587
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,592
Their drag force
equals the downward force of gravity,

588
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,177
making the net force zero, making...

589
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,096
Equal velocities. That is genius.

590
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:48,253
Never forget. I am the fastest man alive.

591
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,380
He's killing him.

592
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:55,634
Barry.

593
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,061
You're next.

594
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:21,614
Look at your hero.

595
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,500
This man is no God.

596
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,001
He is nothing.

597
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,811
The days of The Flash protecting this city
are over.

598
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,516
- Hold your fire!
- Put him down!

599
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:53,313
Now, what will you do
without your precious hero?

600
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,148
Shoot that thing, now!

601
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,545
Nice try.

602
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,476
- Anything?
- No.

603
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,809
- Do you have him?
- No.

604
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,324
Barry.

605
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,826
Harrison Wells.

606
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:45,871
You thought you could defeat me with this?

607
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,583
I made a mistake.

608
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:54,840
Yes, a costly one.

609
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,427
Goodbye, Flash.
You too weren't fast enough.

610
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,744
No. No!

611
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:28,208
Stay with me. Stay with me, Barry.
Stay with me. Please, Barry. Please.

612
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:35,085
This is all you. If Barry dies, you die!

613
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,291
Joe! Barry's vitals have stabilized.
Let's let him go.

614
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,550
No, Caitlin.

615
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,632
Why? What good does that do for Barry?

616
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,971
It's gonna help me.

617
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,260
Joe, stop!

618
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:45,891
Who's Jesse?

619
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:48,559
How do...

620
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,474
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her. You've...

621
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,103
- You did vibe me.
- Yes.

622
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,393
What did you see?

623
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,481
I saw your daughter. She was with Zoom.

624
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:00,898
But she's alive?

625
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,568
Yeah.

626
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,954
Zoom sent you here like the others?

627
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,579
You kill The Flash
and you get your daughter back?

628
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,795
The only way I get my daughter back
is I capture Zoom.

629
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,668
Do you understand? You love Barry.

630
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,170
I love my daughter.

631
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,670
And none of these children are safe
as long as Zoom is here.

632
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,764
I tried on my Earth to capture him.

633
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,137
I failed.

634
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,514
I thought I could bring him down here

635
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,641
with Barry's help.

636
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:35,773
I was wrong.

637
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,034
Hey. I think he's waking up.

638
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,121
Barry.

639
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,454
Barry? Can you hear me?

640
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,128
Hey.

641
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:06,380
You scared the crap out of us.
You were gone for a long time.

642
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,298
How bad is it?

643
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,556
Bad.

644
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,521
If you didn't heal so quickly,
I'd be very worried.

645
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:15,681
Linda. How is she?

646
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,480
She's fine. She's staying out
with some friends out in Coast City.

647
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,070
Zoom?

648
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,574
Let's... Let's worry about Zoom
when you're up and about.

649
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,068
Okay?

650
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,570
Oh, no. You're staying put.

651
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,369
Yeah, seriously. You got your ass kicked.

652
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,413
No, guys.

653
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,331
I can't feel my legs.

654
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,916
I can't feel my legs.
