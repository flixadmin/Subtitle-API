2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,279
They've broken through the front lines!

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,794
I've lost contact with the capital!

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,314
There's too many of them!

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,590
Stand fast!

6
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,996
Finish them!

7
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,192
Where's B-127?

8
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,680
Sorry I'm late. I hit a little traffic.

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,758
Get down! Incoming!

10
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Optimus.

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,556
Decepticons, attack!

12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,915
Autobots, fall back! Get to the tower!

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,840
Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

14
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,635
Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,714
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,270
We must reach them if we hope to survive.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,795
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,436
We will fight on.
But we must find refuge first.

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,117
I found a planet
that's well hidden. Earth.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,034
You will travel there
and establish a base for us.

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,670
Once we've gathered the others,
we'll join you.

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,679
You must protect the planet.

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,512
If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.

24
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,075
Now go!

25
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,792
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
No!

27
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,354
Okay, okay!
I'm dead already, man!

28
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,874
Not just you.

29
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,336
Being the overachiever that you are,

30
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,320
you managed to get
your whole squad killed, Danny.

31
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Bravo.

32
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
- Come on, man. Those things sting.
- What things? These things?

33
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,760
You know, I wouldn't know.
I haven't been hit yet.

34
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,350
Okay, you know what?
That's too close, man.

35
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,760
You could've taken out an eye.

36
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,797
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,633
You're right. I'm sorry.

38
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,675
That one was on me.

39
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,558
That's a malfunctioning trigger.

40
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,554
This weapon is just faulty.
Someone is going to get a talking to...

41
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,676
Man, would you stop?

42
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,638
All right, just stop.

43
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,913
I should've let you die in Grenada.

44
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,936
If you did, we wouldn't be able
to come to the forest,

45
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,560
run around and play these awesome games.

46
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,910
Exactly.

47
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,834
I hate you.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,152
Wow, man, that hurts. 'Cause I love you.

49
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,994
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

50
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,896
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

51
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,515
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,553
Hey, yo, take cover!

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,840
Danny.

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
You okay?

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,440
Yeah, man.

56
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,914
This is Agent Jack Burns.

57
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,038
I need medical up here now.

58
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,315
We have a projectile strike

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,994
Multiple injuries.

61
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,072
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

62

What the hell hit us, then?

64
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,880
Target on your right!

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,073
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

66
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Drive!

67
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
There!

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
What the hell?

69
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,876
Take it down!

70
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,431
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

71
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
There it is!

72

Oh, no.

76
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,837
It's going for the mine! Cut it off!

Move, move!

78
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Please.

79
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,393
This is a mistake.

80
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,913
Stay cool. Hold your fire.

81
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,992
I don't want to hurt anyone.

82
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,910
Who called in the Air Force?

83
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,953
That's not the Air Force.

84
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Run.

85
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,759
Did you think you could hide?

86
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,472
Now you'll die screaming.

87
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
Like your friends!

88
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,476
Tell me where your friends are hiding.

89
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
I'll never talk.

90
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,039
Is that right?

91
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,759

Breakfast is conveniently located

- Yeah.
- ...a little.

122

making my own breakfast and what have you,

Charlie.

126

What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

127
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,996
perfect timing for a large cash gift.

128

You know, $500 is really all I need
to finish the Corvette.

129
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,191
I don't have $500.
You know how much nurses make.

130
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,516
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

131
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,920
Tell you what, kiddo...

132
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,480
I got another job interview tomorrow.

133

If all goes well,
I'll have you swimming in car parts.

I prefer cash, Ron.

Don't be rude. Feed the dog.

136

Can you drop your brother at karate

142

I could if I had a car.

143
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,437
Just let him follow you on your bike
so nobody abducts him.

144
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,752
Abducts him?
You just said he's a grown man now.

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,116
Hey, Uncle Hank.

173
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,510
Are you still working on that damn car?

174
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,593
You still working
on that damn personality?

175
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,671
- What have you got for me?
- Whatever you want.

176

Russians are gonna
blow us all to hell anyway.

177

That's the spirit.

178

Hey, kid.

179
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
Hand me the three-eighths, would you?

180

You working on the carburetor?

- You need the half-inch.

- Thanks, kid.
- Yep.

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,596
Where is Optimus Prime?
He survived the fall of Cybertron.

191
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,469
And no rebellion is truly dead
until the leader is vanquished.

192
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,190
So where is he?

193
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,236
My name is Cliffjumper,
lieutenant in the Autobot resistance.

194
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,552
My safe return will be considered...

195
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,633
Wrong answer.

196
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,074
We know he's planning to establish a base.

197
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,959
Tell us where it is
and we'll let you live.

198
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,680
My name is Cliffjumper, lieutenant...

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Sometimes you want to go...</i></Font>

No.

201
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,191
That's B-127's signal.

202
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,034
- Can you trace it?
- Already did.

203
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,238
If you won't tell us where Prime is,
perhaps your young friend will.

204
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,595
Never.

205
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,515
You're a brave warrior.
You deserve a better death.

206
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,994
But then again...

207
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,276
Set course for Earth.

208
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,120
I'll give you thirty bucks for all of it.

209
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,076
I can get twice that much
for the coil alone.

210
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,152
From who?
I'm the only one that comes in here.

211
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,879
I don't even know how you're still open.

212
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,236
Just take it. Go. My show is on.

213
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,439
Hey, where did you get that Beetle?

214
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,191
I swear to God, ever since
they put up that dumbass tower,

215
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,795
I can't get a signal to watch my shows.

216
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,837
I've got to see what happens
to Alf this week.

217
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,474
Come on!

218
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400

219
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,634

Happy birthday, baby.

I love you. Come on, open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

241
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
Thanks, Mom.

242
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,073
Helmet. With...

243
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Daffodils.

244
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,639
So, I keep hearing

245
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,629
about people on mopeds getting
run over and their brains smashed in.

246
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,399
You got to wear this from now on.

247
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,314
I don't care if it's not the law.
It's our law.

248
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,352
Plus, look how cute it is.

249
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Yeah.

250
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,439
Happy birthday.

251
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,440
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

252
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,794
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

253
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,312
A smile is a powerful thing.

254
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,880
It releases endorphins.

255
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,233
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

256
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,673
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often

257
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,280
actually have more friends.

258
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,270
That's unbelievable.

259
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,656
I really think
it's gonna change your whole outlook

260
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,796
if you smile more often.

261
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,640
I want the Beetle.

262
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,837
- What?
- The yellow Beetle, I want it.

263
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,296
I'll make you a deal.
If I get that thing started, it's mine.

264
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,154
That's no deal.
That's just you taking my car.

265
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,995
If I get it started, I keep it
and I work here every day for a year.

266
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,311
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

267
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,279
I will pick up and organize
every scrap of paper in this place.

268
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,957
I'll even detail your horrible,
disgusting toilets.

Please. It's my birthday.

270
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,280
Sorry, no deal.

271
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,319
'Cause we ain't hiring.

272
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,990
It's yours, kid. Happy birthday.

273
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Okay.

317
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Hi.

318
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,359
Oh, God, are you...

319
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,720
Do you speak?

320
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,674
I won't hurt you.

321
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,317
Can you understand me?

322
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,154
What are you?

323
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,553
Where did you come from?

324
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,314
Okay. It's okay.

325
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,874
You like my shirt?

326
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,035
You a metal fan?

327
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,910
No, wait...

328
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,513
Oh, who? Me?

329
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,795
Who am I?

330
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,796
I'm...

331
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,440
Charlie.

332
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,954
Charlie Watson.

333
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,952
I'm 18.

334
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,875
Today.

335
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,157
Actually, it's my birthday today.

336
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,430
What's your name?

337
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,270
You don't know
or you don't have a name?

338
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,351
You sound like a little bumblebee.

339
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,392
I'm gonna call you that from now on.

340
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,436
Bumblebee.

341
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,039
Matches your outfit, too.

342
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,160
I want a divorce, Roy!

343
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,477
Come on, Amber.
Give me one good reason.

344
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,392
You tried to sleep with my sister!

345
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,880
Unsuccessfully!

346
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,395
Yeah, you're unsuccessful at everything.

347
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,075
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

348
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,631
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

349
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,077
Now, just settle down for one second
and hear me out.

350
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,715
- What the hell is that?
- What?

351
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,679
Oh, God, Roy,
that thing is coming right for us!

352
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,399
No, no, no, no, no...

353
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,392
Not my car. Not my car.

354
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,676
Please, God, no, not my car!

355
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,632
Oh, thank God, my car.

356
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,720
Yeah, I'm okay.

357
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,999
That's good, baby. That's good.

358
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,753
Run. Run!

359
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,509
God!

360
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,554
Is that my car?

361
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,590
Hello...

362
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,116
Jeez!

363
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,520
Earth.

364
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,670
Roy!

365
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,193
How underwhelming.

366
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,432
The indigenous life is even more primitive
than I expected.

367
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Hey...

368
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,793
I like the way they pop.

369
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,234
Focus, comrade.

370
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,556
B-127's distress signal came
from the western coast of this continent.

371
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,554
For now, we head west.

372
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,116
When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

373
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,680
I don't know, but I hope soon.

374
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,275
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

375
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,352
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

376
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,880
Morning...

377
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,436
Bee?

378
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,794
Bee, where are you?

379
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,997
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

380
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Bee!

381
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,753
Where did you go?

382
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Otis!

383
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,194
Have you seen my car?

384
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,430
Unfortunately, yes.

385
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,673
No, have you seen my car today?
It was in the garage. Someone stole it!

386
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,513
No, idiot. Mom took it.

387
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,114
She had to bring Conan to the vet

388
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,056
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

389
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,719
and Ron needed the station wagon.

390
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,195
Thank God.

391
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,030
Wait.

392
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,792
Hi. Excuse me. It's me again.

393
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,016
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

394
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,269
Nope. Yep.

395
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,915
Okay.

396
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,632
I know, buddy. Hang in there.

397
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,152
You can't eat everything you see.

398
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,393
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

399
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,234
Oh, my God. Stop it! Don't do that!

400
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Bee, no!

401
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Mom?

402
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,916
Jesus! Charlie, what are you doing?

403
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,320
Mom, you gotta pull over.

404
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,279
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

405
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,034
Okay, okay. All right.

406
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,674
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

407
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,759
You almost gave me a heart attack.
I thought I was being carjacked.

408
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,593
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

409
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,594
I can't believe you would take him
without me. Mom, I'm so worried about him!

410
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,319
He's my dog, too, you know.

411
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,960
What happened to Conan being Otis's dog?

412
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,958
Mom, you're being hysterical, okay?

413
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,120
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

414
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,958
I know how you get during emergencies.

415
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,950
I'm a nurse.

416
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,120
Not of animals.

417
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,831
Okay. I'm happy for you to drive.

418
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,071
You weren't wearing your helmet,
by the way.

419
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,640
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

420
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,115
Keep it together, Bee.

421
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Sir?

422
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Sir.

423
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,551
I thought
you'd want to see this immediately.

424
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,313
- They sure?
- Yes, sir.

425
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,233
Two of them just made contact in Texas.

426
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,558
Intel says they're heading west fast.

427
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,280
Saddle up, Simmons.

428
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
We're going to Texas.

429
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,514
Okay, Bee,
we need to go over a few things.

430
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,199
Okay. We're all clear.

431
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,834
All right. I'm re-thinking the beach.

432
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,914
I'm good.

433
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,994
No, I'm good, thanks.

434
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,916
People can be terrible about things
they don't understand.

435
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,720
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

436
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,240
and cut you into tiny little pieces.

437
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,234
It'll be bad, trust me.

438
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,556
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

439
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,678
So let's practice. You ready?

440
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,952
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

441
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,471
Great. Perfect. Come back now.

442
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,474
Okay, so let's say we're driving
and all of a sudden...

443
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,075
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

444
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,914
You serious?

445
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,231
Bee, it's too late. You're already dead.

446
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,674
It's all right.

447
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,912
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

448
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,276
<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i></Font>

449
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,671
The goal, sir,
should be to communicate with them.

450
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,794
First contact with an alien species.

451
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,354
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

452
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,633
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

453
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,238
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

454
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,871
Not yet. B-127's signal has gone silent.

455
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,719
I have an idea.

456
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,517
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

457
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,351
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

458
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,034
So state your business.

459
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,233
People of Earth,

460
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,315
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

461
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,920
What are you doing?

462
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,079
This is humiliating.

463
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,672
We believe a dangerous criminal
from our world

464
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,832
is hiding somewhere on yours.

465
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,513
How is it you think we can help?

466
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,431
We need your eyes.

467
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,350
Wait.

468
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,797
You want access to our satellites?

469
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,271
Our scanners' range is limited.

470
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,672
Your infrastructure is primitive.

471
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,511
But combined,
they could be quite powerful.

472
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,234
No way! Out of the question!

473
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,199
We have a common enemy, Agent Burns.

474
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,716
There's a war raging on our planet.

475
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,431
If B-127 isn't found,
that war may find its way here.

476
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,880
Perhaps...

477
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,189
We can find a way to help one another.

478
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,637
We'll talk it over with our superiors.
In the meantime, if you could follow us.

479
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,270
Very well, friend Powell.

480
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,278
Take us to your leader.

481
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,834
Must suck being cooped up
in a VW all day, huh?

482
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,836
Is there anyone that can help you?

483
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,354
Do you have a family?

484
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,832
You know, like a mom, dad, siblings?
You all love each other?

485
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,800
Or drive each other crazy

486
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,600
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

487
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,593
Do you want me to see if I can fix it?

488
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,519
I'll be gentle, I promise.

489
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,920
You lay down, okay?

490
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,755
Hold still.

491
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,313
I think maybe there's something...

Who was that?

502
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,034
That voice said something about a war.

503
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,960
Do you remember anything?

504
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,475
Is the VW Beetle some kind of disguise?

505
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,713
Are you hiding from something?

506
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,189
Are you scared?

507
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,110
It's broken.

508
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,396
It's okay.

509
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,399
I think I can help.

510
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,640
Let's go home.

511

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Does that answer your question?</i></Font>

515
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,476
No way. Are you actually watching it?

No, no, why would you play this?

527
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,193
Sorry. I just...

528
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,356
I finished.

529
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,913
Let's see if we got something.

530
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,230
Okay.

531
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,910
Okay.

532
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,160
All right.

533
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,799
Oh, my God, yes!

534
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,594
It worked!

535
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,879
Look at you go.

536
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,039
You got some moves.

537
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,553
You know, Bee, music can help you
say what you're feeling.

538
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,394
You're gonna love this. It's brand new.

Okay.

543
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,830
Here.

544
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,840
Try this.

Fine.

547
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,232
Okay, where's my Stevie Nicks?

548
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,793
Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.

549
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Stones.

550
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,675
Hey, hey,
please don't touch those. Please.

551
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,317
They belonged to my dad.

552

Do you want to hear it?

553
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,515
We used to listen to this
while we'd work on the Corvette.

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Oh, my love,

555
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,599
It was his favorite.

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">I've hungered for your touch

it would make the car feel better.

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Time...</i></Font>

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">...goes by so slowly</i></Font>

560
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,280
We used to work on this car
every weekend together.

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">And time can do so much</i></Font>

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Are you still mine?</i></Font>

564

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">I need your love</i></Font>

566

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">I need your love</i></Font>

568

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">God speed your love to me</i></Font>

570
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,238
I never got to say goodbye.

571
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,595
You know,
I always thought if I could just

572
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,075
finish fixing this car...

573

<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea</i></Font>

574
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,837
If I could just get it
to start up again,

575
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,954
he would hear me.

576
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,073
He would hear me.

577
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,352
<i><Font color="#80FFFF">Oh, my love...</i></Font>

578
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,313
I say this with all due respect.

579
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,200
Have you lost your damn mind?

580
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,239
- That was with all due respect?
- The man's got a point, Doctor.

581
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,910
Our satellite network is at the forefront
of our national defense.

582
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,516
Sir, please. It could be
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

583
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,436
Can you imagine the advances an alliance
with these creatures might bring?

584
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,558
I imagine the advances.
An advance on Washington.

585
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,600
- New York. An advance on Chicago!
- That's not gonna happen.

586
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,354
They literally
call themselves "Decepticons."

587
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,920
That doesn't set off any red flags?

588
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,390
Enough! From both of you.

589
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,790
Sir,

590
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,279
we're talking about the most advanced
robotic system ever seen.

591
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,479
If we tell them no,

592
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,957
they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

593
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,197
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the Cold War?

594
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,876
Fine.

595
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,395
We'll help them find their fugitive.

596
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,713
And when it's done,

597
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,792
you can do all the experiments you want.

598
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,996
Yes, sir.

599
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,152
Gentle... Robots.

600
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,719
Welcome to Sector 7.

601
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,438
How kind of you to finally allow us in.

602
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,399
We're very happy
to have you here as friends.

603
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,437
Thank you, friend Powell.

604
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,514
My superior has agreed to grant you
limited access to our satellites.

605
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,835
In addition, you're welcome to use
all of our technology here.

606
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,913
It's the largest super-array
of Crays on Earth.

607
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,276
We thank you for your hospitality.

608
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,237
Tell me, those vocal communication
devices you use,

609
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,278
do they function worldwide?

610
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,114
The telephones? Yes, why?

611
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,194
You got to pick a station, man.
I know there's a lot of choices.

612
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,960
"You want to go on a date with me, maybe?"

613
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Okay.

614
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,240
What are you trying to do?

615
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,630
Here we go. Here we go.

616
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,680
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.

617
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,296
Okay, you're a nerd, but just
don't let her see that you're nerdy.

618
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,277
Excuse me. Sorry to barge in. I just...

619
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,070
Do you, just...

620
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,072
No, no, it's fine! Just...

621
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,233
Just sit down, please?
Don't scream, okay?

622
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,115
What is that?

623
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,873
It's okay, okay?
Just breathe. Breathe.

624
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,831
- First of all, hi.
- Hi.

625
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,074
I'm Charlie.

626
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,640
I'm Memo, hi.

627
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,029
Hi, Memo.

628
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,320
It's nice to meet you.

629
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,114
Pleasure... Pleasure...

630
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,637
Look, I know what you saw
was a little crazy. I can explain.

631
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,359
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

632
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,119
If you tell anyone what you just saw,

633
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,032
I'm gonna have to
run you over with my car.

That was...

636
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,953
I don't mean that in a mean way. Okay?
What I'm saying

637
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,591
is no one can know
what you just saw, okay?

638
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,790
You promise?

639
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Yeah.

640
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,596
Okay.

641

It's...

644

He.

645
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,071
He's been going up and down on that dial
all day today and I don't know why.

646
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,632
- Hey, check out his reflexes.
- What?

647
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,559
Oh, God!

648
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,794
Yo, give me your shirt.

649

Give me your shirt.

650

Yes, yes! Come on.
I'll give it back to you.

Okay.

All right.

Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, no, no! You don't need to do this.

656
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,675
- Yes, I do.
- No, but...

- No, I get it. I get it!

You've given them our satellites,
our comms, God knows what else.

678
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,278
Yet in the space of a day
they've given us a way

679
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,912
to not only hunt down B-127,
but all of them.

Let them find B-127.

And then I'll give you permission
to destroy them all.

No idea.

What are they gonna do, Memo?

They're just gonna send him away to a lab
and do weird science experiments on him.

You're an actual genius!

a gallon of lemonade on him once.

01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,549
Mom!

792
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,313
That was insane!

793
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,438
My heart right now is going crazy.

794
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,879
- Oh, God.
- Stop the car, please.

795
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,157
Bee, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

796
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,753
<i><Font color="#80FFFF">I can't drive 55!</i></Font>

797
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,280
Bumblebee!

798
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,279
<i><Font color="#80FFFF">I can't drive 55!</i></Font>

803
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,912
Oh, my God, we're committing a felony!

805
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,038
We got a yellow vehicle driving
its damn self through the Pico Tunnel.

809
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,480
Good night.

810
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,796
Good night.

811
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,994
Good night, Bee.

812
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,915
Morning, buddy.
I got to go to work, okay?

813
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,510
Bee. Listen to me.
You need to stay in this garage, okay?

814
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,798
After what happened last night, I'm pretty
sure the cops are looking for you,

815
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,520
and you don't exactly blend in.

816
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,273
I'll be back, all right?

817
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,076
Here.

818
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,674
You can have my Pop-Tart.

819
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:41,278
I need you to go to the
frozen banana stand and steal some sticks.

820
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,760
We're out of sticks.

821
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,196
Can't we just sell the hot dogs
without the sticks?

822
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
No.

823
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,396
What's happening here?

824
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,216
We got a hit, I think.
Where's that location?

825
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,517
Near San Francisco.
A coastal town named Brighton Falls.

826
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,357
You have a personal call.

827
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,992
- Hello?
<i><Font color="#80FFFF">- Charlie, hey, it's Memo.</i></Font>

828
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,551
You got to come home right now.

829
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,150
It's bad. It's really, really bad.

830
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,920
Where's Bumblebee?

831
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,191
Bumblebee, what have you done?

832
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,158
What were you thinking? What...

833
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,236
I told you to hide in the garage!

834
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,390
Great.

835
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,479
Helpful shame spiral, Bee.

836
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,871
I'm not mad, okay? This is all my fault.

837
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,953
I never should have left you.

838
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,637
Hey, okay, maybe don't transform
all the way?

839
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,871
We've still got
to get you through the door.

840
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,515
Come on, buddy.

841
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,829
It's okay.

842
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,440
I am so screwed.

843
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,600
And now you're crippled for life.

844
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,319
Honey, watch the hair.

845
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,000
Go. Now. But be quiet.

846
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,400
Mom, wait!

847
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,035
Oh, my God!

848
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,713
- Mom...
- What happened?

849
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,757
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

850
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,354
What'd you do to my TV?

851
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,990
Look, Mom, I can explain.
We will talk about this later, all right?

852
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,958
- Now, I have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

853
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,634
No. You're not going anywhere.

854
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,719
- It's about my car. It's really important.
- About your car?

855
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,840
That you spend all day and night shut
in that garage, doing God-knows-what with?

856
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,957
Mom, I can't. I really can't right now.

857
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,236
Oh, no, you really can, Charlie.

858
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,277
You really can.

859
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,400
I have had it!

860
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,200
Your attitude, your always sulking around.

861
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,757
You brought home that piece of crap
without even asking me!

862
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,799
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

863
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,315
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

864
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,312
You know, Mom,
just because you've moved on

865
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,154
and you're happy with your new life
doesn't mean I have!

866
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,635
You've found a replacement for my dad
and I haven't, okay, and I never will!

867
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,555
So I'm sorry if that makes things harder,
but in ten months from now

868
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,513
you won't even have to deal with me!

869
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,715
Charlie!

870
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,120
Hey, you okay?

871
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,956
Yeah.

872
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,797
I just feel like ever since my dad died,

873
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,839
I've become this drain on everyone,
and I hate it.

874
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,990
It's like everybody expects me
to act like nothing ever happened,

875
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,356
and it's impossible to do that.

876
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,798
About your dad, I'm really sorry.

877
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,476
Thanks.

878
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,080
You know, there's this quote that I like.

879
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,157
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

880
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,880
That's nice.

881
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,673
My mom got it from Weight Watchers.

882
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,235
Get out and move away from the vehicle.

883
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,994
Stay cool, Bee.

884
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,440
What's going on?

885
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,880
Hey!

886
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,440
- Come on!
- Stop it!

887
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,475
Let go of me!

888
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,991
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

889
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,913
No, don't run. Do not run!

890
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,840
She ran.

891
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,074
Please tell me they're on our side.

892
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,753
No more running.

893
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,799
No more hiding.

894
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,352
B-127, you're a traitor and a coward.

895
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,791
Tell us where Optimus Prime is hiding.

896
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,349
Bee, look out!

897
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,274
Why isn't he fighting back?

898
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,280
Why don't you fight?

899
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,154
Leave him alone! Please!

900
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,160
Again.

901
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,920
Hit it again!

902
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,960
Stop! Stop it!

903
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,440
Your daughter stole
government property, Mrs. Watson.

904
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,836
She's been having trouble adjusting,

905
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,480
but we had no idea it was this serious.

906
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,755
I...

907
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,160
Charlie. Honey.

908
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,960
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

909
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,720
- "He?"
- Ma'am.

910
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,235
I can assure you that it is an "it".

911
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,391
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

912
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,552
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

913
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,599
I don't know what he is, but...

914
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,274
He's my friend.

915
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,315
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

916
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,711
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

917
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,195
She's disoriented.

918
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,795
No, I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

919
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,600
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

920
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,871
Stop! Just go to your room.

921
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,952
When I was going through puberty,

922
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,959
I stole things, too.

923
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,160
- Stole a box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

924
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
Boom.

925
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,394
Caught you.

926
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,473
Mom's gonna love this.

927
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,279
Look, Otis, you need to go home and...

928
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,874
Mom!

929
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,754
No, Otis, stop it!
Why would you do that?

930
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,435
Let go of me!
You're touching my buttocks!

931
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,319
I will tell you a secret if you shut up.

932
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,315
Okay, so this is my room.

933
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,153
Just make yourself at home.

934
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,277
These are actually my sister's stuff.

935
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,159
She likes playing pranks,
like putting her stuff over here.

936
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,516
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah.

- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

948
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,076
I need someone reliable to make sure
that Mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.

949
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,960
I'm someone reliable.

950
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,075
Hell, yeah, you are.

951
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,229
Good luck.

952
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,990
You, too.

953
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,760
Get over here.

954
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,229
Let's do this.

955
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,913
Tell us where Optimus Prime
and the rebels are hiding,

956
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,714
and we can end this war.

957
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,040
Talk!

958
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,316
Who is Optimus Prime?

959
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,631
This doesn't concern you, human Powell.

960
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,237
Last chance.

961
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,279
Are you sure this is a good idea?

962
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,509
It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

963
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,920
You can't get... Well, why don't you...
Stop, stop, wait...

964
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,079
- How'd you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

965
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,029
Can I?

966
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,231
His memory cells are fried.

967
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,116
Finish him.

They're all coming here.

978

This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

Powell?

985
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,240
And thanks to our human allies,

986
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,630
I know just how to get the message home.

987
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,439

Thank you for your hospitality,

He's all yours.

992

01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,836
What, did she cut the wire to the TV?

01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,550
Ron.

997
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,995

Charlie!

Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

Where is your sister?

Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

1002
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,277
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

1003
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,596
What?

1004
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,354
Charlie has fallen ill

1005
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,194
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

1006
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,630
- She wishes not to...

1007
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,200
Are you on drugs?

1008
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,400
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.

1009
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,153
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

1010
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,277
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

1011
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,238
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

1012

1013

Otis?

1014
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,316
I found a tower to transmit our message.

1015
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:41,836
It's close.

1016
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,274
B-127. I almost forgot.

1017
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,680
I didn't.

1018
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,434
No! Don't shoot!

1019
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,476
No!

1020
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,390
Bee!

1021
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,360
Talk to me, Bee, talk to me.

1022
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,634
I can fix this. I can fix this.

1023
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,910
Charlie.

1024
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,993
You got to wake up, Bee.
You got to wake up.

1025
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,360
Please.

1026

Charlie, we got to go.

1027
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,869
- The gun.
- What?

1028
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,440
The electric gun. Get it.

1029

I can fix you.

1030

Come on, Bee.

Come back to me.

1032
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,519
Come on, give me the other one.

1033

Bee, come on.

I can't lose you, too, Bee.

1035

Please, Bee!

1036

I'm sorry.

Oh, my God.

Come on, Bee,
we've got to get you out of here.

1039
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,959
Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

1040
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,069
We got to move, now.

1041
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,360
Come on, Bee, you've gotta get up.
Can you get up?

1042
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,153
There's a door in my way.

1043
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,915
They've got bombs!

1044
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,434

1049

One.

1050
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,395

- Come on.

1051

Memo?

1052
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,873
Memo. Memo, wake up.

1053
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,960
Easy.

1054
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,080
Easy.

1055
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,120
Hold your fire!

1056
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,873

- No, stop!

1065
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,234
- Stop it!
- Contain it and dismantle it!

1066

Strip it down to parts!

1067

You lose that car,
I will personally rip your face off.

1111

- Charlie!
- Mom?

You pull that car over right this second.

1114
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,791
This is very unsafe, what you're doing.

Mom, you got to get out of here, okay?

Mom...

Is everyone okay?

1128
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,754
Ron! We have a kid in the car!

1129
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,594
I was trying to save the other kid!
What was I...

1130
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,274
It was a lose-lose.

1131

Otis? Otis, are you all right?

1132
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,638
That was radical.

Handle him! And finish the job this time!

1142

There. The one on the tower.
