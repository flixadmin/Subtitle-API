<i>A virus that kills Supes.</i>

34
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:14,465
<i>Somebody's been running tests.</i>

35
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:16,491
Holy shit.

36
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:17,575
Let's go.

37
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,202
Sameer, is the virus gone?

38
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,513
<i>That's the only dose.</i>

39
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:22,377
{\an8}So we inject it
into your dead buddy over here,

40
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:24,750
{\an8}to infect the crazy fucking flying sheep.

41
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,544
- Where's Sameer?
- We couldn't find Dr. Shah.

42
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,963
<i>She knew the difference
between right and wrong.</i>

43
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,089

<i>You set me up</i>

45
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:33,883
and you fell for it.

46
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:34,986
<i>What's your next step?</i>

47
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,346
<i>The world ripped down,

48
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,906
Jesus fucking Christ, are you serious?

49
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,848
Shh.

50
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:41,558
<i>We recently found a leak.</i>

51
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,602

I don't know what to do!

54
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,067
I love you so much.

55
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,738
<i>Some sins deserve
eternal damnation.</i>

56
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,448
I have committed murders.

57
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:58,533
We don't belong with decent people.

58
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,994
<i>We are monsters
so other people don't have to be.</i>

59
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:02,913
<i>You chopped off my fucking leg!</i>

60
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,539
You'll be back to work in no time.

61
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:05,933
- What work?
- You're gonna make us

62
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,959
some more of that virus.

63
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,677
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey, motherfucker.

64
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:22,349
Now listen up, son.

65
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,060
We been awfully patient with you...

66
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:29,564
...but it's time to stop fucking about
and get the job done.

67
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,569
Mary's little lamb is starting to stink.

68
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:38,240
I could just bash your fucking head in,
jog your memory.

69
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:43,328
Or, alternatively...

70
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,998
...you just give us a list
of what you need

71
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,708
to extract the virus.

72
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:52,170
You cut off my fucking leg,
you chain me here... For what?

73
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,925
Listen, mate.
I'm the only thing

74
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,387
that's standing between you
and a murderball game at the Y.

75
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,598
You don't understand, I can't.

76
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:05,684
I can't. Vicky, Zoe... I can't.

77
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:10,439
Could just send you
back to them in a fucking bucket,

78
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,315
you don't do whatever the fuck we say.

79
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:19,823
You all right?

80
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,582
Yeah, right as rain.

81
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,210
You got a week.

82
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:34,838
And make it strong enough
to top Homelander.

83
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,007
A week? This could take months!

84
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,216
A week.

85
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,388
Don't let him fall asleep this time.

86
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,938
To my right, your left,
is the famous Beresford Hotel

87
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:54,524
out of where Ralph Fiennes's
Chris Marshall pursued

88
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,612
JLo's maid Marisa, asking
if any part of their love was real.

89
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,429
You know, this has got to be
a health code violation.

90
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:04,868
It's what he wanted.

91
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,471
My God, did he love <i>Maid in Manhattan.</i>

92
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:09,623
- Man, that movie sucks.
- It's so bad.

93
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,166
- Right?
- It's so bad.

94
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,379
I just feel like
maybe I shouldn't leave, you know?

95
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:21,676
You know, you can call me anytime,
I can come in same day...

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,515
Yeah, but people back home really need
their Voughtality beauty care, right?

97
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,435
Really, I'm...

98
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,479
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

99
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,648
Yeah.

100
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,402
Is she okay?

101
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,279
Kimiko?
Our friend Frenchie

102
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,424
just turned himself in
for a bunch of murders he committed

103
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:45,075
for this Russian mob boss,

104
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,745
but Kimiko's upset that he didn't talk
to her about it first, so...

105
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,791
Who the fuck are your friends?

106
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,459
Abortion is murder!

107
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,670
Abortion is murder!

108
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,922
- Hey, fuck off, asshole!
- Hughie, Hughie...

109
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,316
Hey, stop, stop, please, please, please.

110
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,092
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.

111
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,819
- I'm sorry.
- I am so sorry, Daphne, I'm so sorry.

112
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,763
That man is a piece of shit, dear.

113
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,848
Folks, this way.

114
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:10,976
That's not part of the tour.

Inmate refused visitation.

120
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,338

our top story...

{\an8}are Jewish space lasers brainwashing you

Oh, shit.

00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:50,587
Listen, I can't do this shit anymore, man.

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,327
<i>- I'm done!</i>
- All right.

139
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,204
No one ever said this would be easy.

140
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,623
Think about your brother, your nephews...

141
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,166
They'd be so proud of you, man.

142
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,877
Who cares what my family thinks
if I'm already fucking dead?

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,504
Calm down.

144
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,547
<i>Now walk me through everything.</i>

145
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:08,134
And let's process
this shit together, all right?

146
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,345
This is so fucked!

147
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,681
So before Cameron got beaten to death,

148
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:15,600
Homelander was seen
putting Supes together like a...

149
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:16,726
An army.

150
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,977
Mm-hmm.

151
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:21,147
And then A-Train saw
Tek-Knight talking to Sage.

152
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,148
Looked like they were planning something...

153
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,650
You want to talk to Tek-Knight.

154
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:27,487
Now, he's having a Federalist Society
party tonight at his estate.

155
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,572
I cannot believe
that this is about

156
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,117
to come out of my mouth, but...

157
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:34,953
...we could use Butcher.

158
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,204
Have you heard from him?

159
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,081
Motherfucker's MIA.

160
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,541
Hey.

161
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,377
Maybe you should sit this out. You know?

162
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,796
You've just been through so much.
With your dad...

163
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,589
I'm fine.

164
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:50,093
Focusing on work is exactly
what I need to do right now, okay?

165
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,345
Just trust me.

166
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:53,513
Okay.

167
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:57,100
Okay. So, how are we supposed to sneak
into an alt-right cocktail party?

168
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,936
Thought you'd never ask.

169
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,105
Webweaver?

170
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,360
I know you.

171
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:09,654
Where's the limey?

172
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,616
Don't worry about all that.
I got your medicine.

173
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,621
Usually Beardy McBritish wants
some dirt in exchange, but...

174
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,415
I'm fresh out.

175
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:26,880
Unless there's another way I can pay?

176
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,339
Wink-wink.

177
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:31,718
On the house, for being a loyal CI.

178
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:43,146
Yo. I'm-I'm, I'm pretty fucked up, no cap.

179
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,398
Would you mind doing the honors?

180
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:46,482
Fuck you mean?

181
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:49,611
- Shoot it up my pooper, dawg.
- Motherfucker, you done lost your mind.

182
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:51,696
There's some lube on the table here.

183
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,323
Squeeze bottle, not the pump.

184
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,034
The blue one on the right.
With the water base.

185
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,410
No fucking way.

186
00:07:57,494 --> 00:08:00,914
A.G., A.G.

187
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,169
I'll boof that shit later.

188
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,421
<i>♪ Wild thing, wild thing... ♪</i>

189
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,131
<i>♪ She love to do...</i>

190
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,382
Fuck.

191
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:14,302
Oh, yeah, really get it up in there, dawg.

192
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,517
Oh, yo, yo!

193
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,101
- What?
- That's my web hole!

194
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,145
Ohh, back up, back it up, back it up.

195
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,064
Oh. Fuck.

196
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:28,900
- Oh. Fuck.
- Oh. Oh...

197
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:31,444
All right.

198
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,239
Ooh.

199
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,708
Oh. Yo. My bad.

200
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:49,128
Hey.

201
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,463
Uh...

202
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:51,840
You good?

203
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:54,467
Want some Purell or...?
Okay, yep. Coming in. Coming in.

204
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:55,885
There you go.

205
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,303
Okay.

206
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,014
Ain't enough Purell in the fucking world.

207
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:02,392
How, uh...
how long's he gonna be out for?

208
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,603
With as much Rohypnol I shot up his ass,
at least 48 hours.

209
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,981
Get his pants.

210
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,504
There's the big man!

211
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:35,133
The myth, the legend,
the symbol of America.

212
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,264
Please. We're all patriots here.

213
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,575
Good evening, sir. How are you?

214
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,601
This is Ryan, my son.

215
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,940
How's that gavel, Mr. Speaker?

216
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:55,028
Well, it, uh, might've taken
18 rounds of voting, but we got there,

217
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,279
didn't we?

218
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,780
You know, sir, it's humbling

219
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,490
to see your commitment to America.

220
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:01,451
Greatest country on Earth.

221
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,829
Can't wait to see you inherit
The Seven one of these days.

222
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,372
Those are mighty big boots to fill.

223
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,665
Yeah.

224
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:10,335
Oh, Captain...

225
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,670
my captain.

226
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:15,006
It is such an honor to have you here.

227
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,009
I mean, the two top heroes together.

228
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:21,137
Can't you just smell the team-up?

229
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,892
You know, Sage and I might
need you for the moment,

230
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,727
but let's get one thing straight...

231
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,437
there is no team-up.

232
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,189
We're not equals.

233
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,941
You're pathetic.

234
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,069
You can't even fly, for God's sakes.

235
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:38,196
Come on, buddy.

236
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,867
Ah! Oh, what a cutup.

237
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,416
What part of

238
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,128
"you're an idiot child not welcome
at the adult table" do you not understand?

239
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:56,381
Oh, I thought you knew everything.

240
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,257
Tek Knight invited me.

241
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:00,343
We go way back.

242
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:04,389
It's so good to see you here.

243
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:07,600
...and <i>The Whole Truth</i> got picked up
for another season on Vought+.

244
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,227
It's a hit.

245
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,270
Must be, if you got all this.

246
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,522
No, you...

247
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,440
you don't get this
from entertainment money.

248
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:15,817
This is real money.

249
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,235
Eleven generations' money.

250
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:18,236
Oh.

251
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,738
The Vernon family started out
as slave catchers.

252
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:25,743
Now we own more private prisons
than any other company in the U.S. of A.

253
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,579
And you sure know how to fill them.

254
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,708
From snout to tail, I catch, house,

255
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,501
and rehab criminals, and then I catch them

256
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,294
all over again.

257
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:38,715
You know, I bet A-Train here would've
given my great-great-granddaddy

258
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,025
- a run for his money. Ah?
- Oh.

259
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,010
But we would've caught you.

260
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:45,722
Ooh.

261
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,016
I guess we'll never know.

262
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,273
Come on out, kid.

263
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,500
You guys are gonna laugh.

264
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:58,151
No one is gonna laugh.

265
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:12,165
Guys, come on. You-you promised.

266
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,501
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, you know what?

267
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,961
Ah!

268
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,087
Fuck you guys.

269
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,093
How did a junkie like Webweaver score
an invite to this anyway?

270
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,971
Don't know.
But A-Train said he's on the list.

271
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:29,557
God, why does he wear it
so tight?

272
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,101
Smells like ass sweat
and broken dreams in here.

273
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,520
Good, it'll hide your scent
from Tek Knight.

274
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:35,831
You don't want to give him any tells.

275
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,274
Wait. Tek Knight has super smell?

276
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,611
Yeah. Smell, vision, taste, touch.

277
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,946
- He's like Sherlock Holmes on meth.
- I don't like this.

278
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,864
He's gonna make Hughie.

279
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,134
How else are we gonna
find out what Sage is cooking?

280
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,160
Just got to work fast, kid.

281
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,412
Take these bugs,
put 'em all over the party,

282
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,390
and lure Tek Knight back here
as soon as you can.

283
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:54,957
- Okay.
- We'll take care of the rest.

284
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,375
Oh, God.

285
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,462
Okay. Comm check-ins every two minutes.

286
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,339
Just say something, okay?

287
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,632
- Anything.
- Yeah. Copy.

288
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,300
In Webweaver's voice, motherfucker.

289
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,344
Uh... Copy, dawg.

290
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:07,762
Hey...

291
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:10,264
I'm fine.

292
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:11,933
All right? Trust me.

293
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,228
Okay.

294
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:18,356
Ooh, that is... ripe.

295
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,741
Webweaver.

296
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,620
Master Knight's expecting you.

297
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,914
He'll be thrilled.

298
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:38,334
Yeah, uh, so am I, dawg.

299
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,972
Fuck, oh, fuck. The Seven are here.

300
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,560
<i>Just
hurry up and plant the bugs, Hughie.</i>

301
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,234
- Oh, shit, I'm so sorry. I...
- Jesus fucking...

302
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:04,318
Madam...

303
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,863
<i>- Vice President-elect.</i>
- Oh, shit.

304
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,322
<i>Uh...</i>

305
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,410
Um...

306
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,289
Webweaver.

307
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,084
That's quite a scent.

308
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:21,335
Webweaver!

309
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:22,753
You made it.

310
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:26,007
Oh, it's so good
to meet you in person. Finally.

311
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,317
<i>Feels like I already know you.</i>

312
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:28,676
<i>Yeah, I know. Me too.</i>

313
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,636
No... cap?

314
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,848
Really, I'm honored that you would even
consider the sidekick gig.

315
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:37,435
I know it's a big change,
but if tonight goes well...

316
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,645
- ...it's yours.
- Oh.

317
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,522
Uh, w-well, great.

318
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:45,109
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, that's... great.

319
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:47,361
Well, you know, I've never been
to an estate before.

320
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,030
- Mm.
- Um, do you guys have stables?

321
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,534
Let's get the tour started inside.

322
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:55,828
- Okay? Come on.
- Okay. Got it.

323
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,831
What happened to you?

324
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:01,101
You look like you got ass-fucked
by the business end of a hammer.

325
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,294
Well, maybe I don't want to be
at this CPAC nightmare

326
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,962
any more than they want me here.

327
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:07,089
There's gonna be
a little sidebar later on.

328
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,050
One percent of the one percent.

329
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,637
Sage here is going to lube them up
with cognac and Montecristos,

330
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,765
and then convince them
to commit a little high treason.

331
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,974
I'm sorry, what the fuck?

332
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,018
Why would I expose myself like that?

333
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:21,270
Because in this room
is 38% of the U.S. GDP.

334
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:25,191
And if we have a shot in hell of pulling
off the 25th Amendment, we need them.

335
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:27,318
Do you want to be el jefe or not?

336
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,949
Good. Now, you're the virgin at prom.

337
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,700
Go get finger-popped.

338
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,079
Oh, hey.

339
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,748
You hear about Stan Edgar?

340
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,167
Well, what about him?

341
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,045
Well, apparently,
he got released from prison.

342
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:52,927
Hmm. Details are fairly sketchy as to why.

343
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,764
How. But, yeah, he got out.

344
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,891
Hasn't been seen since.

345
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,393
Well, he's nothing if not slippery.

346
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,603
I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.

347
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:06,607
He can't hurt us.

348
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,734
Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:22,290
That's why I went
to the Safdies to direct.

350
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:23,933
<i>Okay, Hughie, check in.</i>

351
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,044
- No more PG-13 bullshit.
- Oh, wow, I love these, uh, these orchid prints

352
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:29,380
<i>in your... stairway.</i>

353
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:33,426
Oh, wow.

354
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,596
I love your study. So many books.

355
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,975
Got the original
Beecher Stowe <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>

356
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:42,101
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,686
Cool, cool.

358
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,523
Now, look, uh, I don't do this
for just anybody, but, uh...

359
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,816
you want to see the Tek Cave?

360
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,318
The Tek Ca... Uh...

361
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:53,279
S-Sure, I mean, uh, fuck yeah, dawg.

362
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,244
Oh, it's one of those pull-the-book,
hidden-elevator-thingies.

363
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:01,954
Like in my movies.

364
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:03,998
<i>- Like in your movies.</i>
- Shit.

365
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,583
Huh.

366
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:15,217
Hughie.

367
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:25,227
Oh, my God.

368
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,354
Uh...

369
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:28,898
Oh, wow.

370
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,572
This is the Tek Cave. Cool, cool.

371
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,824
Ah, you've met Elijah.

372
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,285
Raised me since I lost my parents.

373
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,954
He's like a dad to me.

374
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:45,456
Isn't that right, Elijah?

375
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,042
That's correct, Master Knight.

376
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,589
There's nothing greater
than a father's guiding hand.

377
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,091
You know?

378
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,343
That's for sure.

379
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:01,514
Jesus. You didn't get all the santorum
off the gibbet cage!

380
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:02,848
It'll be taken care of, sir.

381
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:05,393
Most certainly.

382
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:07,728
We got to pull him out.

383
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:10,398
No, no, no. Look, j-just hold on.

384
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,484
Uh...

385
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:19,073
Who is that?

386
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:20,533
That's my last sidekick.

387
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,120
I don't like liars.

388
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,706
The whole culture down here
is based on trust.

389
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,250
Huh.

390
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,630
Are you agitated?

391
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,465
No, I'm fine.

392
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,842
I get it.

393
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,927
This is all a little vanilla for you.

394
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,596
But... don't worry.

395
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,183
Tonight, we're really
gonna push ourselves...

396
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,061
...to your level.

397
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,118
Hey. Dude.

398
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,328
Are you fucking nuts?

399
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,872
Put your mask back on.

400
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,332
G-Get out of his chair.
What are you doing?

401
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,501
You know what's funny? I hate sake.

402
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,129
But I'm supposed to follow
some stupid Black ninja bullshit,

403
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,839
which makes no goddamn sense,
by the way.

404
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,591
You ever meet a Black ninja?

405
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:19,967
Lower your voice.

406
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,302
There's nobody here.

407
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:23,971
They left us like babies
so they could go do important stuff.

408
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,556
- We don't matter.
- Hey.

409
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:28,726
Speak for yourself.
I'm doing a ton of important shit.

410
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,227
Yeah? Like what?

411
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:33,105
Need-to-know, bro.
Need-to-fucking-know.

412
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,399
Fuck it. I'm done with all this shit.

413
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:36,692
You're quitting?

414
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,236
What are you gonna do?
Seven's the biggest gig there is.

415
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,988
Look, I don't understand Noir, okay?

416
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:42,299
You know there was nothing in his closet

417
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:45,868
but literally like seven file boxes
of shitty Buster Beaver drawings?

418
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,244
Why'd he have that?

419
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,448
Who the fuck knows or cares?

420
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:52,416
I'm going to Missouri tomorrow.

421
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,961
I booked Cirque de Vought's new show,
<i>VIVANT! Music of the Bee Gees.</i>

422
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,796
Three nights a week in Branson.

423
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,423
They're gonna let me fly.

424
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,091
I can fly, did you know that?

425
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:04,678
Yeah, dude, we all know that.
Look, why didn't you just come to me?

426
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,639
About what?

427
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,891
Seriously? Dude.

428
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,937
Man, me and the old Noir?

429
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,899
We were like great bros, like real bros.

430
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,859
Give me this.

431
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:27,451
Few years ago, Noir cleared out
an entire Indonesian fishing village.

432
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:30,329
Vought Fresh Farms was expanding
their palm oil plantation,

433
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,432
but the locals were bitching
'cause they needed the river

434
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:35,251
to survive or whatever the fuck.

435
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,128
Noir "cancelled" two dozen of 'em.

436
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,172
Came back with
a raging hard-on for a week.

437
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,009
No, dude, see, what you're not getting

438
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:48,180
is how horny killing made the old Noir.

439
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:49,515
That was his whole thing.

440
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,850
But I don't really like violence.

441
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:59,608
Look, I know this
is hard to imagine, but...

442
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,068
some people laugh at me.

443
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,611
It's crazy, right?

444
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,821
Yeah.

445
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,907
But you know what I realized?

446
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,493
When I crush someone's nose
into the back of their skull

447
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,788
or beat 'em so bad
that they'll never walk again?

448
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,708
They're not laughing anymore.

449
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,210
They show respect.

450
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:22,631
Violence is power.

451
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,595
I'm starting to get why
it gave Noir so much chub.

452
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:34,852
<i>- Let your intention connect.</i>
- Oh, something is wrong.

453
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,479
Something is really, really wrong.

454
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,273
We should've never sent him in there.

455
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:41,251
Everything that's been
going on with his dad, I mean...

456
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,985
Fuck!

457
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,696
- M.M.!
- Annie, I hear you.

458
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,966
But what if we go in there
and we blow that man's cover?

459
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,992
Homelander is in there.

460
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,494
Sage, Firecracker, Neuman.

461
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:55,372
I'm going in.

462
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:58,250
Kimiko?

463
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:07,885
I'm going to move clarity forward
through mindfulness.

464
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:15,100
And a gang of halothane to go with it.

465
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,451
Are you all right?

466
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:36,163
I'm fine.

467
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,293
How you chopped off
an innocent man's leg...

468
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:43,962
...does that sound fine to you?

469
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:46,924
It's the only way...

470
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:49,927
I'm gonna get a proper crack
at Homelander.

471
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:52,388
Have you talked to Ryan?

472
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,849
Are you even trying
to get him out anymore?

473
00:22:55,933 --> 00:23:00,062
Or is... this just the same old
bloodlust all over again?

474
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,815
Jesus Christ, you're doing
me fucking head in.

475
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:05,693
I'm trying to save
the bleedin' world here.

476
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:07,486
Claret's gonna get spilt.

477
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,534
I can't do...

478
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:16,537
what needs to be done
and keep you happy.

479
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,416
Billy, come on.

480
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,668
I mean, "saving the world"? Really?

481
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:27,005
You're gonna kill one Homelander...

482
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,633
...just to end up with another.

483
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,677
All right, split up,

484
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,888
stay connected,
stay the fuck out of sight.

485
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:22,102
Actually, we know
if the rape is legitimate.

486
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:25,647
The woman's body has a way
to reject that pregnancy.

487
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:30,319
A nationwide ban on abortion
is just good policy.

488
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,575
Huh.

489
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,707
Tequila shots. Reposado.
Keep 'em coming.

490
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:51,256
I just had abortion mansplained
to me by a guy

491
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,051
who refuses to be alone
with any woman who isn't his wife...

492
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:56,386
...or mistress.

493
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:00,849
I don't know.
I mean, cozying up to these people,

494
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,560
you're fucking asking me
to do the impossible here.

495
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:15,781
When I was 11,
my grandma was diagnosed

496
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:19,284
with Stage 3 chronic
lymphocytic leukemia.

497
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,495
God...

498
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:25,123
She had the biggest laugh,
but she got so small so fast.

499
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:26,708
She was bed-ridden.

500
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,837
The doctors didn't care about
saving some old ex-Black Panther

501
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,256
and they told my parents
there was nothing to be done.

502
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,552
I stayed up the next three nights
and discovered a cure.

503
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:42,057
Presented my research
to those satisfied fat crackers,

504
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,853
they patted me on the head,
said I was adorable and laughed at me.

505
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,939
Grandma died screaming in pain.

506
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:57,656
I could cure cancer,
reverse global warming,

507
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,700
but what's the point?

508
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:02,786
Humans are animals.

509
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,123
And the lines at Voughtland
are too long as it is.

510
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,170
Why are you telling me this?

511
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,882
Because you remember what it's like,

512
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:18,969
being a little girl
who no one fucking listens to.

513
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,308
And because fuck them all.

514
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:30,647
The only way women like us
have ever gotten what we deserved...

515
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,487
...one hand in their pockets while
the other slits their fucking throats.

516
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:42,492
Now...

517
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,579
You in or out?

518
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:57,007
Mm. Oh.

519
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,398
It's a great party, huh?

520
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,692
Y'all see all the free shrimp they got?

521
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,279
Firecracker, it's kind of
a private conversation.

522
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:22,532
But I'm sure the bar has
some SunnyD and Everclear.

523
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:35,879
Where is our host?

524
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:39,299
Mm. I have not seen him in a while.

525
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:40,777
<i>♪ Happy ♪</i>

526
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,969
<i>♪ Just one more year...</i>

527
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:43,887
Master Knight.

528

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,799
Early signs of OCD. You see that, right?

707
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,867
I said shut up.

708
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,619
You've cursed the poor girl.

709
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,245
No.

710
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,960
Look, this is a white,
Christian nation

711
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,537
founded on white, Christian values.

712
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,806
Church and state are the same thing.

713
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,267
And we need Supreme Court justices who
will protect our values,

714
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,044
no matter how much they cost.

715
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:32,929
Y'all are supposed to be undercover.

716
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:35,598
What the fuck did you do?

717
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:37,475
Shit. Damn.

718
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,239
Oh, fuck no. I'm not taking him.

719
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,824
You're gonna get me murdered.

720
00:39:58,538 --> 00:39:59,997
Just try it, bitch.

721
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,478
Get the door.

722
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:27,066
M.M.?

723
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:30,695
What the hell just happened?

724
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,034

Oh, my God.

731
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,519
Hughie. Hughie. Are you okay?

732
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,313
Hey, hey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

733
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,773
Oh, fuck. You're okay.

734
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,003
Hey!

735
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:46,187
Do me a favor,
just go wait over here, okay? Good boy.

736
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:51,108
- What is going on?
- Hmm?

737
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:53,486
Tek-Knight, A-Train, Firecracker,
they're all M.I.A.,

738
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,738
and where the fuck have you been?

739
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:59,158
I once ate a whole bag of candy corns.

740
00:42:01,077 --> 00:42:02,411
What?

741
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:04,539
In my mouth.

742
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,707
- I ate them.
- Sage, what the fuck...

743
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:10,837
What happened to you?

744
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,171
Brain damage.

745
00:42:12,255 --> 00:42:16,509
But now, I could really go
for a Crunchwrap Supreme

746
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:18,177
and a Sybian.

747
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:20,054
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

748
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:23,724
- Hmm?
- Get a grip on yourself right now.

749
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:26,352
Get a fucking grip. Right now.
Come on, come on.

750
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:45,872
Fuck it.

751
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:48,082
Fuck it. I'll do it myself.

752
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,084
Folks.

753
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,752
Thank you for coming.

754
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,130
I'm sure you're wondering
why we pulled you aside,

755
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:55,590
so let's get right to it.

756
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,594
I think we can all agree
that Robert Singer

757
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,722
is the greatest threat
this nation has ever faced.

758
00:43:02,805 --> 00:43:06,142
He is going to destroy this whole country.

759
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:08,519
You all met Ryan, my son.

760
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:11,564
For his sake, I cannot and I will not

761
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:14,191
- let that stand.
- Does she agree?

762
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,819
Of course. Especially her.

763
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:18,321
She's not just eye candy.

764
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:20,448
No, no, Victoria here,

765
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,533
she's an integral part of the plan.

766
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:26,537
She sees up close what a doddering slave
to the woke mob Singer really is.

767
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:29,749
How great the threat really is.

768
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:32,418
So once he's in office, we need to act.

769
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:34,962
We need to invoke
the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

770
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,632
You're-you're talking about a coup.

771
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,383
No, I'm not.

772
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:41,510
I'm talking about saving this country.

773
00:43:41,594 --> 00:43:44,305
Before Singer replaces us

774
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:47,934
with a bunch of transgender illegals
that will do everything...

775
00:43:48,017 --> 00:43:50,394
Save the boogeyman shit
for the idiots watching VNN.

776
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:53,731
How do you propose
to handle the Justice Department?

777
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,985
Well, they will all...

778
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,612
be our appointees.

779
00:43:59,695 --> 00:44:00,947
Obviously.

780
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,115
- And the military's reaction?
- Or OPEC.

781
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,117
How you gonna guarantee our oil reserves?

782
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:07,828
Of course there's gonna be
some birth pangs...

783
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:09,222
The shock to the markets would be total.

784
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,041
And what happens if civil servants resign

785
00:44:12,124 --> 00:44:13,626
en masse?

786
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:16,837
With all due respect, sir, I think
you got a little hitch in your giddy-up.

787
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,131
Who's handling all this?

788
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:21,384
Great question.

789
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,219
This is great. Great questions.

790
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:26,055
Truly. And, um, uh,

791
00:44:26,138 --> 00:44:28,474
Sage. Sage, um...

792
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:32,603
...has the details.

793
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:34,063
Mmm.

794
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:42,154
Who's handling all this?

795
00:44:42,238 --> 00:44:44,240
Me.

796
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,243
I fucking am.

797
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:50,955
Look, I'm sure you're all wondering

798
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:53,833
why I'm here tonight,
instead of rimming out AOC,

799
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:57,044
while shouting, "Defund the police,"
up her asshole.

800
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,466
But I'm here tonight

801
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,719
to tell you the truth.

802
00:45:07,346 --> 00:45:09,724
The truth is America is not a democracy.

803
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:14,228
The word "democracy"
makes people feel safe.

804
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:17,457
But the founders never trusted the masses,
because the truth is,

805
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,483
the masses are fucking stupid.

806
00:45:20,526 --> 00:45:22,361
Anyone who owns a "Live, Laugh, Love" mug

807
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:24,488
shouldn't have a say
in how a country is run.

808
00:45:27,283 --> 00:45:29,160
People are a labor force

809
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:31,537
that need a kind, but firm hand.

810
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,165
There are no nations. There's Apple, Exxon

811
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:35,833
and Berkshire Hathaway.

812
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,753
Corporations are
the real superpowers here.

813
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:42,423
You should be able to operate
without any regulation or restriction

814
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,509
whatsoever.
After all, you're billionaires.

815
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:47,845
You are smart enough to know what's best.

816
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:49,513
Bottom line?

817
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,225
You support me,
and that is what you'll fucking get.

818
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:01,067
Hear, hear.

819
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,235

- Hear, hear.

820
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:20,836

What deal?

871
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,185
He'll fucking murder me.

874
00:48:44,772 --> 00:48:46,357

00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,067
My prisons.

876
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,735
Homelander and Sage, they,

877
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:51,862
they need places
across the country to put their...

878
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:54,156
dissidents.

887
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:18,180
from a little boy.

888
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:20,808
I listened to him moan about his career.

889
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,685
I cleaned cum

890
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:25,062
out of too many goddamn holes

891
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:26,897
to count.

892
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:28,816
But prison camps?

893
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,528
Go.

894
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:34,780
We'll make it look like an accident.

895
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:37,950
He always admired David Carradine.

896
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:39,910
Thank you.

899

The safe word.

900
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:49,420

Not quite.

905
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:01,598
Panic attack.

906
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:03,600

Consider this the universe's warning,

908

Whatever you're doing, stop it.

909

Take some downtime now.

911
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:35,591
Ma'am.

I'm sorry, but I just don't think
your inmate wants to see you.

913
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,635
Where were you last night?

914
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:23,722
Starlight was at the mansion.

915
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:27,726
What?

916
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,353
I chased her outside,

917
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:31,355
but the bitch got away.

918
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,567
She did?

919
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,154
Tek-Knight's dead.

920
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,868
Probably Starlight and her friends did it.

921
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,156
How do you think

922
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,664
they knew about the party?

923
00:51:49,957 --> 00:51:52,251
Cameron Coleman wasn't the leak.

924
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:54,962
So either Sage was lyin' to you,

925
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,339
or she's as useless as tits on a mouse.

926
00:51:57,423 --> 00:51:59,133
I mean, fuck.

927
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,135
I heard about her performance
last night, sir.

928
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,345
- I just want you to know that I would...
- So...

929
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:06,723
You're the one who let Starlight get away.

930
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:10,978
So how do I know that you're not the leak?

931
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:14,481
When you found me...

932
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:16,483
my podcast had...

933
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,687
I don't know, a couple hundred fans.

934
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:21,989
You know, folks laughed.

935
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,575
Now I'm the fucking anchor

936
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:27,536
at VNN.

937
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:29,621
With millions of followers.

938
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:34,084
And they ain't laughin' no more.

939
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:37,129
- I really don't care...
- Please! Just let me finish.

940
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,632
Now I have spent...

941
00:52:41,717 --> 00:52:43,552
...my whole life

942
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:45,637
on the outside, looking in.

943
00:52:47,848 --> 00:52:49,850
It was you...

944
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:53,145
...who threw that door open for me, sir.

945
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:55,230
You brought me in.

946
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,358
God, you have given me...

947
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,404
...everything.

948
00:53:04,156 --> 00:53:06,408
You...

949
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:08,160
are everything

950
00:53:08,243 --> 00:53:09,661
to me.

951
00:53:11,538 --> 00:53:13,916
Uh...

952
00:53:16,418 --> 00:53:18,420
What are you doing?

953
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:21,715
I am not sexually attracted to you.

954
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,383
No, this ain't about sex.

955
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,511
No, this?

956
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,306
This is about loyalty.

957
00:53:46,615 --> 00:53:48,867
But you're not pregnant.

958
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:50,911
There's, um,

959
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,164
a long regimen of drugs a person can take

960
00:53:54,248 --> 00:53:56,708
to make it happen.

961
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:58,961
It enlarges the heart
just a tiny little bit.

962
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:07,553
You did this for me?

963
00:54:07,636 --> 00:54:09,805
I'd do anything for you.

964
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,812
Anything.

965
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,236
That's my boy.

966
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,573
That's my good little boy.

967
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,412
Mm.

Oh, my God. Hughie.

980
00:55:07,696 --> 00:55:09,573
What else did she do to you?

00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,856
Well, looky here.
Christmas came early, Sameer.

988
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:46,568
Nicked it off a French bloke.

989
00:55:46,652 --> 00:55:49,279
Should be enough to get you started.

990

I won't do it.

991
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,117
The fuck you won't.

992
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:56,203
Do what you want to me, but I ca...

993
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,788
I can't do this for you.

994
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,831
Listen.

995
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:01,166
One dose.

996
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:02,709
Strong enough to top Homelander.

997
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,920
And then you can go back
to what's her name.

998
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,172
And you don't got to see me no more.

999
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,550
But this first.

1000
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:13,261
You don't understand.

1001
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:14,721
I can't.

1002
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:17,099
It's what we realized in the lab.

1003
00:56:17,182 --> 00:56:19,726
To make the virus strong enough
to kill Homelander

1004
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,562
would evolve it into something unstable.

1005
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,439
What do you mean, unstable?

1006
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:25,899
Airborne.

1007
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,317
Highly contagious.

1008
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:28,819
Super lethal.

1009
00:56:28,902 --> 00:56:31,863
No one with Compound V
in their bloodstream would be safe.

1010
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:34,157
A global fucking pandemic.

1011
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,702
We're not just talking
about killing Homelander.

1012
00:56:36,785 --> 00:56:40,288
We're talking about killing
every Supe on earth.

1013
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:43,834
That's Annie, Kimiko.

1014
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:46,294

- Vicky.

1016
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,801
I'm sorry.

1017
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,555
But when they say shit's
falling into the wrong hands...

1018
00:56:58,598 --> 00:57:00,600
...they mean your hands.

1019
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:08,942
This is beyond
our wildest dreams.

1020
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,861
Man, dude just gave us the silver bullet.

1021
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:13,238
We can wipe them all out.

1022
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:16,616
Billy,
you cannot go along with this.

1023
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,744
Listen, mate, no one

1024
00:57:18,827 --> 00:57:20,579
ever said nothing about genocide.

1025
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:23,915
- Is that a fucking joke?
- He's insane.

1026
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:26,251
Who was it that said,
"They all got to go"?

1027
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:27,711
"Every fucking last one of 'em."

1028
00:57:27,794 --> 00:57:30,297
He's talking about murder, Billy.

1029
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,758
- Of thousands.
- Think how much better the world would be.

1030
00:57:32,841 --> 00:57:35,093
And a lot of them are innocent, okay?
I know you...

1031
00:57:35,177 --> 00:57:37,429
Shut your fucking cake hole, bitch!

1032
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,018
Wait a minute...

1033
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:46,688
You can see her?

1034
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,200
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean, you're me?

1035
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:02,078
I mean, out of all the fucking people

1036
00:58:02,162 --> 00:58:05,791
that your festering fucked-up brain
could've conjured up,

1037
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:07,834
you picked me.

1038
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,880
The real Joe Kessler?

1039
00:58:11,963 --> 00:58:14,716
He's dead in the Panjshir Valley,
motherfucker.

1040
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,134
You never dragged me out.

1041
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:17,677
You left me to die.

1042
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:20,430
I'll be back at the head of the table
in no time.

1043
00:58:21,473 --> 00:58:22,307
No.

1044
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,476
We'll get Ryan's head clear,
and that's it.

1045
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,061
Fuck all this cloak and dagger shite.

1046
00:58:26,144 --> 00:58:27,521
It's bloody freezing out here.

1047
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,898
We'll patch you up right as rain.

1048
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:34,027
No. No.

1049
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,029
No, I'd remember that.

1050
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,572
I'd fucking remember that.

1051
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:39,509
Unless of course
you've got a big, old,

1052
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,326
fat, V'd-up brain tumor, you cunt.

1053
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:44,204
Which is why you are
seeing me in the first place.

1054
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:49,793
I killed Ezekiel for you.

1055
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:52,420
I am inside of you.

1056
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:54,464
I am you.

1057
00:58:54,548 --> 00:58:57,509
Which is why when I tell you
you want to do this,

1058
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:59,719
I am literally telling you

1059
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:02,055
that you fucking want to do this.

1060
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,561
So don't you worry, Billy, my boy.

1061
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,982
Daddy's home.
