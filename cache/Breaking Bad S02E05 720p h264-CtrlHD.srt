1
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,861
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,613
Here at the end of round one...

3
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,074
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

4
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,410
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

5
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,455
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,416
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,461
Yeah.

8
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,588
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,341
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,426
And your hair should start
to come back.

11
00:02:57,053 --> 00:03:00,139
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:04,686
-I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
-Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:09,274
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:13,987
-No more--?
-No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,614
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:19,909
Fine.

17
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,246
I mean, you know, we're busy...

18
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:26,124
...but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,127
It's all good.

20
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,093
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,179
Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,848
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,876
Thank you.

24
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,055
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,891
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,894
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:31,856
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,359
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,069
Okay.

30
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,073
Congratulations.

31
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,076
Thank you.

32
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,882
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,134
Can you--?
Can you please explain to me...

34
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:04,556
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,937
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

36
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,775
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

37
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,778
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

38
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:23,449
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

39
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,660
Yeah. Okay.

40
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,454
Bitch.

41
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,331
Hi.

42
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,961
Been around someone
who smokes?

43
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,421
No.

44
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,631
The hospital bill came.

45
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,800
-That was fast.
-Yeah.

46
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,096
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

47
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:56,065
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

48
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:58,985
I mean...

49
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:03,323
...I know it's strictly your domain,
but....

50
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,617
They will. I'm sure they will.

51
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,452
I'll handle it.

52
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,277
Oh, God.

53
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,364
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

54
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,615
-Dead.
-Still?

55
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,034
-Completely.
-Okay, then.

56
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,787
-Well, thanks for stopping by.
-Okay.

57
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,959
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

58
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,503
-Good.
-Of course, that's not gonna last.

59
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,673
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

60
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,299
No takers so far?

61
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:11,845
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

62
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,472
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

63
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:16,975
-Heisenberg?
-Yeah, I know.

64
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,853
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

65
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:24,190
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

66
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,860
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

67
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,447
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

68
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,037
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

69
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,748
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

70
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:43,042
...in pursuit of their prey.

71
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,211
Yeah, I think I heard that.

72
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,382
You, my friend, are a great white.

73
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,510
How does Albuquerque liaison...

74
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,055
...Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

75
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,391
Like one hell of a promotion.

76
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,270
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

77
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,898
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

78
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,150
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

79
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,945
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

80
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,948
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

81
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,576
-I'm the whole package.
-I'm glad I didn't just eat.

82
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,245
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

83
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,123
-You wanna grab lunch?
-Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

84
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:25,084
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

85
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,253
Try not to get lost on the way.

86
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,464
Schrader.

87
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,798
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

88
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,635
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

89
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,512
Yeah, El Paso.

90
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,057
Here's the man.

91
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,270
-Hey, congratulations, Hank.
-Thanks.

92
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:49,252
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

93
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,755
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

94
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:54,591
Hey. Hey.

95
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:30,418
-Hey.
-Got some nerve coming back here.

96
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,545
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

97
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,881
Yeah, well, maybe both.

98
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:46,059
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

99
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:51,064
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

100
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,067
...the toilet.

101
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,612
Look, like I said...

102
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,698
...my word is my bond.

103
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:18,216
What would you charge me
to store this here?

104
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:21,344
-A million-five.
-Come on, yo.

105
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:23,763
-Your sister.
-Dog, I'm serious, all right?

106
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:28,601
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

107
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,229
We could, you know, negotiate.

108
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:37,735
Five hundred.

109
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:39,237
-A month?
-A week.

110
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,199
For real?

111
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,034
-See you.
-Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,453
Just hold on. Just chill.

113
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,167
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

114
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,460
-Outside.
-Inside.

115
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,296
-Forget it.
-Man, come on.

116
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,549
Your fence is too easy to climb.

117
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:02,302
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

118
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,472
-Come again?
-Gate, in and out, privileges.

119
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:11,394
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

120
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,147
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

121
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,648
Yeah.

122
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,288
You selling?

123
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,415
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

124
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,300
What about that one?

125
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:47,764
Serious?

126
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,121
It's Jane, right?

127
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,792
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

128
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,004
-Really? Does it inspire awe?
-No. I mean, you know, it's great.

129
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:22,632
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

130
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:25,718
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

131
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:30,265
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

132
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,476
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

133
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,396
Jesus.

134
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:41,025
Utilities are included.

135
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,027
Stacking. Sweet.

136
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,947
-You got cable?
-Already wired. Just call to activate.

137
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,782
High speed, whatever.

138
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,660
Bathroom, cool tile.

139
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,704
Bedroom.

140
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,038
Nice.

141
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:57,417
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

142
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,880
-So you're interested?
-Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

143
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:04,048
And you're good with NP, NS?

144
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:07,802
Sorry. What?

145
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:11,181
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

146
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,309
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

147
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:18,605
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
or recent pay stub, current employer...

148
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,399
...former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

149
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:25,278
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

150
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:29,115
Yeah. Look...

151
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:30,783
...the thing is...

152
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,619
...I can....

153
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,287
Unbelievable.

154
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:38,124
-I'm just currently between situations.
-Then I'm currently not renting.

155
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,961
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

156
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,632
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

157
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,426
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

158
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,803
-Trust me.
-Your dad?

159
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:53,806
Owns the place. I manage it.

160
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,226
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

161
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,144
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

162
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:00,563
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

163
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,149
And I got no game, all right?

164
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,985
I just need a chance.

165
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:12,617
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

166
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,787
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

167
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,873
Didn't meet their expectations again.

168
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,876
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

169
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:26,214
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

170
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:28,842
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

171
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,011
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

172
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,188
Rent just went up.

173
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,191
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

174
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,943
Yes.

175
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,195
Okay. Yes.

176
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:52,115
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

177
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:55,034
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

178
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:57,704
DBAA fee, non-refundable.

179
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:02,458
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

180
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,381
All right. So, what's DBAA?

181
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,925
-Don't be an asshole.
-Gotcha.

182
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,678
-I live next door.
-Really?

183
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,223
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

184
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,975
If you blow this, I want you gone.

185
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:22,270
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

186
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:23,855
...faster than you can blink.

187
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,401
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

188
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,903
Which is what, by the way?

189
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,405
It's Jesse.

190
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,409
Jesse Jackson.

191
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:38,578
Seriously?

192
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:41,456
What?

193
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,091
-What are you doing?
-Beating off. What's it look like?

194
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,761
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

195
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,056
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

196
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:43,268
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

197
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,645
So let me get this straight.

198
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:50,441
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

199
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,986
...career-boosting promotion...

200
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:57,490
...so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

201
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,076
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

202
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:02,245
Babe, relax.

203
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:05,790
-Please, don't tell me to relax.
-Sorry, I forgot.

204
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,001
-You know I hate that.
-Right.

205
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,961
Dave said I should express that.

206
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,881
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

207
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,425
I can take a day.

208
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,343
No big deal.

209
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:23,558
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

210
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:13,126
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

211
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,628
The plan is we cook.

212
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:20,258
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

213
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:32,854
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

214
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:35,773
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

215
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:37,775
-Dude.
-What?

216
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:40,820
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

217
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,449
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

218
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:47,869
-...but still, what choice do we have?
-First of all, there's no we.

219
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:52,165
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

220
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,583
I got profile now.

221
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:57,003
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

222
00:22:57,212 --> 00:23:00,590
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

223
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,343
-No way.
-Then what do you suggest?

224
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:08,431
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

225
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,855
I got bills, man.

226
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,357
You've got bills?

227
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,400
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

228
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:21,402
I've already lost more than
I've made...

229
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,280
...and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

230
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:27,534
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

231
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:29,828
After completing
my first round of treatment...

232
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:33,540
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

233
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,708
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

234
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:39,003
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

235
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:42,632
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

236
00:23:46,386 --> 00:23:50,139
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

237
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:53,393
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices.

238
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,646
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

239
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:58,898
...or you and I start--

240
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:02,861
You selling whatever you can.

241
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:07,866
There's a third way.

242
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,244
And what would that be?

243
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:16,166
We got to be Tuco.

244
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:18,751
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

245
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,797
So you're going to what?

246
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:25,175
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

247
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:28,428
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

248
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:33,183
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

249
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:37,270
Look, we control production
and distribution.

250
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:40,690
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

251
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:43,943
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

252
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:45,445
Sky-high stacks.

253
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:49,282
-No.
-No? That's not the point?

254
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:52,076
No, I am not willing to do that.

255
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,913
Who said anything about you?

256
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:00,084
I don't vote for this plan.

257
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:04,464
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

258
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,217
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

259
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,971
I beg your pardon?

260
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,975
-This is a partnership, remember?
-I rem-- Oh, I remember.

261
00:25:16,184 --> 00:25:18,311
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

262
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,814
That was the division of labour
when we started all this.

263
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,192
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

264
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,237
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

265
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,656
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

266
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:32,826
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

267
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:43,169
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

268
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:46,297
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

269
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:49,551
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

270
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,427
Yeah, damn straight.

271
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,638
Know why?

272
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:56,641
Because we do things
my way this time...

273
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,685
...or I walk.

274
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:06,526
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

275
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:30,216
<i>Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?</i>

276
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:31,426
What up with it, yo?

277
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:34,888
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

278
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:37,849
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

279
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,062
-Yo, Badge, hey.
-Cool crib, man.

280
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:44,898
Hey, it echoes.

281
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:46,733
Hello.

282
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:48,902
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

283
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,820
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

284
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:53,573
So plasma is gonna go right here.

285
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:55,825
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

286
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,244
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

287
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,121
No. They burn in, yo.

288
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,458
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

289
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,252
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

290
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,129
That's what I'm waiting for.

291
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:10,548
-Porn, coz. You know?
-Jesus.

292
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:13,259
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

293
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:16,346
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

294
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:19,390
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

295
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,725
Those are buck.

296
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:23,937
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

297
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:26,272
-Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
-Yeah.

298
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,691
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

299
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,319
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

300
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,321
-It's gonna be chill.
-The ladies...

301
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,283
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

302
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:40,620
You are going to score, big time.

303
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:45,291
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

304
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,628
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

305
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:52,465
You got any other refreshments?

306
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,552
-I could kick it. It's been a while.
-Yes, yes.

307
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,179
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

308
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:00,640
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

309
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:04,477
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

310
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:07,313
Okay? So listen up.

311
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:11,192
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

312
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:15,321
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

313
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,283
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

314
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,952
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

315
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:22,662
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

316
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:26,332
-Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
-Seventeen.

317
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,253
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

318
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:33,882
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

319
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,176
...who else is selling right now,
huh?

320
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:39,429
-It's dry out there, that's for sure.
-Church.

321
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:42,891
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

322
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,269
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

323
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:48,688
Short me, you're out.

324
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,481
Cut it, you're out.

325
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,317
Period.

326
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:56,446
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

327
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:58,198
Understand?

328
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:01,034
Badger, what is this?

329
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:04,829
A big opportunity.

330
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,500
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

331
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:12,212
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

332
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,880
So bring out the product, yo.

333
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:16,841
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

334
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,012
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

335
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:26,851
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

336
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,853
Now, I got mad volume.

337
00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:32,732
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

338
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:36,069
...there is always more.

339
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:40,782
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

340
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,201
Apply yourselves.

341
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:44,494
Hell, yeah.

342
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:46,704
Hell, yeah.

343
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:20,155
Hey, there's the big guy.

344
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:22,615
-Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
-Hey, Hank.

345
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:23,992
It's an armpit.

346
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,952
It's not an armpit.

347
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:27,787
Oh, excuse me.

348
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:30,540
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

349
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,126
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

350
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,713
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

351
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:39,007
Human heads, they leave.

352
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:43,303
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

353
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,889
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

354
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:50,727
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

355
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:53,813
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

356
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:56,649
You just do your time
like a good boy...

357
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:59,819
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

358
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,779
...in a couple of years.

359
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:22,050
I went online to this fantastic...

360
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:25,178
...real estate website for D.C.

361
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:30,183
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

362
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:32,435
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

363
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:35,688
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

364
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:38,107
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there--

365
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:45,490
Apologise.

366
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,244
What?

367
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:55,917
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologise.

368
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:01,714
-For?
-You know perfectly well, Marie.

369
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:04,926
-Well, obviously I don't--
-Your lies.

370
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:06,719
To me.

371
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,265
The shoplifting.

372
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:12,058
All of it.

373
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:16,729
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

374
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:20,024
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it--

375
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:22,068
Apologise.

376
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,574
Now or never. I mean it.

377
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,243
Or it'll never be the same.

378
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,040
Why are you punishing me?

379
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:43,339
If you don't respect me enough to
apologise, to tell me the truth, then--

380
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:54,267
I need my sister back.

381
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:09,949
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,288
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:29,469
-What, do you want the gory details?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,471
No, you don't.

385
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,556
Keep you up at night.

386
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:39,437
So was it scary?

387
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:42,190
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

388
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:43,441
Jesus.

389
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,528
But you were way faster than him.

390
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:49,113
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

391
00:33:49,948 --> 00:33:52,033
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

392
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,576
Kick ass and take names.

393
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:56,579
-Son.
-No, it's fine.

394
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,624
You know what it is?

395
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:03,503
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

396
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,630
I mean, you don't think about it.

397
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:08,508
You stomp them down.

398
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,678
Where do they come from?

399
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,765
Criminals, like the one you....

400
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:19,686
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

401
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:24,357
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

402
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:29,779
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

403
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:35,368
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

404
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,294
Cops.

405
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:51,588
Cops!

406
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,648
Wasn't sure it was you.

407
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:53,900
New car?

408
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:57,904
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

409
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:01,241
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

410
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:10,375
Your half.

411
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,044
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

412
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:18,299
You're welcome.

413
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:19,551
Jesus.

414
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:24,222
Help me understand the math,
okay?

415
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,307
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

416
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:29,435
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

417
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:31,437
$1,000 each.

418
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:33,565
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

419
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:38,611
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

420
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,781
Sixteen. Not 15.

421
00:38:43,324 --> 00:38:44,784
Something came up.

422
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:47,620
Something came up?

423
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:50,915
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

424
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:55,712
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

425
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:00,466
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed--

426
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:06,014
Or rather you got robbed.
--but it doesn't matter.

427
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:09,726
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

428
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:11,644
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

429
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:13,813
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

430
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:17,108
It's the cost of business, yo.

431
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:18,776
You're sweating me over a grand?

432
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:23,406
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

433
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,867
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

434
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:29,162
...is just you making a fool
of yourself.

435
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:32,207
I've got another technical
term for you.

436
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:35,168
Non-sustainable business model.

437
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:37,629
You're focusing on the negative.

438
00:39:37,837 --> 00:39:41,424
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

439
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:44,469
What happens when
word gets out...

440
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:48,097
...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

441
00:39:48,306 --> 00:39:51,226
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Pinkman...

442
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:55,522
...drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity.

443
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,023
Man, come on.

444
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:00,693
You think Tuco had breakage?

445
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:03,530
I guess it's true, he did.

446
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:04,864
He broke bones.

447
00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:09,035
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

448
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:11,746
You want another grand?
Is that it?

449
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:14,207
-That's not my point.
-Take it. Here.

450
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:20,964
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

451
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:23,341
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

452
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,177
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

453
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,720
So am I.

454
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:30,640
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

455
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:33,726
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

456
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,813
You've made
the division of labour very clear.

457
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:41,693
Yo, I mean, seriously...

458
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:45,405
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

459
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,641
Hey.

460
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,101
Sorry.

461
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,061
Wow, you snuck in.

462
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,355
Didn't even know you were home.

463
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,691
What you eating?

464
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,944
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

465
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:27,864
I thought we nixed those, huh?

466
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:29,782
Did we?

467
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:35,455
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

468
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:38,166
I had a craving.

469
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:40,543
Once in a while is no big deal.

470
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,259
So where's Jr.?

471
00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:50,428
Out.

472
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:53,973
With whom?

473
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:55,642
Louis.

474
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,731
Out where?

475
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:06,152
Somewhere. I don't know.

476
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:09,155
-He'll be back by 9.
-Okay.

477
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:14,702
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

478
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,496
Why don't you?

479
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:22,001
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

480
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,629
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

481
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:27,090
Just pick up the phone like I do.

482
00:42:38,685 --> 00:42:40,228
Great.

483
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:47,193
Perhaps you might know
something...

484
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:48,570
...about this.

485
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:53,491
Perhaps.

486
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,536
And then again...

487
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,789
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

488
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:03,459
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

489
00:43:06,588 --> 00:43:08,548
I'd like an explanation, please.

490
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:11,634
-You don't wanna go down that road.
-Why would you do this?

491
00:43:11,843 --> 00:43:14,888
-You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
-Three and a half cigarettes...

492
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:16,556
...won't do a thing to the baby.

493
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:18,892
-Nothing.
-I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

494
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,686
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

495
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:27,859
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

496
00:43:29,486 --> 00:43:33,781
Skyler, this--
I mean, this is something that--

497
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,243
-This is so unlike you. Why--?
-Really?

498
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:39,370
How would you know?

499
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:44,209
No, thank you.

500
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:06,397
Hank.

501
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:36,135
Jesus.

502
00:45:18,261 --> 00:45:20,180
Yo.

503
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:31,858
You asked me what
I want you to do.

504
00:45:42,118 --> 00:45:44,704
I want you to handle it.
