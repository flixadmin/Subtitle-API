1
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:10,970
That's better.

2
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,230
You don't need it.

3
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,525
Still pretty?

4
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,402
Yeah!

5
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:28,363
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,703
El?

7
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,997
Yes?

8
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:42,252
Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,837
Me, too.

10
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,971
--Guys!

11
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,681
It's Lucas,
I think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,560
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,228
- Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,357
What's he saying?

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,484
I don't know, he's way out of range.

16
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,528
...son of a bitch!

17
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,739
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.

18
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,409
Yes, I copy!
Do you?

19
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,244
They know about Eleven!

20
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,371
Get out of there!
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,957
The bad men are coming!
All of them!

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,710
Do you hear me?
The bad men are coming!

23
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,461
"Mad hen."
Does that mean anything to you?

24
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,879
Like a code name or something?

25
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,424
- The bad men are coming!
- "Bad men."

26
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,134
- Bad men!

27
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,136
Stay here.

28
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,730
What's that guy doing?

29
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:45,732
You don't think...

30
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,986
Well, I know she and Steve
have been spending some time together,

31
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,237
-so I thought maybe--
-Mom!

32
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,114
Well, is he home?

33
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,240
-Maybe you could ask him?
-Mom!

34
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,617
I'm sorry,
can you just hold on, please?

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,827
Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times--

36
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,829
-Did you schedule any repairs?
-What?

37
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,582
Is there anyone supposed to come
and do repairs on the house?

38
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,302
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong--

39
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,638
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- Mike!

40
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,681
- One second.
- Mike!

41
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:22,685
We need to leave...
right now.

42
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,731
--Michael!

43
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,610
If anyone asks where I am,
I've left the country.

44
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:31,778
What?

45
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,514
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

46
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,359
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,820
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Dustin!

48
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,780
Dustin, do you copy?

49
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,698
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

50
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,409
-Where are you?
-Cornwallis.

51
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,785
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

52
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,495
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

53
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,788
Okay.

54
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,214
-Shit!
-This way, come on!

55
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,595
Out of the way!

56
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,305
- Out of the way!

57
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,022
- Lucas!
- Where are they?

58
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,399
- I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

59
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,943
--Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,114
Go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,533
-Faster, faster!
-Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

62
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,127
Holy... holy shit!

63
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:55,588
Did... did you see
what she did to that van?

64
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,756
No, Dustin, we missed it.

65
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,342
- I mean that was...
- Awesome.

66
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,095
It was awesome.

67
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,815
Everything I said
about you being a traitor and stuff...

68
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,526
I was wrong.

69
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,364
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,078
Friends...

71
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,872
friends don't lie.

72
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,085
I'm sorry, too.

73
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:36,629
Me, too.

74
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,137
Hey.

75
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,681
Jonathan?
Jesus, what... what happened?

76
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:11,933
- Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

77
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,476
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

78
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,686
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.

79
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,064
-Take them off.
-I am afraid I cannot do that.

80
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,232
-Take them off!
-You heard her. Take 'em off.

81
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:25,780
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

82
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,788
What is this?

83
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,456
Why don't you ask your son?
We found it in his car.

84
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,166
-What?
-Why are you going through my car?

85
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,043
Is that really the question
you should be asking right now?

86
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,212
I wanna see you in my office.

87
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,630
You won't believe me.

88
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,717
Why don't you give me a try?

89
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,513
Mike? Mike?

90
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,828
Yeah, just a minute, please!

91
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,581
- Jiminy Christmas.

92
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,959
Hold your horses.

93
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,006
Mr. Wheeler?

94
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,716
Yes?

95
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,551
I don't understand.

96
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,012
You think my son is hiding this girl?

97
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,221
What happened to her hair?

98
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,849
We just need to know
if you've seen her in the past week.

99
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,144
-No, no.
-Absolutely not.

100
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,937
Our son with a girl?

101
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,315
I mean, believe me,

102
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,735
if he had a girl sleeping in this house,
we'd know about it.

103
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,403
Wouldn't we?

104
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,323
This girl...

105
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,449
what has she done?

106
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,284
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

107
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,660
- Oh, my God, is she Russian?

108
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:39,872
-You can't treat us like this.
-I need you to stay calm.

109
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,665
You come into my house,

110
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,251
and you tell me that my son
is hiding some girl,

111
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,463
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

112
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,382
And you, what,
you expect me to remain, what, calm?

113
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,063
I understand how upsetting this is.

114
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,358
I wish we could tell you more...

115
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:13,739
but I can tell you that your son,
Michael, is in real danger.

116
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,660
We want to help him.

117
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,538
We will help him.
I give you my word.

118
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,500
But in order for me to do that...

119
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,920
you have to trust me.

120
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,049
Will you trust me?

121
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,014
Good.

122
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,266
Now...

123
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,645
do you have any idea
where your son might have gone?

124
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:51,986
This is Randolph Road, right here.

125
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,614
The fence starts here,
and goes all the way around.

126
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,659
And this is the lab right here.

127
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,202
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

128
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,328
It's gotta be.

129
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,289
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

130
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,790
The sign says "Department of Energy."

131
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,001
Department of Energy?
What do you think that means?

132
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,044
It means government. Military.

133
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:11,297
- Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

134
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,840
It's military. My dad's told me before.

135
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,675
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.

136
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,802
Do they make, like,
lightbulbs or something?

137
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,095
No, weapons...

138
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,680
to fight the Russians,
and commies and stuff.

139
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,307
Weapons.

140
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,768
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

141
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,646
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.

142
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,772
Well, what do we do?

143
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,524
I don't know,
but we can't go home.

144
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,026
We're fugitives now.

145
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,738
Guys?

146
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,574
Do you hear that?

147
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,040
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

148
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,791
-It's stuck.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

149
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,126
- Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- Come on!

150
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,628
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

151
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,506
--Get down!

152
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,264
Mental.

153
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,190
You say blood draws this thing?

154
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,608
We don't know.

155
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,860
It's just a theory.

156
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,157
I'm sorry, Mom.

157
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,243
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

158
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,120
-That is not good enough, Jonathan.
-I know.

159
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,623
That's not even close. That's not even
in the... in the ballpark.

160
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,291
I wanted to tell you, I just--

161
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,627
What if this thing took you, too?

162
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,005
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

163
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,550
I thought I could save Will...
I still do.

164
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,011
This is not yours to fix alone.

165
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:45,933
You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

166
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,142
You're not alone.

167
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,602
I know.

168
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,104
God damn it, Jonathan.

169
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,898
-I know.
-Damn it.

170
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:56,986
I want an apology!

171
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,237
An apology for what, exactly?

172
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,072
Where is the chief?
I want to speak to him

173
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,490
-right this instant.
-Stay here.

174
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,409
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

175
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,660
What is your name, Deputy?

176
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,537
Well, I'm an officer...
okay?

177
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,080
Name and badge number,
both of you!

178
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,040
- What the hell is going on here?
- Chief...

179
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,084
These men are humiliating my son.

180
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,169
-No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
-Yes.

181
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,629
There was some kind of fight, Chief--

182
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,382
A psychotic child broke his arm!

183
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,719
-A little girl, Chief. A little one.
-That tone! Do you hear that tone?

184
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,053
Honestly,
I'm just trying to state a fact.

185
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,555
-I don't have time for this.
-It was a little girl--

186
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,224
Will you please take a statement...
and get her out?

187
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,475
- Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

188
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,729
She had no hair
and she was bleeding from her nose.

189
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,731
Like a freak.

190
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,940
What'd you just say?

191
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,151
I said she's a freak!

192
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,029
No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair?

193
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,031
Her head's shaved.

194
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,866
She doesn't even look like a girl.

195
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,285
And...

196
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,120
And what?

197
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,206
Tell the man, Troy.

198
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,877
She can...

199
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,422
do things.

200
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,799
What kind of things?

201
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:01,925
Like...

202
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,345
make you fly.

203
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,641
And piss yourself.

204
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:10,726
What?

205
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,312
Was she alone?

206
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,607
She always hangs out with those losers.

207
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,858
"Losers"?

208
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,486
What losers?

209
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,657
Hey.

210
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,285
You owe me $1.20.

211
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,414
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin
when we're done with him.

212
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,167
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

213
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,835
The cops should just lock him up forever.

214
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,505
- Did you see the look on his face?

215
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,423
- Oh.

216
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,842
He probably had that same look
whenever he killed his brother, right?

217
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:48,430
Oh, God, I just got an image
of him making that face

218
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,848
- while he and Nancy are screwing.

219
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,767
Carol, for once in your life,
shut your damn mouth!

220
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,561
-What?
-Hey, what's your problem, man?

221
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,981
You're both assholes.
That's my problem.

222
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,400
-Are you serious right now, man?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

223
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:00,484
You shouldn't have done that.

224
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,860
-Done what?
-You know what.

225
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,821
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

226
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,156
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember
you asking me to stop.

227
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,908
I should've put that spray paint
right down your throat.

228
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,618
- What the hell, Steve?
- You know,

229
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,787
neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her,

230
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,539
because she's not miserable like you two.

231
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,040
She actually cares about other people.

232
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,375
The slut with a heart of gold.

233
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,668
I told you to watch your mouth!

234
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,045
Hey! I don't know
what's gotten into you, man,

235
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,423
-but you don't talk to her that way.
-Get out of my face.

236
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,007
- Or what?

237
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,175
Or what?

238
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,844
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

239
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,011
You gonna fight me now, too?

240
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,389
Because you couldn't take
Jonathan Byers...

241
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,226
so I wouldn't recommend that.

242
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,402
- Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.

243
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,280
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy!

244
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,866
Run away!
Just like you always do.

245
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,286
That Nancy's turning you
into a little pussy!

246
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,664
--That's right, Harrington, run away!

247
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,375
Run away!

248
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,553
I have to go home.

249
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,138
No, you can't.

250
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,975
-My mom... my dad are there.
-They're gonna be okay.

251
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,520
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Let go.

252
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,230
-Let go!
-Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

253
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,773
The last thing in the world we need

254
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,567
is them knowing
you're mixed up in all this.

255
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,195
-Mike is over there--
-They haven't found him.

256
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,571
Not yet, at least.

257
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,909
-For Mike?
-Come on, get in the car.

258
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,372
Look, we need to find them
before they do.

259
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,790
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

260
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,668
-No, I don't.
-I need you to think.

261
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,462
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.

262
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,380
I mean, lately...

263
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,632
Is there any place that your...

264
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,675
your parents don't know
about that he might go?

265
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,886
- I don't know.
- I might.

266
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,054
What?

267
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:56,141
I don't know where he is,
but I think I know how to ask him.

268
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,610
Whoa.

269
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,702
I got it.

270
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,256
Mike,
are you there? Mike?

271
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,674
You guys hear that?

272
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,884
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

273
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,638
Mike, are you there?

274
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,390
Answer.

275
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,141
Mike, we need you to answer.

276
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,768
Is that your sister?

277
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,397
This is an emergency, Mike.

278
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,773
Do you copy?

279
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,442
Mike, do you copy?

280
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,069
Okay, this is really weird.

281
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,654
Don't answer.

282
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,823
-She said it was an emergency.
-What if it's a trick?

283
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,659
-It's your sister!
-What if the bad people kidnapped her?

284
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,620
-What if they're forcing her to say this?
-I need you to answer.

285
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,248
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.

286
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,083
We need to know
that you're there, Mike.

287
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,628
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.

288
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,714
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

289
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,841
Why is she with the chief?

290
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,217
How the hell does he know about...

291
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:16,221
We can protect you,
we can help you, but you gotta pick up.

292
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,932
Are you there?
Do you copy? Over.

293
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,858
Anybody got any other ideas?

294
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,944
Yeah, I copy.

295
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:33,989
It's Mike.

296
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,407
I'm here.

297
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,036
We're here.

298
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,172
Need a hand?

299
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,425
Did you have something
to do with this?

300
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,594
I just...

301
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,763
I wanna help.

302
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,481
All yours.

303
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,081
They expect us
to just sit here like prisoners.

304
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,791
We should be out there looking for him.

305
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,669
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

306
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,546
This is our government.
They're on our side.

307
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,550
That man gives me the creeps.

308
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,262
Nancy.

309
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,807
You don't think
she's involved in this, too, do you?

310
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,308
Nancy with Mike?

311
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,851
No.

312
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,938
- No.

313
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,784
Will you stop pacing?

314
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,828
It's been way too long.

315
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,831
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap

316
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,624
and the bad men
are coming to get us right now!

317
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,709
It's not a trap.

318
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,794
Why would the chief set us up?

319
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,046
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

320
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,506
Lando Calrissian.

321
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,258
Would you shut up about Lando?

322
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,260
I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this!

323
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,178
When do you feel good
about anything?

324
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,233
Shit!

325
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,651
Go, go, go, go.

326
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,613
Lando.

327
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,449
You think they saw us?

328
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,200
Both of you, shut up.

329
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,455
- Hey!

330
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,249
What the--

331
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,924
All right, let's go.

332
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,260
Let's go!

333
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,786
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

334
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,667
I was so worried about you.

335
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,169
Yeah, uh... me, too.

336
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,884
Is that my dress?

337
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:29,558
Okay, so, in this example,
we're the acrobat.

338
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,561
Will and Barbara, and that monster,
they're this flea.

339
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,021
And this is the Upside Down,
where Will is hiding.

340
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,567
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

341
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,235
-A gate.
-That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

342
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,611
With our compasses.

343
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:46,825
Okay, so the gate
has a really strong electromagnetic field,

344
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,119
and that can change
the directions of a compass needle.

345
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,412
Is this gate underground?

346
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,163
Yes.

347
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,250
Near a large water tank?

348
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,127
Yes.

349
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,462
How do you know all that?

350
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,632
He's seen it.

351
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,551
Is there any way that you could...

352
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,305
that you could reach Will?
That you could talk to him in this--

353
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,472
The Upside Down.

354
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,182
Down. Yeah.

355
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:13,977
And my friend Barbara?

356
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,520
Can you find her, too?

357
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:52,849
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,975
What?

359
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,186
What's wrong?
What happened?

360
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,938
I can't find them.

361
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,724
Whenever she uses her powers,
she gets weak.

362
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,352
The more energy she uses,
the more tired she gets.

363
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,021
-Like, she flipped the van earlier.
-It was awesome.

364
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,399
-But she's drained.
-Like a bad battery.

365
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,360
Well...
How do we make her better?

366
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,279
We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.

367
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,198
Well, how long?

368
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,658
I don't know.

369
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,992
The bath.

370
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,327
What?

371
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,623
I can find them.

372
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,167
In the bath.

373
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,549
Oh!

374
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,970
Oh. Oh, my...
No, mmm-mmm.

375
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,055
Hey, you know how they did that?
You know what that is?

376
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,390
No, what?

377
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,017
Melted plastic
and microwaved bubble gum.

378
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,978
No way. Really?

379
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,604
Really.

380
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,067
-What in the world?
-Do you want me to pause it?

381
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,736
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

382
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,740
Hello?

383
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,616
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

384
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,578
Dustin? Is everything okay?

385
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,288
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

386
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,457
I have a science question.

387
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,918
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up--

388
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,963
Do you know anything
about sensory deprivation tanks?

389
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,840
Specifically how to build one?

390
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,885
Sensory deprivation?
What is this for?

391
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,179
Fun.

392
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,930
Okay. Well...

393
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,184
Why don't we talk about it Monday?
After school, okay?

394
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,728
You always say
we should never stop being curious.

395
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,730
To always open any curiosity door we find.

396
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:04,856
Dustin--

397
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,567
Why are you keeping
this curiosity door locked?

398
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,404
Uh-huh.

399
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,451
Uh-huh. How much?

400
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,411
Uh-huh.

401
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,499
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.

402
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,209
Definitely.
All right, Mr. Clarke.

403
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,503
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

404
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,962
Bye.

405
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,340
Do you still have that kiddie pool
we bobbed for apples in?

406
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,717
-I think so. Yeah.
-Yeah.

407
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,469
Good. Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.

408
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,262
How much is "lots"?

409
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,432
1,500 pounds.

410
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,227
Well, where are we gonna
get that much salt?

411
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,326
Hey, wait.

412
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,370
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

413
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,539
Worst case, no school.

414
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,333
Even if we find Will in there...

415
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,960
what are we gonna do about that thing?

416
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,336
We're not gonna do anything.

417
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,838
I don't want you
anywhere near this, all right?

418
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:12,340
-Your mom's been through enough already.
-He's my brother.

419
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,760
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him. All right?

420
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,387
You gotta trust me on this.

421
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,180
I am going to find him.

422
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,689
This damn thing is heavy.

423
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,655
Come on.
It's upside down.

424
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:36,990
No, this way.

425
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,035
-Okay, um...
-How does this even work?

426
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,621
- Try that side.
- Son of a bitch!

427
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,707
-Pull it back. Pull it back.
-I am!

428
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,418
- One, two, three.

429
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,836
Shit!

430
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,470
Ah.

431
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,638
Stand back.

432
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,105
Whoa.

433
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,825
What did she even eat?

434
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,536
- What?
- Eleven.

435
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,874
Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

436
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,210
She really likes Eggos.

437
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,505
I knew you
were acting weird. I just...

438
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,633
I thought it was because of Will.

439
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,594
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

440
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,096
Hey...

441
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,017
No more secrets, okay?

442
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,144
From now on we tell each other everything.

443
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,272
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

444
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,316
What? No.

445
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:57,070
No, it's... it's not...
it's not like that.

446
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,906
Do you like Eleven?

447
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:03,326
What? No. Ew. Gross.

448
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:19,509
This will keep it dark for you.

449
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,678
Just like in your bathtub.

450
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,516
You're a very brave girl.

451
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,393
You know that, don't you?

452
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:33,398
Everything you're doing
for my boy... for Will...

453
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,484
for my family...

454
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,738
Thank you.

455
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,576
Listen.

456
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,956
I am gonna be there
with you the whole time.

457
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,000
And if it ever gets too scary...

458
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:56,462
in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

459
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,550
Yes.

460
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,262
Ready?

461
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,226
Ready.

462
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,203
Colder!

463
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,457
Warmer!

464
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,252
Right there!

465
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,141
Barb?

466
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,476
Barbara?

467
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,884
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

468
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,888
Is Barb okay?
Is she okay?

469
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,973
Gone! Gone!

470
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,808
Gone!

471
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,561
Gone! Gone!

472
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,939
Gone. Gone.

473
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,524
--Gone.

474
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,400
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

475
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,778
- Gone. Gone!
- It's okay. It's okay.

476
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,279
Gone!

477
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,114
- Hey. It's okay.

478
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,700
It's okay, we're right here.
We're right here, honey.

479
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,037
It's okay. I got you.

480
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,957
Don't be afraid.

481
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,542
I'm right here with you.

482
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,169
I'm right here with you.

483
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,421
It's okay. It's okay.

484
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,799
It's okay.

485
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,009
It's okay, you're safe.

486
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,469
You're okay, honey.

487
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,972
Castle Byers.

488
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:17,932
Castle Byers.

489
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,389
Will.

490
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,308
- Will?

491
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,732
You tell him...
tell him I'm coming.

492
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,317
Mom is coming.

493
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,527
Your mom...
she's coming for you.

494
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,531
Hurry.

495
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,158
Hurry.

496
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,622
Okay. Listen, you tell him to...
to stay where he is.

497
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:25,708
We're coming. We're coming, okay?
We're coming, honey.

498
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,044
Just... just hold on a little longer.

499
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,212
Will. Will.

500
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,558
Will?

501
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,560
Will!

502
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,277
--Oh!

503
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:56,072
--Oh, okay, okay.

504
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,324
I've got you.

505
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,619
It's okay.
I got you. I got you.

506
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,872
I got you, honey.
You did so good.

507
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,335
- Are you okay?

508
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,880
So this fort.
Where is it?

509
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,757
Uh, it's in the woods
behind our house.

510
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,259
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.

511
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,266
Hey, get back inside.

512
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,476
What, are you insane?

513
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,852
-No, I'm--
-Look, if something happens to me,

514
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:27,978
I don't make it back--

515
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,772
Yeah, but then I'll go.
You stay.

516
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,981
Are you kidding me?

517
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:34,318
He's my son, Hop. My son.

518
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,486
I'm going!

519
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,322
- Now, listen, I need you to stay here...
- No.

520
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:39,740
-...and watch over the kids.
-No, Mom.

521
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,659
-I can help.
-Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.

522
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:42,743
Joyce!

523
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:43,994
-Please.
-Please, be careful.

524
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:45,621
- Joyce, come on!
- Please. I'm gonna find him.

525
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,456
I'm gonna find him.

526
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,826
We have to go back to the station.

527
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,328
What?

528
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:32,835
Your mom and Hopper
are just walking in there like bait.

529
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,839
That thing is still in there.

530
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:42,261
And we can't just sit here
and let it get them, too.

531
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,637
We can't.

532
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,977
You still wanna try it out?

533
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:53,063
I wanna finish what we started.

534
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,650
I want to kill it.

535
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:12,708
So this is your plan?

536
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,502
Worked for me before, didn't it?

537
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,796
-Well, did it?
-Come on, trust me.

538
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,007
I'd like to hear
your thoughts on the war.

539
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,092
I think we're dealing with a whole
different environment here.

540
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,844
I'll tell you what,
we always planned

541
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,222
on the Russians massing the fire and we...

542
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:44,949
--Don't move!

543
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,701
- All right, move in.

544
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,245
It's all right.

545
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,704
Let me do the talking.

546
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,588
♪ If I go there will be trouble ♪

547
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,634
♪ And if I stay it will be double ♪

548
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,429
♪ So, come on and let me know ♪

549
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,558
♪ Should I stay or should I go now? ♪
