1
00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:01,710
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:04,177
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,367
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,347
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,882
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,234
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:12,286
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,520
like me.

9
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,289
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,024
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:19,059
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,528
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,964
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:26,600
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,125
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,622
Is that what you think I am?
Some sort of evil secretary?

17
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,173
- You tell me.
- I am now,

18
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:35,542
and forever will be,
my husband's partner.

19
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:38,012
Pleased to meet you, Dominic Lanse.

20
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,082
Hello, Mr. Allen.

21
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,968
Devoe, if you hurt my family...

22
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:45,911
I have no interest in your family.

23
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:47,309
Besides, you're gonna need someone

24
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:48,585
to miss you when you're gone.

25
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,924
- What did you do?
- I left something for you.

26
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,684
I don't have need for it anymore.

27
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,061
Barry Allen, you're under arrest

28
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:55,578
for the murder of Clifford Devoe.

29
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,699
My name is Barry Allen.

30
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:03,837
And I'm an innocent man.

31
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:07,775
I know that you'll find my fingerprints

32
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,611
all over his body.

33
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:14,481
And I know that you'll
find his DNA on mine.

34
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:21,221
But I don't know who stabbed him...

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,192
Or how he ended up in my loft.

36
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,431
All I can tell you is I'm being framed...

37
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,867
For something I didn't do.

38
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:38,238
I didn't kill Clifford Devoe.

39
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:48,215
All right, Allen,

40
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:51,118
let's run it back from the beginning.

41
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,956
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

42
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,825
This is exactly what Devoe wanted.

43
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:01,495
I mean, we all played right
into his plan, especially me.

44
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,596
Why would Devoe want to
orchestrate all of this?

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,699
I don't know, but we
know that this started

46
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:07,291
when I was still in the Speed Force.

47
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,602
But why target Dominic?

48
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:10,304
Dominic's power must have allowed Devoe

49
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,294
to inhabit his body.

50
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,440
We should've been on
top of this earlier.

51
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,008
What about the other metas on the bus?

52
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,344
Why create them?

53
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,413
Part of a larger plan?

54
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,940
How are you even here right now, Allen?

55
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:26,320
Aren't you on house arrest?

56
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:27,855
- Yeah, well...
- He's at Joe's, actually.

57
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,356
Either that or the courthouse.

58
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:33,060
I managed to hack into
the ankle monitor GPS.

59
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:34,943
That's not the only thing Cisco hacked.

60
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,530
When you came out of the Speed Force,

61
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,138
you were talking gibberish at CCPD.

62
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,367
You said something about
not wanting to kill anyone.

63
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,069
I digitally scrubbed a video.

64
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:43,670
Last thing we want is
somebody hearing something

65
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:45,372
we don't want them to hear.

66
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,809
- Your Honor, I'm innocent.
- I didn't do this.

67
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,511
I didn't kill anyone.

68
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,746
Yeah, I mean, I don't
remember saying any of that.

69
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,882
- You don't?
- No.

70
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,550
We should look at
everything else he said

71
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,218
when he first came
out of the Speed Force.

72
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,863
- Might give us a clue.
- That's a good idea.

73
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,123
Okay, guys, but remember,

74
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:03,090
I mean, considering all the
evidence they have against me,

75
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:04,958
this trial is not even
gonna last very long.

76
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,027
Okay, but with Cecile
taking a leave of absence

77
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,463
to represent you, you got
the best lawyer in town.

78
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,265
- Yeah,
- I mean, even if they did

79
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,401
find you guilty, it's not
like any prison can hold you.

80
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,905
Well, I'm not gonna run.
I won't be a fugitive.

81
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,007
If I'm convicted, I
have to go to prison.

82
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,542
We're not gonna let that happen.

83
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:26,046
- Right.
- Let's get to work.

84
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,287
We should get to the courthouse.

85
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,888
Yeah.

86
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,690
- How you doing?
- They say the first year

87
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,459
of marriage is always the hardest,

88
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:41,995
but I never thought my husband
being on trial for murder

89
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:43,424
would be one of the challenges.

90
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:45,432
We have been through so much.

91
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,701
We'll get through this too.

92
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:49,470
Will we, Barry?

93
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:52,906
I know the Speed Force gave you
a new outlook on life, but...

94
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,075
I don't know if being
positive is enough right now.

95
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:58,912
I'm just trying to be strong
for the team and for you.

96
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,315
Remember, we're The Flash.

97
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,786
We're The Flash.

98
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,232
Ralph, hold up.

99
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,423
Listen, I'm not gonna
let Barry go to prison.

100
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:10,839
I failed his dad, I'm
not gonna fail him.

101
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,115
I need your help.

102
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,161
My help, huh? As in the stretchy kind?

103
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:16,296
As in the underhanded
private investigator kind.

104
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,167
- Oh, ha, no offense taken.
- Come on.

105
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,271
Science has long pondered
what would be required

106
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,640
to successfully transfer consciousness

107
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:30,544
from one living being to another.

108
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,346
But we've accomplished far beyond

109
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:35,215
a simple transfer of consciousness.

110
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:38,370
We've extracted that
which elevates our humanity

111
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,020
and added upon it.

112
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:43,127
I am both who I was before...

113
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:48,595
And who I desire to become.

114
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:51,331
Yes, you are, my love.

115
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:56,236
My hand still feels
foreign upon your flesh.

116
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,741
And you don't care for it.

117
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:02,910
No, I do.

118
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:05,178
As I said, I inherited my host's ability

119
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,247
to read thoughts.

120
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,084
We have never lied to each other before.

121
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,820
Let's not begin now.

122
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,589
Okay.

123
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:20,365
Marlize, my love...

124
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,765
See past this body.

125
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,834
See past these eyes.

126
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,171
See me, Clifford.

127
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:38,145
I am nothing without you.

128
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:54,928
Your Honor, ladies and
gentleman of the jury,

129
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,713
If you don't understand what it
is I'm about to tell you today,

130
00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:59,166
you need to do something.

131
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:03,236
I need you to believe in the impossible.

132
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,272
As children, we're taught that

133
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,708
the police are there
to protect us, to serve.

134
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,901
We're told that our tax
dollars go toward training them

135
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,580
to be the champions of the city.

136
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,495
But for some of us, it
still seems impossible

137
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:19,686
that a police investigator,
one of Central City's finest,

138
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,388
could betray that trust.

139
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,590
And even worse, under the
guise of upholding the law

140
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,192
to commit the most heinous act

141
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,291
that one person can
carry out against another.

142
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:30,731
But that is exactly
what Barry Allen did.

143
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,634
Now, the prosecution will
prove beyond any doubt

144
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:36,837
that he stood among us a
wolf in sheep's clothing.

145
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,538
But here's the thing.

146
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,862
Barry Allen wears a mask,

147
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:43,276
used his connection to the law,

148
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,078
his experience as a police investigator,

149
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,414
especially as a crime scene technician,

150
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,918
to stalk a beloved professor and husband

151
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,416
and murder Clifford Devoe in cold blood.

152
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,776
All right, Mr. Borwin,
just sign on the dotted line

153
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,029
and your savings account is all set up.

154
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,399
Appreciate your helping me
out, I want to get this right.

155
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:07,467
It's my first savings account.

156
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:12,072
- You okay?
- Yeah.

157
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:15,208
Just a little lightheaded
before lunch, I guess.

158
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,078
Have a great day.

159
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,444
Ladies and gentleman,
the document in my hand,

160
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,704
it's a court-issued restraining order.

161
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,950
It's issued to Marlize
Devoe, the wife of the victim,

162
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:38,451
on behalf of her husband

163
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:43,356
against a Mr. Bartholomew Henry Allen.

164
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:45,759
Now if you'd like a better
look, I have a bigger copy.

165
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,427
And if you'll allow me to call out

166
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,096
what's written underneath
"reason for order issue,"

167
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:52,499
harassment.

168
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,335
The defendant was
seen just days earlier,

169
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:58,038
illegally breaking and entering
into the victim's house,

170
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
searching through the victim's effects.

171
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,675
A man obsessed.

172
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:03,710
Barry Allen's skin cells were found

173
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,846
under the nails of the victim.

174
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,248
Now imagine that, if you can,

175
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,951
Mr. Devoe, a man in a wheelchair,

176
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:12,991
desperately trying to defend himself

177
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,955
as Mr. Allen sought to overpower him.

178
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:17,155
And finally, this is the knife

179
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:20,017
that was used to kill Clifford Devoe.

180
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,564
If it looks new, that's because it is.

181
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,834
It was a wedding gift to Mr. Allen.

182
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:31,204
Now let's just let that
sink in for a moment.

183
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:32,872
This was supposed to commemorate

184
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:35,575
the most joyous moment
in a couple's lives.

185
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,072
But instead Mr. Allen used it

186
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:40,046
to forever separate a
couple from one another.

187
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,949
He used a wedding gift
as a murder weapon.

188
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,447
That is a special kind of evil.

189
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,853
Defendant showed

190
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,028
- an absolute disregard...
- Cisco,

191
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:50,889
there's a meta attack downtown.

192
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:53,193
- We got to go.
- Brazen callousness...

193
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:56,763
I'll stay here with Barry.

194
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,085
When you're done,

195
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,138
could I get some coverage
of the work stations?

196
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,041
Detective, would you
get a statement please?

197
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:10,377
- Mr. Ramon.
- Captain.

198
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,147
- What happened here?
- Well, vintage Central City.

199
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,781
Aning another weird one.

200
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:19,119
No data breach, nothing
stolen. Everyone just collapsed.

201
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:21,588
I have officers at the hospital
interviewing people now,

202
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,256
but so far, no one knows anything.

203
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,658
- Hmm.
- Whoa.

204
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,704
Dark matter city.

205
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,762
Yeah, we're definitely
dealing with a meta here.

206
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:31,053
You want to see what kind of
perimeter we're dealing with?

207
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:34,000
You read my mind.

208
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:36,970
Hey, Joe, you sure you're
okay to run this case?

209
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,638
Because I totally understand

210
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,907
if you need a little more time, uh...

211
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,143
Uh, I'm fine, really.

212
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:45,578
I may have to go over
to the courthouse later.

213
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,181
Yeah, I'm, uh...

214
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,317
I'm actually heading over there myself.

215
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:54,220
The prosecution called me to testify.

216
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:55,789
I'm sorry, Joe.

217
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,366
You know how much I care about Barry,

218
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,327
but I have to tell them what I know.

219
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:04,998
I get it, you got to
do what you got to do.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,232
Yeah.

221
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:11,871
Do I need to repeat the question?

222
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,840
No, I heard it.

223
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:15,298
The person standing over

224
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:19,345
Clifford Devoe's body was Barry Allen.

225
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:21,348
No further questions, Your Honor.

226
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:27,944
Captain Singh, you stated
that you interviewed

227
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:30,757
Barry Allen five years
ago for the job of CSI.

228
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,094
I wonder, what was your
first impression of him?

229
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,762
He was young.

230
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,698
Had half the experience of
everyone else I interviewed.

231
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,800
Hmm. Why'd you hire him?

232
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,269
It was really something
he said in the interview.

233
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,709
Everyone always talks about

234
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:48,074
going after the criminal, the guilty.

235
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,810
But Allen said he wanted
to help the victims.

236
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,267
The innocents.

237
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:58,408
I thought Central City
deserved someone like that.

238
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:00,845
Allen is one of the good ones.

239
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:05,017
One of the good ones.

240
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,861
No further questions, Your Honor.

241
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,870
I'd like to redirect, Your Honor.

242
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,314
Proceed.

243
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:22,242
Would you cover for
Mr. Allen if you had to?

244
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:24,878
- No, of course not.
- No.

245
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,751
It says here in his personnel file

246
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,350
that he took a six-month sabbatical

247
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,582
to the Czech Republic.

248
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,584
Did he get approval from you first?

249
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,353
Not exactly.

250
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:34,921
He said it was for something personal,

251
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,423
I'm sure he had a good reason to go.

252
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,292
Is saving the world a good reason?

253
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:41,127
It also says in here that he was late

254
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,998
72 times in the past two years.

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,667
Did you ever ask him why?

256
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:50,904
No, because regardless
of what time he got in,

257
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,972
he always did his job.

258
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,974
I was just curious to
imagine what he does

259
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,343
with his time instead of being at work.

260
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:01,314
It's almost like he
has this secret life.

261
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:02,829
So in spite of all these infractions,

262
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:05,652
you never thought to discipline him?

263
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:07,020
What are you suggesting?

264
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:09,989
That whether you realized it or not,

265
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:11,491
you've been covering the ugly truth

266
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:13,064
about Mr. Allen for years now.

267
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,261
- That is not true.
- Is it true that he was

268
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,997
targeting and harassing Mr. Devoe?

269
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,066
Yes or no?

270
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,437
Yes, which is why

271
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,172
I granted Devoe the restraining order

272
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:27,967
and told Allen to stay away.

273
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,142
But that didn't stop him, did it?

274
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:30,777
He kept going after him
right up until the night

275
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:34,113
- that Mr. Devoe was killed.
- Objection! Conjecture.

276
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:35,482
Withdrawn.

277
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:38,585
Captain, now, you said that Mr. Allen

278
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:41,225
wants to help the
victims, or the innocents.

279
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,022
But disappearing for months at a time

280
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,924
and being late 72 times

281
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:46,659
doesn't sound like he wants to help

282
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,729
or care for anybody but himself.

283
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:53,099
Now, do you still think that
he's one of the good ones?

284
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:02,709
Hope you're right about this.

285
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:04,010
Oh, trust me,

286
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,513
I'm very good at reading body language.

287
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:07,847
Right now, you're tense.

288
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,415
Huh, now you're annoyed.

289
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:12,519
Ooh, here we go.

290
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,891
- Yahtzee.
- Did you get that?

291
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:20,751
Oh, Ralphie got it.

292
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,106
I smell an acquittal.

293
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:30,069
As we thought might
happen, we are in trouble.

294
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:33,076
David's testimony hurt us, but
we still have a few options.

295
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,374
What are they?

296
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,209
I can go to Slater, I
can ask for a plea deal,

297
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:38,811
maybe get you a shorter sentence.

298
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,444
Or we could use an insanity defense.

299
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,376
No, both those options

300
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,118
are admitting I'm guilty, and I'm not.

301
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,453
Fine, then the only
other way out of this

302
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:48,922
is for you to testify.

303
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,857
Cecile, I'm sorry, I won't do it.

304
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:53,826
All of the evidence, every
bit of it, it points to you.

305
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:56,251
If you're not willing to take
that stand and defend yourself,

306
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:58,932
then this is an impossible case.

307
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm not taking a stand.

308
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:02,201
Barry, even if that means
turning this case around

309
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,603
and not going to jail?

310
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:06,072
Iris, if I testify, I have to lie.

311
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,942
I commit perjury, I become
exactly who they think I am.

312
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:10,543
Then don't lie.

313
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:13,046
- What?
- Tell the truth.

314
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:15,148
Tell everyone you're The Flash.

315
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:20,687
Barry, if the court
knows you're The Flash,

316
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:24,123
then you can explain everything
and they'll believe you.

317
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,259
Prosecution's gonna wrap up soon.

318
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,294
I need your answer today.

319
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,963
This is the only way, Barry.

320
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,698
Tell the city you're The Flash.

321
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,761
This is all we got?

322
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:41,561
- This isn't a lot to go on.
- I know, okay?

323
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,121
We're lucky we even got this footage.

324
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,063
- Why?
- For some reason,

325
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,665
all the security cameras were fried.

326
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,367
Hey, guys, I was just at the hospital

327
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,669
going over the medical records

328
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:49,971
of everyone who was at the bank.

329
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,271
I know why they passed out.

330
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,605
Why did they pass out?

331
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,178
Well, they all suffered from fatigue,

332
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:57,149
vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rashes.

333
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:59,452
So everyone ate a bad burrito?

334
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:02,499
No, radiation poisoning.

335
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,317
That's why the security
cameras are fried.

336
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,030
- Mm-hmm.
- We got to find this guy

337
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,353
before he poisons the whole city.

338
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:10,189
- Yeah, or worse.
- Hmm?

339
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,492
Guys, if this meta can cause
these levels of radiation

340
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,260
in these patients, that means this meta

341
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:16,996
has a similar makeup to a nuclear bomb.

342
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:19,089
So, like, enough to blow us all up?

343
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,300
What are we talking here?

344
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:21,968
The fallout from a nuclear explosion

345
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,236
could be catastrophic.

346
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,672
- Exactly.
- Fallout.

347
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,608
- Great name.
- Terrible power.

348
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,977
Okay, I'll see if the satellite

349
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,612
can track his radiation signature.

350
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:36,827
Mrs. Devoe, when did
you first meet Mr. Allen?

351
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,313
Um...

352
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:43,702
Mr. Allen showed up at my
house almost two months ago

353
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,425
claiming to be investigating

354
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,360
one of Clifford's former colleagues.

355
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:52,165
We reassured him that we didn't
have information to help him.

356
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:55,568
But Mr. Allen persisted and
continued to harass my husband.

357
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,913
And what prompted the restraining order?

358
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,950
My husband has...

359
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:05,510
had advancing ALS.

360
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:08,842
I was alone with Kevin most of the time.

361
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,918
But something about Mr.
Allen's aggressive manner

362
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,789
just made me feel unsafe, so
we went to the authorities.

363
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,860
And we thought the complaint
would dissuade Mr. Allen.

364
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,196
But it didn't.

365
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,132
Psst.

366
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,839
Could you please describe for the court

367
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,942
the last time that you saw your husband?

368
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:39,078
It was Christmas.

369
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,948
And Clifford wanted
to confront Mr. Allen.

370
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,150
He had hoped that in the holiday spirit,

371
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:48,221
he could convince him to let us be.

372
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:49,789
And I...

373
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,792
I begged Clifford not to go.

374
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,861
But even with his disability,

375
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,630
Clifford insisted that it was his job

376
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:01,300
as my husband to protect
us, to protect me.

377
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,366
He didn't want to live in fear, so...

378
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,897
He left...

379
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:13,913
And I wish... I wish
I could have stopped him

380
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:18,139
and stepped in and
told him not to do this.

381
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:20,976
But I let him go.

382
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:35,092
No further questions, Your Honor.

383
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,761
Your Honor, I would like to enter

384
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,770
Exhibit F into evidence.

385
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:39,889
Objection, Your Honor.

386
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,941
Why wasn't this entered into discovery?

387
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:44,143
Oh, I've only recently
received this new evidence.

388
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,342
May we approach?

389
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:46,978
Your Honor, there are protocols

390
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,681
that need to be observed.

391
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,389
This is my courtroom, Mr. Slater.

392
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:52,325
I'll run it any way I see fit.

393
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,236
I'll allow it.

394
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:00,907
These photographs were
taken earlier today.

395
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,733
Mrs. Devoe.

396
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,013
Could you tell me please

397
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:08,911
who is the man that you're
kissing in that photograph?

398
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:11,991
It is most certainly not
your husband, correct?

399
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,436
His name is Dominic Lanse.

400
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,339
And how long have you known Mr. Lanse?

401
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:19,726
A few months.

402
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,694
So it appears to me that
perhaps your marriage

403
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:25,292
was not quite as perfect
as you've portrayed.

404
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:28,634
Maybe you were ready for a
life without your husband.

405
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:30,603
So you ran into the arms of another man,

406
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:35,708
another man you convinced
to kill your husband.

407
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,850
Clifford and I met Dominic Lanse

408
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:46,753
at an ALS charity gala months ago.

409
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,821
He was there to honor his father,

410
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:51,035
who had recently passed
away with the disease.

411
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,730
Clifford noticed the bond
that Dominic and I shared,

412
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,133
long before I did.

413
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:02,878
My husband was happy that
I found someone to talk to,

414
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:07,105
and he urged me to turn to Dominic

415
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:11,144
for the needs and comforts
he could no longer fulfill.

416
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,613
My husband wanted me to be happy.

417
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:23,433
Clifford didn't see my
relationship with Dominic

418
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:25,825
as a tool to pull us apart

419
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,027
but to bring us together.

420
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,830
And it did.

421
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:34,734
My heart will always belong to Clifford.

422
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,840
No further questions, Your Honor.

423
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,213
You're excused.

424
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:50,603
- Okay, that did not go well.
- What's your decision, Barry?

425
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:55,308
I'm not gonna do it.

426
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:05,251
Marlize.

427
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,253
Mrs. West-Allen, I don't
think it's appropriate

428
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:08,855
for the two of us to be seen talking.

429
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:11,658
Oh, please. No one is watching,

430
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,461
so you can drop that
ridiculous act already.

431
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,463
Hmm.

432
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,264
If you insist.

433
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:25,472
- Why are you doing this?
- Hmm.

434
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,040
What is wrong with you?

435
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,542
It's not about what's wrong with me.

436
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,478
It's what's wrong with the world.

437
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,013
There are problems
bigger than your husband.

438
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,448
Such as?

439
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:43,857
Whatever it is that you are up to,

440
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:46,726
it will come to an end.

441
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:49,865
Such passion. I had that too

442
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:51,998
when Clifford and I first got married.

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,135
But passion fades, and what remains,

444
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:58,438
if you are fortunate
enough like Clifford and I,

445
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,908
is something deeper than
ardor that cannot be destroyed.

446
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,944
Then why are you so hell-bent
on destroying our lives?

447
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,147
I am doing what I have to do

448
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:10,048
for my husband, Mrs. West-Allen.

449
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:13,019
The question you should truly be asking

450
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,488
is, what are you
willing to do for yours?

451
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:20,627
Hope you enjoy the rest of the show.

452
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,436
Still no word from the courthouse.

453
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,420
- That's good news, right?
- No news is good news?

454
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,840
No, good news is good news.

455
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:36,242
No news is miscommunication.

456
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:40,046
The satellite was able to
track a spike in radiation

457
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,915
downtown on Main Street. We found him.

458
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,116
Fallout's on the move.

459
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:44,350
We got to get down there now.

460
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:45,618
I'll monitor him from here.

461
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,987
- Harry, time to book it.
- Yep.

462
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:55,495
- I got two rads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

463
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,892
- Hey, hey, stop!
- Hey!

464
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:00,632
Stop! Stop!

465
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:01,968
Stop!

466
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:06,371
What's going on out there?

467
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,843
Nuclear waste tanker.

468
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,779
Sorry!

469
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:15,014
- Idiots.
- Okay.

470
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:16,616
Move along.

471
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,962
Mr. Slater, call your next witness.

472
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,363
Thank you, Your Honor.

473
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:33,466
Your Honor.

474
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:35,201
There's something you
need to know right now

475
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:36,998
that will alter the
outcome of this case.

476
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,873
Mrs. West-Allen, I have no idea

477
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,609
what you think you're doing.

478
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,178
Explaining what my husband won't.

479
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,241
Barry Allen is...

480
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,378
Barry Allen is...

481
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:56,862
The Fla...

482
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,033
What's happening?

483
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:03,636
We're moving so quickly
that everyone else is still.

484
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:05,571
How are you able to do this with me?

485
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:07,940
I actually don't know.

486
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:10,843
Iris, hey.

487
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,913
I already decided not to
tell anyone else who I am.

488
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:16,382
Barry, if the jury knew
that you were The Flash,

489
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,284
there is no way that
they would convict you.

490
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,719
I'm trying to protect you, okay?

491
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:23,923
If everyone knew my secret,
we would never stop running.

492
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:26,659
I would rather run forever with you

493
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,727
than stand alone without you.

494
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:30,663
It wouldn't just be us running.

495
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:33,199
Everyone that has stood
by us the last four years

496
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,634
would have a target on their back.

497
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:38,537
If criminals knew my name,
they'd know my weakness.

498
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:42,721
I'm trying to be strong, Barry.

499
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:44,210
I know.

500
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:46,579
I can't anymore.

501
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,249
How can you?

502
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:54,486
My dad. He went through this too.

503
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,558
The trial is not over, Barry.

504
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,227
Yeah, it is.

505
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:04,229
All the evidence points towards me.

506
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:06,732
Can't tell them, okay?

507
00:24:09,203 --> 00:24:11,170
Okay.

508
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,109
Yes, Mrs. West-Allen?

509
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:23,249
Um...

510
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:25,217
Your Honor...

511
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:27,753
Barry Allen...

512
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:29,255
is innocent.

513
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:34,126
And I just thought you
all should know that.

514
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:36,562
Thank you for your time. Okay.

515
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,474
If there was an award
for best crocodile tears

516
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:50,342
by the most emotionally
manipulative widow,

517
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:52,807
Marlize, definitely in the top three.

518
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,000
Let's snap something more
damning than a lip lock.

519
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:57,616
We're not here for that.

520
00:24:57,618 --> 00:25:00,085
Can you do your gross stretchy thing

521
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:01,754
and slip inside and open the door?

522
00:25:04,091 --> 00:25:06,225
Those are carpet fibers.

523
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:10,863
Those are from Allen's
loft, aren't they?

524
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,776
You're gonna plant
evidence to frame Marlize.

525
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:18,379
She was the only one

526
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:20,372
that could have planted Devoe's body.

527
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:22,274
Fibers on the treads of her shoes

528
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:24,376
places her at the crime scene.

529
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:27,746
This is the right thing to do, Ralph.

530
00:25:27,748 --> 00:25:30,349
Just open the door. I'll do the rest.

531
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,220
Okay.

532
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,889
It's a solid plan, Joe.

533
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:40,459
Subtle, but it's crafty
with a touch of pathos.

534
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:43,128
After this, you're gonna sit
back and kick up your feet

535
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,359
and sleep as sound as a
millennial after Burning Man

536
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:47,533
because you did the right thing.

537
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,406
You took down a bad, bad chick.

538
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:50,602
Ralph, could you hurry up?

539
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:52,037
And you're gonna ride that feeling

540
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,639
like it's Space Mountain.

541
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:55,808
And then when they catch you

542
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,277
and they take your badge and your gun,

543
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,912
that self-righteous indignation

544
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:01,947
is gonna keep your chest
puffed and your chin up

545
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:03,849
because you did the right thing.

546
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:05,632
Sure, you're gonna be
mad for a few years,

547
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:07,853
but that fades.

548
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:09,655
It evolves,

549
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:11,390
turns into self-pity.

550
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:13,759
A few more years, and...

551
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:16,762
your life is gonna be a
shell of its former self.

552
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:19,231
And then, one night,

553
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,533
it's gonna dawn on you that

554
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:24,136
you did the wrong thing.

555
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:25,971
It's gonna ruin everything.

556
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:27,573
Your colleagues won't talk to you,

557
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:29,585
your friends hav hvanished.

558
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,844
And your family?

559
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:35,214
It'll be like...

560
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,518
Like you were never born.

561
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,387
Because you turned into the very thing

562
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:44,456
that you swore to protect them from.

563
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,666
Anywho...

564
00:26:57,772 --> 00:27:00,105
Good luck with that.

565
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,520
Mr. Slater?

566
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,656
The prosecution rests, Your Honor.

567
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:20,492
Ms. Horton, are you ready
to present your case?

568
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,564
The defense rests, Your Honor.

569
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:35,274
Should've gone with the insanity plea.

570
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,310
Excuse me.

571
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:16,381
What's wrong?

572
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,391
What is going on?

573
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:35,934
There's a massive spike
in radiation downtown,

574
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,302
at Prentice and Rawlins.

575
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,006
The driver of the nuclear waste truck.

576
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:44,276
Radiation signature's already
at 3000 rads and climbing.

577
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:46,512
We need to stop this guy
before it hits 10,000.

578
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:48,147
What happens at 10,000 rads?

579
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,635
Hiroshima.

580
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:54,628
Barry Allen has dedicated his life

581
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,717
in service of Central City.

582
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,853
He's helped us solve countless crimes.

583
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,455
His testimony has led to the conviction

584
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,425
of dozens of criminals.

585
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,827
Barry Allen is a good man.

586
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:11,698
He's an innocent man.

587
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,246
And frankly, Central
City is lucky to have him.

588
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:17,882
Dare I say...

589
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:23,009
Few men in this city are as honest,

590
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,312
upstanding, and dependable.

591
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,483
Mr. Allen?

592
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,485
Your Honor, I...

593
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:34,053
I have to go.

594
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,969
Barry, what are you doing?

595
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:40,560
I have to.

596
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:45,391
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
this is an emergency.

597
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:46,566
Someone needs me.

598
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,789
And I need you to respect my courtroom.

599
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:52,005
I will not stand for
theatrical disruptions.

600
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:55,308
Your Honor, uh, my client
is still free on bail.

601
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,110
And there are no laws that require him

602
00:29:57,112 --> 00:30:00,880
to be present during closing statements.

603
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,016
Be advised, Mr. Allen.

604
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,907
You are required by law

605
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,587
to be here for sentencing.

606
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:09,789
Yes, Your Honor.

607
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,604
Stay where you are!

608
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:28,474
What is happening to me?

609
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,010
Hold it, right there!

610
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,378
I didn't do anything!

611
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,516
- You need to stop.
- I don't want to hurt anybody.

612
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,595
I understand, but your
radioactivity is dangerous.

613
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,448
- Guys?
- 7,500 rads!

614
00:30:58,451 --> 00:30:59,751
Barry, don't get too
close to him, all right?

615
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:00,907
The radiation he's emitting

616
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,342
is too hot to allow you to self-heal.

617
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,010
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

618
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,212
What am I supposed to
do? How do I stop him?

619
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,552
I can't stop this!

620
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:15,722
- Oh, damn.
- We need to cool him down.

621
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,624
Killer Frost.

622
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,203
- Great.
- Well, go, turn!

623
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:21,828
Well, that's not how it works.

624
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,896
I can't just snap my
fingers and make her appear.

625
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,565
It only happens when
I'm scared or angry.

626
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,367
Oh, good Lord, Caitlin.

627
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,805
The city's about to explode!

628
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,070
Everyone, everything you know and love,

629
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,339
the birds, the trees, the fish,

630
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:34,607
the puppies!

631
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:35,775
The puppies are going down

632
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:36,743
because you didn't want to...

633
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,111
Show up for work!

634
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:42,347
Thanks.

635
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,594
- That was pretty good, yeah?
- That was pretty good.

636
00:31:44,597 --> 00:31:46,419
- Now go already!
- Okay!

637
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,454
Okay, there you go.

638
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:50,957
What's going on?

639
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,126
Is this business or a social call?

640
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:55,261
Business, I see.

641
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:15,281
- She okay?
- She's gonna be okay, yeah.

642
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:17,483
Do you have any more ideas?

643
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,836
Where do I breach him?

644
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,053
Ramon, no, you...

645
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:21,854
You drop him a breach, he could explode.

646
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,672
And Fallout's fallout would kill us all.

647
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,191
Do you think?

648
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,993
Wait, what if I create
a vacuum around him?

649
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,461
That way, even if he does explode,

650
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,758
at least we contain the blast.

651
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,064
Yeah, yes, Allen, yes.

652
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,765
That... that could work,
that could contain it.

653
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,392
Whatever you're gonna
do, though, do it fast.

654
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,969
Fallout just went above 8,000 rads.

655
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,868
The vacuum's containing his energy.

656
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:49,415
Good.

657
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,484
But he's still getting stronger.

658
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:53,172
Allen, I don't know long

659
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,921
you can take this much radiation.

660
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:56,856
I don't have a choice.

661
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,558
We have to contain his energy.

662
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,660
Allen, 9,000 rads.

663
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,674
10,000 rads, critical mass.

664
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:09,610
Ramon, you need to send
that energy somewhere.

665
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,737
What? To where?

666
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,638
Earth-15, Earth-15 is a dead Earth.

667
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,806
Breach it there now!

668
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:55,281
- You did it.
- Oh, man, you did it.

669
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:58,718
You saved the day.

670
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,426
Ladies and gentleman of the jury,

671
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,094
you've reached a verdict?

672
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:09,529
We have, Your Honor.

673
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,798
All rise.

674
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:17,703
For Docket Number 5567-B,

675
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:21,941
in the matter of The People
vs. Bartholomew Henry Allen,

676
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:24,444
we, the jury, find the defendant

677
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:27,453
guilty of murder in the first degree.

678
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,081
Thanks to your meta metabolism,

679
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:44,375
your radiation burns should disappear

680
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:45,843
in the next few minutes.

681
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:48,379
- What about Fallout?
- He's unstable,

682
00:34:48,382 --> 00:34:49,833
but we sent him to Tracy's lab.

683
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,534
She's gonna analyze his DNA,

684
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:53,136
see if it's the same
as the other best metas

685
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,508
and then we'll be
able to neutralize him.

686
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,116
Superior Court, where minutes ago,

687
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,309
the jury found Bartholomew Henry Allen

688
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:01,077
guilty in the murder of
Professor Clifford Devoe.

689
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,655
Mr. Allen has been a CSI

690
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,309
with the Central City Police Department

691
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,216
for the last five years.

692
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:07,650
In just a few short hours,

693
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:09,185
the judge is expected to announce

694
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:10,687
Mr. Allen's sentence.

695
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:13,123
Prosecutor Anton Slater made a statement.

696
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,158
He hoped Mr. Allen would
receive a life sentence,

697
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,527
given the brutal nature of the cri...

698
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,496
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

699
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:21,398
I can't believe this is happening.

700
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,868
Come on, guys, we just
saved the city today.

701
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,103
We knew this wasn't
gonna go my way in court.

702
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:28,872
That doesn't mean that Devoe beat us.

703
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,807
Whatever happens, we're
gonna keep fighting.

704
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,776
I know.

705
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:34,110
We need to get you back.

706
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:36,179
You need to be there for sentencing.

707
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,082
Yeah.

708
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,398
I'll see you guys later, all right?

709
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,874
I'm gonna be okay, all right?

710
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:49,877
Come on.

711
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:54,657
You know you got your strength

712
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,300
from watching your dad be your rock?

713
00:35:57,302 --> 00:36:00,218
I got mine because...

714
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:03,522
you're mine.

715
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:05,675
I'll be strong for you.

716
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:08,976
I love you.

717
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:11,381
I love you.

718
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:14,184
Come on.

719
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:17,253
- Allen...
- Step back.

720
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:25,728
Yeah, I need a minute, all right?

721
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:32,035
Mrs. Allen, did you expect this?

722
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:35,939
Mr. Allen.

723
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,629
Devoe.

724
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,577
Did you know there was a 12% chance

725
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,614
that you were gonna tell
the world you're The Flash?

726
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,749
I'd recheck your math.

727
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:48,751
There's no need.

728
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:51,054
Because no matter what path you chose,

729
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:53,123
all avenues led to my triumph.

730
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,024
Why do you want us distracted?

731
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:56,559
Why do you want me out of the picture?

732
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,194
What are you planning?

733
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,130
At you think that you could understand

734
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:04,167
the breadth of what I'm about
to do is almost humorous.

735
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,835
Yes, I think you will miss Iris.

736
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,877
That's right, Mr. Allen.

737
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:16,146
I didn't just take Dominic's body.

738
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:18,749
I took his ability.

739
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,551
I know what you're thinking right now.

740
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:28,091
Well, I want you to hear me say it.

741
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:31,261
I'm gonna figure a way out of this.

742
00:37:31,263 --> 00:37:33,029
And when I do,

743
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,098
I don't care who's face you're wearing.

744
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm coming for you.

745
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:40,603
You haven't beaten us yet.

746
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,739
Haven't I?

747
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,713
Have a nice life, Mr. Allen.

748
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:07,530
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

749
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:10,833
I didn't do this, I didn't kill anyone.

750
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:14,726
And I know that one day,
the truth will come out.

751
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,029
Thank you.

752
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:18,874
Rise for sentencing.

753
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:26,115
In my 30 years behind this bench,

754
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,851
I have seen my share of criminals.

755
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:33,056
But I confess this
defendant stands apart.

756
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:37,360
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

757
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:40,196
A few hours ago, the
very existence of our city

758
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:43,099
came under the threat
of nuclear destruction.

759
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,768
But one man rose to meet that challenge.

760
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,706
The defendant was in a
position of authority.

761
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:54,677
Our city trusted him to
bring the guilty to justice.

762
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,779
He ran into danger,

763
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,359
knowing he would suffer
burns all over his body.

764
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:03,030
He used that trust to take an
innocent and vulnerable life.

765
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:05,488
This man was not thinking about himself.

766
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,056
He was thinking about you.

767
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:09,325
The first responders on the front lines.

768
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:13,413
Never have I seen a
defendant more unmoved.

769
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:15,732
Never have I seen a
man with more bravery.

770
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:17,929
Never have I seen such inhumanity.

771
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:19,179
Such heroism.

772
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:22,405
Such a lack of regard for human life.

773
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:25,642
It is my great honor to present

774
00:39:25,644 --> 00:39:27,477
Central City Police Department's

775
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,078
Award of Valor

776
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,447
to this city's finest hero.

777
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:34,550
The fastest man alive, The Flash!

778
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,820
The court hereby orders

779
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:39,609
that Bartholomew Henry Allen

780
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:41,045
should be incarcerated

781
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,824
for the rest of his natural life,

782
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:45,762
without the possibility of parole

783
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:49,465
and that Mr. Allen be
immediately remanded

784
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,168
to Iron Heights Penitentiary.

785
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,371
And may God have mercy on your soul.

786
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,785
Be seeing you around, B!

787
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,223
Get comfortable.

788
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,773
