1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,640
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
Neron must be looking
for a new vessel.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
Nora.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,280
- Nora?
- I don't like Nate.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,480
- That would be wrong and...
- He likes you.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,200
Why don't you talk to Nate,
tell him how you feel?

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,600
Mick's writing a Sci-fi
romance novel.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,760
- Rebecca Silver?
- Nom de plume.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,840
Nearly cost her own life,
but she killed that bloody demon.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,080
You're letting the cold in, man.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,600
We found something, sir.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,400
But it's hard to explain.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,720
Don't stand there like a fool,
spit it out.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,200
Something was encased
in the ice,

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,920
- and it appears to be...
- Gold.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Well, careful, sir.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
It's...

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
incredible.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,680
I haven't the foggiest what it is.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
I know exactly what it is.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,280
My greatest discovery.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,600
Yeah, that's what they all say.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,320
Oh, hey, ladies.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Is he any trouble?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
Slam dunk.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Honestly, with Neron gone,

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,160
catching fugitives
has never been easier.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,680
I thought it was gonna take all week.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,080
That's great, it means you won't
have to miss book club tonight.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,120
That's right.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Book club.

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Smells like somebody
hasn't showered

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
since birds were letters.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,280
That's a hieroglyphics joke.

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Nice.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,720
Buddy, don't talk
with your mouth full, am I right?

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,560
Mummy's are the biggest dummies.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,240
Hey, you big dummy, mummy,
got your containment cell all set up,

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,800
and we upgraded you
to a king size sarcophagus.

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Oh, and would you like a wake-up call
from the front desk in,

41
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,400
I don't know, about a thousand years?

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Nice.

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
All right, cool.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,920
I mean, what the hell was that?

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
- On it.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
Z, how's it going?

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,360
It's going super awesome.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,080
How are you and Nate?

50
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Good.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,280
Nate Dog?
It's... it's going totally great,

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
in a super platonic way.

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,640
Then why you guys being so weird?

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,320
It was that awkward, huh?

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
Even the mummy thought
it was awkward.

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,080
Look, I mean, you like him, right?

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,800
Yeah, I think so, but I don't know
what the next step would be.

58
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,200
Oh, that's easy
you just jump his bone.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,320
What if I do that
and I screw up our friendship.

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,800
Look, Z, sometimes for the good
of the relationship,

61
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,440
you have to put yourself outside
of your comfort zone.

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,560
For instance,

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,800
I am going to read 500 pages
of some trashy novel

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,400
by tonight for Ava.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,000
And look, with Neron gone,

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,920
now's the time for us
to get our personal lives into order.

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
I will help you.

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Please don't.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Relationship expert.

70
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,800
<i>I showed him my locket, explaining,</i>

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,080
<i>I keep the ones I love in here,
close to my heart.</i>

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,480
<i>Gustavo replied, "I keep the ones
I love in my freezer,</i>

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,200
<i>close to my microwave."</i>

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>He had a devilish sense of humor
that I found irresistible.</i>

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Hey, Ray.

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,480
I was just reading
our book club book to Nora.

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,200
Oh, that's really nice, Mona.

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
Ray, are you okay?

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
You look like you haven't slept
in days.

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,400
Oh, yeah,
I've been having weird dreams.

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
How is she?

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,760
No improvements, but no setbacks.

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,400
- Any news from Constantine?
- Nothing yet.

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
Well, I'm sure he'll find a way
to bring her back.

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
I'll leave you two alone.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,600
I brought you some more flowers,

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,960
because when you do wake up,
I want you to know that

88
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,680
your life is gonna be beautiful
from now on.

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
What the hell?

90
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
What's happening?

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,160
Ray, what are you doing
with the pillow?

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
You smothering,
you're smothering her?

93
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Not groovy.

94
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
Not groovy at all.

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
What just happened?

96
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
What are you doing?

97
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,280
Why did you try to smother Nora?

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Are you losing it, Ray?

99
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,840
Oh, I don't think you're crazy, Ray.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Let's chat, just Ray and Neron.

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Neron?

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,040
No, no, you're, you're dead.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,800
{\an5}You're dead, this, this isn't real.

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,480
{\an5}- This isn't real.
- Not real?

105
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
This is, this is all in my head.

106
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,800
{\an5}This is, this is all in my head.

107
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,280
- Okay?
- Ray.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,920
Oh, wow, this place is a mess.

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Hey.

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,760
{\an5}Containment Level bathroom
is sort of my crying spot.

111
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,200
- Not now, Gary.
- Okay.

112
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Okay.

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,000
You're a reasonable man, Ray Palmer.

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,880
So I'm going to make you
a reasonable offer.

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,200
Give yourself to me freely.

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
No.

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,400
No, this conversation is over.

118
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,040
{\an5}You leave me no choice

119
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,160
{\an5}but to make you kill
someone you love.

120
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,440
{\an5}You... you made me try to kill Nora,
but why?

121
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,240
{\an5}Because if you murder
someone you love,

122
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
your soul will be mine.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,880
What is happening?

124
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
{\an5}Oi, Mick, fancy a brew?

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
{\an5}Laundry.

126
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,680
Oh, sorry, sorry.

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
I'll be in the science doing lab.

128
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,360
Nobody bother me or my hand.

129
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,600
Haircut.

130
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,280
What's all this ruckus?

131
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,240
- Hey.
- Hey, I got it.

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,440
Is this fan mail for Rebecca Silver?

133
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,840
No, it is not.

134
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
- Here, give me that.
- What...

135
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
<i>"An invitation for Rebecca Silver
to reveal her identity</i>

136
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,720
<i>at Romanti Con 2019 for $20,000."</i>

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,280
Rebecca doesn't do Cons.

138
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
{\an5}Now, Mick, I realize
that you don't like people

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
{\an5}knowing that you moonlight
as a romance novelist, but...

140
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,080
Do I look like
a romance novelist to you?

141
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
Oh, listen, don't you get mad at me.

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
Now this is an easy score,
and we're gonna get that money.

143
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,360
Twenty K.

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
How?

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,440
Well I'll be Rebecca, mate.

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,240
Okay.

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
Page one.

148
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Will have to wait.

149
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280
All right, people, we've got a hit.

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,640
New York City, 1933,
the Adventurers' Society.

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
Shut the front door.

152
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
What's the Adventurers' Society?

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
It's a club for archeologists
and explorers.

154
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,600
{\an5}It's basically the coolest place
in history.

155
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
Guys, this is gonna be awesome.

156
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,680
Nate, you're running point
on this one with Zari.

157
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
- For real?
- For real?

158
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,960
Sara, we did not discuss this.

159
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,120
Look, relax,
it's just a cleanup job.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
They'll do fine.

161
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,640
Okay, find the fugitive,
bring him in,

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
preferably in one piece.

163
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Now scram.

164
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Yep.

165
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
{\an5}You're willing to risk
an entire mission

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
to play matchmaker?

167
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I sure am.

168
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,040
Honestly, I'm getting
a "just friends" vibe.

169
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,160
I bet you 20 bucks
they hook up on the mission.

170
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I will take that.

171
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,200
You and I running this mission
won't be weird at all.

172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,000
- Yeah, it's gonna be super chill.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,240
And just because
Sara and Ava are busy,

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,560
doesn't mean everybody else is.

175
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Yes.

176
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,920
Let's rally the troops.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

178
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Raymond, we got a legit
Time Bros mission.

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
What? Time...

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Time Bros, that's us.

181
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,200
Look, I just... I got some stuff
I am doing here.

182
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,800
Come on, put the "schmience" away.

183
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
We got a magic blip.

184
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,720
Look, right now it's just
me and Zari.

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,680
And if I'm being totally honest,
it's a little awkward between us.

186
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,240
So I could really use my wingman.

187
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,840
I was doing some
interesting stuff here.

188
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,160
It's something
that has to do with me.

189
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Busy working on a vaccine
for Ner... Ner.

190
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,560
- For what?
- Ner...

191
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
You all right?

192
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,640
- I got it.
- You, you do... you do?

193
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,880
This is about Nora.

194
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,240
I'm sitting here going
on and on about me and Zari.

195
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm not even thinking about
what you must be going through.

196
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,560
I am sorry for being a bad friend.

197
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Bring it in.

198
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
What kind of punk ass hug is that?

199
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,080
Bring it all the way in, Raymond.

200
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Hug me.

201
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,360
Look, whatever you're working on,

202
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
you're gonna kill it.

203
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
You're gonna absolutely murder it.

204
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
- Ray.
- Yeah, I just, sort of

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,040
sometimes like to do
a pre-mission message, you know?

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,800
Just to limber up before
we get out in the field.

207
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Little too much?

208
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Yeah.

209
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Well?

210
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,560
Say hello to Rebecca Silver.

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
Try these.

212
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Perfect.

213
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
Nice getup.

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
So you guys heard
we're headed to the 30s?

215
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,960
- No.
- Well, you are.

216
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
Sara put Nate and me in charge.

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh, you and Nate finally gonna...

218
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Stop, stop.

219
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
Okay, guess what?

220
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
You're on the Waverider,
so you're going.

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
Jumpship's got a full tank,
though, yeah?

222
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,240
Do you have somewhere to be?

223
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,880
Oh, best you don't pry, love.

224
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,880
Just like I'm not asking
about that naughty little number

225
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,280
Sara left behind for you to wear.

226
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Check your closet.

227
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,880
- Rory, do you wanna maybe...
- Plans.

228
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay.

229
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,600
I can't believe everyone else
bailed on the mission.

230
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,760
More Adventurers' Society for us.

231
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,760
All right, let's do this.

232
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,320
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

233
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,520
I... I know these costumes
are totally ridiculous.

234
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
You... you... you look absolutely.

235
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
Yeah, ridiculous.

236
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,240
Apparently it's all part
of a cover story Sara gave me.

237
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I'm someone named Marion Ravenwood.

238
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Wait.

239
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
Wait a second.

240
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
Well, it says here
I am Dr. Henry Jones Jr.

241
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Professor of archeology,
expert in the occult,

242
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,480
and how does one say this?

243
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,320
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

244
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,120
It's Indiana Jones.

245
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Yeah.

246
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,120
Sara set us up.

247
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
What's that?

248
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,240
Adventurers' Society,

249
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
everyone else unavailable
for the mission,

250
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
dressing up like your favorite movie,

251
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,400
it's all a set up to send us
on the perfect date.

252
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,160
I totally get if you wanna go
back to the ship.

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Or...

254
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,880
we can see where
this mission takes us.

255
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,640
<i>We believe in the summer sun</i>

256
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,840
<i>Neon rays, I'm gonna get me some</i>

257
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
<i>Golden light come shine
On everyone</i>

258
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,040
Oh, Mick, we're gonna make
a killing off of these people.

259
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,560
Does Rebecca Silver belong
in sci-fi erotica or cyber erotica?

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,320
Rebecca Silver defies all categories.

261
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Excuse me, you are?

262
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,240
It's me you should be
talking to, actually.

263
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,960
I am Rebecca Silver.

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,800
And I do not appreciate the tone
that you're taking with my bodyguard.

265
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,600
Oh, goodness, Miss Silver,
the Recluse of Romance.

266
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
We are honored
that you will be making

267
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,000
your first public appearance
ever with us.

268
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,000
You look exactly as I dreamed.

269
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,240
I'm just here for the check, really.

270
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,120
Of course, and you will get it
after your public appearance,

271
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,360
Q&A, and book signing.

272
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,040
Oh, chitchat with a bunch of weirdos

273
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,520
dressed as some ridiculous
alien queen they all want to bang.

274
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
No problem.

275
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Number one, Garima is a warrior.

276
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,880
Number two, you're being rude.

277
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Rude?

278
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,120
That's rich coming from you.

279
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
You're the rudest person I know.

280
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
You don't get it.

281
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,240
You need training.

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
What time's the Q&A?

283
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,960
In two hours.

284
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,520
Good, we'll be there.

285
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,080
Let's do this.

286
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,640
Okay, page one.

287
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,720
Is this on audiobook?

288
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,000
<i>They say your life flashes
before your eyes when you die.</i>

289
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,040
<i>But what if in that moment,
you finally see everything</i>

290
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,480
<i>life's been trying to show you?</i>

291
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,080
<i>That's how I discovered
that a killer was amongst me.</i>

292
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
<i>I should've known
something was amiss that night.</i>

293
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,720
<i>I was returning from hot yoga
to my sensational cliff side home,</i>

294
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,960
<i>matcha green tea smoothie
in hand,</i>

295
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
<i>when I noticed my door
was slightly ajar.</i>

296
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
<i>I entered wondering if my dog walker
or cat sitter or personal shopper</i>

297
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,040
<i>or astrologer had failed to close it.</i>

298
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,160
<i>That's when I heard him say,</i>

299
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,360
<i>There's something
I've been meaning to kill you.</i>

300
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Ladies and gentlemen.

301
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,760
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

302
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,880
My esteemed colleagues,
the honor of having my flag retired

303
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,160
is only rivaled by the honor
of sharing my latest discovery.

304
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,200
To retrieve it required

305
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
not only besting the frozen wasteland
of the Arctic,

306
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,240
but also the physical limitations
of the human body itself.

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,480
But for the sake of exploration,
I prevailed.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,640
And so, without further ado,
I present to you,

309
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,640
Gordon Gilchrist's
Golden Mystery Egg.

310
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,080
Now, Vincent.

311
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,160
In the words of Ray and Mike Tyson,
I think we found our "myth-tery" man.

312
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,120
Come on, science.

313
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Something's happening.

314
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
I can feel my hand again.

315
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,040
No, no, no.

316
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
The infection...

317
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,000
is spreading.

318
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,880
Gideon, where in the timeline
is John Constantine?

319
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,480
<i>His last known whereabouts
were in 2019 with Gary Green.</i>

320
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,200
<i>Would you like me to connect,
connect...</i>

321
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,520
<i>What are you doing to me, Dr. Palmer?</i>

322
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Gideon?

323
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Gideon?

324
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
What?

325
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
What are you...

326
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,200
We can't have anyone spying
on us now, can we Raymond?

327
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,160
You're all alone now.

328
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Well,

329
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
it's you and me.

330
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Oh, yeah?

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,760
Well, I'll just... I'll just do this
the old fashioned way.

332
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
- Hello.
- Gary, hi.

333
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Ray Palmer here.

334
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,840
By any chance, have you spoken
to Constantine lately?

335
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
Worried about Nora, huh?

336
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
Yes, but no.

337
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm... I'm calling
on a more personal matter.

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,360
Say no more.

339
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,280
I will be right over.

340
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
What? No, no, no Gary.

341
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
No, Gary.

342
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
How can I help?

343
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Oh, no.

344
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
You hear something?

345
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
There's a guard.

346
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Okay.

347
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,640
Don't worry, I can talk
my way into anywhere.

348
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Excuse me, my good man.

349
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Can you point me
to the nearest facilities?

350
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,320
I have an urgent need to,
relieve my bowels.

351
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Let's go.

352
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,920
We are crushing this mission,
by the way.

353
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,000
No classic Legends mishaps

354
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,080
and only one historically
insignificant nobody received

355
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,360
blunt force trauma to the head.

356
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,080
And now we get our prize.

357
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Wait.

358
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Trip wires.

359
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,800
This is gonna require one of us
to squeeze through these trip wires,

360
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,560
maneuvering our bodies
in unexpected ways.

361
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,040
Are you asking me to do that?

362
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,240
No, I'm asking you to hold my coat.

363
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,040
When I wrote, "Uncaged Desire,"
I was trying to uncage my own desire.

364
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
A desire to, to...

365
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,680
to... oh, bollocks.

366
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,920
- What's the next bit, again?
- To feel life, not just live it.

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,840
You still don't know Rebecca.

368
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,880
Well, I know you and you're Rebecca.

369
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,080
Your primary mode of communication
is grunting like a caveman.

370
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,920
Besides, I mean, Rebecca Silver
is whoever we want her to be.

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
These people, they don't know
anything about her.

372
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,800
What are you talking about?

373
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
They read her books,
they read her letters.

374
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Her letters?

375
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,080
Do you answer your fan mail?

376
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,040
I just thought all this
was a big laugh at their expense.

377
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,200
Well, it's not.

378
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Careful.

379
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,240
The hell?

380
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
It's papier-mâché.

381
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,960
Oh, my God.

382
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,960
She did this all for us.

383
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,320
It's all a set up.

384
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,520
- No.
- Yeah.

385
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,640
- You think?
- Yeah.

386
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,600
It was a fake Magic-O-Meter alert.

387
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,600
Sara concocted this whole thing.

388
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,480
- I bet you they're actors too.
- Yep.

389
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,280
"Gordon Gilchrist"
with that ridiculous facial hair?

390
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,400
- The only that's missing, Nazis.
- Yeah.

391
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
What did you do with the egg?

392
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,520
The real egg?

393
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,440
Oh, wow, she really went all out.

394
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,600
- Hey.
- Oh, there you are.

395
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,280
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna make it.

396
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
This is a interesting choice
of venue.

397
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
We can't have book club without Nora.

398
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,360
It takes all three of us
for a book club quorum.

399
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,680
Very sweet.

400
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,280
- Cheers, babe.
- Thank you.

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,480
All right, so, who do you guys think
is the real killer?

402
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,520
Because I have my theories.

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,240
Oh, my God, this can't be real.

404
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,360
- I have to go now.
- What?

405
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,000
You just said that book club
requires all three of you.

406
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
It's Rebecca Silver.

407
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,200
She's revealing her identity
at Romanti Con tonight.

408
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,120
Rebecca Silver?

409
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,160
The sex-positive novelist
reinventing feminism.

410
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah, we know who she is.

411
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,000
Make sure you take lots of pictures.

412
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Oh, my God, thank you.

413
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,760
I can't believe
I'm going to be breathing

414
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,560
the same air as Rebecca Silver.

415
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,240
Okay, so.

416
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,120
What did you think of the book?

417
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,960
Oh, you wanna keep doing book club?

418
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,120
Babe, we don't have to,
we can just forget it.

419
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,720
I thought it would be nice for us
to be able to do something abuse.

420
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,160
It's so sweet, thank you.

421
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,800
I didn't read the book.

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,560
- What?
- Sorry.

423
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,000
Seriously?

424
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,880
Honestly, I... I usually just
drink rosé and let Mona go on and on

425
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,840
and use it as a mini-vacay
for my brain.

426
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,360
Well, it was actually
a really good book.

427
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,120
Wait, wait, wait, you... come on.

428
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,520
I can still drink rosé,
and you can go on and on.

429
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,960
Come on.

430
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,280
- Come on.
- Okay, fine.

431
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,360
So, I think the real killer
was the dog walker.

432
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,000
- No.
- Yes.

433
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,920
I mean, all that pent-up frustration,
and she treated him like a doormat.

434
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
You can't help me.

435
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
I need Constantine.

436
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
Well, I may not be
a master of the dark arts,

437
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,800
but I am an intern of the dark arts.

438
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,760
You're interning for Constantine?

439
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Yeah.

440
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,040
He's letting me study
his spell books,

441
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,480
if I water his plants while
he searches for a cure for Nora.

442
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,560
But besides,
what other options do you have?

443
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,600
Come on, tell the Garebear
what ails ya.

444
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,120
I... I don't know how to explain it,

445
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,960
but it feels like,
like there's something inside of me.

446
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Oh, yeah, you know,

447
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,760
there's a beautiful singer
inside of me,

448
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,040
but no one's ever gonna meet her.

449
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
No, no, Gary.

450
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,480
No, Gary, this is bad.

451
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,520
This is very bad,
and I don't know how to get it out.

452
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,160
Indigestion.

453
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,000
I know just the spell.

454
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,040
I'll have your pipes
cleared out in no time.

455
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Let me just look it up.

456
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh, good thing it's not a demon,
because if it was,

457
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,680
you wouldn't be able to tell me.

458
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,520
A weird rule
that keeps the victim silent

459
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,800
all the while trying to murder
a loved one

460
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
in order to seal in
the demonic possession forever.

461
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,960
- Why did you just stab yourself?
- I didn't

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,080
- You're possessed
- Yes.

463
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,200
I... I can help.

464
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,720
Where is the egg?

465
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,440
Take it easy, Hitler Youth.

466
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
The egg's broken,
it was a crappy prop.

467
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,160
The real egg.

468
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Do not anger me.

469
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,360
Look, this was a good effort.

470
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,680
Like really good,
but we've done Nazis before.

471
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,200
But, like, real Nazis.

472
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,360
So, if it's okay with you,
I would rather just...

473
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
pull the plug on this.

474
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,600
- Yep.
- My friend here is a surgeon.

475
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Oh, nice.

476
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,880
He will kill you until you tell me
where the real egg is.

477
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
Yeah, let's tell Sara we're onto her.

478
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Yeah.

479
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,760
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Sara, Nate and Zari Here.</i>

480
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,360
<i>First of all, well played.</i>

481
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,000
<i>Yeah, setting up this whole adventure</i>

482
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,360
<i>for us to go on a date
was way over the top.</i>

483
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,280
But in the same breath, very sweet.

484
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,480
And if I were to give a note,

485
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,680
the Nazis were just, like,
a tad too much.

486
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,360
What are, what are you talking about?

487
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,920
Are they in the same theater troupe
as Ava's parents?

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,240
<i>- What?</i>
- Sara, drop the act.

489
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
Nazis killing us
with throwing daggers?

490
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,160
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,080
Look, I did purposefully
put the two of you

492
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,520
on a mission together,
but this is a real mission.

493
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,640
Not a game.

494
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,040
<i>Those are real Nazis.</i>

495
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,880
And now, young lady, you die.

496
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,880
- Sorry, Nate.
- For what?

497
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,160
- You okay?
- Yeah,

498
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,680
it was actually really intense.

499
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,960
See, they took care of things
on their own.

500
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
And they were clearly
about to hook up.

501
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
- No, they weren't, wait.
- You owe me 20 bucks.

502
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Were guys about to hook up?

503
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,880
- It was definitely on the table.
- No, no, no

504
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
- See?
- See?

505
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,280
- Come on, it doesn't matter.
- I told you.

506
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,560
Okay, now that you know
it's a real mission, where's the egg?

507
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,040
Yeah, and where is Ray?

508
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,040
Isn't he supposed to be
quarterbacking on this?

509
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Ray?

510
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Ray, come in.

511
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,560
Nate, buddy,
don't go back to the ship

512
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
under any circumstances.

513
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
<i>You okay, buddy?</i>

514
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,760
Yeah, just, cleaning up
a storm over here.

515
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,240
<i>I don't want you to trip
and break your neck</i>

516
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,600
<i>on the mopped floors.</i>

517
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,840
Okay, bye.

518
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,800
Bye. Okay, that was weird,
even for Ray.

519
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
We should check on him.

520
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You go check on Ray,
we'll handle the egg.

521
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,240
I'm sorry that our first date
got ruined by Nazis.

522
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,760
Who says it's ruined?

523
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay, what do we know?

524
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,280
We found an egg, but it was fake.

525
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,560
Someone stole the real one.

526
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,560
Hey, what about that
Gordon Gilchrist guy?

527
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,080
He's the one who found it,

528
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,800
so I don't know
why he would have stolen it.

529
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,280
Although, I sort of think
his poor assistant Vincent

530
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
did most of the work.

531
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,400
- Wait, that's just like book.
- It is?

532
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,400
The book from book club.

533
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,640
Vincent is the doormat.

534
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,520
Look, it's always the doormat.

535
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,280
It was the dog walker in the book,

536
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,240
and now this Vincent guy's mad
that he didn't get any credit.

537
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,240
So we find Vincent, take the egg,
and wipe everyone's memories.

538
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Easy.

539
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,720
Ray, Ray.

540
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,480
Remember, if you kill a loved one,
Neron will take over.

541
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh, well, here's the thing, Gary.

542
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,800
I... I like you, but...

543
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,560
Yeah, got it.

544
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
Ol' Gare.

545
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,760
Not loved by the Legends,

546
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,640
bottom of the pecking order
at the Bureau.

547
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,880
Constantine's plant sitter.

548
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
Always the butt of the joke.

549
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,640
Gary, it's not like that.

550
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,480
<i>It is like that, Gary.</i>

551
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
<i>No one appreciates you.</i>

552
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,760
<i>They all think you're a fool
that they can use</i>

553
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,360
<i>whenever it's convenient for them.</i>

554
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,320
<i>But I respect you,
and I see your potential.</i>

555
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Neron?

556
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,600
Gary, don't listen to him.

557
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,840
He's trying to trick you.

558
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,360
<i>A demon can't renege on the deals
they make.</i>

559
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,000
<i>So you can believe me when I say</i>

560
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,440
I can make you whole again.

561
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Whole?

562
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,320
Rebecca, first let me say
that your novel,

563
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,480
"Uncaged Desires,"
was a sexual epiphany for me.

564
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,120
I can't say that I'm surprised.

565
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
My writing does have that effect.

566
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,080
But how did Officer Daphne
free Tank Tremors?

567
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,200
Can prison guards release inmates
just because they're in love?

568
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,320
Oh, well, you see that
was a metaphor.

569
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,160
After all, aren't we all in our own
prisons of desire?

570
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
Rebecca, in "Heat Waves,"

571
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,120
who is the unnamed villain
who's stalking Garima?

572
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
- Charlie?
- What is a villain?

573
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,880
Is it just someone
with a different point of view?

574
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,720
What's really stalking Garima
are the choices that she made.

575
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,880
So,

576
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,320
you're the real
Rebecca Silver, huh?

577
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Hi, yes.

578
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,840
I mean,
that is what I have embroidered

579
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,840
on my satin pillow cases.

580
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,720
Okay, then.

581
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,200
I have a question
about your novel, "Raw Hides."

582
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,200
When Captain Cash Harvey
fights the Prairie Bandits,

583
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,080
why does Nasgowa stow away
in his Conestoga wagon?

584
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,320
Well, you see,
that is also a metaphor.

585
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,640
That is not a metaphor.

586
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,240
She really did it,
and she died because of it.

587
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,920
The real Rebecca Silver would know.

588
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,480
I am the real Rebecca Silver.

589
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
I have tea with lemon.

590
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,560
I have a really small dog.

591
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
You're a fraud.

592
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,640
Where's the real Rebecca?

593
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,200
Where's the real Rebecca?

594
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,080
Where's the real Rebecca?

595
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,080
Where's the real Rebecca?

596
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,800
Right, go to hell,
you stinking mouth breathers.

597
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,160
Where's the real Rebecca?

598
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,360
Where's the real Rebecca?

599
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,560
- Where's the real Rebecca?
- Quiet.

600
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Give me that.

601
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,040
Nasgowa chased Cash for one reason.

602
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,440
It's the same reason humans
have gotten together

603
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,800
since the dawn of time.

604
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,560
It's why people like you
come to conventions

605
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,400
and dress up
as your favorite characters,

606
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,840
why a man
sits behind a desk, typing,

607
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,800
pouring out his heart...

608
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
why...

609
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
an author,

610
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,160
a writer, replies to fans.

611
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
It's connection.

612
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,200
Human connection.

613
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,000
I am Rebecca Silver.

614
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,480
You... you are Rebecca.

615
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,520
I'd recognize that wisdom anywhere.

616
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,880
I would've come sooner, Nora,
but have you any idea how hard it is

617
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,560
to acquire a phoenix's tail feather?

618
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
I didn't.

619
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
All right.

620
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,640
By the power above and below,

621
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,760
I call you on you, Nora Darhk,
to return to this plane

622
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,600
and rise reborn.

623
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Come on, love.

624
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,400
Come back to me, come on, love.

625
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Get Neron.

626
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,440
No, no, no, it's all right,
love, it's all right.

627
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
He's gone, you did it.

628
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
- No.
- He's gone.

629
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,760
He has Ray.

630
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Ray?

631
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,360
Gideon, where's Ray?

632
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,400
Nate, you shouldn't have come.

633
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Ray, what's going on?

634
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,880
You should leave.

635
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,320
You can't let me get near...

636
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,960
Ray, what are you saying?

637
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,080
You been acting so weird lately.

638
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,120
- Thought we are bros.
- It's not me.

639
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,480
No, see, it's N...

640
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,280
It's Ner...

641
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
What's near?

642
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,160
- Somebody's nearby?
- No.

643
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,640
All right, people, gather around.

644
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,120
Vincent?

645
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,520
What's the meaning of this?

646
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,840
I found it.

647
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
- Hand over the egg.
- I should get credit over it.

648
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
The egg is my accomplishment.

649
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,320
It belongs to me.

650
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,320
Everyone's memory of the egg
is about to be erased,

651
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,760
so don't get too bent out of shape.

652
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Not so fast.

653
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,200
Finally, the egg is ours.

654
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,960
Oh, man, these guys.

655
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm Ray, the wrist of me isn't.

656
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,280
Nate, you have to get out of here.

657
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,400
- You have to leave.
- I won't leave you buddy.

658
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,120
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

659
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
You have to go.

660
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,840
He's gonna make me kill you.

661
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,520
No, because I believe you, Raymond,
are stronger than he is.

662
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,920
Nate, I'm so sorry.

663
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,880
Why... why are you hitting me?

664
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Can't, stop.

665
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,440
We're bros.

666
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
We are bros.

667
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,600
No, no.

668
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
No.

669
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,480
Okay, I give up.

670
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,040
I give you up,
do you hear me, Neron?

671
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
I give up.

672
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,440
Spare Nate and I'll let you,
I'll let you have me.

673
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,800
Just promise me you won't hurt him,
and I won't resist.

674
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Deal.

675
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,960
It's nice to have a willing host.

676
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,440
But a promise is a promise.

677
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,240
We gotta get the egg

678
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,520
On it.

679
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,640
Okay, I got you.

680
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,120
See them whip skills?

681
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,360
Yeah, give me an idea
for a date night.

682
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,800
Oh, come on, now, don't be shy.

683
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,400
You're a little late, Johnny.

684
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,000
I've sort of taken over jolly
old Ray.

685
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,840
So you've lost a step.

686
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,800
That's the thing about mortals.

687
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,080
They age so quickly.

688
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,400
But don't worry, Johnny.

689
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,800
I won't let you die of old age.

690
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,840
Yeah, well,
I might be a little older, mate,

691
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,120
but I've picked up a few tricks
along the way.

692
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,880
- And that one's from Marie Laveau.
- Cute trick.

693
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,200
But we both know you won't
be able to hold it for long.

694
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,640
You're a parasite.

695
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,640
And I will separate you
from Ray Palmer.

696
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh, Gary.

697
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
Where have you been?

698
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,640
I was hiding in the lab,

699
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,920
then I heard noises.

700
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,760
Yeah, well, go and get
my steam trunk.

701
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,680
and we can exorcise this demon
right now.

702
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,840
Damn it, Gary, now is not the time

703
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,520
for you to be standing around
like some hapless idiot.

704
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,360
I can't hold this bastard forever.

705
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
Do it now.

706
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,440
Demands a lot from you,
doesn't he, Gary?

707
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,080
But what has he ever done for you?

708
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,960
I, on the other hand,
brought you a gift.

709
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Go ahead.

710
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Open it.

711
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,000
No, no, no.

712
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,360
Oh, don't accept anything
from him, Gary.

713
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,240
My nipple.

714
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,560
Gary, listen to me, that part of you,
it belongs to hell now.

715
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,520
All right? Don't let it seduce you.

716
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,280
The same way John seduced you
into being unicorn bait?

717
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,040
It's beautiful.

718
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,800
Oh, it's curse.

719
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,960
Now back away from it,
you bloody fool.

720
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It belongs to you, Gary.

721
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,960
Come on, Gary, think about
what you're doing, all right?

722
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,640
Don't give in to its temptation.

723
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
How'd I do?

724
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,760
Time dweeb.

725
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,120
The hell are you doing here?

726
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,120
- What do I do?
- Shut up, Gary.

727
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,160
I'm tired of being a doormat.

728
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,200
Gary, no.

729
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Well done, Mr. Green.

730
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,360
I'm whole again.

731
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,400
<i>All systems back online.</i>

732
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,960
So, Zari, some big moves back there.

733
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,640
Yeah, you were really brave.

734
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Thanks.

735
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
So why are you scared
to make a move on Nate?

736
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Nate.

737
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,560
What happened?

738
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,440
- Where is he?
- Who?

739
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Ray.

740
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
Neron's got him.

741
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,160
Sara, hey.

742
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,080
We got you a collectible
Romanti-Con tote bag.

743
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Who died?

744
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,240
Yeah, what's going on?

745
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,160
I have some bad news.

746
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,280
- I told you, I'm fine
- She's stable, Director.

747
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,920
- Thank you.
- Ava, you shouldn't be here.

748
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,360
You should be scouring every second
of the time line for Ray.

749
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,800
Agents are on it as we speak.

750
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,240
Oh, why did he do that?

751
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,880
Look, I know
you've been through a lot,

752
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,000
but I need your help.

753
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,840
My help?

754
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Why?

755
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,920
Because no matter how many agents
I send after Neron,

756
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,600
none of them can do what you do,
none of them,

757
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,480
have the powers you have, Nora.

758
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
And I trust you.

759
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,120
Nora Darhk, I am asking you
to face another demon,

760
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,040
but this time I am asking you
to face it

761
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,240
as a member of the Time Bureau.

762
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
Let's do this.

763
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
You haven't recovered yet.

764
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,640
We gotta track down Ray.

765
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,040
You will when you're better,
I promise.

766
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,720
You don't just throw a man down
with these sort of injuries.

767
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,640
- It's mean-spirited.
- Don't be a baby.

768
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,800
- Does this hurt?
- Yes, Zari.

769
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,160
It all hurts.

770
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,160
Well, where doesn't it hurt, Nate?

771
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Here?

772
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Yeah.

773
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Here?

774
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,600
I guess there's an upside
to getting pummeled.

775
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,040
You know how I never let anyone know
what I'm really feeling?

776
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,760
It's kind of your thing.

777
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,960
That's how I feel, Nate.

778
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,520
I feel the same.

779
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Gideon?

780
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,560
What kind of egg is that?

781
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,160
<i>I believe, Dr. Hayward,
it's a dragon egg.</i>

782
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Of course.
