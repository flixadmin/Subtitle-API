Clitus

3
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:27,113
Are you there

4
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:28,743
My angel

5
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,592
This is for you

6
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,873
What did the doctor say?

7
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,666
He said his jump was too much

8
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:44,003
I have a lot of power

9
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,295
Clitus I'm afraid

10
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:48,222
everything is going to be alright

11
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:50,592
They want to take my expression

12
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:53,776
They are sending me somewhere

13
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,269
That keep people like me

14
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:57,571
They can not do that

15
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,399
They can't take you from me

16
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:04,186
You are the only light

17
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,210
I have always loved you

18
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:09,029
Babe

19
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:10,733
leave me

20
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:16,706
Babe

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,540
نههه

22
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,181
نههه

23
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,227
Do not have the last word?

24
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:19,055
Welcome to your new home Francis

25
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,052
Will Clytus Cassidy be sentenced to death? Police are looking for more bodies

26
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,019
Did your old boyfriend finally get what he deserved?

27
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:47,102
And the world would be a safer place without it

32
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,665
Detective Mulligan with all due respect to you

33
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,930
I do not want to have anything to do with Clytus Cassidy

34
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:56,972
Well, it got very bad

35
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:58,795
Because he just wants to see you

36
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,581
I think you had a chance with Cassidy and ruined it

37
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,212
Right ... So, well

38
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
What do you want from me?

39
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:10,273
We want someone to know where the body is buried

40
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:14,319
So you have to do the right thing to change something

41
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:20,071
Nah

42
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,988
Get your little hands away from me

43
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,149
We have to get him out

44
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,173
Protect a city

45
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,414
What was he doing?

46
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,629
Leave me alone

47
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,265
Someone who can fly

48
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,843
It should not crawl on the ground

49
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:45,085
You eat leftovers

50
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:47,285
You better be quiet

51
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,644
I told you many times

52
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:54,732
Hide yourself while I work

53
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:55,904
I'm quite serious

54
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:58,066
The important thing is to respect

55
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,264
Respect? Yeah

56
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,436
Respect? Yeah

57
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,477
Ok ok

58
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,692
Someone is going to give you some information, right?

59
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:04,284
it's true

60
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:04,888
Not wrong

61
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,475
what do you mean?

62
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,363
Because you ruin everything

63
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:10,123
Oh, I understand you are talking about it again

64
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,497
I miss him

65
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,503
I will do it

66
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,672
I do not like you

67
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,091
Let me eat it

68
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:19,755
You

69
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:21,396
Merit

70
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:23,781
You do not have good things

71
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,841
hmmm

72
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,800
Welcome back Eddie Brock

73
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,881
I was thinking about you

74
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,450
What do you want, Clitus?

75
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,474
I mean, why am I here?

76
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:54,325
Can you do a favor to a person who is buried alive?

77
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,131
A message to all

78
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:59,644
Give me a fan

79
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:01,686
And in it

80
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,553
I will give you my life

81
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:05,477
What?

82
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:06,595
Story

83
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,674
The current narratives do not seem to be very useful

84
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:16,426
A scary and exclusive story like this

85
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,278
It takes you back to the top

86
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:22,616
continue

87
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:23,998
People love

88
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,463
Serial killer

89
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:32,854
All my secrets are yours

90
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,909
Eddie

91
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,932
A sign of killing

92
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,310
But why me?

93
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,054
I like you

94
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:45,651
OK. Accept

95
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
What is your message?

96
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:53,770
The church that is far away

97
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,408
Is the only thing i see

98
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:00,189
Broken Angel

99
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:03,991
My other half

100
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,950
Print this in your column

101
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,293
This?

102
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:12,524
Who is going to read this?

103
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,877
A mess

104
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:16,984
Print it

105
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:19,529
And whatever for me

106
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:21,854
It will be for you

107
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:23,603
Wow how lucky I am

108
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:25,786
Goodbye Eddie

109
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:27,637
thank you

110
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:29,549
I thank you

111
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,203
What a bitch

112
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:34,057
Look at Eddie

113
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:35,632
look

114
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:36,557
what are you doing?

115
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:39,109
I will do your job properly

116
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:47,748
Eddie

117
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,971
Don't forget me Eddie

118
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:03,674
what did you get?

119
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,315
I got a headache and

120
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,127
And I probably have tuberculosis too

121
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,451
Say it a little louder

122
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,272
You read me a poem, man

123
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:12,880
Is this a joke for you Eddie?

124
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,117
Because I do not laugh

125
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:15,862
Yes, you can laugh

126
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,539
Carefree man

127
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,157
These things take a while, right?

128
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,034
As soon as you find something - sure -

129
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,620
Do this sooner than the rest

130
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,672
Don't be embarrassed

131
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:25,945
OK

132
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,503
Do you understand?

133
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:28,323
Trust me

134
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:31,902
The only thing I do slowly today is buy chocolate ice cream

135
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,144
It does not freeze

136
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
come here

137
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:41,845
look

138
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:42,876
I am looking

139
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:43,755
Take them

140
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:47,482
OK

141
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:55,232
Okay

142
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,983
What do you think?

143
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,334
I think we are Pablo Picasso

144
00:10:59,365 --> 00:10:59,795
Nah

145
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:02,521
OK

146
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,287
Come see here

147
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,528
So tell me what do you see?

148
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:10,684
Umm a blood

149
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:11,372
ignore it

150
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:20,662
Oh I know what this one is

151
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,647
A tree

152
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,155
Take Eddie and sit down

153
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,255
Now

154
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:28,762
be careful

155
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:52,858
We hit you on the spot

156
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:54,662
لامصب

157
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,901
It can be said that your friendship with Clytus caused Cassidy

158
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,419
Solve this mystery that has not been solved for decades?

159
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,529
You are the only one you talked to from the outside

160
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,841
He seems to like you

161
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,208
Oh yeah he's a serial killer

162
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,233
I do not know how he might love someone

163
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,298
Brock was released with the help of the FBI, but police were unable to do so

164
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,103
Based on public sources

165
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:25,157
The mayor of California commented on

166
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,665
The harshest execution changed the sentence for Cassidy

167
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,423
Brock by this revitalizing move

168
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,321
Once again he returned to the top

169
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,877
The end of a tragic story

170
00:12:57,222 --> 00:13:00,174
The acquitted suspects and their families were relieved

171
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,354
Thanks for the courage

172
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:04,330
Thank you Eddie Brock

173
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:05,487
And I didn't

174
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:06,635
U know

175
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,666
We could be like this Eddie

176
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,463
Let's go out and solve the cases

177
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:13,479
Let's fight with a bad person

178
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:14,835
Maybe I should eat them

179
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,289
Let's have a good time

180
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,910
But our day ended well

181
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:21,293
نه

182
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:24,816
You said I could eat bada

183
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,551
This issue again?

184
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,285
I must be free

185
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:30,636
Let the wind pass through my hair

186
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:33,082
And I can feel the sand on my toes

187
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,106
You have no hair

188
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,933
You do not listen to me

189
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:37,341
Oh, I'm listening

190
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:40,103
I can no longer live like this

191
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,340
I'm starving

192
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,379
Well eat them

193
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,699
I can not

194
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:47,222
Sonny and Evil are my best friends

195
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:48,246
Are you serious?

196
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,559
... This is ridiculous

197
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,386
It was a bad move

198
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,605
It was a really bad move

199
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,349
And this is a $ 2,000 TV

200
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:03,430
You have to control yourself

201
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,246
That's why we have this billboard (to vent your anger on this)

202
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,687
I can't live with chicken and chocolate

203
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,080
I need a brain

204
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,358
Chickens also have brains

205
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,839
I totally disagree with you

206
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:14,701
look

207
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:17,115
Look at that poor idiot

208
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:19,803
Their brains are small

209
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,318
It is not their fault

210
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,807
You live for Fenilava Lafnilafva

211
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,377
Technical lafawalalai

212
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,291
Yes, I said the same thing - I told you a thousand times -

213
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,844
Because it is found only in the brain and chocolate

214
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:32,766
Because it is found only in the brain and in chocolate - and in chocolate -

215
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,009
Yes its true

216
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:36,321
Well, look at this as long as you live in my body

217
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,422
You live by my rules

218
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:40,469
I live in your body because - why -

219
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:43,407
Unfortunately, I have no other choice

220
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:45,608
How is this, Han?

221
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:50,358
The FBI is still investigating the issues we were involved in

222
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:52,951
So if another head disappears

223
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,928
They take us to Area 51

224
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,397
They kill our couple

225
00:14:57,757 --> 00:14:59,084
... so one must

226
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:00,709
Take responsibility

227
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:02,022
... assume responsibility

228
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,670
It's stupid

229
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:08,998
Food

230
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,381
Can you be carefree for a minute?

231
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:11,209
Food

232
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,452
Please do not continue

233
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:12,881
Food

234
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,952
Diet

235
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,881
God damn you

236
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,540
Good evening Eddie - Hello Ms. Chen -

237
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:26,697
Not a contemporary fever

238
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:28,438
Hello, I am at your service

239
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:29,834
Chocolate has not yet arrived

240
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,360
Oh, no, no

241
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:33,009
We have an appointment

242
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
So now what?

243
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,720
Can't you protect me anymore?

244
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,303
I do not think you can do that

245
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:40,017
I kept my mouth shut and fed that little secret

246
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:43,993
Wow, look at Ms. Chen Pir, what has been extorted from her, huh?

247
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:46,532
I'm not old at all, I'm 39 years old

248
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,384
And I'm very hungry, too

249
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,243
Let me see

250
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,988
I want to eat Ms. Chen

251
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:53,438
No, no, you can not eat Ms. Chen

252
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,431
What?

253
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,079
I think I should use an alternative map

254
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,290
What is an alternative plan?

255
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,954
Aaaaaaah, not this again

256
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,845
I need a human brain

257
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,083
I need it to survive

258
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:07,747
Nope

259
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,098
Let's go get some chickens, man, let's go

260
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,729
This is a few games

261
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,198
See how much we can do awful

262
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:39,484
We are depriving our talent

263
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:49,947
Oh, a bad person

264
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,708
Sliding bars

265
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:00,529
Windom, Walsh Conn

266
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,731
Let go, let go

267
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,255
I'm going to hit you on the head now

268
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:05,880
No, you do not

269
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:07,731
I play bowling with him

270
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:08,621
You do not

271
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:12,207
I'll take him to ... What was his name when we loved him, Eddie?

272
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,315
His name was Lucky Strike.

273
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:16,066
His name was Lucky Strike

274
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:17,535
"I want to take her to" Lucky Strike

275
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,722
I get 300 points in each game

276
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:20,246
No, you do not

277
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,925
The rest of the body stays here

278
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,629
Make the wrong soil and blood

279
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:27,457
Oh my God

280
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,004
No, let it land

281
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:33,028
No, no, no, no

282
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,067
OK

283
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,863
The woman did not need our help

284
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:44,425
He did not want to help us, Eddie

285
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:45,716
These are different

286
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:51,535
جانمی جان

287
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:53,600
On the back of the line, Eddie

288
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,459
Hey, Anne

289
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,513
Hey, Ed-Eddie Hello

290
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,107
Hi

291
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:04,364
Talk to him kindly - you breathe -

292
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:06,224
Bad when I did not call?

293
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:08,122
... No, not at all, I just had

294
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,583
I was just going out for a while (another meaning: I just got hung up)

295
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:11,888
Oh well, oh me

296
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:14,865
Sorry I did not answer the calls ... I think

297
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:19,098
I wanted one space, then all ... those adventures

298
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,200
... that space covers people's heads, well

299
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,341
Oh, good old days

300
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,185
Anyway, I have some news and I wanted to see if we could see each other?

301
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:28,700
اررررههه - yeah, surely -

302
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,271
It will be very good, great

303
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,108
Okay, how about tomorrow night?

304
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,391
tomorrow night? Well, very good

305
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:37,446
8 oclock?

306
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:38,672
(Restaurant name)

307
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:39,438
Ok great

308
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,430
I'm so excited - yes I am too, goodbye -

309
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:42,055
Very good

310
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,578
Confused with the doctor

311
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,547
It was the voice of a woman I was just hitting

312
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:55,784
stop

313
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,229
Don't you want to be the most handsome?

314
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,885
You always get rid of my head

315
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:07,933
Wow

316
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:08,979
Hey

317
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Hey

318
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:21,173
What a waste

319
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,200
So ... how are you?

320
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,630
How about Jenap (says the dog)? - Good, good -

321
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:29,013
Kunshu still learned this from you

322
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:32,412
How is your neighbor?

323
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,926
Well, you know how much I love "Underdogs" - yeah -

324
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,957
Yes, you have been interested in this for a long time

325
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,434
Nicely said

326
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:41,942
... Well, then

327
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:42,504
Okay

328
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:43,927
Okay??

329
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:48,378
Eddie, I thought I'd better tell you personally

330
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:54,027
نه

331
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,098
Wow, wow wow ... wow wow

332
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,005
It's a lot bigger than what I got for you

333
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:03,527
O miserable humiliation

334
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,457
Didn't Dan buy it? The same Dr. Dan

335
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,893
Yes, Dan bought it

336
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,566
Oh damn it

337
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,036
are you alright?

338
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:13,090
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either.

339
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,191
You can just say congratulations and I'm happy for you

340
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:20,230
You know, like two people who care so much about each other that they lie to each other

341
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:21,941
That one does not feel like garbage

342
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,887
Maybe we can do that model

343
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:26,441
You know ... you know I'm happy for you

344
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:29,035
Um ... congratulations to you - no -

345
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,285
thank you

346
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,699
We were going to marry him, Eddie

347
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:35,457
I personally pray

348
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:37,285
Five lambs under the trailer

349
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:40,504
Everything should be sausage

350
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:41,051
What?

351
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:42,360
What was that?

352
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
What? Nothing

353
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,879
If I ask you a question, can you tell the truth?

354
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,910
Do you mean, for example, why am I not so happy with you?

355
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:57,052
Because of your marriage? ... Because you just told me to lie, well this one

356
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:58,356
I am confused

357
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,520
Whats the name?

358
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:01,630
He is dead

359
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,528
Saw the spirits of Ummah

360
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:04,755
... Yes, um

361
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,481
Ok - ok -

362
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,523
...Okay

363
00:21:11,224 --> 00:21:12,224
... this

364
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:14,997
You do not change, do you?

365
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,872
What are you talking about? This was shocking news

366
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:20,052
... I mean, I love you

367
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:21,357
Too much to digest

368
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:22,778
No, the fact is that you do not love anyone

369
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,543
You can not ... life is not what you think

370
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,710
Well then

371
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:30,044
Do not marry Dan

372
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:31,895
Dan gives me a sense of security

373
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,325
And you made me feel like I was riding an air train

374
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,192
Sometimes I thought there was no way to get off

375
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:41,481
Oops, Oops

376
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,450
I don't

377
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,623
Take care of him?

378
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,226
Let it ruin everything

379
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:56,255
I'm doing something to make you cry now, Eddie

380
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:57,474
He falls in love with her

381
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,216
cry

382
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:00,919
cry

383
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:02,692
It is difficult to digest

384
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,364
Congratulations Anne

385
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,059
it was a good news

386
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,417
Go slower, buddy

387
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:22,386
Why?

388
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,675
You do not believe in consequences

389
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:26,910
I will not be harmed, you will repair it

390
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,042
Hangover after drunkenness has no effect

391
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:30,996
I can't hurt myself even if I want to

392
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:41,794
Eddie, I'm sorry

393
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,052
That I did not consider your heart

394
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:47,005
Emotional pain is much harder

395
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:49,568
And it lasts longer

396
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:51,654
Just have to

397
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:55,349
Be an adult and accept it

398
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,973
It's easy for you to say

399
00:22:57,748 --> 00:22:58,490
Why?

400
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:01,597
Because I'm a real boy

401
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:03,690
And you are just a pendant

402
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:09,034
I accept this because we are not feeling well now

403
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:17,315
Do not worry, my friend, I have your air

404
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:29,058
Dirty omelet always keeps me fresh in the morning

405
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:32,190
Sausages and cereals (from now on he snoozes and sings no)

406
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:58,297
Be a good friend

407
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,352
This is for you

408
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:16,930
A letter from your aunt?

409
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,227
Wow, listen to this

410
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:22,250
My dearest friend

411
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:26,016
I wrote you a letter

412
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:27,641
To witness

413
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:29,711
My death

414
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:30,782
the final

415
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:33,891
My moments on this

416
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:34,875
the wheel

417
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,539
Dirt Battalion

418
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:39,407
Which I call it

419
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:40,805
the earth

420
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:43,249
You are responsible

421
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,985
You are the end of Clitus Cassidy

422
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,579
You just kept the door open for me

423
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,758
To go out

424
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:54,664
They move my heart

425
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:57,102
Just like he was standing at birth

426
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:02,297
What if Clitus Cassidy was not revived?

427
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:06,691
She never threw her grandmother down the stairs

428
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,587
Goodbye Grandma

429
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,008
The misery of the old dog

430
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:17,415
He never threw the hair dryer in his mother's bathtub

431
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:20,732
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either

432
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:26,383
He was never beaten to death by his father

433
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,185
... and could not be sent to

434
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:30,476
"Synthes"

435
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,124
A home for children that no one wants

436
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:41,393
That hellish circus

437
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,016
With a bright light

438
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:54,384
Oh Eddie

439
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:57,111
All of us in this world

440
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,525
We were born with blood and pain

441
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,994
Each hero has a main and beginning story

442
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,101
Your friend, Clytus Cassidy

443
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,905
Kiss, armpit Kiss, armpit

444
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:17,796
Smiley face

445
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
What is a drop?

446
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:22,984
You know, I-I have to be there

447
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:25,054
Oh no, think about it

448
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:26,944
Oh, oh, well, I threw it there

449
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,578
In fact, he threw himself into it

450
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:31,007
When he decided to be a chain psychologist

451
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:32,390
Tada

452
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:36,374
You know, it would be great if you could support me

453
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:37,969
Ketchup?

454
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:42,210
Here is a self-service for himself

455
00:26:42,664 --> 00:26:45,195
Who cares if I eat a few of these idiots?

456
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,843
We can not be sure who is not guilty, comrade

457
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:48,984
Anna is a prisoner

458
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:50,999
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either

459
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:53,851
Or unjustly here they are not all just killers

460
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,507
are you alright?

461
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,531
Yeah man I'm just practicing

462
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:58,367
I'm a hunter, Eddie

463
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,557
I'm not used to eating salads

464
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:06,074
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either

465
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:07,544
Very good

466
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:09,020
Do not use - Do not use -

467
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,199
Excuse me, what?

468
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:11,176
ahh wow

469
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,402
I have no explanation for it, am

470
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:18,123
Oh, I'm signing here

471
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,084
Take two steps away from the bars

472
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,412
Do not make any calls

473
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:24,257
I realized

474
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,436
Here is a meeting

475
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,796
This is my meeting (semantic similarity with my appointment and the word appointment itself) not Wei Ting (our appointment)

476
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,499
Everything Yu Ting Ah (Your Appointment) (Issues About You)

477
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:42,773
Ooooh Rosette Goodbye Eddie Brock

478
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:45,718
Wow this thing

479
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,960
End of tour

480
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,663
Magical misery

481
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,178
I'm worried about your mood (your conscience)

482
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:57,281
How do you want to go about your life with a man?

483
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,504
I was hoping you could

484
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:01,031
Give me some advice

485
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:06,258
You're a funny person, aren't you?

486
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:10,031
You do not need it. My memory holds everything

487
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:12,313
impolite

488
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:15,492
Outcomes

489
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:18,633
Every decision you have made so far

490
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:23,133
Who to leave behind

491
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,907
How to leave them behind

492
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,819
A canopy bed (beds that have a roof and columns and are in palaces in the movie)

493
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:30,422
خالی

494
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,109
Wait

495
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:36,789
A savior in the dark who never comes

496
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:38,320
That's because of you

497
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,102
It makes you feel emotional

498
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,195
You

499
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:42,821
And I

500
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:44,234
Like us

501
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,172
No

502
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:46,552
No, we are not

503
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:48,273
We are twisted from the inside

504
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,095
Bad morals

505
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:52,859
Eddie is like home and family to me

506
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:57,784
And that's really all I want in this world

507
00:28:58,393 --> 00:28:59,182
Family

508
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:03,518
Well, killing your mother and grandmother is definitely an interesting way to show it

509
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:09,546
There is something you want to say ... before

510
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,220
Did this happen?

511
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:17,697
Yeah

512
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:19,775
I have dreams

513
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,197
To do for you

514
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh how kind

515
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,002
from

516
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:26,791
I wish you

517
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:30,267
I have a broken heart

518
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:32,189
He said you were late

519
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:35,709
I wish you to spend your day alone

520
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,748
As always

521
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:39,060
Hey be careful buddy

522
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:40,810
Where do you want to go with these words?

523
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:41,670
You

524
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:45,881
For anyone who has ever loved you like a cancer, Eddie

525
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:50,264
You deceived your fiancé who trusted you

526
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:54,767
No wonder Daddy couldn't look at you like before

527
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,564
After his wife killed your mother

528
00:29:57,971 --> 00:29:59,486
You were born only

529
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:01,017
O bastard

530
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,025
No no no no no

531
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:05,689
Do you dare talk about Baba again?

532
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,601
Have you heard of any contact?

533
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,367
Hey go back

534
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Eddie?

535
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:21,125
The card is over here

536
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:23,992
I had tasted blood before, my friend

537
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,320
But it was not the taste of blood

538
00:30:26,844 --> 00:30:28,531
Eddie Brock

539
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,388
... as a big secret

540
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:31,389
Shut up Kasidi

541
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,756
It was a big mistake

542
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:44,992
light it up

543
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,773
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

544
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:49,367
No, I'm not anymore

545
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:55,265
Eddie - One more word I do not want to hear from you, idiot -

546
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:57,218
Eddie Joon - I do not want to hear -

547
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,735
Eddie, I'm sorry

548
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,584
It was the last time he could be interviewed

549
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,600
There is no more talk of his victim because they died

550
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,465
And there is no trace of their bodies

551
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,400
We lost them forever - completely

552
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,600
I did not mean

553
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,600
You did not mean?

554
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,300
I said I'm sorry

555
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,600
You had no intention, but you did it

556
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,750
I mean, Yahoo, you decided that

557
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:17,025
I do not know what to call it, you know

558
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,200
That's what you did

559
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,900
You did not even think we could be arrested, we could be killed

560
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,400
You don't think about these things at all, do you?

561
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:26,500
You only think of the chicken and you only think of yourself and whatever you want

562
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,500
Let me remind you of something, Eddie

563
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,200
You were a loser before I came

564
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,300
You were nothing. I did something to make you special

565
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,850
Oh, you did something to make me special

566
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Okay, let me tell you something, okay?

567
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,825
Before you came, I had a life. I didn't have chicken, okay?

568
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,450
But I had a dream

569
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,900
Yes, I had a dream and I had a fiancé

570
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,750
And I had a successful TV show

571
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,650
But you destroyed them all

572
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah, but, you know what, I rebuilt my life

573
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,650
And now I just want to live. Good Night

574
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,300
And how did you build this new life?

575
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,780
Sorry?

576
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,200
Well, who found the clue on the wall?

577
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,750
So you can be a brilliant little hero?

578
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,300
Hmmm, when did you find the clue? Who?

579
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,700
!Wow

580
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,750
Yeah

581
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,750
no no no. My problem is not to be a hero, man

582
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,700
My problem is living in peace

583
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,300
You know what I mean?

584
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,950
No, you do not understand, you do not understand what I am talking about

585
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
Well, the problem is, I want to live without you

586
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,500
I do not want to hear about eating bad all the time

587
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,300
I do not like to hear about you

588
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,600
I do not like you to destroy the house of my life

589
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,525
Do you know how lucky I was to be chosen?

590
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,600
Did you choose me?

591
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,093
Comrade, when your friends fly off the planet Ming Mang

592
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,867
I was the only one who let you go

593
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:39,079
You are an outcast, a fool

594
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,600
You want to take care of me

595
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,929
But you can not take care of anything

596
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:42,525
You are useless

597
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,040
Just do something to wash the toilet

598
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,275
Sorry

599
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,600
I do not know what happened to Yahoo

600
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:49,750
Please let me fix it

601
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,350
How bad

602
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,600
It will be like the first day

603
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,409
O bastard

604
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:11,017
Get out, get out, pack up

605
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:11,869
go out

606
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:13,600
This is my house

607
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,500
Up there, be quiet

608
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,750
go out

609
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:33,540
Sunny

610
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:35,437
You do not dare

611
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,810
I have, how I have

612
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,500
No, no, no

613
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,500
Yeah

614
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:43,141
No

615
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:44,675
I am calling the police now

616
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm so sorry

617
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,810
Show yourself

618
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,866
You can not win

619
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:08,900
Take a look at me and take a look at your size, little one

620
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,600
How dare you

621
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,100
I guess this is a goodbye

622
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,100
Oh, yes, you finally said the right thing

623
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,075
What a mess

624
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,600
What is this wedge?

625
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:34,831
اررره

626
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,300
No, no no, no, no

627
00:34:58,339 --> 00:34:59,058
No

628
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,300
Yeah

629
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,456
No

630
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,100
Yeah

631
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,100
نه

632
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,600
O yeah

633
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,200
No

634
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:18,733
No, no, no, no, I wish I had never seen you

635
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,300
Sayonara (Goodbye)

636
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:40,491
Clytus Cassidy, you were tried and sentenced to death by the state of California

637
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,811
May your death comfort the families of the victims

638
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,928
And may you find peace from now on

639
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,700
Chaos is coming soon

640
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,600
Chaos is coming soon

641
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,600
These are your last words

642
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,780
Enjoy the show

643
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,500
Chairman

644
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,475
One thing can

645
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,453
Break this world

646
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:15,637
Do not move

647
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:43,852
Please

648
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,924
I have a family

649
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,200
What is the word of the hereafter, boss?

650
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,200
Do not do this, please

651
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
I was released, I am happy, Grandma

652
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,300
God willing, everyone is free

653
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,100
I was released, our eyes were wet

654
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,100
God willing, the outside world is better

655
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:46,472
You two fell victim to this incident

656
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,075
Do not look at me like that carefree, you were never supposed to answer, right?

657
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:12,493
Yes

658
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:18,507
breaking news

659
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:24,069
The serial killer of Clytus Cassidy is now on the run ... as the government seeks

660
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:25,094
Oh, damn it

661
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,469
He escaped from St. Quentin Prison

662
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:43,293
Hey - aren't you dead? -

663
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,388
No

664
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,412
can I come in? - Yes sure -

665
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:50,754
Um ... I just saw him in the news

666
00:41:52,114 --> 00:41:54,411
Give one to ten these eleven degrees

667
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:58,137
According to St. Quentin, the situation is very good

668
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,411
TV is beautiful

669
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,536
How ... how did he escape?

670
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,770
Ah ... he ran away, that's the main question

671
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:07,067
And again you were on a special date

672
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,559
So what did he tell you?

673
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,129
Avalanche? Nothing

674
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:11,379
He did not say anything at all

675
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:13,012
Didn't he say anything about the escape plan?

676
00:42:13,037 --> 00:42:15,903
Or did he not tell you anything about a particular escape dress?

677
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,769
But how is it possible that you are at the center of such a story whenever it seems

678
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:23,175
And strangely enough, you know nothing about it

679
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:24,465
Maybe I'm lucky

680
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:27,426
Oh well

681
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,458
... You said that I am

682
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,716
The report from St. Quentin is the same as Cucumber

683
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:38,489
What did you mean by that?

684
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,599
I was asking the same question, do you know what I got?

685
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,028
The information is confidential, but you should not know what to say

686
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:48,615
never mind

687
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,505
I thought maybe he would come looking for the man who ... almost sent him to that world but

688
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,436
I guess he doesn't

689
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,294
If I were you, I would not be sunny

690
00:43:00,974 --> 00:43:01,974
I know the way out myself

691
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:15,474
{In the mind of Clytus Cassidy, what happens to the serial killer} Think, think, think

692
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:16,966
What was Venom doing in this situation?

693
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:20,591
Before you found me, he would find you and bring your face down

694
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,510
all right

695
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,835
Who to leave behind and how to leave them behind

696
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:28,860
A canopy bed

697
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:29,513
خالی

698
00:43:29,538 --> 00:43:30,638
Left to rot

699
00:43:30,663 --> 00:43:32,083
Does he mean marriage? - Wait -

700
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:34,832
A savior in the dark who never comes

701
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:36,144
I do not understand

702
00:43:36,169 --> 00:43:38,945
Church - This Hell Cycle -

703
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,180
Silence

704
00:43:40,563 --> 00:43:41,563
because of you

705
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,937
You and I are like -

706
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,917
Bright light - we have a complex nature -

707
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,941
Bad morals - Vaisa, Vaisa -

708
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,198
You are like home and family to me

709
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:55,979
St. Estos

710
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,847
Daddy brought another one

711
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:36,437
See this strange

712
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:38,625
It's totally different

713
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:40,889
Wow secret clothes

714
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:44,422
Hey ... the card is correct

715
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:47,806
The most beautiful dress I have ever seen. Oh my God

716
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,670
Japan?

717
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:51,704
No, I made it myself

718
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:52,908
Hey

719
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:54,478
Ooof

720
00:44:54,494 --> 00:44:55,798
Hi beautiful

721
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:57,822
Sorry, no you are not my type (I do not like people like you)

722
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:01,517
I was released from Eddie's confinement (meaning sexual orientation)

723
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,033
Hello dear

724
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:33,736
I have to cut a red one

725
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:41,822
Let's start the celebration

726
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,548
Oops

727
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:51,938
Hey hey hey vaisa hey vaisa

728
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:01,588
You are real - yes I am -

729
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:07,700
And when I kill that thing that made me, we become indestructible

730
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,036
I know where we can find it, but first

731
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,317
I want you to help me find what I lost

732
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:17,623
accept it

733
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:18,943
solve it

734
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:12,539
thank you

735
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:18,227
Oh damn

736
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:20,251
That wonderful dress

737
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:21,672
Thank you one

738
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:25,219
Eddie was wrong

739
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:30,594
Everyone was embarrassed because he was embarrassed

740
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:33,813
But see me now

741
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,367
You are in love

742
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:37,609
And I'm free

743
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:47,442
Stop this cruel behavior against space, which is a mistake

744
00:47:48,356 --> 00:47:50,699
We should all be able to live together

745
00:47:50,723 --> 00:47:53,426
On this piece of rock (Earth)

746
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:58,481
Be free to be who we are

747
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,067
L love you

748
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,317
I love you too

749
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:08,653
A word ending word

750
00:48:18,888 --> 00:48:20,768
Is it over? It was very impressive

751
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:24,518
I wish you saw me tonight

752
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,420
Eddie

753
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:14,953
Oh damn

754
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:18,938
I'm Mulligan

755
00:49:18,962 --> 00:49:20,117
... I'm Eddie Brock

756
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:22,851
Look, it might be weird, but I think I found something

757
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:24,289
Well tell me what

758
00:49:24,617 --> 00:49:27,898
The last time I talked to Cassidy, she was talking about a canopy bed

759
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,633
And also marriage and a series of other things but

760
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:32,789
I'm at St. Stos right now and ... oh this

761
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:36,695
I found a tree that

762
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,695
I'm looking at it and the method of something that is written has been dug out

763
00:49:39,899 --> 00:49:41,000
CK

764
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:43,414
Loves FB

765
00:49:44,008 --> 00:49:46,945
I think anyone who has this FB knows where Cassidy is going

766
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:48,328
... and I oh

767
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:49,953
... if you can

768
00:49:50,797 --> 00:49:55,984
I don't know, read a series of files to see if you understand who this FBI is or not

769
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:59,089
FB means Francis Bryson

770
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:02,046
Wow how fast

771
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:03,585
Impossible Eddie

772
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:07,171
He's dead ... oh I shot him

773
00:50:48,026 --> 00:50:49,381
Can I help you sir?

774
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,321
See if there is anything on the internet?

775
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:25,709
are you alive

776
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,818
From here, I will take out the skin of your face and go with it as a guest

777
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:42,990
It never leaves here, Sickfried

778
00:51:43,014 --> 00:51:44,779
No one goes out

779
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,678
All right, Francis

780
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,881
Your sweetheart seems to have left St. Quentin

781
00:51:58,213 --> 00:51:59,702
Everything is in the news

782
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:02,304
Oh, don't get excited

783
00:52:03,422 --> 00:52:04,937
He will not find you

784
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,046
گا ** دمت

785
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,218
how interesting

786
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:13,622
But you are not my type

787
00:52:14,203 --> 00:52:16,038
I wonder where it could be

788
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:20,896
I have the same cup

789
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:22,772
Tada

790
00:52:45,557 --> 00:52:46,901
Hey Baby

791
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:50,792
... from

792
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,776
I do not want to be afraid, right?

793
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:56,713
... I like that with

794
00:52:58,315 --> 00:52:59,963
Get to know the carnage (carnage = killing)

795
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:15,528
Very attractive

796
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:46,652
Model year 66

797
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,108
The one I always wanted

798
00:53:49,616 --> 00:53:50,983
Yeah, I remember

799
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:52,788
Let's see what you do with it

800
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,585
ارررههه عزیزم

801
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:21,714
Stop it, kill it like this

802
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,870
If he does this one more time, I will eat his face

803
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,607
Sensitive to sound

804
00:55:32,178 --> 00:55:33,178
Stop the car

805
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:34,404
Stand up

806
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:45,238
Who said love and affection are gone

807
00:55:50,288 --> 00:55:52,585
Hey, don't hit here

808
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:56,187
Help me

809
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:57,428
Food

810
00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:59,514
Get out, get out

811
00:55:59,538 --> 00:56:01,286
... Chocolate

812
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:05,640
I do

813
00:56:05,781 --> 00:56:09,632
I had a problem supporting them

814
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:11,374
Where is Eddie then?

815
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:14,405
غذااا

816
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:27,432
Monsters, monsters are everywhere

817
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,838
They are everywhere

818
00:56:30,675 --> 00:56:31,994
هیولاهااا

819
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,158
Call EPB (Broad Crime Organization)

820
00:56:51,892 --> 00:56:52,977
And relevant authorities

821
00:56:53,704 --> 00:56:54,954
Close here

822
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,407
And bring me Brock

823
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,219
I have no benefit for anyone here, you are just wasting your time

824
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:05,756
Oh you know what I'm all thinking?

825
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:08,774
I'm all thinking about what else there is to Clytus Cassidy that Eddie does not say

826
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,845
Why was Eddie the person Clytus Cassidy wanted to see before his execution, huh?

827
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,978
Bad things are happening around you

828
00:57:16,002 --> 00:57:18,595
Last year, several bodies were found near your home

829
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:21,666
The story you made at the Crab Restaurant (Venom 1 went to the aquarium and bit the crab)

830
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:25,377
And you survived the missile explosion (the end of Venom 1)

831
00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:29,837
And now finding a mountain of corpses and a dead psychiatrist in the tail of the device

832
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:31,697
I did not know about it until today

833
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:34,103
And people are talking about seeing a monster

834
00:57:34,128 --> 00:57:37,663
Monster..Um what exactly do you mean by monster?

835
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:41,280
Another monster, Eddie ... wherever Clytus goes, that monster goes with him

836
00:57:41,304 --> 00:57:42,624
Oh my God

837
00:57:42,648 --> 00:57:44,155
Talk to Eddie

838
00:57:44,726 --> 00:57:45,726
Talk

839
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:50,514
How does that work Eddie?

840
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,647
What is the secret? How does it make people delusional?

841
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:00,985
I can no longer answer your questions before making a call

842
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:07,758
I'll make you a phone

843
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,172
Do you know what the problem of secrets is?

844
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:11,735
They are finally revealed

845
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,321
That's why they are so hard to keep

846
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:24,790
Did Eddie ask you to do this?

847
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:27,665
Did no one else help him? We arrive late to the party

848
00:58:27,689 --> 00:58:29,297
You are in trouble

849
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:30,946
Yes, his work is always in trouble

850
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,118
Is it going to be space again?

851
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:35,446
It's not clear

852
00:58:38,759 --> 00:58:40,266
I want to talk to him alone

853
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:44,258
You came and Nesazia because you know you try to have a party

854
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:46,516
Is this to teach you at university?

855
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,921
Hey n ... hey n thank you so much for coming

856
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,860
Dude is very Teflon and non-stick

857
00:58:56,938 --> 00:58:58,594
How much should I worry about you now?

858
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,000
I .. I ruined

859
00:59:00,227 --> 00:59:01,227
Okay, how bad?

860
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,914
It could not be worse and it is all my fault

861
00:59:04,696 --> 00:59:07,242
Whatever you do, you have to tell the police the truth

862
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:09,414
No, no, I can not tell them

863
00:59:09,438 --> 00:59:14,149
They are looking for a serial killer who has a space inside

864
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:17,039
And it kills everyone

865
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:21,141
What?

866
00:59:21,774 --> 00:59:23,531
Talk to me about what happened

867
00:59:23,555 --> 00:59:25,992
No ... oh he ... he's not here

868
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,953
"Like, 'I'm lying, he's not here,' or 'He's not really here?'

869
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:33,274
Not really here

870
00:59:35,493 --> 00:59:37,485
Sintostos on fire to all units

871
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:38,671
گاومون زایید

872
00:59:38,696 --> 00:59:40,196
I do not know, I do not know - what do you think? -

873
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:42,805
All I know is that he can't do much without eating

874
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,000
That's why he should eat chicken and chocolate

875
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:48,064
This is how the whole world is summed up in this

876
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:53,376
We have to find it

877
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:55,353
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?

878
00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:57,072
Yes, please find it

879
00:59:57,096 --> 00:59:59,415
Then I'm on my way

880
00:59:59,986 --> 01:00:01,579
I will try - thank you -

881
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:06,626
Ms. Chen - you? -

882
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,517
منم

883
01:00:09,228 --> 01:00:10,228
What do you want?

884
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:12,001
Very good-natured

885
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,876
Well, listen - you broke Eddie's heart -

886
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,369
The truth is, I do not have time to sit down and tell you the story. Do you know where Venom is?

887
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:18,908
Do you want to break his heart too?

888
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:20,814
I do not want to get into the discussion of who did what to whom

889
01:00:21,056 --> 01:00:25,040
Eddie said maybe it's because of the chocolate here, I just want to talk to the space

890
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:27,970
We were not supposed to do this now, but

891
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,703
... Mayor in progress

892
01:00:29,728 --> 01:00:31,195
Can you please raise his voice?

893
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:36,254
Cassidy and Bryson are probably extremely dangerous and fully armed

894
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:39,144
And the search for them continues tonight

895
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:40,363
Okay?

896
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:42,136
Clitus has a symbiote

897
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,230
Oh my God, is there anything else you lied to me about?

898
01:00:45,254 --> 01:00:45,925
cute

899
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:47,058
Sorry?

900
01:00:47,082 --> 01:00:48,214
Eddie needs Venom

901
01:00:48,238 --> 01:00:48,964
She called me Naz Nazi

902
01:00:48,988 --> 01:00:52,417
He said he did not need her to live better without him

903
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:54,128
... Look, I do not understand why it matters to you

904
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:57,904
Oh, let me see for a moment

905
01:00:59,847 --> 01:01:01,409
Come out now

906
01:01:05,102 --> 01:01:07,914
Did you see him? Did you see him seriously? - Yes baby I saw it -

907
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:13,016
Eddie fights that lonely figure

908
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,953
Don't be a big kid, go and help your friend

909
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:17,773
He said I should just go and repair the toilet

910
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:21,391
Clytus goes to him and he will not live without you

911
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:26,406
Of course, he will not live, because I am the hero

912
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,305
Yes, you are a great sexy hero

913
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,828
You are the coolest, the most attractive and the bravest

914
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:38,555
Yes, I am

915
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,242
You know I'm still standing here

916
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:41,867
Nobody loves you

917
01:01:42,594 --> 01:01:44,711
We love when you are struggling

918
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:51,812
Let's go see that bitch

919
01:01:57,977 --> 01:02:00,930
I promised we would be released from here

920
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:05,195
And we go to the church on the hill

921
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:08,727
A marriage

922
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:10,594
Three guests

923
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:13,328
One for each of us

924
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:15,398
The policeman who took my eyes off me

925
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,320
Eddie Brock

926
01:02:18,516 --> 01:02:20,680
And I didn't

927
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,148
A bloody wedding

928
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:30,539
Didn't find it?

929
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:46,021
What happened?

930
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:59,713
Hey Dan, very well, let's go

931
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:01,690
I do not talk to him

932
01:03:01,714 --> 01:03:02,940
Well he does not want to come out

933
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:04,307
Wow ... let me see what that means?

934
01:03:04,331 --> 01:03:07,065
We have to go right now because Cleitus wants to destroy the whole city

935
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:09,939
We do not make any mistake to apologize

936
01:03:09,963 --> 01:03:11,634
You just want an apology

937
01:03:11,658 --> 01:03:15,009
Look, I know the situation is complicated - do you apologize? Right now, do you apologize? -

938
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:17,775
I want to beg

939
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:20,876
Ok i'm growing up

940
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,361
I am always the greatest

941
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,572
But go on - what does it say? What is he saying? -

942
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,322
He says I'm listening

943
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:28,790
Well, listen to this

944
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:30,064
I am sorry

945
01:03:30,088 --> 01:03:31,587
No, I did not like it that way

946
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:33,806
I'm sorry - no -

947
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:36,408
I- I'm sorry

948
01:03:36,432 --> 01:03:37,689
Very strange

949
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,103
I'm sorry - I do not know why you shout at me -

950
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:40,931
...Because

951
01:03:40,955 --> 01:03:44,384
Well, I was a loser before I met you

952
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:46,126
Absolutely right - ... and I -

953
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,220
And now, I am a person

954
01:03:49,517 --> 01:03:52,509
Hey, you made me special

955
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:53,681
So right

956
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:54,923
Make it a little more beautiful

957
01:03:54,947 --> 01:03:57,072
... make it more beautiful? Ok i am

958
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:02,782
I'm really sorry for what I said

959
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:04,513
Hmmm - and also for what I did not say -

960
01:04:04,537 --> 01:04:09,552
Oh my gosh - and for what I did and did not do ... even for what I did not do -

961
01:04:10,529 --> 01:04:13,607
You know he's thinking - oh ... carefree -

962
01:04:16,263 --> 01:04:17,052
OK

963
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,600
Oh no - kiss her -

964
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:25,271
Do you want to kiss me? - No -

965
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:27,865
Oh God, I will never do that again

966
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:30,404
Of course, maybe never, though

967
01:04:30,404 --> 01:04:33,474
If everything goes well, we can order potatoes

968
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:36,504
..Well Eddie..den..everything..closed the flanges..example

969
01:04:36,528 --> 01:04:37,887
And if for any reason

970
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:38,950
Fire and sound

971
01:04:39,302 --> 01:04:41,075
Fire and sound? The name of a music band?

972
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,372
No it kills them - yeah -

973
01:04:42,936 --> 01:04:44,717
Okay, man, look, I'm careful

974
01:04:48,124 --> 01:04:49,124
Ashamed

975
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:51,186
Dan, I'm really sorry

976
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:53,600
We need a series of serious counseling sessions

977
01:04:58,366 --> 01:04:59,585
I'm going to Brock's house

978
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,410
damn it

979
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,120
Put your hands on your head

980
01:05:12,627 --> 01:05:15,384
Which one do you say?

981
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:24,774
We found you

982
01:05:25,306 --> 01:05:27,946
The partner is very happy

983
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:34,435
Yohoo

984
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:38,021
براک جونم

985
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:55,077
Wow ring

986
01:05:57,929 --> 01:06:00,499
When were you supposed to go?

987
01:06:07,773 --> 01:06:09,366
A shining prey

988
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,874
For small fish

989
01:06:20,784 --> 01:06:21,784
This is from this friend

990
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:32,152
hello

991
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,750
I just tied your boyfriend together

992
01:06:35,172 --> 01:06:36,156
It's nothing

993
01:06:36,953 --> 01:06:39,672
If you answer the question "Where is Eddie Brock?"

994
01:06:40,852 --> 01:06:43,279
Well, I'm certainly not going to tell you this

995
01:06:43,304 --> 01:06:44,765
It's a pity to hurt you

996
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,711
Tell Brock

997
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:55,102
Clitus has something to exchange

998
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:58,422
Its head in exchange for Eddie's head

999
01:07:00,188 --> 01:07:01,289
It kills your partner

1000
01:07:01,874 --> 01:07:03,483
The same people are trying

1001
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:04,928
شخوش

1002
01:07:18,023 --> 01:07:19,203
They can not find it

1003
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:21,077
They are looking for us too, buddy

1004
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:25,218
Where are you carefree?

1005
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,749
Hey Dan, what happened?

1006
01:07:32,773 --> 01:07:34,335
Getting Eddie - Huh? -

1007
01:07:34,922 --> 01:07:35,947
They get it

1008
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:36,589
Calm down

1009
01:07:36,613 --> 01:07:38,191
They took her to a wedding

1010
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:39,706
Where to take it? - To a wedding -

1011
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,792
You have to hurry - we set off -

1012
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:44,777
Get ready we are going to the wedding

1013
01:07:45,105 --> 01:07:46,738
Oh the sweat of the gold leaf?

1014
01:07:47,238 --> 01:07:48,480
Asan Safa

1015
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:26,866
That church in the distance

1016
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:29,429
Is the only thing i see

1017
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:35,007
Broken Angel

1018
01:08:36,882 --> 01:08:38,155
My other half

1019
01:08:41,304 --> 01:08:42,304
Dear heart

1020
01:08:42,546 --> 01:08:44,179
... hiss ... first

1021
01:08:44,429 --> 01:08:45,718
... Actually at the ceremony

1022
01:08:45,742 --> 01:08:46,562
... دهنتو

1023
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,452
close

1024
01:08:50,062 --> 01:08:50,944
Father

1025
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:53,468
Honey, I got what you want

1026
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:55,772
You want more than anything

1027
01:08:55,867 --> 01:08:58,335
That policeman? - Pleated itself -

1028
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:00,116
Go on, father

1029
01:09:00,187 --> 01:09:01,187
Dear heart

1030
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:03,702
If anyone has a problem with this connection

1031
01:09:04,304 --> 01:09:07,452
Say it now or be silent forever

1032
01:09:09,804 --> 01:09:11,397
Where is that?

1033
01:09:14,437 --> 01:09:15,437
Inhashi

1034
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:18,608
Death to you father

1035
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,046
I will not tell your father

1036
01:09:21,812 --> 01:09:23,601
You father

1037
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,171
Oh damn

1038
01:09:26,235 --> 01:09:28,421
Oh ... where did you go? What are you doing?

1039
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:29,952
Worse than I thought

1040
01:09:29,976 --> 01:09:31,202
She is a redhead

1041
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:33,155
A red one?

1042
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,671
We have to go right now

1043
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:37,358
Annie manages to get along with us that we did not get along with at all

1044
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:38,999
Well, let's go - now? -

1045
01:09:39,023 --> 01:09:42,335
We are leaving with the wish of happiness for our dear couple

1046
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,522
Eddie ... Yoho

1047
01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:46,843
Will I be ahead now?

1048
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:48,624
Look, you have to come out right now

1049
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:51,780
Because I feel very, very vulnerable

1050
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:53,147
Brock is like you?

1051
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:55,069
It does not stay like this for a long time

1052
01:09:56,312 --> 01:09:58,210
Eddie, come here again

1053
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:00,218
You have to come out right now

1054
01:10:01,051 --> 01:10:03,897
I let you eat everyone, you can eat everyone

1055
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:06,718
Of course, except for the father who is wearing a robe

1056
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:07,655
say it

1057
01:10:07,921 --> 01:10:08,694
I promise

1058
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:12,976
thank you

1059
01:10:26,854 --> 01:10:28,482
عزیززززممم

1060
01:10:28,506 --> 01:10:30,459
See your mouth

1061
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:34,147
Nothing has happened yet. Do you have a problem in your marriage?

1062
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,186
Time to die

1063
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,436
This is called spirit

1064
01:10:39,045 --> 01:10:41,756
I meant we were going to die

1065
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:27,294
I killed you - oh you can not kill a ghost -

1066
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:35,984
Pull it but keep your mouth shut

1067
01:11:36,008 --> 01:11:38,632
Our wife knows what she is doing

1068
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,031
Just take your voice

1069
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:44,000
Who do you think you are talking to?

1070
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:45,367
Get ahead

1071
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:46,601
My police

1072
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,229
Oh, that guy in the robe

1073
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:57,643
Oh God, no oh

1074
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:00,674
Let's gain power

1075
01:12:00,698 --> 01:12:01,596
نه

1076
01:12:18,953 --> 01:12:22,234
Help Help Help ... Clytus Cassidy

1077
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:35,637
... what they say

1078
01:12:36,161 --> 01:12:38,785
About eye to eye?

1079
01:12:48,522 --> 01:12:50,289
Fire and sound

1080
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:52,055
Of course, except for the sound part

1081
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:56,186
Babe

1082
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:00,259
Clitus

1083
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:31,754
Let me see how many Brock bat dead

1084
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:41,339
Do you know how I spent my endless days?

1085
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:57,566
I spent it thinking about how you defined one side of the story for them

1086
01:14:10,343 --> 01:14:17,202
You did not write the part where Klitos was harassed by Mommy, Daddy and Johnny

1087
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:55,088
You did not tell the world how scared that little boy was

1088
01:14:55,853 --> 01:14:57,853
Something that did not matter to anyone

1089
01:14:57,877 --> 01:15:01,330
And no one came to save him

1090
01:15:05,244 --> 01:15:07,017
... Never ask yourself

1091
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:12,447
To write this story

1092
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:22,782
Oh good day back

1093
01:15:32,088 --> 01:15:33,981
I'm not crazy

1094
01:15:35,135 --> 01:15:38,290
But I am a vindictive person

1095
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,744
You're going to see him die

1096
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:53,583
that...that

1097
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:10,626
Do something

1098
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,883
Eddie, unfortunately we can not defeat them

1099
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:24,975
Baby, this is too much

1100
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,728
You have to stop it

1101
01:16:28,473 --> 01:16:29,540
what are you doing?

1102
01:16:29,564 --> 01:16:32,421
I will dismantle it forever

1103
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:35,128
No, you are hurting him

1104
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:40,988
Another foot

1105
01:16:40,986 --> 01:16:42,586
I can not

1106
01:16:44,702 --> 01:16:45,702
See see

1107
01:16:46,553 --> 01:16:48,145
They do not unite like symbiotes

1108
01:16:49,252 --> 01:16:51,433
Shut up - Shut up -

1109
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:53,572
Take your hands off my wife

1110
01:16:55,898 --> 01:16:57,040
They do not combine

1111
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,320
We became

1112
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:01,919
That's right we became

1113
01:17:04,317 --> 01:17:05,748
We are together

1114
01:17:07,959 --> 01:17:10,069
We must protect it

1115
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:30,266
Let the slaughter take place (let Carnegie take over everything)

1116
01:18:53,106 --> 01:18:54,306
Got you, okay?

1117
01:19:24,912 --> 01:19:28,256
Father, one of us must die

1118
01:19:28,725 --> 01:19:30,529
Oh, we need fire

1119
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,170
Maybe the sound

1120
01:20:49,184 --> 01:20:51,489
It did not taste good at all

1121
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,560
I'm a killer

1122
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:08,318
Whether with monsters or without monsters Eddie

1123
01:21:11,412 --> 01:21:12,982
Do you know what I really wanted?

1124
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,325
How do I know?

1125
01:21:16,802 --> 01:21:18,700
I told you before but you did not listen

1126
01:21:20,271 --> 01:21:21,778
But now I'm listening

1127
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:25,318
I wanted to be friends with you

1128
01:21:28,052 --> 01:21:29,357
I'm sorry, Clitus

1129
01:21:32,529 --> 01:21:33,729
The grave of the father of this cove

1130
01:21:55,789 --> 01:21:57,810
You's inside, take Eddie out of here

1131
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,263
Follow your partner

1132
01:22:00,676 --> 01:22:01,537
I know

1133
01:22:03,897 --> 01:22:04,897
This is it

1134
01:22:06,037 --> 01:22:07,037
Take care

1135
01:22:10,787 --> 01:22:12,387
Yes, you are also a hero

1136
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:13,271
Day

1137
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:15,771
Take care too

1138
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:17,233
thank you

1139
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:18,404
I like you

1140
01:22:19,045 --> 01:22:20,826
Although I told her we needed her

1141
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:23,990
I really think it was more than a simple help

1142
01:22:38,094 --> 01:22:39,594
The monsters are Carnegie son's taxinee (because he was injured by a piece of carnage, so it happened

1143
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:54,141
Summary of the whole story of Don Quixote and his colleague

1144
01:22:55,454 --> 01:22:58,000
It showed two completely different people with different tastes

1145
01:22:59,532 --> 01:23:01,851
They were doing a strange job

1146
01:23:02,688 --> 01:23:05,336
Sometimes they didn't get along very well, but in the end

1147
01:23:07,539 --> 01:23:09,601
Working together to show the best of each other

1148
01:23:11,461 --> 01:23:12,258
Eddie

1149
01:23:13,266 --> 01:23:14,266
The time has come

1150
01:23:15,711 --> 01:23:16,911
I have to go alone

1151
01:23:17,938 --> 01:23:19,016
They want me

1152
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:21,063
Yeah

1153
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,680
Well, my dearest friend

1154
01:23:25,774 --> 01:23:28,250
Reality is the enemy of reality

1155
01:23:29,391 --> 01:23:30,633
What do you mean by that?

1156
01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:32,086
that's mean

1157
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:35,211
That is us

1158
01:23:36,406 --> 01:23:37,164
Are

1159
01:23:38,383 --> 01:23:39,453
... van - Ferrari -

1160
01:23:39,477 --> 01:23:41,883
Um ... yeah.yes

1161
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:43,039
On the run

1162
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:43,961
That's it

1163
01:23:58,322 --> 01:24:00,388
Thank you, sir, for bringing me here

1164
01:24:01,142 --> 01:24:02,275
You could not, comrade

1165
01:24:03,673 --> 01:24:04,673
Isn't it beautiful?

1166
01:24:06,712 --> 01:24:08,563
Sorry we can not talk about

1167
01:24:09,415 --> 01:24:11,188
Let the wind blow in your hair

1168
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:12,821
Osho says

1169
01:24:13,478 --> 01:24:15,087
When you love someone

1170
01:24:15,111 --> 01:24:17,876
You accept what it is - Osho? -

1171
01:24:18,445 --> 01:24:20,360
With all its flaws

1172
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:21,798
Defects

1173
01:24:22,126 --> 01:24:23,938
No one is perfect

1174
01:24:23,962 --> 01:24:27,876
Go back one step ... did you just say that you love me?

1175
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:29,631
اممم - گفتی -

1176
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:33,303
Where are we going?

1177
01:24:33,858 --> 01:24:35,272
I do not know, I do not know

1178
01:24:37,116 --> 01:24:39,443
Wherever you read less carefully, I think

1179
01:24:39,467 --> 01:24:42,147
Who really did not mean that?

1180
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:43,084
Why was it

1181
01:24:43,842 --> 01:24:46,709
We need a cape and a mask

1182
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:51,272
No, we can't do that, that's fine
