1
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,880
You need to drink, child.

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,920
(She sighs)

3
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
And eat.

4
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,800
lsn't there anything else?

5
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,760
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

6
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,000
People can't live on grass.

7
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,160
(Jorah) In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

8
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,520
they say there are fields of ghost grass

9
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,720
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

10
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
lt murders all other grass.

11
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,600
The Dothraki believe that one day

12
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,680
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,880
lt'll get easier.

14
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,040
(Neighs, snorts)

15
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
(Laughing)

16
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,040
Khaleesi!

17
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,920
Your hands.

18
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,920
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

19
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,320
Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

20
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,040
You'd be more comfortable there.

21
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,800
l have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

22
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,000
l'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end
of the bargain and l have my crown.

23
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,280
As you wish, Your Grace.

24
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

25
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,720
l suppose it is preferable to beheading.

26
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,240
What did Ned Stark want you for?

27
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,400
Buying from a slaver?

28
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,360
Selling to one.

29
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Some poachers l caught on my land.

30
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,600
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

31
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,480
You can rest assured of that.

32
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,240
(Dogs howling)

33
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,360
(Rooster crows, hen clucking)

34
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,600
- (Moans)
- (Barking)

35
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,640
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

36
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
My mother's been looking for you.

37
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,400
We ride for King's Landing today.

38
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,360
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

39
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,680
and omer your sympathies.

40
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,120
What good will my sympathies do them?

41
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,640
None. But it is expected of you.

42
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,600
Your absence has already been noted.

43
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,600
The boy means nothing to me.

44
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
And l can't stand
the wailing of women.

45
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,040
(Whimpers)

46
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,920
One word and l'll hit you again.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
l'm telling Mother!

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,880
Go! Tell her.

49
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,000
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,960
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

51
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,760
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

52
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,960
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

53
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,160
You can't...

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
Do you understand?

55
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,320
l hope so.

57
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,600
lf he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

58
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,280
Ah. Time for breaMast.

59
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,040
Bread. And two of those little fish.

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,320
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

61
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,800
And bacon, burnt black.

62
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,720
- Hyah.
- (Laughs)

63
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,560
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

64
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,680
ls Bran going to die?

65
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,560
Apparently not.

66
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,000
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

67
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,720
lt's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

68
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,480
Only the gods know for certain.

69
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,920
All the rest of us can do is pray.

70
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,800
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

71
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
l still can't believe you're going.

72
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,600
lt's ridiculous, even for you.

73
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
Where's your sense of wonder?

74
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,400
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

75
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,640
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

76
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,760
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

77
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,640
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

78
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,560
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

79
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
No, l just want to stand
on top of the Wall

80
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
and piss om the edge of the world.

81
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,440
The children don't need to hear your filth.

82
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,920
Come.

83
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,360
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

84
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,840
Give me a good, clean death any day.

85
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,520
Speaking for the grotesques,
l'd have to disagree.

86
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,240
Death is so final, whereas life...

87
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,480
ah, life is full of possibilities.

88
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,840
l hope the boy does wake. l'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

89
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,080
My dear brother,

90
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,760
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

91
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,920
My dear brother, you wound me.

92
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,360
You know how much
l love my family.

93
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,120
Please.

94
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,360
Oh, l would have dressed, Your Grace.

95
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,720
This is your home. l'm your guest.

96
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,880
Handsome one, isn't he?

97
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,880
l lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
He was a fighter too -

99
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,920
tried to beat the fever that took him.

100
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,880
Forgive me.

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
lt's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

102
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,840
l never knew.

103
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,760
lt was years ago.

104
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,560
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

105
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,880
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

106
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,600
The boy looked just like him.

107
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
Such a little thing.

108
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,040
A bird without feathers.

109
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,000
They came to take his body away

110
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,560
and Robert held me.
l screamed and l battled, but he held me.

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
That little bundle.

112
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,360
They took him away
and l never saw him again.

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,680
Never have visited the crypt, never.

114
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,840
l pray to the Mother
every morning and night

115
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,960
that she return your child to you.

116
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,640
l am grateful.

117
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

118
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,560
(Bellows pumping, fire crackling)

119
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,400
A sword for the Wall?

120
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,400
- l already have one.
- Good man.

121
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,120
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course l have.

122
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
At someone, l mean.

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,480
lt's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

124
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
You realise we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

125
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
and some bone to keep it all standing.

126
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,600
Let me thank you ahead of time

127
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,360
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

128
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,920
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

129
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,880
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

130
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,880
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,OOO years.

131
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,920
ls it ''we'' already?

132
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,760
Have you taken your vows, then?

133
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,240
Soon enough.

134
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,720
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

135
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,720
l'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

136
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,000
it's only for life.

137
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,560
Thank you, Nymeria.

138
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,880
Septa Mordane says
l have to do it again.

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

140
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

141
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,760
lt's good you've got help.

142
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,400
Watch.

143
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,360
Nymeria, gloves.

144
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,560
(Whimpers)

145
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,440
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

146
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,440
Nymeria, gloves!

147
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,440
l have something for you.

148
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,760
And it has to be packed very carefully.

149
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,400
A present?

150
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,400
Close the door.

151
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,720
This is no toy.

152
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,960
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

153
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,720
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

154
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,760
l had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

155
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,080
lt won't hack a man's head om,

156
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,000
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

157
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,680
- l can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

158
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
How does it feel?

159
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,560
Do you like the balance?

160
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,080
l think so.

161
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,800
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

162
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,720
l know which end to use.

163
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
l'm going to miss you.

164
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,840
Careful.

165
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,440
All the best swords have names, you know.

166
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,480
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

167
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,040
l've got a needle of my own.

168
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,200
l came to say goodbye to Bran.

169
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,840
You've said it.

170
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,000
l wish l could be here when you wake up.

171
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
l'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

172
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,000
l'm taking the black.

173
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,280
l know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

174
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

175
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,320
l'll know my way around by then.

176
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,680
l'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

177
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,440
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

178
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,280
l want you...

179
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,000
to leave.

180
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,760
1T years ago

181
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,200
you rode om with Robert Baratheon.

182
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,520
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

183
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
And now you're leaving again.

184
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,840
l have no choice.

185
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,680
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

186
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,000
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

187
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,840
You do have a choice.

188
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
And you've made it.

189
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,240
Cat...

190
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,480
l can't do it, Ned.

191
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
l really can't.

192
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,720
You can.

193
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
You must.

194
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,520
You've said goodbye to Bran?

195
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,560
He's not going to die. l know it.

196
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,760
You Starks are hard to kill.

197
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,200
My mother?

198
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,760
- She was very kind.
- Good.

199
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,600
Next time l see you,
you'll be all in black.

200
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
lt was always my colour.

201
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,560
Farewell, Snow.

202
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,240
And you, Stark.

203
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,560
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

204
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,960
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

205
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,760
And you are a Stark.

206
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
You might not have my name,

207
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,920
but you have my blood.

208
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,200
ls my mother alive?

209
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,320
Does she know about me?
Where l am, where l'm going?

210
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,920
Does she care?

211
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,040
I
The next time we see each other

212
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,120
we'll talk about your mother.

213
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,920
Hmm?

214
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,440
l promise.

215
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,200
(Horse neighs)

216
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,280
Gods, this is country!

217
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,360
l've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

218
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,640
l've half a mind to go with you.

219
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,240
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

220
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,560
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

221
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,240
- You should have asked me 20 years ago.
- (Chuckles)

222
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,000
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

223
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,280
we never had the chance to be young.

224
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,960
l recall a few chances.

225
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,160
(Laughing)

226
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,200
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

227
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,160
That common girl of yours?

228
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,960
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

229
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,160
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

230
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,840
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

231
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,480
And her tits.

232
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,800
Yours was, er... Aleena?

233
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,680
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

234
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,640
Your bastard's mother?

235
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
- Wylla.
- That's it.

236
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,600
She must have been a rare wench

237
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,480
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

238
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,560
You never told me what she looked like.

239
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,760
Nor will l.

240
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,080
We were at war.

241
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,840
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

242
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,880
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

243
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,840
l swear if l weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

244
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,160
The worst thing about your coronation -

245
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,200
l'll never get to hit you again.

246
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,800
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

247
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,560
There was a rider in the night.

248
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,760
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

249
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,640
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

250
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,960
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

251
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,000
and a bold man to wield it.

252
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,840
She's little more than a child.

253
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,040
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

254
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,680
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

255
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,960
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

256
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,280
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

257
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
the woman l loved.

258
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,360
l'll kill every Targaryen l get my hands on.

259
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,320
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

260
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,960
This Khal Drogo,

261
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,880
it's said he has 100,OOO men
in his horde.

262
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,640
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

263
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,240
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

264
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,240
They have no ships, Robert.

265
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,200
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

266
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,840
lf the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

267
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,480
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

268
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,160
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

269
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
There's a war coming, Ned.

270
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,040
l don't know when,
l don't know who we'll be fighting,

271
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,560
but it's coming.

272
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,600
(Laughter)

273
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,080
(Whimpering)

274
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
(Grunting)

275
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,440
(Fox barking)

276
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,360
Sit.

277
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,160
You'll be fed.

278
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,680
Untie them.

279
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,920
Ah, rapers.

280
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,640
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

281
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,920
Most choose the knife.

282
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,160
Not impressed by your new brothers?

283
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,680
Lovely thing about the Watch -

284
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,000
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

285
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Why do you read so much?

286
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,560
Look at me and tell me what you see.

287
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,640
ls this a trick?

288
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,320
What you see is a dwarf.

289
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
lf l'd been born a peasant they might've
Ieft me out in the woods to die.

290
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,520
Alas, l was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

291
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,560
Things are expected of me.

292
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,000
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

293
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,040
Until your brother killed that king.

294
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,200
Yes, until my brother killed him.

295
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,560
Life is full of these little ironies.

296
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,200
My sister married the new king, and...

297
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,680
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

298
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,280
l must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

299
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,840
But how?

300
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,640
Well, my brother has his sword

301
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,960
and l have my mind,

302
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,960
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

303
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,600
That's why l read so much, Jon Snow.

304
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,280
And you?

305
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,480
What's your story, bastard?

306
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,440
Ask me nicely
and maybe l'll tell you, dwarf.

307
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,960
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

308
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,360
om to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

309
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,120
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

310
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,800
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

311
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,080
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

312
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,600
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

313
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,880
You're a smart boy.

314
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,360
You don't believe that nonsense.

315
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,360
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

316
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,040
(Wind howling)

317
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,160
(Creak)

318
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,400
lt's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

319
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,160
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

320
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,520
Talk to Poole about it.

321
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,520
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

322
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,080
We need a new steward,

323
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,120
and there are several other
appointments that require

324
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,960
- our immediate attention.
- l don't care about appointments!

325
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,080
(Footsteps)

326
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,080
l'll make the appointments.

327
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,640
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

328
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,680
Very good, my lord.

329
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
My lady.

330
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
(Distant howling)

331
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,080
(Distant barking, howling)

332
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,960
When was the last time you left this room?

333
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,480
l have to take care of him.

334
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,240
He's not going to die, Mother.

335
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,080
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

336
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
What if he's wrong?

337
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,560
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

338
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,280
- He's six.
- (Barking and howling continues)

339
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,480
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

340
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,840
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

341
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
l can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

342
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,920
- (Howling, barking)
- (Animal shrieking)

343
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
Fire.

344
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,160
- (People shouting)
- You stay here. l'll come back.

345
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,480
(Bell ringing)

346
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,120
(Barking, people shouting)

347
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,560
You're not supposed to be here.

348
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,160
No one is supposed to be here.

349
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,480
lt's a mercy.

350
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,360
He's dead already.

351
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,680
No!

352
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,320
(She yells)

353
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,440
(Both grunting)

354
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,680
- (Crunch)
- (Screaming)

355
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,800
(Slash)

356
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,720
(Gasping)

357
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,800
- (Snarling)
- (Screaming)

358
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,480
- (Ripping)
- (Choking, screaming)

359
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,520
(Whines softly)

360
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,840
(Horse neighs)

361
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,240
(People chatting, child crying)

362
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,560
(Animals bleating)

363
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,600
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

364
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,480
Everywhere? Even in the East?

365
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,440
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

366
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,360
- It is known.
- It is known.

367
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,200
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

368
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,360
The moon?

369
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,000
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

370
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,600
that once there were two moons in the sky.

371
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,480
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

372
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:21,440
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

373
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,320
and they drank the sun's fire.

374
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,280
(Chuckles) Moon is no egg.

375
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,040
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

376
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,560
- It is known.
- It is known.

377
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,880
Leave me with her.

378
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,280
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

379
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Men like to talk when they're happy.

380
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,800
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

381
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,080
How old were you?

382
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,600
l was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

383
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,240
Nine?!

384
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,120
l did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

385
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,960
First you must learn.

386
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,040
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

387
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,120
Yes.

388
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,880
Will it take three years?

389
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,880
No.

390
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,520
(Wind whistling)

391
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,440
(Horse snorts)

392
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,080
Welcome.

393
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,640
(Catelyn) What l am about to tell you
must remain between us.

394
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,560
l don't think Bran fell from that tower.

395
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,680
l think he was thrown.

396
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,600
The boy was always
surefooted before.

397
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,440
Someone tried to kill him twice.

398
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,280
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

399
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,960
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

400
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,600
- Saw what, my lady?
- l don't know.

401
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
But l would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

402
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,560
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

403
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,800
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

404
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,120
lt's too fine a weapon for such a man.

405
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,360
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

406
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,240
Someone gave it to him.

407
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,040
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

408
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,600
lf it's war they want...

409
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,760
lf it comes to that,
you know l'll stand behind you.

410
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,880
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,440
Hmm?

412
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,400
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

413
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,440
We don't know the truth yet.

414
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,800
Lord Stark must be told of this.

415
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,600
l don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

416
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,520
- l'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

417
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,720
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

418
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,560
- l will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

419
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,120
l must.

420
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,680
l'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

421
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,160
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

422
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
l don't want the Lannisters
to know l'm coming.

423
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,880
Let me accompany you at least.

424
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,880
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

425
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,800
What about Bran?

426
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,160
l have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

427
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,560
Bran's life is in their hands now.

428
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,920
No, Khaleesi.

429
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,760
You must look in his eyes always.

430
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Love comes in at the eyes.

431
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,120
lt is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

432
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,000
with nothing but her eyes.

433
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,240
Finish a man?

434
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,840
Oh.

435
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,360
Kings travelled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

436
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,000
Magisters sold their palaces.

437
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,400
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

438
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,920
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

439
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:22,960
and she refused them all.

440
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,160
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

441
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,880
l... l don't think

442
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,360
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

443
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,640
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

444
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,720
Men want what they've never had.

445
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,040
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

446
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,280
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

447
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,240
Then don't make love like a slave.

448
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,760
(Gasps) Very good, Khaleesi.

449
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,800
Out there he is the mighty khal,

450
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,640
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

451
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
l... l don't think

452
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,280
that this is the Dothraki way.

453
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,360
lf he wanted the Dothraki way,

454
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,200
why did he marry you?

455
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,960
No.

456
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,160
No!

457
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,960
Tonight l would look upon your face!

458
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,040
(Girls laugh)

459
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,960
Pardon me, ser.

460
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,840
Do l frighten you so much, girl?

461
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,240
Or is it him there making you shake?

462
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,680
He frightens me too.

463
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,160
Look at that face.

464
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:19,760
l'm sorry if l omended you, ser.

465
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,240
Why won't he speak to me?

466
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,200
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

467
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,160
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

468
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,920
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

469
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,320
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.

470
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,840
The Royal Executioner.

471
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,120
What is it, sweet lady?

472
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,840
Does the hound frighten you?

473
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,400
Away with you, dog.

474
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,840
You're scaring my lady.

475
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,000
l don't like to see you upset.

476
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,200
The sun's finally shining.

477
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,800
Come walk with me.

478
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,800
Stay, Lady.

479
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,120
(Whines)

480
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,480
(Laughing)

481
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,920
l probably shouldn't have any more.

482
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,200
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

483
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,160
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

484
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,240
(Sticks clacking)

485
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,760
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

486
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,680
- l'll get you!
- (Laughing)

487
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,360
Arya!

488
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,600
Ow!

489
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,320
What are you doing here?

490
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,360
- Go away.
- Your sister?

491
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,760
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.

492
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,840
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

493
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,160
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

494
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,360
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

495
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:19,960
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

496
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,560
l'm your prince, not your lord,

497
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,280
and l said pick up your sword.

498
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,520
lt's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

499
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,400
And you're not a knight.

500
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,840
Only a butcher's boy.

501
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,760
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

502
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,040
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

503
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:43,120
l won't hurt him...

504
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,160
much.

505
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,680
(Whimpers)

506
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,520
- Arya!
- (Growls)

507
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,800
Filthy little bitch!

508
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,680
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

509
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,400
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

510
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,400
l'll gut you, you little cunt!

511
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,080
- (Snarling)
- (Joffrey screams)

512
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,120
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

513
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:09,080
Arya!

514
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,640
Nymeria!

515
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,680
(Joffrey whimpering)

516
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,200
No.

517
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,640
No. Please don't.

518
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
Arya, leave him alone.

519
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,520
(Barks)

520
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,200
My prince, my poor prince,
Iook what they did to you.

521
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,560
Stay here. l'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

522
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:46,800
Then go!

523
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,800
Don't touch me.

524
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,760
(Rustling, footsteps)

525
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,680
(Man) The wolfs not here.
Look down by the stream.

526
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,040
(Nymeria whines)

527
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,240
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

528
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
Go on. Run.

529
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,400
Go! Leave now!

530
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,760
- It's a direwolf.
- l'll check down here.

531
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,560
- (Whines)
- (Man) l think l heard a noise.

532
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,600
Go!

533
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,800
- (Dogs barking)
- (Ned) Arya!

534
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,040
(Man) Arya!

535
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:47,600
(Ned) Arya!

536
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,480
(Man) Arya!

537
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,040
Arya!

538
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,280
(Man) Arya!

539
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
My lord!

540
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,480
My Lord! They've found her.

541
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,000
- She's unharmed.
- (Man) Arya!

542
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,320
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

543
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,200
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

544
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,320
- (Man) Arya!
- Right, get back.

545
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,000
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

546
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:13,240
Back! Back to the inn!

547
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:15,880
All back!

548
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,160
l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

549
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,720
- Are you hurt?
- No.

550
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,200
Oh, it's all right.

551
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,480
What is the meaning of this?

552
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:35,560
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

553
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:37,360
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

554
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:38,840
Quiet, woman.

555
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:42,920
Sorry, Ned. l never meant to frighten the girl.

556
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:45,280
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

557
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,880
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

558
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,080
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm om.

559
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,000
That's not true!

560
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,560
She just... bit him a little.

561
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,920
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Jom told us what happened.

562
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,080
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

563
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,680
That's not what happened!

564
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

565
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,040
- Liar!
- Shut up!

566
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,520
(Robert) Enough!

567
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,440
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

568
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,680
Seven hells!
What am l to make of this?

569
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,440
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

570
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:21,480
She's not.

571
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,920
Sansa, come here, darling.

572
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,880
(Murmuring)

573
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,240
Now, child...

574
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:39,080
tell me what happened.

575
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:41,160
Tell it all and tell it true.

576
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,640
lt's a great crime to lie to a king.

577
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,880
l don't know.

578
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,880
l don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

579
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,200
- l didn't see.
- Liar!

580
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,680
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

581
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,960
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

582
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:07,400
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

583
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,440
- l want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

584
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,960
whip her through the streets?

585
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,000
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

586
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,640
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

587
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,520
You let that little girl disarm you?

588
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,320
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

589
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,120
- l'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

590
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,200
(Cersei) And what of the direwolf?

591
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,280
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

592
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,520
l'd forgot the damned wolf.

593
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,160
I
We found no trace of the direwolf
Your Grace.

594
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,360
No? So be it.

595
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,440
We have another wolf.

596
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:57,240
As you will.

597
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,480
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolfs no pet.

598
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,680
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

599
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,360
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

600
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:08,960
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

601
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,080
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

602
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,000
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

603
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,440
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

604
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:18,200
ls this your command?

605
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,680
Your Grace?

606
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,960
(Door slams)

607
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,240
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

608
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,240
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.

609
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,720
No.

610
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:36,600
Jory...

611
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,960
take the girls to their rooms.

612
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:46,400
- (Sansa sobbing)
- If it must be done,

613
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,400
then l'll do it myself.

614
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,480
ls this some trick?

615
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,560
The wolf is of the North.

616
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:56,360
She deserves better than a butcher.

617
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,880
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

618
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,920
He ran.

619
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,560
Not very fast.

620
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:54,480
(Whines)

621
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,720
(Whines)

622
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,360
(Whimpers)

623
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,520
(Soft groaning)

624
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,840
(Lady whines)

625
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,200
(lnhales)

626
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,280
(Lady yelps)
