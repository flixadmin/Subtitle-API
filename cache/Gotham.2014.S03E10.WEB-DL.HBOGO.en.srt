1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,360
Oh no.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,840
Help me! Help me! Somebody help!

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,440
They think she might have fallen
asleep at the wheel.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,440
Her brake lines were cut!

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,520
Which leaves one conclusion. Murder.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,880
And I know who did it.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hold on, Butch.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,560
I might be in trouble.
I stole a necklace.

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
Why is this necklace so important?
What makes someone kill for it?

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,240
- What is it?
- A key.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,600
We need to go somewhere.

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,040
We'll go to my house.

14
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,480
You two are a couple now?

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
- No.
- Yes.

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,440
My engagement announcement is
coming out in the Gazette tomorrow.

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,480
And it will feature Mario's name.

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
His family name.

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
You mean Falcone?

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Such a beautiful space
for a rehearsal dinner.

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,200
We can't thank you enough.

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,720
And did Roberto's food live
up to all my hype?

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Are you kidding?

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,440
Any more Burrata, and I wouldn't fit
into my wedding dress.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,920
I can't believe we're getting married
in two days!

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,080
Have you two settled on a,
honeymoon destination?

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,480
No. But Lee finally agreed
to take some time off of work.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,960
With everything going on, I didn't
wanna leave anybody in the lurch.

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,880
I was very sorry
to hear about Captain Barnes.

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
He's a good man.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
What he did was due entirely
to the virus.

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,280
What's truly frightening
is that nobody knew.

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,480
Nobody could see it.

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,720
There aren't any symptoms?

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,920
Well looking back
now there were signs,

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
increased strength,
emotional instability...

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,480
Nothing he couldn't hide.

38
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
The lab analyzing Alice Tetch's blood
has developed a test

39
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,720
to see if someone's infected.

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
- You're kidding. When?
- They just finished.

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,120
It's a step toward finding a cure.

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,760
- How are we? Good?
- Wonderful, Roberto.

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
We can't wait for tomorrow night.

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Your rehearsal dinner's
gonna be <i>fantastico.</i>

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,720
We're gonna take care of everything.

46
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,840
It's a privilege to serve you again,
Don Falcone.

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Don Falcone. Please.

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,520
We'll pull your car around.

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Okay.

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,800
Wonderful evening, Roberto.
Appreciate...

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I love you.

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
I love you, too.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,920
You don't understand anything, okay?

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
My friend just got blown up.

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
Now, I wanna know what happened?

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
{\an5}We need to talk.

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,840
{\an5}Is everyone okay?

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,040
{\an5}A few first degree burns
but that's it.

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
{\an5}They were lucky.

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,560
{\an5}Any idea who might have done this?

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,680
{\an5}I've made my share of enemies
over the years. Could be anyone.

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
{\an5}Why come after you now?

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
{\an5}My oldest son is getting married.

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,840
{\an5}When better to settle an old score
and hurt me and my family?

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
{\an5}Maybe.

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
{\an5}Or maybe someone thinks
you're coming out of retirement?

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,240
{\an5}- I'm not.
- Good.

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,840
{\an5}Doesn't mean I'm gonna stand by
after something like this.

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,960
{\an5}The Captain of Police
was just indicted for murder

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,240
{\an5}and sent to Arkham.

71
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,760
{\an5}The last thing I need
is you and your men

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,680
{\an5}tearing up Gotham
looking for revenge.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
{\an5}I didn't start this.

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,120
{\an5}I'll get to the bottom of it.

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
{\an5}You have my word.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
{\an5}I'll give you one day.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,600
As members of the five families
you are well aware,

78
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,400
{\an5}that with the tragic downfall
of Captain Barnes,

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
{\an5}people are frightened.

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
{\an5}They will be looking to us
for stability.

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
{\an5}To feel safe.

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,760
{\an5}So, how does a 50 percent increase
on protection fees sound!

83
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,040
{\an5}Sounds a little steep to me.

84
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,800
{\an5}What do we have here?
A little family reunion?

85
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,640
{\an5}Did my invitation get lost
in the mail?

86
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,920
{\an5}No. This meeting is for grown-ups,

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,960
{\an5}so I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

88
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Quick question.

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,920
Is it, "How do I commit suicide?"

90
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,240
Because that answer is coming.

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Tabitha and Butch are missing.
Where are they?

92
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I have no idea.

93
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,320
I have not seen Butch

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
since his little summer stock
revival of the Red Hood Gang.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
Let's cut the crap, shall we?

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,720
Tabitha has been helping Butch hide

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,640
since your little
victory celebration.

98
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,080
They're an item now. Barf.

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,320
She's supposed to check
in every night, and she hasn't.

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,640
She's not answering her phone
and no one has seen her.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
- And you think I took them?
- Obviously.

102
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
How about this, you lower your gun,

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,960
and beg my forgiveness
for this gross insubordination,

104
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,960
and I might let you walk out
of here alive.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,840
<i>Damn it.</i>

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,320
My apologies.

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,000
They must have run off somewhere
without telling me.

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,400
Love.

109
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,720
It makes people do crazy things,
doesn't it?

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,680
We have a history, you and I.

111
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,040
But, if you ever point a gun
at me again,

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Olga will be cleaning your brains
off the floor.

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,360
She's a real whiz with stains.

114
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Bye, Pengy.

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
Everyone out, now!

116
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Are you checking up on me?

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,080
What? No.

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Barbara Kean was just here.

119
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
She's looking for them.

120
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,960
- So?
- So, are you finished yet?

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,280
We've talked about this.

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,040
I need to work through my grief
my way.

123
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
<i>Of course, and I support you.</i>

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,800
Any chance you could work through it
a smidge faster?

125
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,120
<i>I am swamped today.</i>

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Sorry you had to hear that.

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,640
He can just be so self-centered.

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,800
- What were we talking about?
- I'm gonna kill you!

129
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,000
Right, how I found you.

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Well...

131
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,720
...it wasn't hard.

132
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
The next time you wanna disappear,

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,280
consider taking a sabbatical
from your favorite restaurant.

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
Your love
of Gusto's Eggplant Parmesan

135
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
isn't exactly a state secret.

136
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,600
Come here.

137
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
That, with a healthy amount
of Midazolam

138
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,680
in your food to knock you out.

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,640
A hundred bucks to your delivery boy,
who by the way,

140
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,520
I get the feeling hasn't been being
tipped very well, Butch.

141
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm sorry. What was that?

142
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,520
You're gonna regret this!

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
You're gonna regret this.

144
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
If you touch one hair on her head,
I swear I'll kill you.

145
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Save your strength, big guy.
You're gonna need it.

146
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
And you tell Penguin he's a coward!

147
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,520
If he wants me dead, he should
come here and do it like a man!

148
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,680
This has nothing
to do with Penguin...

149
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,640
...and you are the coward.

150
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,680
Killing an innocent woman.

151
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,800
What? Who?

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Isabella.

153
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,200
She was my everything,
and you took her from me!

154
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,440
What in the hell
are you talkin' about?

155
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
I was hoping you'd be difficult.

156
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,840
Hey.

157
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
You okay?

158
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Stomach.

159
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,080
Being acting captain
is such a strain, why do it?

160
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm the senior guy around here.

161
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,600
- What about Tuttle?
- Tuttle?

162
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Guy shot a cat last week.

163
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
- On purpose?
- Does it matter?

164
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,680
Look, I might not have always seen
eye-to-eye with Barnes,

165
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
but he was a good captain.

166
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
Least I can do is keep his seat warm

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
until they find some kind of cure
for this virus.

168
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,720
Detective Gordon...

169
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,880
Car bomb used a mercury switch
with military-grade plastic.

170
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
That's kinda high-end for a mob hit.

171
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
That's not all.

172
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,880
The explosive was laced
with some sort of accelerant.

173
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,360
Made the explosion burn at 10 times
the heat of standard C-4.

174
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,800
Whoever set this bomb
didn't want anything left behind.

175
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,440
Only one guy I know
with that level of expertise.

176
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,840
Ex-military nut job
goes by the name of "Fuse."

177
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
This is our guy.

178
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Not for nothing,

179
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,680
ensuring Don Falcone's safety
is not why I wear the badge.

180
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,960
- It's not just about him.
- You mean Lee.

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,440
If you're worried,
you could tell her not to marry

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,200
the son of a former crime boss.

183
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,440
GCPD!

184
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Dead but still warm.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
Whoever did this must've just left.

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
So whoever hired Fuse to plant
the bomb doesn't want any loose ends?

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
Looks like he was on his way
out of town.

188
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,880
Must have figured his employers
weren't that forgivin'.

189
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,960
Guy can pack,
I'll give him that much.

190
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
Once a soldier, always a soldier.

191
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,000
Bed sheets aren't tucked in.

192
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Times, locations,
surveillance photos.

193
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
This doesn't make any sense.

194
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
What?

195
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
Carmine's not the target.

196
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Down!

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What the hell's going on?

198
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
Carmine's not the target.

199
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
You are.

200
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
<i>Voila.</i>

201
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,200
Thank you very much, Master Bruce.

202
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
What is this?

203
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,920
That is a Pennyworth signature
Frittata.

204
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
It's a crustless quiche.

205
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,400
It's eggs, Miss.
Just, just eat it, will ya?

206
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
Where's your mate, anyway?

207
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,920
Conservatory.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
Girl loves it there.

209
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,120
Well, she's hardly,
what you call, a girl, is she?

210
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,440
Yeah. Well, thanks for the crustless
egg thing, but I got errands to run.

211
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,360
No, sorry, miss.
No one is to leave the house,

212
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,640
until we find exactly
who is following you.

213
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,080
It's been days.
I can't take it anymore!

214
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm sorry. What is it exactly
that you object to?

215
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,040
Is it the gourmet food
or the king-size double-bed

216
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
with the Egyptian linen?

217
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,880
Would you tell the help here
that I can come and go as I please?

218
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,120
- Please.
- Alfred's right.

219
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,320
It's not safe for you to be
in Gotham alone.

220
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,160
I've been in Gotham alone
my whole life.

221
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,000
I can take care of myself.
Nothing's changed.

222
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

223
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
You've made that clear.

224
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,160
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

225
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Those men were willing
to kill for this key.

226
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
We need to know why.

227
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
I'll be in the study.

228
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,960
There's more books
I haven't gone through.

229
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,440
There has to be a reference
to the key somewhere.

230
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,400
And have you stopped to consider
that maybe it's just an old key?

231
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
No.

232
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
I'll get you some breakfast, miss.

233
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
You know? Some of these plants
would do much better

234
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
in direct sunlight.

235
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,440
Could you turn off the alarm
so I can put them outside?

236
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,920
Well, maybe later.

237
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,160
I'd rather not you be walking around
the grounds on your own.

238
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,320
Can you smell this.

239
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Beg your pardon?

240
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,520
Right here.

241
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,640
What is that?

242
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,240
Just a mix of clove, fenugreek,
and yarrow root oils.

243
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
It's lovely.

244
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
- It is, isn't it?
- Yeah.

245
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,800
Now, I need you to tell me something,
okay?

246
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Anything.

247
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,200
How do you turn off the alarm?

248
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,560
This doesn't make any sense.

249
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,280
Do you know anyone
who might want you dead?

250
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
You can't be serious.

251
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,400
- Everyone has enemies.
- No, Detective. They don't.

252
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Regardless.

253
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
You need to limit your exposure.

254
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,320
Lay low for a while until I can
find out who's behind this.

255
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
How do you propose I do that?

256
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm picking up our wedding rings
this afternoon.

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
Lee and I are getting married
tomorrow.

258
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
You want me to cancel the wedding.

259
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,600
- I just wanna keep you safe.
- I'd bet you'd love that.

260
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
I run home to Lee.

261
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,560
Tell her we need to hide until
Detective Gordon can save the day?

262
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
This is not a time for ego.

263
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, you're talking to me about ego?

264
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,080
How do I even know
you're gonna be able to find him?

265
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Or that you'll even try?

266
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
You need to trust me.

267
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,360
Whoever is behind this is gonna keep
coming until they get the job done.

268
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
If that's true...

269
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,040
...it doesn't matter where we go
or what we do.

270
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,840
As long as I got a target on my back,
Lee isn't safe.

271
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
- Hey.
- Yeah.

272
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,520
Keep an eye on Mario.
Don't let him leave.

273
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,840
- What are you doing?
- I'm keeping an eye on Mario.

274
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't look at him.

275
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,880
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

276
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
Something doesn't fit.

277
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,840
I need to talk to Carmine.

278
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,640
Maybe once he knows Mario's the
target something will jog his memory.

279
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,520
- Just, just keep it...
- I got it. I got it.

280
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,920
Hello, Comrade.

281
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,280
Comrade is not Russian word.

282
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh, shut up. Of course it is.

283
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,000
- You shouldn't be here.
- Relax.

284
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,280
I know Penguin's out for a few hours.

285
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I just wanna talk.

286
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,640
I don't know anything.

287
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,600
Listen, I grew up in a place
like this.

288
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
A large staff of people always coming
and going.

289
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,880
Listening.

290
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,320
You can't help but overhear things.

291
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,240
- Is handsome ring.
- It is.

292
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,280
And very expensive.

293
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
I bet it would look just fabulous
on you.

294
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,680
Mr. Penguin, he treat me nice.

295
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,160
I have warm feeling for him.

296
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
- But the other one...
- Nygma?

297
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,520
I don't know why Mr. Penguin
likes him so much.

298
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,640
He could do better.

299
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,960
Wait.

300
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
You mean likes, likes?

301
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Wow.

302
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,840
Okay, we should definitely revisit
that another time.

303
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,080
But what about Nygma?

304
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,200
Did he say anything
about my missing friend?

305
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,400
I don't know, but I hear
Mr. Nygma talking about

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,280
special delivery but nothing come
to the house but bill.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
"Stocks & Bondage?"

308
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,040
How many times
do I have to tell you?

309
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,880
I have never
even heard of this woman.

310
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,240
Well, then I suppose I should put
my attention elsewhere.

311
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,280
No! No!

312
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,480
- Leave her out of this!
- Afraid I can't do that.

313
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,800
She is an integral part
of your penance.

314
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,120
It was such a pleasant surprise

315
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
when I discovered that the two
of you were together.

316
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,120
You know,
after the initial gag reflex.

317
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,760
You know,
I bet this gal doesn't even exist.

318
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,040
I mean, come on.

319
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,040
Who would fall in love
with a freak show like you?

320
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,400
Oh, wait.

321
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Let me guess.

322
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,880
I bet she's got a certificate, too,
huh?

323
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,360
What do you want?

324
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,440
Tell me what you want.

325
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,360
Tell me what you want.

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,040
I want to break Butch's heart
before I end his life.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,840
You know, kind of a
eye-for-an-eye thing.

328
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
But in this case...

329
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,280
...I'll take a hand.

330
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Is that vinegar?

331
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,680
Vinegar and baking soda.

332
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,560
Takes tarnish off anything.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,880
Selina, that key
is hundreds of years old!

334
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm not an idiot, you know.

335
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,280
Maybe there's something on the key
that you can't see,

336
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
because a hundred years of crap
is covering it up?

337
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,120
Why did you tell Ivy
we weren't a couple?

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,640
- Why did you tell her we were?
- Is that a trick question?

339
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,240
Why can't we just be us?

340
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,600
Can you take that key out now?
It's making me nervous.

341
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,920
There's an engraving on it.

342
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,120
Like a bird or something.

343
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,680
Not just a bird.

344
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
An owl.

345
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,600
- And?
- Alfred!

346
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
If you're right, merely possessing
this key could be seen

347
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,600
as breaking your agreement
with the people

348
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,560
that the woman
in the owl mask represents.

349
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,320
Which is why we need to contact them.

350
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,720
They have to understand Ivy didn't
know what she was stealing.

351
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,360
Wait, where is she anyhow?

352
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Oh, bloody hell. She's gone.

353
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,440
How did she disable the alarm?

354
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Don't worry about that now,
all right?

355
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,960
What's the big deal?
She'll be back when she's hungry.

356
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,240
Wayne Manor.

357
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
<i>You have the necklace.</i>

358
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
<i>We have your friend.</i>

359
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,360
We'll make exchange, no?

360
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,320
Where and when?

361
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,800
We're supposed to go down
the manhole?

362
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
That's what they said.

363
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,120
All right, give me the key.
I'll sort it out.

364
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
No.

365
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,160
I need to speak with them personally.

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Make sure they understand
this was a mistake.

367
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Very well, Master Bruce.

368
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,920
There's no way of asking you
to stay here

369
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
that doesn't end with you
yelling at me, is there?

370
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
No.

371
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Over there.

372
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
Ivy?

373
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,160
It's about time!

374
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,240
My name is Bruce Wayne.

375
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,920
I need to speak with Kathryn.

376
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,440
She needs to understand
I've honored our deal.

377
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,560
Hand over the necklace
and you get your friend back.

378
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
That's the deal.

379
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,480
You mean the key, don't you?

380
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,040
You're not getting it back until
I talk to the people you work for.

381
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,720
Maybe we just kill you and take it?

382
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,840
You think we're stupid
enough to bring it with us?

383
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
You really want it back?

384
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,160
I'd listen to him.

385
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,920
Put the tools down, lads, aye?

386
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,440
I need reassurances my friends
are no longer in any danger.

387
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,800
I need to speak to the woman
in the mask.

388
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,360
Any assurances
that woman gives you are lies.

389
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,080
How do you know?

390
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,880
Because the people
you are talking about have no honor.

391
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,040
And they will betray you
as they betrayed us.

392
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
Wait. You, you don't work for them?

393
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,320
No, we work to destroy them.

394
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
Who are they?

395
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,840
They call themselves
the Court of Owls.

396
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,560
- They're after Mario?
- Yes.

397
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,480
- Where is he?
- GCPD. He's safe for now.

398
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,600
But I can't help him
if you don't tell me what's going on.

399
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,440
You think I'm holding something back?

400
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,120
A military grade explosion.

401
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,040
The clean up.

402
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,000
A sword-wielding assassin
in broad daylight.

403
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,720
This doesn't feel like a mob grudge.

404
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
What else is there?

405
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,080
Could Mario be mixed up in something?

406
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,240
Is that what you came to ask me?

407
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm working the evidence I have.

408
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,800
I understand why
you'd want to believe

409
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,800
the man who's marrying Lee
must be mixed up in something.

410
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,080
But my son is the most
decent person I've ever known.

411
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,800
He's not like us.

412
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
That just tells me
there's something you don't know.

413
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,200
<i>Jim, Mario's gone.</i>

414
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,680
You were supposed to keep him there.

415
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,720
I know, I tried, but he said
he didn't trust you or the GCPD.

416
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,680
to take care of this,
so he was going to.

417
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,400
Whatever the hell that means.

418
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
What is it?

419
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,080
Mario just walked out of the GCPD.

420
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,800
I think he's gonna try
to finish this himself.

421
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,920
How?

422
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
I have a pretty good idea.

423
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

424
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,760
I had something that was supposed
to be delivered to me.

425
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,160
Could you check your records?

426
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,800
Sure. Let me check the safe.

427
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,120
What was the last name?

428
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
- Nygma.
- Oh!

429
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,320
That item was already delivered.

430
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,800
Great.

431
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,920
Well, I guess as long
as I'm already here,

432
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,840
I should pick up
something for the weekend.

433
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Right?

434
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,560
Well, this looks fun.

435
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,280
Could I ask a favor of you...

436
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
- Todd.
- Todd.

437
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,200
Could you show me how this works?

438
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,760
We're not really supposed to...

439
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,280
I won't tell if you don't.

440
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,600
It's pretty basic, really.

441
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,080
You just put your arms through here,
and then your head through here.

442
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
And you bring it up...

443
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,000
And then... Oh! Hey!

444
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,360
Do you like role-play, Todd?

445
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
Good.

446
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,480
I will play the beautiful,
coquettish bank robber

447
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,640
who needs to get into that safe,
and you...

448
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,760
...get to play the lucky
young shopkeeper

449
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,320
who gives her the combination.

450
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Okay?

451
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,040
My friend was taken by this man,
Nygma.

452
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I need to know where she is.

453
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,040
If I find her, I could come back here
and personally thank you.

454
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,360
Give Mommy the combination.

455
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,560
Nine to twenty five, seventy two.

456
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Good.

457
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,280
Nygma, you sick bastard.

458
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,960
Hey!

459
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,680
You can't just leave me here!

460
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Hello?

461
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,720
Oh, goodie.

462
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You're finally awake.

463
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,840
The show continues.

464
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,320
Ta-da!

465
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,520
I designed it myself.

466
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,760
You want to see how it works? Okay!

467
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,640
I love a captive audience.

468
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,920
So, we'll set the timer for,
say, 55 seconds.

469
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
Now, when the timer hits zero,

470
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,720
the spring-loaded blade is released.

471
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
Simple. Now.

472
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
For the fun part.

473
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,000
You can stop the blade
from being released

474
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,800
if you click this little button.

475
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,760
But if you do,
it will send a fatal jolt

476
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,440
of electricity to zap Butch.

477
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
It's a simple test, really.

478
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,800
Stop the blade from falling
and kill Butch, or...

479
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
The choice...

480
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,960
...my dear, is yours.

481
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,720
Will we hear the zap of heartbreak?

482
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,400
Or the sound of one hand clapping?

483
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,080
My name is Volk.

484
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,760
My brother, Jacob,
and that's Dmitry.

485
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,680
What's with the stupid mask?

486
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,760
I like you.

487
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,720
You remind me of my sister in Kiev.

488
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,120
Dmitry is an initiate.

489
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,640
The mask ensures his silence
until he proves himself

490
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,760
and becomes a full member.

491
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
Of what? Who are you?

492
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,120
We are called the Whisper Gang.

493
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,880
Gotham's most notorious smugglers.

494
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,040
We used to number in the hundreds

495
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,080
until the Court saw
our growing strength,

496
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,240
and they offered us a partnership,

497
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,480
only to betray us.

498
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,960
Many escaped back to Ukraine
but a few of us stayed back,

499
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,360
hoping to find a way
to enact revenge.

500
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And we did.

501
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
The key.

502
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Well, what does it open?

503
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
A safe.

504
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
It is in one of the Court's
buildings...

505
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
...here.

506
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,360
Inside, there is a, a device,
that we believe

507
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
can destroy them.

508
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,240
What, like, some kind of weapon?

509
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,040
Well, honestly, we don't know.

510
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,200
We captured a member,
but even he didn't know

511
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,400
what's inside the safe,
only that the Court fears it falling

512
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,920
into the hands of their enemies.

513
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Wait, wouldn't they know
you stole it?

514
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,600
They're probably waiting for you
to show up there.

515
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,760
No. Because originally,
the safe had two keys.

516
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,840
The Court still has one of them,
and the second was thought lost.

517
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Until I found it.

518
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
You mean we did.

519
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,200
The Court of Owls killed my parents.

520
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,160
I stood down because I thought
there was no way to defeat them.

521
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
What are you proposing?

522
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,120
If what you're saying is true,

523
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,600
and there is something
in that safe...

524
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,920
...then that's no longer the case.

525
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Mario?

526
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,880
You really think this is a good idea?

527
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,040
Using yourself as bait?

528
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,160
If those guys are out there,
Lee isn't safe.

529
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,920
They're pros.
You're gonna get killed.

530
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What do you care?

531
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,000
- Why would someone want to kill you?
- I have no idea.

532
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,400
Because it seems to me,

533
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,520
an operation like this
doesn't happen for no reason,

534
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,440
and putting yourself
in the crosshairs feels a lot like

535
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,600
someone protecting a secret.

536
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120
I want to protect Lee.

537
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
That's it.

538
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,240
We're sitting ducks in here.
We need to get away from bystanders.

539
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
- They're here.
- What?

540
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Get down!

541
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
No, no!

542
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,480
No! No, please!

543
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
You could've killed her.

544
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,360
Who sent you?

545
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
Why are you coming after me?

546
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,240
You know why.

547
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Ed, come on.

548
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,120
Come on, let's talk about this, huh?

549
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,640
Come on, Ed.
You don't have to do this.

550
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,920
Come on, let's talk about this.
Come on! Listen!

551
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,360
I told you, I've never heard
of anyone named Isabelle!

552
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,880
Isabella!

553
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,400
Why is that so difficult?

554
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,160
Also, I'm not the one
you should be pleading with.

555
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,400
Your life is in her...

556
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
...hand.

557
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,520
What difference does it make?

558
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,320
You're gonna kill me
one way or the other, right?

559
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Good point.

560
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
New deal.

561
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,880
If she loves you enough
to sacrifice her hand.

562
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,640
Twinsies.

563
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,280
In exchange for your life.

564
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,440
I swear on the memory
of my beloved Isabella,

565
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,680
I will set you both free.

566
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,200
Tabby.

567
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,400
Baby, come on.

568
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,560
We can get out of here, we can...

569
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,520
I like you, Butch. I really do.

570
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
But to be completely honest,

571
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm not exactly in a "love"
place right now.

572
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Sorry, big fella.

573
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,960
I wish I could say
that I was surprised,

574
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,640
but I knew that she was going
to say that.

575
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,720
It's why I made the offer.

576
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,360
Any final words?

577
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
I would keep it brief.

578
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Tabby.

579
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Baby.

580
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,560
The last few weeks
have been the best of my life.

581
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,680
And it's okay you don't love me.

582
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
'Cause I love you.

583
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,200
And for a guy like me?
That's, that's enough.

584
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,280
And you.

585
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,840
You're damn right I killed her.

586
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
I killed the woman you loved.

587
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,880
You know what she said to me?

588
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,120
Right before I put a bullet
in her brain?

589
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,120
You know what she told me?

590
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
She said she wished
she would have been with a real man.

591
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
Hey, Butch.

592
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Yeah?

593
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
You're sweet.

594
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,880
No!

595
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
No!

596
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
Untie me!

597
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Please, untie me!
She's got to get to a hospital!

598
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Quick!

599
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,720
You said that you put
a bullet in her head.

600
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,560
Isabella died in a car crash.

601
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,120
- The brake lines were cut.
- I don't care!

602
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,640
I told you I never heard of her!

603
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,960
You, you really didn't kill her?

604
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,520
No! Untie me!

605
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,480
She's got to get to a hospital,
come on!

606
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,320
I'd put that hand on some ice.

607
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,440
Neither of you recognize him?

608
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
No.

609
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Has he said anything?

610
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,960
Not a peep.

611
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,280
Hey, I ran your guy's prints.

612
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,960
They're not in the system,
which, considering he's a pro,

613
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,280
wasn't that hard to believe.

614
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah, still, now that we have him,

615
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,240
we should work him,
find out who's behind this.

616
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,800
You better act quick. Call came in.

617
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,600
They're transferring him
to a federal facility upstate.

618
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,840
What? No, no, no, no.
We can't let this guy leave.

619
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,640
What can I do? My hands are tied.

620
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,040
The Feds want him, they get him.

621
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,960
The question is why?

622
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,960
Maybe somebody wants him
out of this precinct.

623
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Away from us.

624
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,800
I don't know anyone
with that kind of pull.

625
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Do you?

626
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,360
The other assassin.

627
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,120
You want to tell me
what happened in the store?

628
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
There's nothing to tell.

629
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,040
He came after me,
I did what I needed to do.

630
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
You called her?

631
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,400
She deserves to know what's going on.

632
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,640
Either you tell her or I will.

633
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Come on.

634
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,520
I think I know who sent you.

635
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,360
But I need to know for sure.

636
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,520
And we both know
that you're not going to tell me.

637
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
So...

638
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,680
So, how does it feel?

639
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,160
I don't know,
maybe I could be captain.

640
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,120
Yell at people for not having proof,
or, at one of my detectives

641
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
for going after a pair of assassins
all by his lonesome.

642
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,320
- Not bad.
- Right?

643
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,120
Very interesting play, by the way.

644
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,240
It's not every day that you get
to save the man

645
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,040
who's marrying the woman you love.

646
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,560
Yeah, I'm really something.

647
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
It's not too late, Jim.

648
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,680
Lee deserves to know how you feel.

649
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,680
God knows, I know,
that life gives us enough regret.

650
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,400
There's no need adding to it.

651
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
- Oh, crap.
- I know it's hard.

652
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,800
It's just, it's something
you have to...

653
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Falcone.

654
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,680
Falcone, up against the wall!

655
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,200
What are you doing?

656
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
Just having a chat.

657
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,200
Turns out our friend here
works for a former associate of mine.

658
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,680
So now that I know who's behind this,
I can take care of it, my way.

659
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,960
- It's over.
- You think you're gonna walk away?

660
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,360
You just assaulted a suspect
in police custody.

661
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,920
He won't be pressing charges.

662
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,880
I'm gonna find out
what happened today.

663
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,600
Who's pulling the strings,
and how Mario's involved.

664
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Trust me.

665
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,160
If I were you, I'd let it go.

666
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,800
Gather the men.

667
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,760
Tell them we are joining forces
with the boy.

668
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
I will brief them tomorrow night
myself.

669
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Volk!

670
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,640
Dmitry, eyes.

671
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,960
We know you've been
searching for the second key.

672
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,760
Have you found it?

673
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,840
I'll ask you again.

674
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,320
Have you found the second key?

675
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,040
Why don't you ask Dmitry, huh?

676
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Think she'll be okay?

677
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,160
- Think they can re-attach the hand?
- Please, she's tough as nails.

678
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,280
She'll be fine.

679
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,720
You know this is war, right?

680
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,680
Nygma, Penguin,
anyone who stands with them...

681
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,960
- They're all dead.
- This woman Isabella,

682
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,240
Nygma said she was a librarian,
right?

683
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,680
Well, who kills a librarian?
I mean, what's the motive?

684
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,840
I don't know.

685
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,080
Maybe someone had an overdue book,
and things got out of hand.

686
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,600
Excuse me, but you just can't walk...

687
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,000
Come on! Come on!

688
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,120
We got a hand here, people. Hand!

689
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,920
You cut someone's brake lines.

690
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
You know where they're going
and when.

691
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
You'd know...

692
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
You know them.

693
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,760
I know who did it.

694
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
I know who killed the librarian.

695
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Who?

696
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,720
The same person who's in love
with Nygma

697
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,440
and doesn't want to share him.

698
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,000
Okay. One woman in love
with that psychotic bean pole

699
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,520
defies explanation, but two?

700
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,920
Who said anything about a woman?

701
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,600
I am tired of sitting
at the kids' table.

702
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,920
If I'm right, we can have
way more than vengeance.

703
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
We can have it all.

704
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,960
We don't need to go to war.

705
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,520
All we need to do is start one.

706
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,240
There must have been some mistake.

707
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,640
We don't make mistakes.

708
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,120
I've always done whatever
the Court has asked of me.

709
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,400
Even against my own interest.

710
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,280
I got you Indian Hill
when Maroni refused to sell.

711
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,720
No one is questioning your loyalty.

712
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,080
If this isn't about me,

713
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,640
then why are you trying to kill
my son?

714
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,880
There are things you're not privy to.

715
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,200
That's not an answer.

716
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
It will have to do.

717
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,720
We both know the level
of destruction I can cause.

718
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,040
You think we're scared of you?

719
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,600
The car bomb was designed
to look like a mob hit.

720
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,160
You didn't want me
to find out it was you.

721
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,200
I have.

722
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
I don't care about your reasons.

723
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,720
If my son is harmed in any way,

724
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,080
I will come after you
with everything I have.

725
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,920
You won't win.

726
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,600
If my son is dead,

727
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,800
winning won't be the point.

728
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,360
Gotham will burn.

729
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,800
This city is on the brink of chaos.

730
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,400
Only we can save it.

731
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,440
We will expect your assistance
when called on.

732
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,360
Until then, your son is safe.

733
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,120
At least from us.

734
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,920
What aren't you telling me?

735
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
A great many things.

736
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,280
Enjoy your dinner.

737
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Hey.

738
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Is everything okay?

739
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,080
I was on my way
to the rehearsal dinner.

740
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,600
Then I heard myself telling
the cab driver your address.

741
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,480
Mario told me everything.

742
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
About today.

743
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,800
How you risked your own
life to make sure...

744
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
I didn't do it for him.

745
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
I know.

746
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,160
- He's a good man.
- Uh-huh.

747
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Tell me.

748
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
What?

749
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
What you have to tell me.

750
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,840
I missed my chance
to give you the life you deserve.

751
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
To make you happy.

752
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,720
But I do want that for you.

753
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,160
More than anything.

754
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,960
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

755
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,760
Maybe it's all we have left.

756
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,160
Or we just haven't done it
properly yet.

757
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Good-bye, James Gordon.

758
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,600
Yo, Peeping Tom

759
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
You lost?

760
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,560
Lucky for you, we sell directions.

761
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,160
The price, everything you've got.

762
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,000
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

763
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,520
<i>- She loves him...</i>
- You deaf?

764
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,480
<i>- She loves him, she loves him!</i>
- I said...

765
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Hey, man...

766
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,960
She loves me!

767
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,360
And I won't let her go.

768
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,480
She loves me!
