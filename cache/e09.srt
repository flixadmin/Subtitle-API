163
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,416
And listen.

164
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,875
You had some trouble...

165
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,941
in a hotel a few days ago, right?

166
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,645
Which hotel was that?

167
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,588
Hotel Ishaan.

168
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,173
I will beat the daylights out of you.

169
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,145
Policeman, what's the matter?

170
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,173
- What do you want to say?
- I don't want to say.

171
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:52,716
I want to rise.

172
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:55,652
The man
who would have local liquor

173
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:58,631
by borrowing small amounts
of money from his juniors...

174
00:08:58,721 --> 00:08:59,877
I am sorry,

175
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,936
that tall man.

176
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,586
Where did he get so much money?

177
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:06,143
[Slaps]

178
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,549
[Man 1] Stop sir. Stop sir.

179
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,449
[Man 2] Stop, sir.

180
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:14,553
[Man 1] Sir.

181
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,946
[SSP] <i>Mr. Saxena.</i>

182
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:19,146
What will happen if you start
accusing the police like this?

183
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,449
Sir, may I ask him something?

184
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,682
I will ask only one question.

185
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,546
Just tell me where were you
from 21st to 24th.

186
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:26,582
Why should I tell you?

187
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,961
Who are you to ask me that?

188
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,260
- Look at this. No.
- Mr. Saxena...

189
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,496
Sir,
just because he has a position

190
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:34,113
that doesn't mean that
no one will ask him questions.

191
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:35,492
Let me tell you now.

192
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:37,103
You were supposed
to go and meet Mr. Tyagi.

193
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,482
Two people knew about that.

194
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:40,592
Your department.
And our people.

195
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,139
We have checked on all our people.

196
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:43,489
We found nothing there.

197
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,396
You are sitting in front of Tyagi.

198
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,160
And at that time, that man calls.

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,677
That cannot be a co-incidence.

200
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:49,981
Ask Gupta, sir.

201
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,125
After you went
to Mr. Tyagi's office,

202
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,210
did he call you to talk or not?

203
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,375
Tell me that I am lying now.

204
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:56,982
I have seen the CCTV footage, sir.

205
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,925
- The man was tall.
- Again, tall.

206
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,464
Shall we arrest Mr. Bachchan?
He is tall too.

207
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:03,476
Whom are you comparing
yourself too?

208
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,876
Mr. Bachchan doesn't have
to kidnap someone to earn money.

209
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:08,493
He can do that by working
in a few movies.

210
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,390
Now you are crossing your line,
Mr. Saxena.

211
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,547
You have been appointed here
in some capacity.

212
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:13,683
Don't forget that.

213
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,212
- Okay?
- Sir.

214
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,269
Yes.

215
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,533
Sir, we have received
the forensic report.

216
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:20,580
Yes. And...

217
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,713
She was first strangled to death.

218
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,450
And then the corpse
was hanged, sir.

219
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,231
And after that the corpse
was thrown in the river.

220
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,786
Why would someone work so hard?

221
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,636
I am confused.

222
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,543
- Sir, there is another point.
- Hmm.

223
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,699
We have found some hair
on the victim's body

224
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:36,091
which doesn't belong to her.

225
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:40,296
It is possible some other woman
was involved.

226
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,421
Who can that woman be?

227
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,406
Why are you looking at me?

228
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,335
I am not married.

229
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,206
You are.

230
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:56,252
And your wife also has long hair.
I saw that.

231
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,299
I mean...

232
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:01,742
I am sorry, I interrogated you
without evidence.

233
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,392
I will get the proof next time.

234
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,468
And then I will interrogate him.

235
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,088
- Is everything okay, inside?
- No.

236
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,861
The girl hadn't committed suicide.
She was murdered.

237
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,590
Murdered. How?

238
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,876
Leave for Rishikesh at once.

239
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,469
Nobody else should find that phone.

240
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,711
At any condition.

241
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:32,012
Do you want me to go alone?

242
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:34,154
[Rudra] You will have to go alone.
I cannot leave this place.

243
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:38,751
Sir, that was awesome.

244
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,880
You treated that
watchman Saxena well.

245
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,905
When such people
cross their limits,

246
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:47,596
I feel like killing them.

247
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:50,391
And a woman
is involved in this case.

248
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,612
Now even women have started
this business.

249
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:56,605
You cannot even fathom where
women have their presence, Awasthi.

250
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:13,965
[Tyagi] Yes?

251
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:16,272
Any news?

252
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,455
No, sir. Not yet.

253
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:19,700
Then what are you doing here?
Leave.

254
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,605
Come, when you have any news.

255
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:23,234
Sir, was Anu friends with anyone?

256
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,396
Friend. Relative.

257
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,961
Anyone she used to talk to.
Meet them.

258
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,331
I knew whom she used to meet.
But...

259
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:34,413
I don't remember anyone special.
Why?

260
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,052
There must be someone close to her.

261
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:39,563
No. She didn't have
any friends in college.

262
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,686
The girl whose wedding
we attended,

263
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,194
she used to talk
to her over the phone.

264
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,248
In this city?

265
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,136
No, there is no one.

266
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,568
Sir, please think about it.

267
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:53,279
We have found out that a woman was
responsible for Anusha's murder.

268
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,490
Think about it properly, sir.

269
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,526
Your daughter was protected.

270
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,629
Only a spy could have broken it.

271
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,884
Some woman?

272
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,061
Who can be that woman?

273
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:13,913
[Madhu] Whom are you trying to save?

274
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,617
Why? And till when?

275
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,692
Don't talk without my permission.

276
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:22,767
[Madhu] Will we gain anything
by keeping silent?

277
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,668
Every channel is talking
about baby since yesterday.

278
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,925
Did she even call to ask?

279
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,476
Malini.

280
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,358
She is Anusha's maternal aunt.

281
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,941
But she was always concerned
with baby.

282
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,077
May I speak to her?

283
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,516
Yes, please do so now.

284
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,599
This contains her address
and phone number.

285
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:49,314
This is also her picture.

286
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,883
We have located Ms. Malini's house.

287
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,467
But sir, no one lives there.

288
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,098
Someone just visits there
every other month.

289
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:15,109
And yes, sir.
She is also not very neighborly.

290
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,005
Come, sir.
This is the lane, sir.

291

[Door opens]

292
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,074
Two people go there.

293
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,060
[Awasthi] You three, check that side.

[Door opens]

295
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:47,513
This was the man, sir.

296

I swear on my education. I swear 
on my mother. Sir, this was the man.

297
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,137
He is walking peacefully
with a girl.

298
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,777
And you are saying
the girl was kidnapped.

299
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,792
Sir, if someone has aimed
a gun at you

300
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,890
then even you
will walk straight like her, right?

301
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,515
Actually,
I saw the pistol in the beginning.

302
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,355
I am a family man.

303
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,515
Why will I mess up
with such a person?

304
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,578
So, I gave him a change
for 2,000 rupees.

305
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:13,864
I said, take your change
and take away your gun.

306
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,596
And he was troubling
the girl the entire way.

307
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:18,953
The girl doesn't look troubled.

308
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,033
Sir, you are trifling with me now.

309
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:24,086
I have left my work
and have come to help the police.

310
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,372
Don't you want
to give the ten crores?

311
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:28,469
We are not paying.

312
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,907
The girl's father is paying.

313
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,184
But we need to find him first.

314
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:32,800
Look. Did he look like him?

315
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:35,041
Yes, he did somewhat look like him?

316

What do you mean somewhat?

317

Is it him or not?

Sir, please let me see
the real him.

319

I will identify him at once.

If we have to get him,
then why do we need you?

Mr. Policeman,
why are you wasting your time

329
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,085
in that old deserted mansion?

330
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,482
Malini is in Rishikesh.
We have found her.

in the Ghantaghar police station.

You are very punctual.

- Where is Malini?
- She is not here.

349
