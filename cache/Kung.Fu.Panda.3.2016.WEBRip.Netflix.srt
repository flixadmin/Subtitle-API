-Our battle ended 500 years ago!
-Well, now, I'm ready for a rematch.

Five hundred years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,103
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

[gasps]
No.

33
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,651
Yes. And soon I will have your power, too.

With your chi, I will finally be able
to return to the mortal world.

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,227
And this time,
you won't be there to stop me.

[sighs]
It was never my destiny to stop you.

I have set another on that path.

Then I will find him
and take his chi, too.

You guys aren't doing
the dramatic pose, are you?

Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

You guys, never underestimate
the power of a dramatic entrance.

68
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,400
I've heard about some masters who can
win a fight just by throwing open a door.

Really? I was just making--
Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah, I am.

Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

Hence, the dramatic entrance.

What?!

83

She's always telling everyone what to do.

-Be quiet, Po.
-You see what I mean?

85
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,173
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior.
You are.

86

Come on, they're the Five.
What could I teach them?

87

[scoffs] There is always something
more to learn, even for a master.

For instance,
let me show you another move.

Yes. That you can't teach.

-I heard.
-Who told you? Did Tigress tell you?

and Mantis and your dad

it'll never happen again? 'Cause I'm done.

I could teach that class.

you will never be more than you are now.

Dragon Warrior?

Hmm.

140
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:31,029
It means, you know, just going around
and punching and kicking.

You think that is what
the great Master Oogway saw for you?

A 500-year prophecy fulfilled,

145

so you could spend your days
kicking butt

and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

-Yes?
-No!

Against my better judgment.

Power beyond anything you can imagine.

153
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,292
-Whoa! What was that?
-That was chi.

154
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,129
Whoa! What's chi?

155
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:34,050
The energy that flows
through all living things.

156
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,051
So, you're saying, if I--

157
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,679
So, you're saying, if I teach,
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?

158
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:42,225
No, I'm saying, if you teach,
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

-Oh.
-Mastering chi requires mastery of self.

Oogway sat alone in a cave for 30 years
asking one question.

161
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,281
"Who am I? Who am I?"

162
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,783
I'm lucky if I get five minutes
before you interrupt--

163
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,412
[groans] So, now, I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

164
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,706
Eventually. After you master teaching.

165
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,168
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

166
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:13,923
I'm not trying to turn you into me.
I'm trying to turn you into you.

167
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:22,140
Turn me into me? Wait a second,
that makes no-- Almost there, Shifu!

168
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,310
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway!

169
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,689
Hmm. Oh! Ah. Sorry, no offense,
Master Oogway. I just...

170
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,943
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

-What is this place?
-Uh, my brother's farm?

Ah. If I stepped on you, would you die?

Yes?

You hear that, Oogway? I'm back.

183
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,631
Kai has returned!

-Kai, General Kai.

there will be no one left
who will even remember your name.

Oh, hey, Dad. What's up?

209
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,257
I was just, uh...
stopping by for a little soak.

210
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,555
-Okay, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

211
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,267
Nothing? I come home to find you

And instead of adding bath salts
to the water,

214
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,147
you just added Szechuan peppercorns.

Okay, yes, something's wrong.

218
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,825
There, there, son.
You tell your daddy all about it.

219
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,077
Lift your arm.

220
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,455
Shifu says I don't know what it means
to be the Dragon Warrior.

221
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,624
Now, I have to be a teacher?

222
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,334
I thought I finally knew who I was.

223
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,586
If I'm not the Dragon Warrior,
then who am I?

224
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,255
A teacher? Teaching kung fu?
[gasps]

225
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,550
Po, that's a promotion. Take the job, son!

226
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,428
And someday, when you're in charge
of the whole Jade Palace,

227
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,807
I can sell noodles in the lobby!

And the Dragon Warrior

235
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,864
I have to defend my title!

No one's gonna beat
your dumpling-eating record.

Uh, this is very embarrassing,

but I think you've got me confused
with a panda named Lotus?

My name is Po.

Oh, right, you wouldn't know--

269

Okay, see, Little Lotus was the name
you were given at birth.

-Really?
-Really! [laughs]

271

I can't believe it. After all these years.
And you're really here? This is amazing!

Oh, Dad! Come say hi to, um--

what I'm supposed to call you.

we're taking a picture together!

-[Po] Huh?

But I still don't understand.
I thought Po was the only panda left.

-Where?

Whoa!

-But how did you know where I was?
-I received a message that led me here.

293
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:16,178
How could you receive a message
if no one could find you?

294
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,598
-Sounds suspicious to me.
-[all] Hmm...

295

-No, it was a message from the universe.
-[all] Whoa!

-Whoa!
-Rats.

00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,939
[chuckles] Now, what's all this
about a Dragon Warrior?

298
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,858
How did you know
I was the Dragon Warrior?

299
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,526
[gasps]
Did the universe tell you that, too?

300
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,987
-[all gasp]
-No, the poster did.

301
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,990
And the gift shop. I bought a tiny cup.

302
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,743
Oh, right! Of course!
[chuckles]

303
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,871
[stammering] You have no idea.
There's so much to show you!

304
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,082
You're gonna be so awesomely proud!
Come on! Come on!

305
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,378
I'm already awesomely proud.

306

[Po]
Feeling the burn.

309
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:01,182
Do you have panda asthma, too?
Does that run in the family?

310
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,603
Dad, you're gonna love this.
It's like the coolest thing ever.

-This is the Hall of Heroes.

-Whoa! This place is--
-Awesome?

314
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,699
Were you gonna say--? You were gonna say
"awesome," right? 'Cause it totally is!

315
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,284
-Totally!
-But be super careful.

316
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,702
Everything is very fragile here.

317
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,539
Like the Urn of Whispering Warriors.
Someone broke that once.

318
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,124
-Who?
-Some idiot.

319
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,042
Wow!

320
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,920
This is Master Flying Rhino's
battle armor.

321
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,464
I wonder if I could fit in that.

322
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,841
Get out of my head, Dad.
I've wondered the same thing!

323
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,552
-If I could fit in it?
-If you could--? No, if I could fit.

324
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,262
-Oh.
-Dad, check it out!

325
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,724
Master Ram's crossbow,
the infamous Gate Smasher!

326
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,561
Dad, look at this! The battle helmets
of Master Rat's army! They're so tiny.

327
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,940
Master Dolphin's water proof armor!
This is my favorite.

328
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,193
Check it out. It's the legendary
battle rickshaw of Emperor Hawk!

329
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,531
-Sweet ride.
-[gasps]

330
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,991
Dad, what are you doing?
We're not supposed to touch anything!

331
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:05,871
-Oh, sorry, sorry! Should I put it back?
-Yeah, you probably should.

332
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,250
You look so cool though.
[laughs] How does it feel?

333
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,711
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

334
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,671
Does it feel like you're impenetrable?

335
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,509
Does it feel like you could take on
a thousand warriors and emerge unscathed?

336
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:22,179
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

337
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,516
Ooh! I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

338
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,685
[clinking]

339
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,944
I think I just peed a little.

340
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,533
Anything else we should try in here, son?

341
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,162
Hmm?
[chuckles]

342
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,375
Charge!
[laughs]

343
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,627
Faster, faster, faster!

344
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,087
Thumb war!

345
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,714
-Reinforcements!
-Ooh! Ooh!

346
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,174
No fair, no fair!
[laughs]

Whoo!

-[Li] Here we go! Go, go, go.
-Awesome.

[retching]

353
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,645
-There, there.
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

-[vomits]
-There you go.

355

Dolphin-style attack!

356
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,067
-Twing!
-You got me.

357
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,779
Dolphin-style retreat!
[imitates dolphin sounds]

358
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,530
Go long, son!

359
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,616
Whoa!

360
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,868
I wasn't ready!
[laughs]

361
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,495
-Coming back at ya!
-I got it!

362
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,122
-Going high!
-Yeah, come on, throw it!

363
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,792
-[laughs]
-I'm coming for you!

364
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,920
-Bring it on, Master Rhino!
-Here I come!

00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:40,633
Oh.

367
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,597
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Li] I'm gonna get you.

I'm gonna get you...

-Psst. Psst. Psst.
-I'm gonna get you.

Who's got you? Who's got you?

371
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,149
Who's gonna get you?
Yeah, who's gonna get you? [chuckles]

-[whistles]
-[laughs]

373

[blows raspberry]
Master Rhino!

374
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,906
What? What's wrong?

375

378
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,663
Hello.

379
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,542
Guys, guys! You're never gonna guess
who just showed up.

380
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,962
Not in a million years.
[stammering] You guys, you just try--

381
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,046
[all]
Your father!

382
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,006
Whoa! How did you just guess that?

383
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,509
Oh, wait a second.
Yeah, of course. We look exactly the same.

384
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:28,264
Dad, say hi to my friends.
Mantis, Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

385
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,391
-Oh, Viper, was it?
-Monkey, sir.

386
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,934
They're kind of my best friends.

387
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,563
And this... this is Master Shifu. Legend.

388
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,899
Uh, it is an honor to meet you,
Master Panda.

389
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,069
Perhaps your father would care to join us
in the training hall?

390
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,030
-Your son will be teaching the class.
-[all groan]

391
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
-Oh, ho, ho!
-I'm sure he's tired.

392
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,992
I'm sure you're tired.

393
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,536
He's tired. I'm gonna show him
to the Chrysanthemum Suite.

394
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,747
What? Tired? No, I'm fine.
I would love to watch you teach.

395
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,041
-Trust me, it'll be more fun to watch me--
-[gong ringing]

396
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:56,959
Fight!

397
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,628
-What is that?
-The Valley's under attack!

398
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,757
-Son? Under attack?
-This is perfect!

399
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,760
Now, you can see what being
the Dragon Warrior is all about!

400
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,012
Follow me!

401

[all grunting, yelling]

406
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,784
What's the deal with the green guys?

407
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,955
-[grunts] Some kind of jade zombies.
-Jade zombies?

408

Jombies! Jinx!

-[gong chimes]
-Ow! Yeah! That's the one.

414
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,267
And that guy is-- [gasps]
No! Master Porcupine!

415
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,524
-I thought he died a hundred years ago.
-These guys are legend!

416
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,944
Get a quick sketch of us!

417
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,162
Did you get it? Did you get it?
Oh, I blinked!

418
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,872
Can we get another one?

I'm being choked by Master Porcupine!
This is so cool.

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,549
-Oh, oh, look! It's you.
-Po, focus!

422
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:32,054
"Message from the universe."
I'll give you a message from the universe!

423
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,807
Stay away from my son! Ah!

424
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,601
-Sorry, Dad, I'll clean up later!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my good pan!

I see you.

Your chi will soon be mine.

435
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,054
-Is he talking to me?
-Which one? They're all talking.

436
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,390
Whoa! You're right. That's so scary.

437
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,642
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd would be scary back at them.

438
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,394
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first.

439
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,563
Otherwise, it won't be scary,
it'll just be stupid.

440
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,984
It's not them talking, you idiots!
It's me talking through them! Kai!

441
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,695
-Who?
-Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

442
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,453
-Did you see that?
-Whoa, what just happened?

443
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:41,539
This green smoke-- just poof.
And then, poof. Shifu, what was that?

444
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,044
Kai... Kai... Kai!

445
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,503
Nope, never heard of him.

[Shifu]
Kai... Kai... Where is it?

447
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,218
There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything! Yes!

Behold.

All the answers will be found within.

What? It's blank?

451
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,858
Are you kidding me? Not again!

452
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,612
-[all groan]
-Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry.

Oh, okay. Here we go.

454
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:19,703
It is written in Oogway's hand.
"Long ago, I had a brother."

455
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,581
-Oogway had a brother?
-"In arms. In arms." Sorry.

456
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,086
-He says, "Brother in arms."
-Maybe you should unroll it all at once?

-"I was an ambitious young warrior..."
-[Oogway] ...leading a great army.

And fighting by my side was Kai,
my closest friend.

459
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:48,398
One day, we were ambushed.
I was badly wounded.

460
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,986
My friend carried me for days,
looking for help,

461
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,950
until we came to a secret village,
high in the mountains.

462
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,161
An ancient place of healing.

463

A village of pandas.

Yes, pandas!

466
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:12,464
Pandas who used
the power of chi to heal me.

467
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,762
They taught me how to give chi.

468
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:28,021
Oh, but Kai wanted the power
all to himself.

469
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:33,485
He saw that what could be given
could also be taken.

470
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,158
I had to stop him.

471
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,826
[growls]

472
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,328
[Kai yells]

473
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,582
Our battle shook the earth,

474
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:52,171
until, finally, I banished Kai
to the Spirit Realm.

475
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,048
Should he ever return to the mortal realm,

476
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:59,303
-he can only be stopped...
-[Shifu] "...by a true master of chi."

477
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,513
True master of chi?

478
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,099
-Like you!
-Me? I can barely make a flower bloom.

479
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,102
I'd need at least 30 more years
and a cave!

480
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,395
[Viper]
We need a chi master!

481
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,523
[Shifu] He will continue stealing the chi
of masters until he has consumed it all!

482
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,525
[Viper] We have to think of a way
to stop him.

483
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,403
[Crane] He'll get more and more powerful
with every master he defeats!

484
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,946
[Tigress]
There is no choice. We fight.

485
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,824
-I can teach you, son.
-[gasps]

486
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:25,996
-You can do this?
-Of course. I'm a panda.

487
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:30,000
That must be why
the universe sent you here!

488
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,919
Okay, so what do I have to do?

489
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,088
-You have to come home with me.
-What?

490
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,633
-To the secret village?
-Yes, son.

491
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,386
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

492
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:47,267
You have to learn to live like a panda,
sleep like a panda, eat like a panda.

493
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,481
Those 103 dumplings? [scoffs]
I was just warming up.

494
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,485
I've always felt like I wasn't eating up
to my full potential.

495
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,614
No, you can't take Po away from me!
No, no, I want a second opinion.

496
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,952
-Shifu, open another scroll or something!
-I think he should go.

497
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,745
Fine, a third opinion.

498
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,206
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

499
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,625
Dad, you heard what Shifu said
Oogway said.

500
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,753
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi,

501
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,423
and I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

502
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,634
Well, I'm a panda.

503
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,099
I'll pack your lunch for the road.

504
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,400
Do you really think
Po can master chi in time?

505
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,153
It doesn't matter what I think.
It only matters what the universe thinks.

506
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,322
So, that's a "no"?

507
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,993
-Master, what are we going to do?
-You are going to find out where Kai is.

508
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,454
Follow the trail of those jade creatures,
but do not engage,

509
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,125
for, with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

510
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:57,754
-Why me? Is it because I asked?
-No, it is because you can fly. Go!

511
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,175
-Should've kept your beak shut. [laughs]
-[Shifu] And take Mantis.

512
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,261
-What? Oh, man! Is it because I--?
-Yes.

513
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,762
[sighs]

514
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,911
[panting]

515
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,455
[stomach rumbles]

516
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,832
-Oh, lunch break?
-Oh!

517
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,001
-You don't need to ask me twice.
-[Mr. Ping groans]

518
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,003
-Dad?
-Yes?

519
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,213
-Dad?
-Yes?

520
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:44,259
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing? Getting a backache!

521
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:48,096
-Did you have to step on every rock?
-No, I mean, why are you here?

522
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,890
What was I supposed to do, huh?

523
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,059
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

524
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:55,687
You're never gonna be able
to save the world on an empty stomach.

525
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,440
I consider my presence mission critical.

526
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,901
Oh, yes, about that, we can't share

527
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,862
the location of the village
with others, so...

528
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,324
Well, you think
I can't keep a secret, huh?

529
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,578
I raised Po for 20 years
before I finally told him he was adopted.

530
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,538
Seriously? Yeah?

531
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,666
Okay. I guess it would be cruel
to make you fly back.

532
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,253
[gasps]
You can fly?

533
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,630
I'm a bird, Po.

534
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,849
[both grunting]

535
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,603
-[chuckles, blows raspberry]
-[both grunting]

536
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,981
We're here.

537
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,114
Sure looks like a long ways up there.
[chuckles]

538
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,617
And my son hates stairs.
So, let's go home.

539
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,286
We're pandas. We don't do stairs.

540
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,288
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

541
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,040
[bell rings]

542
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,252
Rats.

543
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,721
Whoa-- Huh?

544
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,319
[Mr. Ping] This is the secret
panda village? [chuckles]

545
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,697
No wonder you keep it a secret.

546
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,575
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

547
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,912
[Li chuckles]

548
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:40,375
-Now, you can "Whoa."
-Whoa!

549
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,128
-[cub 1] Let's go!
-[cub 2] Over here! Come on!

550
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,045
[cub 3]
Yeah!

551
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,631
[pandas chattering, indistinct]

552
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,603
[cubs laughing]

553
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,523
[all gasp]

554
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,774
[chuckles]

555
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,528
[chuckles]
Oh.

556
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,868
[chuckling]

557
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,454
Li? Everyone, Li's back!

558
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,664
-They're both back!
-He found his son!

559
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,208
-He made it!
-They're back!

560
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,501
-Li?
-He found his son!

561
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,377
Everyone, Li's back!

562
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,922
Hang on, we're coming!
[grunts]

563
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,090
-He made it!
-[cub] Whoo-hoo! They made it.

564
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,217
Why are we running?

565
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:38,183
-Li Shan is back!
-[pandas chattering, indistinct]

566
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,145
[all panting]

567
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,065
[panda]
Whew!

568
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,987
Everyone! Everyone, gather around!
This is my son.

569
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,113
-Hello. Hi.
-He's here.

570
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,032
[chuckles]
Triplets!

571
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,784
-Hi, I'm Ku Ku!
-I'm Meng Meng!

572
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,285
-I'm Shui Shui.
-Your fur is soft.

573
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,245
He smells like cookies.

574
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:03,124
-He's so handsome, just like his father.
-Thank you!

575
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,586
Son, these are your cousins.
Dim and Sum.

576
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,004
[laughs]
I have cousins!

577
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,089
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

578
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,384
-Whoa. Buns on a string.
-We call it a snacklace.

579
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,927
That's right!

580
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,098
-Uh... we'll make you another one.
-Oh! It's you!

581
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,850
-Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Hi.
-[bones cracking]

582
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,686
I don't know who you are.

583
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,397
Oh, Stripy Baby! So beautiful!

584
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,732
-[Lei Lei giggling]
-Oh, okay, careful with that.

585
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,650
That's my action fig--

586
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,694
-Can I keep her? Can I?
-No...

587
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,279
[sobs]

588
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,073
...problem. Of course.
Yeah, that's why I brought her.

589
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,493
-Take good care of her.
-Yes! Stripy Baby! [giggles]

590
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,415
You look just like me but a baby.

591

[giggles]

592

You're like me but old.

-You're like me but fatter!
-Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,259
-You're like me but...
-[laughs]

595
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,803
[whimpers]
With a hat!

596
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,681
-[laughter]
-He does wear a hat!

597
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,017
-You all look like me.
-[laughter]

598
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,270
Let's feast in my son's honor!

[all cheer]

600
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,192
-[Po] What the--?
-Pandas don't walk, we roll!

601
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,284
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous? [laughs]

602
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,329
[stammers]
Po, what are you doing? Po!

603
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,874
[grunts]

604
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:30,587
Ow!

605
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,052
Ow!

606
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,220
[grunts]
You're right. That is better than walking.

607
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,347
[laughter]

608
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,974
[all]
Mmm!

609
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,352
-[panda 1] Yeah, that's good stuff.
-[panda 2] Have some dumplings.

610
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,854
What kind of panda
doesn't know how to roll?

611
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,523
Well, I'm kind of new
at this whole "being a panda" thing.

612
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,108
Hey, what kind of panda are you?

613
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,861
-You have a funny neck.
-I'm not a panda at all.

614
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,404
-What's that? What's that?
-My hat. My beak.

615
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,449
-What's that? What's that?
-My wing. My dumplings!

616
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,242
No more questions! Go away, kid!

617
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,119
Here, son, I packed your chopsticks!

618
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,204
-Thanks, Dad!

-[all] Whoa!
-[female panda] Oh, my!

620
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,414
What?

621
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,292
-What are those for?
-These? These are chopsticks.

622
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:13,213
-They're for picking up dumplings.
-You mean, you only eat one at a time?

623
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,467
-Mmm. Yum.
-Yeah, yummy.

624

[gasps]

625
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,013

"Wow, she's amazing. She's so beautiful."

631
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,411
[in normal voice]
That's sweet, Po.

632
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,707
But please try to save all other
compliments until after the performance.

633
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,963
-Me? No, I didn't say--
-Shh, shh, shh! Shut it!

634
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,550
-After the performance.
-Huh! Has it started yet?

635
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:05,140
Best ribbon dancer in the world!
[chuckles]

636
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,599
At least, that's what she said.

637
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,687
Look away! Look away!
No, you can't, can you?

638
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,315
Dad, why does she keep
staring at me like... that!

639
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,401
-Try to keep up.
-[gasps]

640
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,028
Uh, I don't really know how to dance.

641
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,323
Of course you do! All pandas dance!

642
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,493
-I know what you're thinking.
-You do?

643
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,330
-"How can one panda be so beautiful?"
-[chuckles]

644
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,793

Ooh, ooh, ooh! Oh...

-Help me, Dads!
-Yeah, no, you're on your own.

647
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,300
You're doing great, son!

648
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,720

Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.
[laughs]

655
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,241
I have so much to learn.

-Why do you do that?
-Do what?

659
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,547
Just 'cause you say "Wings of"
before something,

660
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,466
it doesn't mean
that you're doing a special move.

661
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:27,138
It's like me saying "Antenna of Power"
or "Thorax of Making Sandwiches."

662
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,849
-Wings of Disagreement.
-Whoa! There!

666
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,280
They must be in there.

667
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,617
-Master Shifu strongly advised us...

-...not to engage.

00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,832
-We've got to get in there.
-But Master Shifu said--

670
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,876
You're seriously afraid?
Even Master Chicken is going in there!

671
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,002
And he's a chicken!

-They need our help. Come on!

-I'll go high, you go low.
-No, wait!

677
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:18,731
Fear the bug!
All right, you little... Uh-oh.

678
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,569
-Hold on, buddy, I'm coming!
-Antenna of Power! Ah, it didn't work!

679
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,695

680
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,827

Don't worry, little birdie.
I'll put your chi to good use...

All right, flower...
I'm gonna make you bloom.

I'm ready for my first day
of panda training!

-What?
-You know, learn to be a panda.

Master chi, save the world!

[yawns] Lesson number one
is go back to bed!

You gotta let the hill

Rookie mistake.

00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,880
Is this... my mom?

776
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,930
I had this done on your 100th day.

777
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,560
Hmm. Your momma couldn't hold you still.

778
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,564
-You nearly ate the paper.
-[both chuckle]

779
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,066
-It's true.
-What was she like?

780
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,363
[sighs]
She was the total package.

781
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,826
Smart, beautiful.

00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,996
-Tremendous appetite.
-[chuckles]

783
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,873
She was the love of my life.

784
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:14,295
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier,

785
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,840
along you came, my Little Lotus.

[chuckles]

787
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,053
I really had it all.

788
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,724
Until that... one moment...

789
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:35,358
when I lost everything.

Dad...

795
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:19,360
You don't have to worry
about losing me ever again. Okay?

796
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,664
Let me get some of that!

It's from the Eastern Province!

Master Lizard, Master Ox,
Master Eagle. All of them.

800
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:55,021
In every village from the sea to here,
every master in China has vanished.

801
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,523
-Maybe they are all at the party?
-Monkey!

802

-I didn't get invited either.
-Kai has taken their chi.

We are all that stand between him
and the knowledge Oogway left in our care.

-The villagers, evacuated?
-Done, Master.

Nice. Very tacky.

811
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,406
How dare you set foot on these grounds!

812
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,034
Look at you pathetic fools.

813
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:54,288
Groveling at the feet
of Oogway the Magnificent.

You are not fit to speak his name.

I am not fit, little kitten?

[Tigress growls]

817
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,172
I fought by his side.

818
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,509
I loved him like a brother.

819
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,886
And he betrayed me.

820
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,681
Well...

821
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:17,894
Now, I will destroy
everything he has created!

822
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,647

[grunts] I will not let you destroy
Oogway's memory!

Why not? He destroyed mine.

Hmm. What do you say, Oogway?
Do you forgive him?

You may have destroyed the Jade Palace,
but you will never succeed.

There will always be someone to stop you.

Who, the panda?
His chi is strong, but it won't be enough.

He will meet the same fate as you.

including Shifu and the others.

-Not quite.

What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

I've mastered napping, sleeping in,
hammocks, hot tubs.

is coming for you.

But, because of you,
I left the Valley unprotected.

I left my friends unprotected.
And, now, they're all... they're all...

And you would have been, too!

Oh?

-No.

00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,439
I'm not in his life, not anymore.

935
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:44,693
[scoffs] Your son got mad at you.
Welcome to parenthood.

936
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:49,656
It-- You don't understand.
I lied to him. He'll never forgive me.

937
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:55,245
I lied to him for 20 years.
He still thinks he came from an egg.

938
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:59,708
Sometimes, we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

939
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:13,138
Look... he's hurt. He's confused.

940
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,557
And he still has to save the world.

941
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,061
He needs both his dads.

942
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:30,822

945
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,290
-This isn't going to work.
-It has to.

946
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,000
-You're not thinking straight.
-I am!

947
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,460
-You're not.
-I am!

948
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,212
-No. No.
-Yes, I am!

949
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,506
-[grunts]
-I've seen Kai.

950
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,593
-I've seen what he can do.
-But he hasn't seen what I can do.

951
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,390
The Wuxi Finger Hold?

952
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,392
It's my best move.

953
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,103
I just have to get to Kai,
grab his finger, and then skadoosh!

954
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,938
Back to the Spirit Realm.
[groans]

955
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,690
-He has an army of jade warriors.
-Ooh!

956
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:08,443
Everything they see, he sees,
so there's no sneaking up on him.

957
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,029
-You will never get close enough.
-It's gonna work!

958
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:16,034
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

959
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,619
Oh, you sound just like Shifu,

960
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,372
with the, "Chi chi chi!
"Chi this! Chi that! Chi chi chi chi chi!"

961
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,126
I'm not a master of chi, okay?
I don't know if I'm the Dragon Warrior.

962
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:28,755
I don't even know if I'm a panda.
I don't know who I am! [sighs]

963
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,260
You're right. There's no way
I can stop him and his army.

964
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,596
[sighs]

965
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,308
[Li]
Unless you had an army of your own.

966
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,982
-You?
-Not just me.

967
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,443
-Us.
-All of us.

968
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,665
I finally found my son
after all these years.

969
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:07,335
It's gonna take a lot more than the end
of the world to keep us apart.

970
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:11,882
-But you don't even know kung fu.
-Then you will teach us.

971
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:16,678
What? I can't teach you kung fu.
I couldn't even teach Tigress.

972
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,347
And she already knows kung fu!

973
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:26,271
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you want to trust right now.

974
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,733
But you gotta believe me,
we can do this.

975
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:34,613
We can learn kung fu.
We can be just like you!

976
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,366
-What did you just say?
-Uh... "We can do this"?

977
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,327
-No!
-"We can learn kung fu"?

978
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,788
-After that!
-Uh... "We can be just like you"?

979
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,289
-Yes!
-We can?

980
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,417
No! You can't!
[laughs]

981
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,752
But you don't have to be.

982
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,421
That's what Shifu meant.

983
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:54,549
I don't have to turn you into me.
I have to turn you into you!

984
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,427
That doesn't make any sense.

985
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:00,931
I know! Thanks, Dads.

986
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,390
[both]
You're welcome?

987
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,685
I'm gonna do something
I never thought I'd be able to do.

988
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,813
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

989
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,777
You guys, your real strength comes
from being the best you, you can be.

990
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,986
So, who are you?

991
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,404
What are you good at?

992
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,864
What do you love?

993
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,742
-What makes you, you?
-[yells]

-Yes. Good, good. Again!

Good. Again!

-Huh?
-Stripy Baby! Stripy Baby!

Faster, faster! Twirl those ribbons!

999
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,846
Hug that log, you!

1000
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:44,683
Hug that log like it's the last time
you're ever gonna hug it good-bye forever.

1001
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,602
Higher! And a little more to the left
this time. You can do it!

1002
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,397
-Whoo-hoo!
-[both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1003
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,024
I don't want to see any of these
hit the ground!

Okay, pay attention, 'cause I'm only
gonna go over this ten more times.

1021
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,556
The only entrance to the village is here.

The dumpling squadron
will take position here,

while the cookie squadron
will take position here.

01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,037
the important thing to remember
is that this is the spot where-- [gasps]

it's distract the jombies

to put a Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai.

taught you this, son.

No, Oogway, don't go!

1250
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,354
I'm not going anywhere. I live here.

Oh, right.

1252
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:41,902
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:46,991
-Wait. I can go back?

We thought we lost you.

Wait, where did you get that?

Oh, this? Oogway gave it to me
in the Spirit Realm.

[sighs]
Of course he did.

Of course you did.
