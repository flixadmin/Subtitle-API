1
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,041
One, two, three, four.

2
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,875
I need help!

3
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,208
Paddles! First aid kit!
We have to stop the bleeding!

4
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,458
He’s got no pulse.

5
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,083
-Hurry! Come on!
-On your knees, bastards!

6
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,250
Hang in there, please.

7
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,333
-Hurry!
-Coming!

8
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,583
Pass me the scissors.

9
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,541
Come on.

10
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,625
Jesus.

11
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,458
-Jesus.
-Here.

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Grab the paddles. Come on, Arturo.

13
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,708
Three, four.

14
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,875
-Clear!
-Stand back!

15
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,083
Stop, you’re searing a corpse.

16
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,833
-Stockholm.
-Get the epinephrine. Now.

17
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,750
I've got it.

18
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,666
You killed him. Accept it.

19
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,833
What are we doing?
The army's going to destroy us.

20
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,083
Stand back!

21
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,291
He has a pulse.

22
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,500
Yes, he does.

23
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,000
He has…

24
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,000
a pulse.

25
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,333
He's got a bullet in his heart.
He won't survive.

26
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,666
We need to take him to the hospital.
We need to get him out now!

27
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,083
He was dead a minute ago,

28
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,583
and he’ll be dead again
when you stop blowing air into his lungs.

29
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,375
If we get him out, we’ll become murderers.

30
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,791
-No.
-Yes.

31
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:48,791
They're going to storm in.
They’ll kill the hostages… and us.

32
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,541
We can't let him die.

33
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:55,291
Listen. That fucking crazy
son of a bitch was asking for it.

34
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,375
You shot him twice.
You did well. Now you feel guilty.

35
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,250
You want to get rid of your guilt
by tossing a bucket of shit on us all.

36
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,000
You can have a clean conscience.
Mine is already dirty. I’ll kill him.

37
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,791
-No!
-I'm going to shoot him!

38
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,583
-No!
-For fuck's sake, stop!

39
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,333
Relax!

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,916
Listen.

41
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,458
We’re taking him out,
and I’ll tell you why.

42
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,833
We need a doctor!

43
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,166
We need a doctor!

44
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,916
As Stockholm watched Arturo
hang between life and death,

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,708
she felt completely empty.

46
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:15,000
She knew she had taken the last safety net
that could protect her son from the world.

47
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,666
Arturo was her child's biological father.

48
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,291
And Stockholm was beginning to realize

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,041
that neither she nor Denver
would ever see Cincinnati again.

50
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,416
She wasn't the only one thinking

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,083
that parenthood is the largest source
of anxiety in the world.

52
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,333
We were expecting the heist men
to make a move.

53
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,458
You're watching live…

54
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,250
Our lives depended on three guys 
whose hands were tied,

55
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,000
and who had a gun in their faces.

56
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,583
Under any other circumstances,
they'd have given up,

57
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,416
but Benjamín had
a daughter inside the bank.

58
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,500
And the Professor had ten.

59
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,833
He's in a critical condition.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,916
I'll be there as soon as possible.

61
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:20,250
Frisk these men in my office.
I need to start the interrogation.

62
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,833
Run the electromagnetic detector
over them.

63
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,916
They could have mics in their teeth.

64
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,625
-No radio waves.
-Bring them some clothes.

65
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,833
Colonel, they're clean.

66
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,875
There are ten heist men.

67
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,166
There's always one with the hostages,
here, in the library.

68
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,041
What happened to Arturo Román?

69
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,625
We tried to bring some hostages to safety…
but he lost it.

70
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,708
He was obsessed with the weapons…
He attacked them with a flamethrower.

71
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,916
Mounted a machine gun on a forklift.

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,875
He put us in danger.
They had to take him down.

73
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,083
He had no pulse for minutes,
but they revived him.

74
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,541
They didn't revive anyone,
and they killed him in cold blood.

75
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,791
It would be best if he died
in the next ten minutes.

76
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,541
This is a gift, and I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!

77
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,625
We'll shoot them in the back
even if they surrender!

78
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,333
And that's why

79
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,541
I need everyone
to think they're fucking murderers.

80
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,250
Understood?

81
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,125
Is anyone else injured?

82
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,291
Two hostages.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
Román injured them.

84
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,375
Absolutely not. It was them.

85
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,041
I've been summoned
to the Ministry of the Interior.

86
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,125
Do not intervene until I get back.

87
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,000
Martínez, the documentation!

88
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,083
Martínez!

89
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,458
He would've killed you.

90
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,791
What am I doing here?

91
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,750
What am I doing here, throwing lead,
while my child's with some monks?

92
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,291
When he grows up…

93
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,666
and finds out about everything,
and asks about his mom…

94
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,375
I don't want anyone to tell him who I was.

95
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,541
I've ruined my son's life.

96
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,875
My father also thinks he ruined my life,

97
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,375
but I love him madly.

98
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,333
A miner with a trans daughter in the '90s…

99
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,833
He made a lot of mistakes.

100
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,583
When I was five,

101
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,750
I went straight to my dad,
and told him, "Daddy, I'm a girl."

102
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,833
And he looked at me
with his serious miner face,

103
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:55,166
and said, "Juan, you're a man.
Men are not girls."

104
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,541
There was this makeup case that I loved…

105
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,958
I don't know how many times
I asked him to buy it for me.

106
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,000
And in the end,
I got a case, but it was full of tools.

107
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,375
You end up understanding
that anything your dad deems girly

108
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,208
is bad, so you hide it.

109
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,125
But you couldn't tell anyone?

110
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,166
There weren't any transgender people
in my town.

111
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,250
There were a lot of pickpockets, burglars…

112
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,041
there were tons of junkies,
but there weren't any trans people.

113
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,750
In those days,
when a man dressed like a woman on TV,

114
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,375
it was to fool around,
for people to laugh.

115
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,250
My father was the first to crack up.

116
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,583
But I forgave him,
because I didn't have any role models,

117
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,000
but neither did he.

118
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,083
I think confusion is
a parent's natural state.

119
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,708
At the end of the day,

120
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,791
your parents don't have to be perfect,
they just have to love you.

121
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,250
Do you like your present?

122
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,166
Are these gentlemen my present?

123
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
They're the best teachers.

124
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,166
Authentic graduate professors.

125
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,625
A tip-top squadron for your first flight.

126
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,208
And we've chosen, especially for you,

127
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,083
a zero-risk robbery.

128
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,041
Basically, it's just for fun.

129
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,083
So tell me, Dad,
what's a zero-risk robbery?

130
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,833
One that goes unnoticed when you rob them.

131
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,416
But they'll find out at some point.

132
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,541
Well, not now.

133
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,708
Not in one, two, or three months…
Not even in ten.

134
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,625
They'll find out in 15,
when the Viking gold museum opens.

135
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,375
But by then, who will connect the dots?

136
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,375
Viking gold?

137
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,833
These are exact brass replicas
of all the pieces

138
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,833
of the biggest Viking treasure
discovered to date.

139
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,541
It was found at an archaeological site
eight months ago,

140
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,916
and is now being held in
a Danish national heritage security room.

141
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,833
The real treasure is in there, well kept,
in limbo, awaiting its destiny.

142
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,708
Do you know where that security room is?

143
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,375
At Frederiksborg Castle.

144
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,750
Exactly the same venue
where I'm playing a concert in three days.

145
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,958
It'll be the perfect soiree.

146
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,958
Fancy cars, tuxedos, cocktails…

147
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,750
classical music…

148
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,875
and 12 kilos of gold.

149
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,541
What are you laughing at?

150
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,166
First, these are Viking grave goods,
not treasure.

151
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,500
That's the term used by archaeologists.

152
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,125
And second, I think you're a cynic.

153
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:41,333
Dad, you pretend to be in love with art.
You restore monasteries.

154
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,250
I'm sorry, but these items
should be in a museum.

155
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,708
Wait a minute. Do you call this art?

156
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,958
Of course I do.

157
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,625
These objects
are more than 1,000 years old.

158
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,333
They're hand carved,
and have Nordic symbols on them.

159
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,166
-This is pure art!
-It's the work of a blacksmith.

160
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,083
Of uncouth barbarians!

161
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,333
These people pillaged iconic,

162
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,250
extraordinary pieces,
Latin, Greek, Phoenician,

163
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,000
and melted them down
to make wine goblets, plates, charms!

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,458
We're giving the gold its dignity back.

165
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,375
Oh, please.

166
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,916
We're the ones who are going to make art.

167
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,250
It'll be an unforgettable heist.

168
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,916
Imminent press conference
at the Ministry of the Interior.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,208
Tamayo, the colonel in charge
of the operation, is going to speak soon.

170
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,375
What's Arturo Román's condition?

171
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,541
You almost kill
the only hostage people know.

172
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,083
And you release the governor
of the Bank of Spain.

173
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,666
Hello? Anyone running the show in there?

174
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,750
This is the situation.
The army is going in.

175
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,291
They're waiting for Tamayo to destroy you.
And he will, for two reasons.

176
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,750
First, he's a coward and a bastard.

177
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,500
Second, you've made it easy for him.

178
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,125
Unanswered questions.
Are hostages being killed?

179
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,083
Is the army preparing an intervention?

180
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,708
You're shooting hostages.
Your fans are going to worship him.

181
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,250
Your girlfriend,

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,833
the trashy Power Ranger,

183
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,250
the teddy bear from the Balkans,
the kid from the grave…

184
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,791
The people you're willing to die for.

185
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,791
Your people…

186
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,083
are dead.

187
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,791
Only I can prevent it.

188
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,250
Give me the information.
I'll make a call, and nobody dies.

189
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,333
Move over, please. Thank you.

190
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,750
Good morning.

191
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,666
We're holding
this additional press conference

192
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,833
to inform you of the latest

193
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,625
regarding the disappearance
of Alicia Sierra.

194
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,875
Former Inspector Alicia Sierra

195
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,583
has betrayed
the police force she represents,

196
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,708
and is now working
for the Professor's gang.

197
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:11,000
Since she escaped,
her whereabouts are unknown.

198
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,666
We're using
all the means at our disposal

199
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,500
to bring her to justice.

200
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,666
This is her current appearance.

201
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,875
This is a CCTV image
from a store close to her home.

202
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,000
Son of a bitch.

203
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:27,375
We lost the trail on her cell phone
two blocks from the National Court.

204
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,791
We've located a safe house in the area

205
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,958
where she may have coordinated
Murillo's extraction.

206
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,000
All of this is under investigation.

207
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,708
The forensic analysis
on the equipment found at her house

208
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,333
suggests that she leaked the emails
about the torture procedures in Algeria.

209
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:48,875
She falsified testimonies,
and broadcast Anibal Cortés' fake burial.

210
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,083
We've found traces of encrypted
communication with opaque servers.

211
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:59,583
Alicia Sierra used them to leak
sensitive information to the Professor.

212
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,041
In the last few hours, we have learned
that she received eight million euros

213
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,041
in companies in her name

214
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,958
in Panama, Belize, and Delaware.

215
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,916
What did you expect?
You've got no way out.

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,833
There's always a way out.

217
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,000
Now, if you have any questions…

218
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,875
-Colonel, please!
-You.

219
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,250
What's Arturo Román's condition?

220
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,416
He's in a critical condition, very severe.

221
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,625
It's too late now.

222
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:33,375
The police, the CNI, the government…
They've all fabricated the evidence.

223
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,083
If you turn us in, they'll say that,
after betraying them, you betrayed us.

224
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,500
Shut up.

225
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,625
Do you really think they'll admit
to fabricating evidence?

226
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,291
The CNI never backs down or apologizes.
You know that.

227
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,583
Shut up.

228
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,375
-Colonel.
-I have a question.

229
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,125
-Are you planning an intervention?
-Things have changed drastically.

230
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:56,291
What was once a heist with hostages
is now a kidnapping with executions.

231
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,458
-The protocols are completely different.
-Is that why the army has been mobilized?

232
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,083
As the operation is ongoing,
I cannot provide further details.

233
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,666
-Please!
-Colonel! Here!

234
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,583
That's the green light.

235
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,041
It's going to be a massacre.
They're going to go in.

236
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,333
They kicked me out of the game.

237
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,833
I don't even know
how they're getting the gold out.

238
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:18,916
The gold.

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,375
-It doesn't matter anymore.
-Of course it does.

240
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,333
You don't get it.
The gold doesn't matter anymore.

241
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,250
-Shut up.
-You've been condemned.

242
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,458
You've been charged
with the same crimes as us, or even worse.

243
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,208
-Quiet.
-Yours include disobedience.

244
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,125
-Shut up.
-You're a traitor now.

245
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,416
-Shut up.
-For the police, government, colleagues…

246
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,791
-Shut up.
-No one will bail you out of jail.

247
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,541
Shut up! I need to think!

248
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,958
No.

249
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,708
Her water broke.

250
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,750
Not now.

251
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,791
Not now.

252
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,166
Be reasonable.
You can't raise a child in prison.

253
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,750
Kids can be raised just fine in prison.
It's called a "prison nursery."

254
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,791
Godfather…

255
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,916
Thanks for including me in this.

256
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,666
I needed it.

257
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,833
If you needed money,
all you had to do was call.

258
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,625
I needed someone to believe in me.

259
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,833
She's talking about her father, Dad.

260
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,333
I know she's talking about her father.

261
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,208
He thinks I can't do heists anymore,
but I can do them even better than before.

262
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,791
But you have to study for this one.
We're going to print 2.4 billion euros.

263
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,666
Like this: chug, chug, chug.

264
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,250
You told your father you're here, right?

265
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,666
He doesn't know, nor will he.

266
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,875
Okay.

267
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,041
Well, we're going to bed.

268
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,875
Tomorrow we have shooting practice
and… whatnot. Let's go.

269
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,458
-Good night.
-Good night.

270
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,208
Dani.

271
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,791
Son!

272
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,166
-Wake up!
-Dude! What's wrong?

273
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,291
I think we misunderstood something.

274
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,208
What did we misunderstand, Dad?

275
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,958
It's five in the morning, Dad!
What did we misunderstand?

276
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,583
Maybe we didn't understand
how Benjamín wanted us

277
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,166
to look after Julia,
and we're screwing it up.

278
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,125
We're not screwing anything up.
Julia wants to be here.

279
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,583
Julia's a grown, adult woman.
She's got her own life, she's independent.

280
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,291
I don't care what she wants.
I need to tell Benjamín

281
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,791
that I might have messed
the "right track" thing up.

282
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,166
And maybe my idea of the right track

283
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,875
isn't the same right or wrong track
Benjamín has in mind.

284
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,875
We need to clean this mess up
before the bullets start flying.

285
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,875
Dad, Benjamín is in prison,

286
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,791
and there's nothing we can do
because we don't have a phone.

287
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,250
We have to soldier on. So good night.

288
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,791
Come on, get up! I have to call him.

289
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,125
You want to call him in prison right now?

290
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,708
What do you mean by "right now"?

291
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,125
We have to walk for three or four hours
until we find a phone.

292
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,500
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not what?

293
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,541
-God.
-Come on.

294
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,000
-I can't go back to sleep now.
-Get up.

295
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,666
The C4 goes behind steel sheets.
We don't want a sympathetic detonation.

296
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,291
Our defense began
by moving the weapons to a safe place.

297
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,333
Grab seven more.

298
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,041
Rio, grenades?

299
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,375
-Six.
-Take as many as you can.

300
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:58,041
We felt like we were building
our own grave, not a bunker.

301
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,125
We got this.

302
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,708
Without the Professor outside,
we felt like orphans.

303
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,166
This is the last fight. Stay strong!

304
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,875
No father, no plan, and no hope.

305
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,833
Forgive me for the soccer reference,
but it's all I've got.

306
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,208
Sometimes, during the World Cup finals,
you can tell who will lose.

307
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,916
You can smell a team's fear
as they sing their anthem.

308
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,875
And I can smell the fear here today.

309
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,083
But we're going to change that.

310
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,708
A game is 11 against 11.

311
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
We're playing ten against 10,000,
and have no coach.

312
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,041
Calling the heist team
at the Bank of Spain.

313
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,125
Breaking news from the stormwater tank.

314
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,541
Sierra's not wearing
her police armband anymore.

315
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,916
Tamayo ousted her. He let her go.

316
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,208
Sierra's flying solo.
Do you know what that means?

317
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,875
Can you guess?

318
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
Tokyo? Rio, do you know?

319
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:03,166
The Professor is not finished.
He's playing his own game, and he can win.

320
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,208
He's playing against a nutcase.

321
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,750
No. She's much more than that.

322
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:13,083
She's a raging nutcase
who's been betrayed by her own people,

323
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,833
They threw her to the wolves.

324
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,000
She probably already knows the Professor
isn't her biggest enemy anymore.

325
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,791
-Breathe with your diaphragm.
-What?

326
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,291
Breathe with your diaphragm
to control the contractions.

327
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,708
Are you a midwife now?

328
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,083
We can't win this war.

329
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,583
The Balkan bear got the strategy wrong.

330
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,791
We don't need to win this war.
We're going to lose it…

331
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,583
but very slowly.

332
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,083
And you…

333
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,208
my boys and girls in red…

334
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,333
We, who have been cast off by society,

335
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,541
a team made up
of the biggest losers in history,

336
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,375
trans, criminals, scum, gays…

337
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,208
Balkans, Latinos…

338
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,458
What can they teach us about losing?

339
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,958
We know how much it hurts
to lose this slowly.

340
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,166
We know.

341
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,958
And we can lose one more day.

342
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,708
Why would we want to lose another day?

343
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,041
To melt the gold,
and get it all out of the vault.

344
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,166
We're back.

345
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,458
It sounds fucking good to me.

346
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,500
But you've got a plan to lose,
and you're not filling us in.

347
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,916
Of course I do.

348
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,875
I may be an engineer,

349
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,375
but being an infantry general
is my true calling.

350
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,750
I need to dilate.

351
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,916
Oxytocin… would work really well.

352
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,125
Unfortunately, we don't have any.

353
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,666
-I need something for the pain.
-No, that would put the baby at risk.

354
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,291
Are you fucking kidding me?

355
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,458
In an open field,
we wouldn't stand a chance.

356
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,583
But with rooms, their advantage wanes.

357
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,958
We'll crawl through every corner,
every fucking heap of rubble.

358
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,333
We'll throw a grenade, then another,
followed by machine gun fire.

359
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,208
This isn't a fucking Vietnam War movie.

360
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,791
Exactly. It's worse.
This is the defense of Stalingrad.

361
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,458
This strategy was devised
by General Chuikov.

362
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:30,666
We'll blast music so loudly
they won't hear the grenades, the gunfire,

363
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,000
and even better…

364
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,375
they won't even hear their own radio.

365
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,833
Alicia, listen.

366
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,875
You can't go to a hospital.

367
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,291
And you can't do it on your own.

368
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,125
Release us. You need help.

369
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,541
-Let us help.
-I'm going to give birth…

370
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,500
on my own.

371
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,625
Like my grandmother did,

372
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:56,083
and like hundreds
of women throughout history have done.

373
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,166
Like this!

374
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:07,166
Welcome to the spectacle of life.

375
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,375
I need three volunteers.
This mission won't be easy.

376
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,583
These three will have to take the rear.

377
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:16,958
Our only chance
is to attack them on both fronts.

378
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:21,708
We'll need to move fast
through the elevator shaft, the air ducts,

379
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,833
or wherever we can, but fast.

380
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,208
Logroño.

381
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,875
You seem to know more than him.
How dilated am I?

382
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,916
I couldn't tell you…

383
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,583
Dilation is measured by touch.

384
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,583
Let's see.

385
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,000
What part of the plan is this?

386
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,833
The birth plan!

387
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,333
I need three volunteers and, listen up…

388
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,500
these three will be the most exposed.

389
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,708
Good. Let's do it.

390
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,500
Come on!

391
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Denver,

392
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,958
say goodbye to her.

393
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:15,291
We've a long night ahead. This might
be the last time you see each other.

394
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,125
Are we seriously going to walk?

395
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,166
How else can we get there at 5:00 a.m.?

396
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,041
Shit, we could steal a car.

397
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:35,291
There you go again. Is stealing always
the first thing you think of?

398
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,708
As soon as something gets tough,
boom, a theft.

399
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,541
Says the one who brought me here
to rob the Royal Mint.

400
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,500
So you can learn to do it intelligently,
like the Professor.

401
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,041
He steals as one should,

402
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:48,541
in one big go, not small amounts,
and screwing other people over.

403
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:52,041
It's 5:00 a.m. If we leave now,
we won't be back until 11:00.

404
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,333
If the Professor sees us,
what will you tell him?

405
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:58,125
See? You're thinking with your head,
and being sensible.

406
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,000
We'll steal a car,

407
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,083
but from someone
who won't report it stolen.

408
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,958
-Coming.
-Come on.

409
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,125
What can I say, Benjamín,
that you don't already know?

410
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,166
There's a risk.

411
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,583
The job is huge,

412
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,208
but every detail
has been thought out, I swear.

413
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,750
If something goes wrong,
Julia will be taken to a men's prison.

414
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,875
I can't even imagine that.

415
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,916
Yeah, but if she asked
to be transferred to a women's prison,

416
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,125
they'd probably do it.

417
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,416
It's taken Julia a long time
to get where she is now.

418
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,750
She's…

419
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,250
just starting to live her life.

420
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:05,583
She's happy.
I'd never seen my daughter happy…

421
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,000
in 30 years.

422
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,625
Her body was a prison.
Don't make her go back.

423
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,166
If the job is as big as you say,
won't you look after her?

424
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,375
Of course. As if she were my own daughter.

425
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,250
Benjamín, listen,

426
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:30,166
I've stood by Julia my whole life,
and I'll stand by her until the day I die.

427
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,125
Thanks, Dani.

428
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,625
Don't… mention it.

429
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,500
I have to go.

430
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,958
Bye.

431
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,416
You overdid it a bit.

432
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
I did? How?

433
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,291
Let's get out of here.

434
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,166
-Bye.
-See you.

435
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,291
Coming.

436
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:11,041
That phone call is irreversible.
Think about it for a second, please.

437
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,625
That call will condemn you and your child.

438
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:20,916
You can hate me as much as you want.
You can wish me dead, or whatever,

439
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,416
but, sadly, right now,

440
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,041
to save your and your kid's life,
you need to save mine.

441
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,083
Right now,
we're in the same place, we're equals.

442
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,666
You and I aren't equals,
you piece of shit.

443
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,166
Your job is to break the law.
I work to stop that.

444
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,875
God.

445
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,458
And that's what I'm doing.

446
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,666
You're condemning your own child.

447
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,000
They'll destroy you
because they don't owe you anything.

448
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,250
My life.

449
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,000
They owe me my life.

450
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:03,500
I became the queen bitch for them.

451
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,541
And they can't let bitches like me down.

452
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,583
I won't let you down.

453
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,500
Shut up.

454
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,541
I won't let you down.

455
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,875
Don't talk to me
as if I were one of your people.

456
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,375
I won't spend the rest of my life
on the run.

457
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,041
I don't run away.

458
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,041
I don't hide.

459
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,500
I don't go to the Philippines.

460
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,875
I liked my life.

461
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,625
I like Madrid. And lamb tripe.

462
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,208
And the Puerta del Sol. And corruption.

463
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm not losing my country because of you!

464
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,708
Tamayo betrayed you, not me.

465
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,541
I hate you.

466
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,833
Fine. But we're running out of time,

467
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:58,416
and your hate for me doesn't entitle you
to put your baby's life at risk.

468
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,541
This kid…

469
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,916
adores risk, you son of a bitch!

470
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,958
Fuck!

471
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:37,666
Follow me.

472
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,375
Tamayo's here,
and soldiers are going in with him.

473
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,291
Did the Professor call?

474
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,541
If he had, I'd have informed you.

475
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,833
Everyone out!

476
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,458
We're going to plan
a military intervention here!

477
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,833
Move it!

478
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:12,375
Police officers are leaving the tent.
They're organizing something.

479
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,791
Copy. We've got a few minutes.

480
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:25,000
When you shoot someone,
you feel like shit.

481
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,416
You hate yourself.

482
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,750
I shot you.

483
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,750
Something bad could've happened to you.

484
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,958
I could've been a murderer…

485
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,916
You think the only option
is prison or be killed.

486
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,583
But no.

487
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,833
It's not how it works.

488
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,333
I treated your wounds.

489
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:54,791
I danced for you.

490
00:32:57,083 --> 00:33:00,791
And ever since then
we've been fucking happy, Mónica.

491
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,125
Just because things worked out once
doesn't mean they will twice.

492
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:10,625
In fact…

493
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,500
we may be pushing our luck too far.

494
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,458
I'd like to talk when you get back.

495
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,041
What if I don't come back?

496
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,708
Then I'd like to kiss you.

497
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,541
A first kiss.

498
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,916
A first kiss is only the first time.

499
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,208
That's why it's called a first kiss.

500
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:51,000
But I don't want to give you a last kiss…
I want to give you a second first kiss.

501
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,083
Like a kiss couples give each other
when they make up.

502
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:57,916
That's the one I want.

503
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,000
The building is blast resistant.
That leaves us few options to break in.

504
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,333
The main entrance,

505
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,416
the loading docks… or the windows.

506
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,791
But they'll be expecting us
to come in through precisely those places,

507
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,125
so none of them is an option.

508
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,041
But there's another option.

509
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,750
You know Captain Gandía.
He was a green beret.

510
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:02,083
I'm honored to have served by his side,
and some of you have too.

511
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,125
He's proposing an alternative plan.

512
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,708
The rooftop is marked
as "blast resistant" in the plans,

513
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,708
but part of it isn't
due to a load-bearing issue.

514
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,833
It's confidential information.
They ignore it.

515
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:17,208
There's a hole
in the Bank of Spain's blast protection?

516
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,125
No. It's fully protected.

517
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,333
But it starts at the museum,

518
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:24,125
and ends with steel doors
like the ones on the ground floor.

519
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,250
So we'll climb up there,

520
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,916
blow the roof off,
and go straight into the dining hall.

521
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,125
That coffered ceiling goes back
to the 18th century… During the Civil War,

522
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:37,875
it was brought here from a palace in Jaén
to protect it from the bombings.

523
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,541
Do you think someone in Bosnia said,

524
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:43,416
"Don't blow up the Mostar Bridge,
it's old"?

525
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,583
No, and there it is, rebuilt.

526
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,375
Or the Sarajevo Library.

527
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,541
During the World War, Berlin burned,

528
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,666
and nobody said, "Don't bomb
this neighborhood, it's pretty."

529
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,333
There are Goya paintings
and Quimbaya gold in there…

530
00:35:56,416 --> 00:36:00,541
We have Amnesty International on our ass.
Are we going to confront UNESCO as well?

531
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,125
You couldn't care less
about Quimbaya gold.

532
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,125
You're looking at me as if I'm a dog.
Tell me what the fuck you're thinking!

533
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,250
You condemned an innocent person.
You slandered her. She'll go to prison.

534
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:15,125
Angelito, a country's security
is above any individual's honor,

535
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,416
it's above all else!

536
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,166
The National Reserve
is a country's backbone.

537
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:24,041
Is Sierra's dignity more important
than the safety of 47 million people?

538
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,666
For fuck's sake, Tamayo!

539
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,416
You condemned her to save yourself,
not to save 47 million people.

540
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,458
We'll get in by blowing up
that coffered ceiling!

541
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,208
Come on, baby!
A little bit more, and you'll be out!

542
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,000
Fuck!

543
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,541
It won't come out!

544
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,208
Why won't it come out?

545
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,500
Because that's not the head.

546
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,666
What?

547
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,000
It's breech.

548
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,458
What?

549
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,666
What do I do?

550
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,083
You need to insert your hand,

551
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:23,125
place the baby on your arm,
as if it were horseback riding,

552
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:27,208
hold its mouth with your index and thumb,
bring its head close to the breastbone…

553
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,375
and pull it out.

554
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:37,458
There's no other way,
and you need to do it now.

555
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,875
You have to release me.

556
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,833
A convoy is leaving the tent.

557
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:56,416
Copy. Everyone in position.

558
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,333
Lisbon?

559
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:00,875
We're ready.

560
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,375
-Tokyo?
-I'm in.

561
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,791
Matías, code red.

562
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,916
Okay, no one moves!

563
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,791
Put your head between your legs,
and brace yourself. Like in an airplane!

564
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,958
It's going to be bumpy.

565
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,250
Change of plans!

566
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,750
Whatever happens up there,

567
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:02,166
no matter what you hear,
no matter what shakes, don't stop melting!

568
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:07,083
Don't stop even if Jesus appears,
and dances reggaeton in front of you.

569
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,833
-Bogotá?
-I'm heading up.

570
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,500
If anyone's thinking
of taking a bit of gold

571
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,708
to make earrings for their grandma…

572
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:17,958
don't.

573
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:23,125
Ask Daddy for the gold when we're outside,
understood, children?

574
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,000
Get to work!

575
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,250
Come on! Let's go!

576
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,166
-Let's do it!
-Start melting!

577
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,000
They're heading southwest.

578
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:45,875
God.

579
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,375
No!

580
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,791
Marseille, grab sheets.

581
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,875
Benjamín, clean water.

582
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,958
Move! Everyone out!

583
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,000
Quickly!

584
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:29,625
Everyone out!

585
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,916
Come on! Out!

586
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,625
They're in a blind spot.

587
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:38,875
If they're in a blind spot,
it's because they're climbing.

588
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,625
They're going to blow the roof!

589
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,916
Tokyo, Denver, Manila, go to the stairs!

590
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,458
Ready!

591
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,291
Now!

592
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,416
God.

593
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,666
Listen to me.

594
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,208
Start taking deep breaths.

595
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,916
That's it.

596
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,791
You can't push now. That's very important.

597
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,083
I'm going to put my hand in.

598
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,416
-Okay?
-Okay.

599
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,250
It'll be okay.

600
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,500
It'll be okay.

601
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,583
Let's do it.

602
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,666
-Location, Tokyo.
-We're on the second floor.

603
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,916
Third floor.

604
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:00,083
Go to the roof,
and catch them from behind. Helsinki?

605
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,708
I'm building a trench!

606
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,583
Retreat to the museum. Wait for me.

607
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,750
-I can't.
-No, for God's sake.

608
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,791
Please!

609
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,416
Come on.

610
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,208
A little bit more.

611
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,250
The breastbone. I've got it.

612
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:03,833
Please…

613
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:04,875
Almost there.

614
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,458
I'm pulling it out.

615
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,041
A little more.

616
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,250
Helsinki, get out.
Take shelter in the museum.

617
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,000
Negative!

618
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,208
Let's do this.

619
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,375
Let's do it.

620
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,833
Take cover.

621
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,458
…a terrible explosion…

622
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,791
LIVE
EXPLOSION AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

623
