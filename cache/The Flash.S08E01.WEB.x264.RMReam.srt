Then I found out what was
being carried in this case.

336
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,860
A bleeding-edge beryllium core

337
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,380
which is a highly unstable
power source.

A beryllium-based detonation

The core wasn't in the case

the real question is,

the Royal Flush Gang

480
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,430
kidnapped a prisoner
named Jared Haywood.

481

Had any luck
tracking them down?

the Mercury Labs chip?

would need it.

Turns out
that chip's so cutting edge,

488

it has, like, a thousand
different applications, so...

489

I blew it.

a whole lot of sadness.

to still be with Ray?

as Ray's liaison.

I messed that up, too.

Oh, my God, Cecil,
I am--I'm so sorry.

I shouldn't have said that.

No, no, it's okay. Hey...
