1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,826
Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,930
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,220
Did you run away?

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,310
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Is that blood?

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,166
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!
- She's freaking me out!

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,400
I bet she's deaf.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,570
Not deaf.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,950
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,410
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,410
No, no, no!

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,090
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,430
- See over there?
- That's the bathroom.

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,510
Privacy.
Get it?

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,910
You don't want it closed?

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,740
No.

16
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,910
Oh, so you can speak.

17
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay, well...

18
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,290
Um, how about we just keep the door...

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,130
just like this.

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,340
- Is that better?
- Yes.

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,100
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,060
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,850
She tried to get naked.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,620
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,150
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like...

26
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,690
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,400
- From where?
- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,170
- You got a lot of family there?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Seriously though, think about it.

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,330
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,570
Why she went like...

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,420
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly!

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,170
We should've never brought her here.

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,646
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,420
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

37
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,276
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,260
- Who's crazy now?
- How is that crazy?

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,930
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,350
- So?
- So if I tell my mom

41
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,270
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

42
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,600
- Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,270
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,570
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

45
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,780
- You're letting a girl...
- Just listen!

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,820
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

47
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,950
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,870
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,226
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

50
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,436
We'll be totally in the clear.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,250
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,710
And this time, we find Will.

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,720
You really think she's psycho?

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
Wouldn't want her in my house.

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,430
Mental.

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,770
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,490
Is that real?

59
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,580
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

60
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,210
What's it mean?
Eleven?

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,670
That's your name?

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,840
Eleven. Okay.

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,260
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

64
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,560
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,020
Um, well, okay.

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,190
'Night, El.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,730
'Night, Mike.

68
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,810
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

69
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,690
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

70
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,650
- I can't eat.
- I just need you to eat, Mom.

71
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,150
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

72
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,716
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to go alone...

73
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,876
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

74
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,320
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

75
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,780
- Okay.
- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

76
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,056
- How much is a copy?
- Yeah, okay.

77
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,226
- Okay, Mom. Mom.
- Ten cents?

78
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,870
- If we... Ten cents...
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

79
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,210
You can't get like this, okay?

80
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,710
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

81
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,590
We've been waiting six hours.

82
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,390
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

83
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,050
Six hours.

84
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,260
A little bit of trust here, all right?

85
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,310
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,060
- And?
- Nothing.

87
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,560
God.

88
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,650
Flo says you got a phone call?

89
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,900
Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,880
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

91
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,330
- The storm?
- What else?

92
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,330
You're saying that that's not weird?

93
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,080
No, it's weird.

94
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,670
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the...

95
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,760
No, it doesn't work like that.

96
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,590
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

97
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,406
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

98
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,470
No. It was him.
It was Will.

99
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,520
And he was scared.
And then something...

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,440
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,336
- Who would do that?
- Well, this thing's been on TV.

102
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,530
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

103
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,610
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

104
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,320
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here?

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,620
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

106
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,216
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

107
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,710
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

108
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,080
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

109
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,790
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

110
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,850
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
- No.

111
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,376
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

112
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,070
Oh, come on!

113
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,230
You're wasting your time.

114
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,950
Hey, Hopper.

115
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,200
Hopper.

116
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,530
Let me go.

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,950
- I'm sorry?
- To Lonnie's.

118
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,910
You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,420
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

120
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,210
He'll... He'll hide.

121
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,000
- You know, he's good at hiding.
- Yeah?

122
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,420
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

123
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,180
Stay here with your mom.

124
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,470
She needs you.

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,820
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

126
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,160
Do a lot of studying last night?

127
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,830
Yeah, actually, I did.

128
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,290
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

129
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,090
Hey, what's going on?

130
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,590
Nothing.

131
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,390
Hey, you found my supercomm.

132
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,640
Pretty cool, huh?

133
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,610
I talk to my friends with it.

134
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,570
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

135
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,730
Signal's pretty weak.

136
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,110
Got you breakfast.

137
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,660
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

138
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,136
but I just need you to go out there.

139
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,290
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

140
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,920
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,130
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

142
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,210
Understand?

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,720
Really, it's no big deal.

144
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,930
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

145
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,600
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

146
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,100
No.

147
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,520
No?

148
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,360
No.

149
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,780
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

150
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,120
You're in trouble, aren't you?

151
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,000
Who...

152
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,130
Who are you in trouble with?

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,420
Bad.

154
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,590
Bad?

155
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,760
Bad people?

156
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,470
They want to hurt you?

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,970
The bad people?

158
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,400
Understand?

159
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,990
Michael, where are you?
We're going to be late.

160
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,846
- Let's go!
- All right, I'll be back.

161
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,620
Just stay here, okay?
Stay here.

162
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,380
When was this?

163
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,090
Last night.
Less than two miles away.

164
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,960
- And the boy?
- Still missing.

165
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,760
<i>It was my son.
I know it.</i>

166
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,140
<i>And I... I heard something else.</i>

167
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,600
<i>Something else?</i>

168
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,310
<i>It was like, uh,
some kind of animal.</i>

169
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,900
<i>I don't know.
Just please tell Hop to hurry.</i>

170
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,900
Will! Will Byers!

171
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,650
Will Byers!

172
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,490
- Will!
- Will!

173
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,330
Hey!
Anything?

174
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,330
You?

175
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,540
No, nothing but a dead phone.

176
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Joyce?

177
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,460
About one step from falling off the edge.

178
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,960
She's been a few steps
for a while now, hasn't she?

179
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,800
Kid's missing, man.

180
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,170
Show a little class.

181
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,680
All right. Come on, let's go!

182
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,010
We got a lot of ground to cover.

183
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,510
The chief and her,
they've screwed before, huh?

184
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,730
Will!

185
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,270
That a "yeah" or did they...

186
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,400
- Will!
- Will!

187
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,370
"When alpha particles go through
gold foil, they become..."

188
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,000
- Unoccupied space.
- "A molecule that can..."

189
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,226
- Hey!
- I don't know,

190
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,596
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

191
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,726
- Steve...
- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

192
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,090
Don't worry.
Now, on to more important matters.

193
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,130
My dad has left town on a conference
and my mom's gone with him,

194
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,630
- 'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
- Good call.

195
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
So are you in?

196
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,220
In for what?

197
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,050
No parents? Big house?

198
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,850
A party?

199
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,850
Ding, ding, ding!

200
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,390
It's Tuesday.

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,940
It's Tuesday!
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,350
Come on.

203
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,190
It'll be low key.
It'll just be us.

204
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,650
What do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

205
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,570
- Um...
- Oh, God. Look.

206
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,280
Oh, God, that's depressing.

207
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,750
- Should we say something?
- I don't think he speaks.

208
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,580
How much you want to bet he killed him?

209
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,920
Shut up.

210
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,720
Hey.

211
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,380
Oh, hey.

212
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,640
I just...

213
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
I wanted to say, you know, um...

214
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm sorry about everything.

215
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,820
Everyone's thinking about you.

216
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,610
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,370
I'm sure he's fine.

218
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,120
He's a smart kid.

219
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,920
I have to go.
Chemistry test.

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

221
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,540
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

222
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,880
<i>Attention, faculty and students.</i>

223
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,430
<i>At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be
an assembly on the football field</i>

224
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,850
<i>in support of Will Byers and his family.</i>

225
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,060
<i>All are encouraged to attend.</i>

226
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,310
<i>Volunteer sign-ups for search parties
are still available in the office.</i>

227
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,700
Oh, this is weird.

228
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,160
- He's never this late.
- I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

229
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,490
I thought you liked his plan.

230
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,910
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid,
or he'd be here.

231
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,950
If his mom found out
a girl spent the night...

232
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,540
He's in deep shit right about now.

233
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,290
Hey, what if she slept naked?

234
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,290
Oh, my God, she didn't.

235
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,590
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

236
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,550
- No way. Mike would never rat us out.
- I don't know.

237
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,840
All that matters is, after school,
the freak will be back in the loony bin,

238
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,060
and we can focus on what really matters,
finding Will.

239
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,466
<i>You want anything to drink?</i>

240
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,160
We have OJ, skim milk...
What else?

241
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,870
Um, we have...

242
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,540
Oh, this is my living room.

243
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,170
It's mostly just for watching TV.

244
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,800
Nice, right?
It's a 22-inch.

245
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,960
That's, like, ten times bigger
than Dustin's.

246
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,690
- Pretty.
- I guess.

247
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,190
That's my sister Nancy.

248
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,900
And that's baby Holly.

249
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,360
And those are my parents.

250
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,150
What are your parents like?

251
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,190
Do they live close?

252
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,200
That's our La-Z-Boy.

253
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,160
It's where my dad sleeps.

254
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,950
You can try it if you want.

255
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
Yeah.

256
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
It's fun.

257
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,420

258
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,930

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,950
Whoosh!

320
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,410
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

321
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,490
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

322
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,380
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

323
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,800
We got first every year.

324
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,590
Except for last year when we got third.

325
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,760
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

326
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,870
You know Will?

327
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,040
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

328
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,710
We gotta go.

329
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,300
I bought pizza
and macaroni.

330
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,560
Ted? Is that you?

332
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,850
Just me, Mom!

333
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,600
- Mike? What are you doing home?
- One second!

334
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,940
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

335
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,740
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

336
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,780
Do you understand?

337
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,450
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

338
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,910
Promise?

339
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,000
It means something that you can't break.

340
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,000
- Ever.
- Michael?

341
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,670
Please?

342
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,730
Pop!

343
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,270
Papa!

344
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,860
Papa!

345
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,280
No!

346
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,320
Papa!

347
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,740
No! No!
No!

348
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:29,764
No! Stop it!

349
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,580
Papa!

350
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,330
Papa!

351
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,830
Papa!

352
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,000
Papa!

353
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,250
Papa!

354
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
Papa.

355
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,900
I just... I don't feel good.

356
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,650
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

357
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,970
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

358
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,466
but the last time I told you I was sick

359
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,466
- you made me go to school anyway, and...
- Michael.

360
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,320
- Yeah?
- I'm not mad at you.

361
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,700
- No?
- No, of course not.

362
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,960
All this that's been going on with Will,

363
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,170
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

364
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,960
I just...

365
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,510
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

366
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,340
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

367
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,550
I'm here for you. Okay?

368
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,310
Is there someone else here?

369
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
No.

370
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,520
Eleven?

371
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,190
Is everything okay?

372
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,320
El?

373
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,700
- Mike.
- Is everything okay?

374
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,120
Are you sure?

375
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,790
Promise.

376
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,330
- Will Byers!
- Will!

377
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,016
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

378
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,250
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

379
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,590
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

380
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,800
What?
George Burness made the jump.

381
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,220
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

382
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
George is a liar.

383
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,260
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

384
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,950
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

385
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,140
Nah.

386
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,020
<i>Chief, you copy?</i>

387
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,110
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

388
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,940
<i>Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.</i>

389
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,860
<i>I think you need to get there right away.</i>

390
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Ugh, Jesus!

391
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,600
Suicide?

392
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,560
Mmm-hmm.

393
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,730
Missing kid, suicide...

394
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,530
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

395
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,990
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

396
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,240
Benny was my friend.

397
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,320
Hello?

398
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,830
Yeah.

399
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,250
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

400
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,396
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
- To look around.

401
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,920
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
- I'll be fast.

402
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,340
Hey, Will?

403
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,800
Will!

404
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,970
Will, you here?
Will!

405
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,100
Get off!

406
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,850
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

407
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,060
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

408
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,320
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

409
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
My oldest.

410
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,360
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.

411
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,840
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen to me.

412
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,776
- You are out of your mind!
- She knows about Will.

413
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,510
What do you mean she knows about Will?

414
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,680
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

415
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,640
- You could tell?
- Just think about it.

416
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,996
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

417
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,640
the same place where Will disappeared?

418
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,020
- That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.

419
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,400
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

420
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,860
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us?

421
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,070
Do you know where he is?

422
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,216
Do you know where Will is?

423
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,580
- Stop it, you're scaring her!
- She should be scared!

424
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,540
If you know where he is, tell us!

425
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,420
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

426
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,920
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

427
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,420
- What kind of danger?
- Her name is Eleven?

428
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,010
- El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger?

429
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,720
Danger danger.

430
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,470
No, no, no!

431
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,310
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

432
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,990
No.

433
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,920
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

434
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,880
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

435
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,750
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

436
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,260
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

437
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,930
he's not here and he never has been.

438
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,010
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?
- I don't know, I just...

439
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,600
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

440
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,220
You know, he was lost or something.

441
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,560
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

442
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,770
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

443
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,190
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

444
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,400
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

445
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,450
Come out here to the city.

446
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,160
People are more real here, you know?

447
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,950
And then I could see you more.

448
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,580
- What, you think I don't want to see you?
- I know you don't.

449
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,710
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

450
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,090
She even know you're here?

451
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,130
Oh, great.

452
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,920
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

453
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,800
Some real fine parenting right there.

454
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,640
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

455
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,020
In case you forgot what he looks like.

456
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,360
He's kinda cute, hmm?

457
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,490
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

458
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,630
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

459
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,450
You, uh, notice anything...

460
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,870
odd about him the last few weeks?

461
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,210
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

462
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,420
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

463
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,710
He got any enemies you might know about?

464
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,880
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

465
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,970
The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

466
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,510
nah.

467
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,350
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

468
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,690
- Just you and the boys?
- Yep.

469
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,850
Me and Henry and...

470
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,690
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

471
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,820
No kid did this.

472
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,820
Kid?

473
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,700
What are you talking about?

474
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,700
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

475
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,540
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

476
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,000
Can you imagine that?

477
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,000
This kid...

478
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,760
what'd he look like?

479
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,220
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

480
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,736
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

481
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,220
He look like this?

482
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,940
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

483
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,060
No. This was a different kid.

484
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,610
This one had really short hair.

485
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,770
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

486
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,490
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

487
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,660
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

488
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,120
could it be Lonnie's kid?

489
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,160
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

490
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,120
About the right height, though.

491
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,870
I mean, could've been.

492
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,630
Yeah, that's...

493
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,710
Could've been.

494
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,930
Because I don't want to go by myself.

495
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,180
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

496
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,640
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

497
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,600
No, tell them we're... studying.

498
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,400
Nancy! Dinner!

499
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,190
Coming!

500
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,940
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

501
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,290
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

502
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,210
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

503
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't know why.

504
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,960
Me, too.

505
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,510
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

506
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,970
So, there's this...

507
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,550
special assembly thing tonight...

508
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,930
for Will at the school field.

509
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,020
Barb's driving.

510
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,270
Why am I just hearing about this?

511
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,190
I thought you knew.

512
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,360
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

513
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,780
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

514
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,900
I mean, everyone's going.

515
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Just... be back by 10:00.

516
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,716
Why don't you take the boys, too?

517
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,950
- No!
- Mmm-mmm.

518
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,710
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

519
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,010
Sorry. Spasm.

520
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,140
Oh...

521
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,430
It's okay, Holly.

522
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,350
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.

523
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,350
Will!

524
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,650
Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

525
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,870
Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

526
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,920
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

527
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,580
And stealing food from Benny?

528
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,340
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

529
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,050
Can't ask a corpse questions.

530
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,920
Hold up!

531
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,470
You got something?

532
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,760
- Hey, what do you got?
- Not sure.

533
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,770
Maybe nothing.

534
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,770
I found this. In there.

535
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,650
No way a kid
crawls through there.

536
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,400
I don't know...

537
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,860
a scared enough one might.

538
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,320
His brother said he was good at hiding.

539
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
El?

540
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,200
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

541
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,790
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

542
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,290
They promise.
Right?

543
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,920
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

544
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,300
Ow!

545
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,010
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

546
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,140
That's all.

547
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,140
We just wanted to find our friend.

548
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,770
"Friend"?

549
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,730
Yeah, friend.
Will?

550
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,110
What is "friend"?

551
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,610
Is she serious?

552
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,700
Um, a friend...

553
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,530
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

554
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,740
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

555
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,120
And they never break a promise.

556
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,120
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit?

557
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,960
- A spit swear means...
- you never break your word.

558
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,460
It's a bond.

559
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,210
That's super important, because friends...

560
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,550
they tell each other things.

561
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,380
Things that parents don't know.

562
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,270
- Barbara, pull over.
- What?

563
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,640
Pull over!

564
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,230
What are we doing here?

565
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,900
His house is three blocks away.

566
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,440
We can't park in the driveway.

567
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,570
Are you serious?

568
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,836
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

569
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,570
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

570
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,490
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

571
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,120
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

572
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,460
We're gonna have a great time.

573
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,080
He just wants to get in your pants.

574
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,790
No, he doesn't.

575
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,170
Nance... seriously.

576
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,340
He invited you to his house.

577
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,340
His parents aren't home.

578
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,680
Come on, you are not this stupid.

579
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

580
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,930
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

581
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,890
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

582
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,940
- Gross.
- I'm serious!

583
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,310
All right, well...

584
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,570
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

585
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,110
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

586
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Ugh.

587
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,740
Is that a new bra?

588
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,540
No.

589
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,970
Barb, chill.

590
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,260
I'm chill.

591
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,730
Hello, ladies.

592
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,300
What are you doing?

593
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,810
It's freezing.

594
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,060
You ever feel cursed?

595
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,570
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

596
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,950
the summer of '23.

597
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,910
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

598
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,670
When'd the last person freeze to death?

599
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,380
Hey, come back inside.

600
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,470
Warm me up. Just...

601
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,680
Just give me a minute out here.

602
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,120
What's the weirdo doing?

603
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,210
El?

604
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,900
Will.

605
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Superpowers.

606
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,620
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

607
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,240
Do you know where he is?

608
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,840
I don't understand.

609
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,930
Hiding.

610
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,680
Will is hiding?

611
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,020
From the bad men?

612
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,610
Then from who?

613
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,800
Where are you?

614
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,160
One! Two!

615
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,920
- Three!
- Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

616
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,670
You're such an asshole, Tommy.

617
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,600
Is that supposed to impress me?

618
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,480
- You're not?
- You are a cliché, you do realize that?

619
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,610
You are a cliché.

620
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,110
What with your...
your grades and your band practice.

621
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,610
I'm so not in band.

622
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,620
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh,
show us how it's done, then?

623
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,700
Okay.

624
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,806
- You gotta make a little hole right in...
- I got it.

625
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,040
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

626
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,800
Chug, chug, chug.

627
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,340
Chug. Chug. Chug.

628
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,150
Barb, you wanna try?

629
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,530
What? No.

630
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,860
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

631
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,070
- Come on.
- Yeah...

632
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,546
- Come on. Yeah.
- Nance, I don't want to.

633
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,280
- It's fun! Just give it a...
- Nance...

634
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,030
Just... Just give it a shot.

635
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,290
Okay.

636
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,000
So you just...

637
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,760
- Gnarly.
- Are you okay?

638
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,366
- Yeah.
- Barb, you're bleeding.

639
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,350
I'm fine.
Where's your bathroom?

640
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,020
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past
the kitchen, to the left.

641
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,680
Okay. Thanks.

642
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,190
Oh.

643
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,200
Oh, my, God!
What the hell, Tommy?

644
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,290
No!

645
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,830
Whoo!

646
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,040
Hello?

647
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,830
Hello.

648
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,750
Who is this?

649
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,090
Will?

650
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,300
Will, it's me.

651
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,140
Talk to me.

652
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,600
I'm here.

653
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,560
Just tell me where you are, honey.

654
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,600
I can hear you. Please.

655
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,270
<i>Mom?</i>

656
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,730
Will!

657
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,440
Yes, it's me.
It's me.

658
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,820
Where are you? Where are you?
Just talk to me...

659
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,530
Oh, no, no!

660
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,660
No!

661
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,250
No!

662
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,040
Oh, no! No, no...

663
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,210
No!

664
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,180
No!

665
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,070
Jonathan?

666
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,700
What...

667
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,440
Will...

668
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,200
Will...

669
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,000
Will, is that you?

670
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,650
Oh, my God.

671
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,940
Oh, God...

672
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,030
Oh, my God...

673
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,120
I'm freezing.

674
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,500
Hmm... well, I hear his
mom's room has a fireplace.

675
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,896
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, yeah?

676
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,250
Okay, well, you know,
you are cleaning the sheets.

677
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,590
- You all right?
- Yeah.

678
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,340
Yeah?
Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.

679
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,180
Nance!

680
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,600
Nancy.

681
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,310
Where are you going?

682
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,440
Nowhere.

683
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,350
Just... upstairs.

684
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,060
To change.

685
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,900
I... fell in the pool.

686
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,530
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

687
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,990
I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.

688
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,450
Nance...

689
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,910
Barb...

690
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm fine.

691
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,080
This isn't you.

692
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,830
I'm fine.

693
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,500
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

694
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,650
Thanks.

695
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,990
Um...

696
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,700
some privacy, maybe?

697
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,290
Oh...

698
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, right.
Sorry.

699
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,790
Steve?

700
00:50:58,810 --> 00:50:59,980
Damn.

701
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,560
Shut up.
