Our top story tonight,

just-released polls

17

have incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

in their final debate before next Tuesday's election.

22
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,808
Now, my young opponent here

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,210
wants to gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

24
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,979
established by the great Thomas Wayne.

and the safety net for those who need it.

28

The Renewal Program is broken.

the Gotham PD has dealt major blows

36
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,333
to organized crime and drug trafficking.

37

The Salvatore Maroni case

00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,534
Most of it's from his hand.

172
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,141
Thumb was severed.

173
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,045
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

174
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,214
[Batman] He was alive when it was cut off.

175
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,917
Ecchymosis

176
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,619
around the wound.

177
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,269
[lead detective] Security detail downstairs

178
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,005
said the family was out trick-or-treatin'.

179
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,575
The mayor was up here alone.

180
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,680
Killer may have come through the skylight.

181
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,788
[Gordon] You said there was a card.

182
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,523
[lead detective] Yeah.

183
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,670
[Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?

184
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,473
Haven't a clue?

185
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,010
Let's play a game, just me and you.

186
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,712
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

187
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,249
There's a cipher too.

188
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,958
Any of this mean anything to you?

189
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,561
What's going on here?

190
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,933
I asked him to come, Pete.

191
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,834
[Pete] This is a crime scene.

192
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,103
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

193
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,139
I got the press downstairs.

194
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,007
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,

195
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,075
'cause we got history.

196
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,144
But this is way over the line.

197
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,115
Wait.

198
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,617
-He's involved in this? -No, he's not involved.

199
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,052
How do you know?

200
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,721
He's a goddamn vigilante! He could be a suspect!

201
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,489
What are you doin' to me? We used to be partners.

202
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,458
[Gordon] I'm just trying to find the connection, Pete.

203
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,160
He lies still.

204
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,562
Excuse me?

205
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,465
The riddle.

206
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,867
What does a liar do when he's dead?

207
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,269
He lies still.

208
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,746
Oh, Jesus.

209
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,785
This must be your favorite night of the year, huh, pal?

210
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,222
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

211
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,992
[Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.

212
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,793
They're ready for your statement.

213
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,599
I want him outta here.

214
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,368
Now!

215
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,209
Come on.

216
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,547
[camera shutter clicking]

217
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,189
Yeah.

218
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,725
The kid found him.

219
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,831
[detective] Was there anyone else

220
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,733
in the house when you arrived?

221
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,204
[melancholy song playing]

222
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,419
We really gotta go, man.

223
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:43,028
[Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.

224
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,164
A wife lost a husband.

225
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,467
And I lost a friend.

226
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,969
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city,

227
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,606
and I will not rest until his killer is found.

228
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,543
This was a truly senseless crime,

229
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,078
and we are actively pursuing

230
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,146
every investigative lead we have

231
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,882
in order to identify the perpetrator

232
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,284
and hunt him down.

233
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,952
I've spoken to the governor...

234
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,688
[Bruce] I wish I could say I'm making a difference,

235
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,190
but I don't know.

236
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,625
[melancholy song continues]

237
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,832
Murder, robberies, assault.

238
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,901
Two years later, they're all up.

239
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,436
And now this.

240
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,240
The city's eating itself.

241
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,211
Maybe it's beyond saving.

242
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,515
But I have to try.

243
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,650
Push myself.

244
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,189
[melancholy song continues]

245
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,471
[engine revving]

[bats chittering]

247
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,466
These nights all roll together in a rush,

248
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,369
behind the mask.

249
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,209
Sometimes in the morning,

250
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,946
I have to force myself to remember

251
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,917
everything that happened.

252
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,953
[groaning]

253

[newscaster on TV] Unbelievable breaking news

254
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,833
this hour, everyone.

255
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,803
Again, four-term incumbent Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

256
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,706
was found murdered last night inside his home

257
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,608
in the exclusive Crest Hill district.

258
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,577
[newscaster 2] Exact details of the crime

259
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,045
still have not been released,

260
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,847
but a citywide manhunt is already underway

261
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,117
as police and FBI search for the brazen killer.

262
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,320
And this certainly is not the first time

263
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,688
Gotham has been rocked

264
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,256
by the murder of a political figure.

265
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,124
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,

266
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,093
it was 20 years ago this week

267
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,828
that celebrated billionaire philanthropist

268
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,897
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha

269
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,033
were slain during Wayne's own mayoral campaign.

270
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,435
It was a shocking crime

271
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,770
that remains unsolved to this day.

272
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,739
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career

273
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,475
was especially notable for his tough war on drugs

274
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,810
when he and city police

275
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,945
launched a major sting operation

276
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,580
resulting in the arrest

277
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,983
of notorious mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni,

278
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,584
with what, to this day,

279
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,220
remains the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.

280
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,555
I assume you heard about this.

281

[newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]

Oh, I see.

[Gordon on video] All this blood is from his head?

285
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,738
Dear God.

286
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,582
[lead detective] There's a cipher too.

[camera shutter clicking]

289
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,797
The killer left this for the Batman?

290
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,867
[Gordon] I asked him to come, Pete.

291
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,934
Apparently.

292
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,070
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

293
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,373
Why is he writing to you?

294
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,975
[Pete] It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

295
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,376
I don't know yet.

296
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,744
[Pete] I got the press downstairs.

Here? Why?

301
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,789
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

302
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,224
-I haven't got time for this. -It's getting serious, Bruce.

303
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,592
If this continues,

304

it won't be long before you've nothing left.

305
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,096
I don't care about that.

306

Any of that.

307
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,599
You don't care about your family's legacy?

308
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,105
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

309
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,674
If I can't change things here,

310
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,677
if I can't have an effect,

311
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,512
then I don't care what happens to me.

312
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,847
That's what I'm afraid of.

313

314
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,418
You're not my father.

I'm well aware.

Just reminiscing about my days in the Circus.

[inhales sharply] This is actually quite elusive.

[Alfred smack lips]

326
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,878
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

327
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,281
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,177
[man] Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

676
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,718
[Selina] Jesus, I hate dropheads.

677
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:35,819
[Batman] Really?

678
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,254
'Cause when I first saw you,

679
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,622
it looked like you were dealing for Penguin.

680
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,623
You don't know what you're talking about.

681
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,991
Can we not...

682
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,060
Can we not do this right now?

683
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,530
Wait. Who was that?

684
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,598
Oh, I saw him.

685
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,166
[Batman] Look back.

686
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,734
If I look back, it's gonna be a whole can of worms.

687
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,169
I need to see his face.

688
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,272
[sighs] Jesus.

689
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,414
That's the DA.

690
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,449
Gil Colson.

691
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,184
And he's coming over. You happy?

692
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,552
[Batman] Talk to him.

693
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:12,723
Hey. How you doing?

694
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,992
-Hi. -I'm Gil.

695
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,562
-Hey, aren't you the DA? -Yeah.

696
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,998
Wow. [chuckles] I've seen you on TV.

697
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,633
Is that right?

698
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:26,003
I haven't seen you around here before.

699
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,105
It's a hell of a time to be the new girl

700
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,574
'cause people are all a little on edge.

701
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,242
[Selina] Oh, honey, I live on the edge.

702
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,744
-[Gil] Is that right? -[Selina chuckles]

703
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,145
[Gil chuckles] I like that.

704
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,546
Do you want to come over?

705
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:37,614
Sure.

706
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,852
-[Gil] This is Travis. -Hey.

707
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,453
[Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?

708
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,622
-Richie, Glen. -[Richie] Hey.

709
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,392
That's half the DA's office.

710
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,893
[Gil] You know Carla here, huh?

711
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,662
-Hi. -That's Cheri. Don't mind her,

712
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,930
she's just taking a break.

713
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,098
Drowning our sorrows.

714
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,533
You want a drop?

715
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,702
[Selina] Uh, no, I'm good. But you enjoy.

716
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,604
[music continues on speakers]

717
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,105
Hope you don't mind.

718
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,407
I got a lot on my shoulders

719
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,775
with that psycho running around.

720
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:05,842
He's wasted.

721
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,411
No shit.

722
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,980
[chuckles] I like this girl.

723
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,682
Oh, hey, I like you, too!

724
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,787
I mean, this Riddler,

725
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,588
he's going after the most powerful people in the city.

726
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:19,723
He knows so much.

727
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,224
[Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.

728
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,526
[Gil] What are you talking about?

729
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,094
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...

730
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,595
[Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.

731
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,331
-Hey. The rat. -[Richie] Think maybe you had

732
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:28,532
-a little too much. Slow down. -Ask him about the rat.

733
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,402
[Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?

734
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,374
[inhales deeply]

735
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,448
I mean,

736
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,585
there was a rat. We had an informant.

737
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,988
We had big-time information on Salvatore Maroni.

738
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,990
That's how we got him out of the drops business.

739
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,524
He's talking about the Maroni case.

740
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:58,362
But if this guy knows, it's gonna come out.

741
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,796
And when it does,

742
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:00,998
this whole city's gonna come apart.

743
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,933
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

744
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,401
This is the kind of pillow talk

745
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,802
that got that Russian girl disappeared.

746
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,405
What do you know about that?

747
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,907
-Does anybody want a drink? -[Gil] I want a drink.

748
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,376
Keep him talking.

749
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,614
-Wait, where are you going? -She knows Annika.

750
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,016
No, stay on the DA.

751
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,218
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

752
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,121
Where's Annika?

753
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,455
Out of my face. I don't know you.

754
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,690
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

755
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,325
What have you heard? Is she okay?

756
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,426
Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.

757
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,761
What, you got a death wish?

758
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,729
[man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

759
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,699
[Carla] There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

760
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,367
Let's keep it festive down here, all right?

761
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,702
[Carla] Sure thing, Oz.

762
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,541
Hey.

763
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,144
Hey.

764
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,547
Been a long time since I seen you down here.

765
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,150
How you been?

766
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,187
Yeah, I've been okay.

767
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,756
I was just, um...

768
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,627
I was just headed back upstairs.

769
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,462
Mm. Well,

770
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,265
don't be a stranger.

771
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,414
-You know Carmine Falcone. -I told you it's a mob spot.

772
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,916
You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.

773
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,051
I don't have a relationship with him, okay?

774
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,453
Well, that's not what it looked like.

775
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,121
-Forget it. -Wait, what are you doing?

776
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,522
[line breaking up] Listen, I can't do this anymore.

777
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,523
No! No!

778
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,325
[static buzzes, stream stops]

779
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,196
[Selina] Taxi!

780
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,465
[heavy breathing]

781
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,367
[Gil] Hey!

782
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,003
I lost you in there.

783
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,338
Yeah, I gotta go.

784
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,074
Oh, you need a ride?

785
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,375
That's me right there.

786
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,145
[eerie music playing]

787
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,683
Taxi!

788
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,851
I'm good.

789
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,354
I hope, uh...

790
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,494
-I'll see you around. -[car door closes]

791
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,500

-[Gil grunts] -[Riddler shushes]

802
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:40,317
[Riddler] Just hold still.

00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,652
-[beeping] -[Gil whimpers]

804

[wistful music playing]

[switch clicks]

808
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,610
[Batman] What do you know about a confidential informant

809
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,312
in the Maroni case?

810
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,717
Yeah, sure, there was.

811
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,520
That's the rat we're looking for.

812
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,889
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

813
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,226
If we find the rat, maybe it'll lead us to him.

814
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,727
Where are you getting this?

815
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,730
I have a source who spoke to the DA tonight.

816
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,667
Gil's very nervous.

817
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,369
I think the killer's targeting people close to that case.

818
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,338
I worked that case.

819
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,608
-Riddler's not after you. -How do you know?

820
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,410
You're not corrupt.

821
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,879
Colson's dirty?

822
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,653
Maybe I, uh...

823
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,157
I go after him. Lean on him to give up the rat.

824
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:28,525
It's too dangerous.

825
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,994
They made a secret deal with this guy.

826
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,929
Who knows how many people it touches.

827
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,500
Politicians. Police. The courts.

828
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,602
It could tear the whole city apart.

829
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,905
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

830
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,842
[Batman] And Riddler's the match.

831
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,444
[Batman on video] You know Carmine Falcone.

832
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,245
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

833
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,914
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.

834
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,948
[Selina] I don't have a relationship...

[video rewinds]

836
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,318
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.

837
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:56,519
[Selina] I don't have a relationship with him.

838
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:57,821
-Okay? -[video rewinds]

839
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,422
[Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.

840
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,224
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

841
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,159
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.

842
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,594
[Selina] I don't have a relationship with him. Okay?

843
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,695
-[Alfred] Pretty. -[tape clicks off]

844
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,865
She a new friend of yours?

845
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,571
I'm not so sure.

846
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,307
Looks like you upset her.

847
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,609
Shall I take this as a good sign?

848
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,644
-What? -Your attire.

849
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,713
Is Bruce Wayne making an actual appearance?

850
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,782
There's a public memorial for Mayor Mitchell.

851
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,552
Serial killers like to follow reactions to their crimes.

852
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,287
Riddler might not be able to resist.

853
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,790
Oh, that reminds me.

854
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,526
I've taken the liberty of doing a little work

855
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,395
on this latest cipher.

856
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,130
The one from the rat maze.

857
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:43,666
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

858
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,602
but I'm fairly certain this translates to,

859
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,506
"You are El Rata Alada."

860
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,207
[Bruce] Rata Alada?

861
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:52,342
"Rat with wings"?

862
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,576
It's slang for "pigeon."

863
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,111
Does that mean anything to you?

864
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,479
Yeah.

865
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,082
A stool pigeon.

866
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,885
-Where are your cufflinks? -I couldn't find them.

867
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,021
Well, you can't go out like that.

868
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,123
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

869
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,029
You have to keep up appearances.

870
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,598
-You're still a Wayne. -[scoffs]

871
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:18,034
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

872
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,870
Your father gave them to me.

873
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,209

00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,253
No more lies! No more lies!

No more lies! No more lies!

880
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,065
Mr. Wayne. All right.

881
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,468
All right, you're going straight down there.

882

[reporter] Is that Bruce Wayne?

885
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,684

You good, fellas?

889
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,065
Good.

890
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,235
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

891
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,948
[melancholy music continues]

892

Sir?

[reporters continue clamoring]

894
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,807
[bodyguard] Hey!

895
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,843
Give us a wide berth here, would you, slick?

896
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,779
Hey, watch it, fellas.

897
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:12,282
You got the prince of the city there.

898
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,053
Some event, huh?

899
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,888
Brought out the one guy in the city

900
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,189
more reclusive than me.

901
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,792
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

902
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,294
Aren't you afraid someone'll take a shot at you?

903
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,763
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

904
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,399
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

905
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,167
Wow, is that right?

906
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,870
His father saved my life.

907
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:37,273
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

908
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,709
I couldn't go to no hospital,

909
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,011
so we showed up on his doorstep.

910
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,448
Operated right on the dining room table.

911
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,618
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,

912
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,920
up on the stairs looking down.

913
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,257
I remember your face.

914
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,261
You don't think that meant something, he did that?

915
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,830
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

916
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,766
"Hippocratic oath."

917
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,737
That's good.

918
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,138
Excuse me.

919
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,841
[laughs]

920
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:13,576
Yes.

-[heavy breathing] -[man coughing]

924
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,192
[announcer on mic] Ladies and gentlemen,

925
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,827
thank you all for coming to today's memorial

926
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,762
for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.

927
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,697
Our program will begin shortly.

928
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,299
As a reminder, the family asked

929
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,867
that those wishing to honor the mayor's memory

930
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,402
consider a donation to the cause

931
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,471
-most dear to his heart... -[scuffling]

932
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,573
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

933
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,108
our city's safety net.

934
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,811
What good's a safety net doesn't catch anybody?

935
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,381
Didn't help my daughter when she needed it,

936
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:52,782
I can tell you that.

937
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,119
The guy was just another rich scum-sucker.

938
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,022
He got what he deserved.

939
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:01,924
Know what I mean?

940
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,261
Hey, don't I know you?

941
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,063
[woman] Bruce Wayne.

942
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,298
Why haven't you called me back?

943
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,433
I'm sorry?

944
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,935
I'm Bella Real. I'm running for mayor.

945
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,470
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

946
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,906
but your people keep telling me you're unavailable.

947
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,441
Will you walk with me?

948
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,445
[Ave Maria continues playing]

949
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,847
Mr. Wayne.

Mr. Wayne.

951
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:30,319
You know, you really could be doing more for this city.

952
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,155
Your family has a history of philanthropy,

953
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,857
but as far as I can tell, you're not doing anything.

954
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:38,094
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

955
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,395
Thank you.

956
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,297
[Bella] My God.

957
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,535
I'm gonna go pay my respects. Will you wait for me?

958
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,236
I want to continue this.

959
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,375
Excuse me.

960
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,312
I'm so sorry for your loss.

961
01:01:58,414 --> 01:01:59,582
Thank you.

962

[Gordon] Excuse me, chief. Can I talk to you?

[Mackenzie] What?

965
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,257
He hasn't been heard from since last night.

966
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,358
Christ, not again.

967

Hey. Mr. Wayne.

968
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,232
You got people looking for him, Jim?

969
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,668
[Gordon] Sent a couple guys to his house. Nothing.

970
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,969
[Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?

971
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,170
[Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

[ominous music playing]

1007
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,138
Holy shit.

1008
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,940
[Mackenzie] Are you kidding me?

1009
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:14,410
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

1010
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,246
Your guy's gonna get himself killed in there.

1011
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,321
[cellphone continues ringing]

1012
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,096
Please.

1013
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:37,233
He made me do it. [tearfully] I'm so sorry.

1014
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,534
He told me if I didn't do

1015
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,669
exactly what he said, he'd kill me.

1016
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:41,037
I'm so sorry.

1017
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,838
Looks like a combination lock.

1018
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,007
Can't we just cut it off?

1019
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,009
Not if you want to keep your head.

1020
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,548
[cellphone continues ringing]

1021
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,442
[Riddler breathing heavily]

1022
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,747
[Riddler] You came.

1023
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,050
Who are you?

1024
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,318
Me?

1025
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,322
I'm nobody.

1026
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,026
I'm just an instrument,

1027
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,728
here to unmask the truth

1028
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,530
about this cesspool we call a city.

1029
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,032
"Unmask"?

1030
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,034
Yes.

1031
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,970
Let's do it together, okay?

1032
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:51,040
I've been trying to reach you.

1033
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,676
You're part of this, too.

1034
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,578
How am I a part of this?

1035
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,279
You'll see.

1036
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,948
[officer] Hey, Chief. You better take a look at this.

1037
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,283
[Riddler on stream] Say hello to my followers.

1038
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,785
We're live.

1039
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,654
They're here to watch our little trial.

1040
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,190
At the moment,

1041
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:11,694
the man across from you, Mr. Colson,

1042
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:12,995
is dead.

1043
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,630
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?

1044
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,965
-This psycho's gonna kill me! -But wait a minute...

1045
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,433
[shouting] Shut up!

1046
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,035
You deserve to be dead after what you did!

1047
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:22,104
You hear me?

1048
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,906
[softly] Okay.

1049
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,709
[Riddler groaning comically]

1050
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,378
[Riddler laughing]

1051
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,250
[Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.

1052
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,187
No one ever gave me a chance.

1053
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,991
Now,

1054
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,660
ever since I was a child,

1055
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,998
I've always loved little puzzles.

1056
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,400
For me, they are a retreat

1057
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,937
from the horrors of our world.

1058
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,239
Maybe they can bring

1059
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,975
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.

1060
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,445
-You want me to do puzzles? -[chuckles excitedly]

1061
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,314
Three riddles in two minutes.

1062
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,949
You give me the answers,

1063
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,452
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

1064
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,987
-Do you understand? -Yeah.

1065
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,190
Okay, okay. So I just...

1066
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,691
-You want me to... -[device beeps]

1067

-[whimpers] -Riddle number one...

-[timer beeping] -"It can be cruel,

1070

"but when it's denied, it's violence you may find."

1071
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,838
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

1072
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:29,972
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

1073
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,373
-"Justice." -Huh?

1074
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,508
The answer's "justice."

1075
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,009
-Justice? -Yes!

1076
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:35,478
-Oh, God. -Justice!

1077
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,214
[dramatically] And you were supposed to be

1078
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,882
an arm of justice in this city,

1079
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,451
along with the late mayor and police commissioner,

1080
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,920
were you not, Mr. Colson?

1081
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:46,355
Of course, of course.

1082
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,524
- Of course. -Riddle number two.

He's asking you how much it cost

-How much? -Nothing!

-[raises voice] How much? -Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1093
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,146
I get a monthly payment

1094
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,447
just not to prosecute certain cases.

1095
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,815
-What cases? -He didn't ask me that!

-Come on! Ten grand. -[Riddler laughing]

That's my answer. It's ten grand!

Okay. Okay. Okay.

1099
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,156
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.

1100
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:24,293
Just one more to go before your time runs out.

-"Which vermin"? -[Batman] The rat.

-He's gonna kill you. -I'm a dead man either way.

You're talking to a dead man, okay?

1111
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,051
If I go out this way, it's just me.

1112
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,288
But if I give over that name, I have family, people I love.

1113
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,622
-He'll kill them, too. -Who will?

-People are watching. -What people?

1115

It's so much bigger than you could ever imagine.

He interfered in an active hostage situation.

Maybe it's on yours.

What'd you say?

1141

He would rather die than talk.

What was he afraid of?

1143

You have any idea what kind of trouble you're in?

That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."

Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

You think Penguin's the rat?

His club caters to the mob.

Maroni practically lived there.

1204
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,105
Penguin would have been privy to a lot of dirt.

1205

DA was a regular, too.

1206
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,108
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam

1207
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,911

The cipher in the maze.

It means "a rat with wings." Like a stool pigeon.

A penguin's got wings, too.

What about the Riddler? He's gonna kill again.

why he looked at me the way he did.

Then one night, my mother told me who he was.

When I was seven, my mother was murdered.

Anyway, social services came to take me away,

01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:13,313
That reporter business?

1658
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:15,749
What do you want to know here, kid?

1659
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:18,552
Did you kill him? For my father?

1660
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:22,256
Look, your father was in trouble.

1661
01:44:22,322 --> 01:44:24,124
This reporter had some dirt.

1662
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:26,760
Some very

1663
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:29,529
personal stuff about your mother,

1664
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:30,931
her family history.

1665
01:44:30,998 --> 01:44:32,499
You know, everybody's got their dirty laundry,

1666
01:44:32,566 --> 01:44:33,867
that's just how it is.

1667
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,135
But he didn't want none of it coming out,

1668
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:37,404
not right before the election.

1669
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:39,606
And your father tried to pay the guy off,

1670
01:44:39,673 --> 01:44:41,675
but he wasn't going for it.

1671
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:43,243
So...

1672
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:44,678
he came to me.

1673
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:47,447
Well, I never seen him like that.

1674
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,550
He said, "Carmine,

1675
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:55,589
"I want you to put the fear of God in this guy."

1676
01:44:57,724 --> 01:45:00,861
And when fear isn't enough...

1677
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:02,996
Oof. Hmm.

1678
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:07,968
Your father wanted me to handle it, so I did.

1679
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:10,837
I handled it.

1680
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:13,740
I know.

1681
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,410
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1682
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:19,279
But you'd be surprised

1683
01:45:19,346 --> 01:45:21,648
what even a good man like him

1684
01:45:21,715 --> 01:45:24,584
is capable of in the right situation.

1685
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,355
Do me a favor.

1686
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:30,657
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1687
01:45:31,224 --> 01:45:32,893
This reporter

1688
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,228
was a lowlife.

1689
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:36,863
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1690
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:40,600
-Maroni? -Oh, yeah.

1691
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:44,738
He could never stand your father and I had history.

1692
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:47,107
And... And after what happened with that reporter,

1693
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,775
Maroni was worried

1694
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:51,511
that your father would be in my pocket

1695
01:45:52,112 --> 01:45:53,580
forever.

1696
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:55,682
He would have done anything

1697
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:58,085
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1698
01:45:58,151 --> 01:45:59,619
You understand?

1699
01:46:00,587 --> 01:46:01,922
Are you saying

1700
01:46:01,988 --> 01:46:05,225
Salvatore Maroni got my father killed?

1701
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:07,527
Do I know it for a fact?

1702
01:46:09,663 --> 01:46:11,932
I'm just saying, it sure looked that way to me.

1703
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:15,469
This is what you wanted, huh?

1704
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:18,305
This little conversation here?

1705
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:20,340
[exhales ruefully]

1706
01:46:20,407 --> 01:46:22,743
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1707
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:27,547
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1708
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:32,686

[sighs]

1713
01:47:37,117 --> 01:47:38,552
You lied to me...

1714
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:42,923
my whole life.

1715
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:50,096
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1716
01:47:52,766 --> 01:47:56,203
He told me what he did for my father.

1717
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:01,908
About Salvatore Maroni.

1718
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:06,379
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1719
01:48:06,446 --> 01:48:08,248
Had my father killed.

1720
01:48:10,617 --> 01:48:12,986
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1721
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:20,660
All these years I've spent fighting for him,

1722
01:48:20,727 --> 01:48:23,096
believing that he was a good man.

1723
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,332
He was a good man.

1724
01:48:25,398 --> 01:48:26,967
You listen to me.

1725
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:30,770
Your father was a good man.

1726
01:48:34,274 --> 01:48:36,409
-He made a mistake. -A "mistake."

1727
01:48:36,476 --> 01:48:38,411
He had a man killed.

1728
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,680
Why?

1729
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:44,084
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1730
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:46,152
His political aspirations?

1731
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:47,787
It wasn't to protect the family image,

1732
01:48:47,854 --> 01:48:50,056
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1733
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:54,661
He was protecting your mother.

1734
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:58,565
He didn't care about his image or the campaign, any of that.

1735
01:48:58,632 --> 01:49:00,934
He cared about her

1736
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:02,269
and you,

1737
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:05,005
and in a moment of weakness, he turned to Falcone.

1738
01:49:05,071 --> 01:49:09,476
But he never thought Falcone would kill that man.

1739
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,044
Your father should have known

1740
01:49:11,111 --> 01:49:12,879
that Falcone would do anything

1741
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:16,182
to finally have something on him that he could use.

1742
01:49:16,249 --> 01:49:18,051
That's who Falcone is.

1743
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,589
And that was your father's mistake.

1744
01:49:22,656 --> 01:49:24,591
But when Falcone told him what he'd done,

1745
01:49:24,658 --> 01:49:28,094
your father was distraught.

1746
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:31,531
He told Falcone he was going to the police,

1747
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:33,934
that he would confess everything.

1748
01:49:35,335 --> 01:49:37,337
And that night,

1749
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:40,173
your father and your mother

1750
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,341
were killed.

[soft music playing]

1752
01:49:46,713 --> 01:49:48,682

[smacks lips]

Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1755
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:04,864
Or maybe it was some random thug on the street

1756
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,499
who needed money, got scared,

1757
01:50:06,566 --> 01:50:07,834
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1758
01:50:07,901 --> 01:50:10,937
If you don't think I've spent every day

1759
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:13,173
searching for that answer...

1760
01:50:14,574 --> 01:50:19,145
It was my job to protect them. Do you understand?

1761
01:50:19,212 --> 01:50:21,348
I know you always blamed yourself.

1762
01:50:21,414 --> 01:50:23,950
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1763
01:50:25,885 --> 01:50:28,288
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1764
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,992
but I didn't know how to help.

1765
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:35,829
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1766
01:50:35,895 --> 01:50:38,632
but I wasn't equipped to take care of you.

1767
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:40,767
You needed a father.

1768
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:45,071
And all you had was me.

I'm sorry.

Don't be sorry, Alfred.

I never thought I'd feel fear like that again.

1773
01:51:10,096 --> 01:51:12,365
I thought I'd mastered all that.

I'm not afraid to die.

I realize now there's something

I haven't got past.

of ever going through any of that again.

-What did Mitchell tell you? -[Annika] No, nothing. He...

But first, I gotta know...

01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:07,207
-What did he tell you? -[Annika] He...

1818
01:54:07,273 --> 01:54:11,344
He just said they all made a deal with you.

01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:16,015
The deal.

1821
01:54:16,082 --> 01:54:17,617
[Annika] He said

1822
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:21,020
you gave some information on some drops thing,

1823
01:54:21,087 --> 01:54:23,656
and that's how he became mayor.

1824
01:54:23,723 --> 01:54:26,426
He said you were a very important man.

1825
01:54:26,492 --> 01:54:27,594
[Falcone] Right.

1826
01:54:28,361 --> 01:54:29,629
Mm-hmm.

1827
01:54:30,597 --> 01:54:32,999
Hmm. Okay.

-[Falcone] Just take it easy. -[Annika choking]

1831
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:43,276
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1832
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:46,579
[Falcone] Take it easy.

1833
01:54:48,414 --> 01:54:49,549
[recording stops]

1834
01:54:55,755 --> 01:54:57,190
Rata Alada.

1835
01:55:01,995 --> 01:55:03,830
A falcon has wings, too.

1836
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:05,965
Falcone is the rat?

1837
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:20,513
Falcone works for you guys?

1838
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,216
The mayor? The DA?

1839
01:55:26,052 --> 01:55:27,720
No. [breathing shakily]

1840
01:55:30,156 --> 01:55:31,591
We work for him.

1841
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:33,793
Everybody does.

1842
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:34,928
How?

1843
01:55:34,994 --> 01:55:37,163
Through Renewal.

1844
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:38,531
Renewal is everything.

1845
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:40,667
-The Renewal Fund? -[Kenzie] Yeah.

1846
01:55:40,733 --> 01:55:41,968
After Thomas Wayne died,

1847
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:44,370
they all went after it like vultures.

1848
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:48,141
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni. Everyone got in on it.

1849
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:50,476
It was perfect for making bribes,

1850
01:55:50,543 --> 01:55:51,644
laundering money.

1851
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:53,680
A huge charitable fund with no oversight.

1852
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:55,581
Everybody got a piece.

1853
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:57,517
But Falcone wanted more.

1854
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:02,655
So he orchestrated a play to take Maroni down big.

1855
01:56:03,923 --> 01:56:06,392
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1856
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:09,295
make the careers of everybody that went after him,

1857
01:56:09,362 --> 01:56:11,664
then install them all as his puppets.

1858
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:14,567
You think this goddamn election matters?

1859
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:18,638
Falcone's the mayor.

1860
01:56:18,705 --> 01:56:21,307
He's been the mayor for the last 20 years.

1861
01:56:21,374 --> 01:56:23,376
Come on, Vengeance.

1862
01:56:23,443 --> 01:56:26,012
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1863
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:27,513
This creep too. Let's finish this.

1864
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:28,648
-Oh, God! -No!

1865
01:56:28,715 --> 01:56:30,016
[gun clatters]

1866
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,718
We'll get him.

1867
01:56:31,784 --> 01:56:33,953
-But not that way. -There is no other way!

1868
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:37,090
-He owns the city! -Cross that line,

1869
01:56:37,156 --> 01:56:39,092
you'll become just like him.

1870
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:40,793
Listen to me.

1871
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,762
Don't throw your life away.

1872
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:50,670
Don't worry, honey.

1873
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,074
I got nine of 'em.

1874
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:57,377
-[screams] -[Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!

1875

[Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]

1876
01:57:09,288 --> 01:57:10,790
[Gordon] She won't get out of there alive.

1877
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:13,126
And if she kills Falcone, we may never find the Riddler.

1878
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:15,495
-I have to stop her. -Don't you mean "we"?

1879
01:57:16,763 --> 01:57:18,598
I gotta do this my way.

1880
01:57:18,664 --> 01:57:19,665
And then what?

1881
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:22,468
We do what Riddler said.

1882
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:24,437
Bring the rat into the light.

Can you tell Mr. Falcone I'd like to come up?

1886
01:58:02,275 --> 01:58:04,277
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1887
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:05,812
Tell him it's about Annika.

1888
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:11,050
Hey!

1889
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:12,585
Look who it is, huh?

1890
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:14,921
-Sorry to bother you. -Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1891
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:17,190
I was just hoping I could talk to you for a minute?

1892
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:18,825
Absolutely.

1893
01:58:20,626 --> 01:58:21,627

I... I don't know where she is.

1900
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:57,663
And I know that you're a very important man.

1901
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:00,700
I was hoping that maybe you could help me find her...

-I'm sorry. [sniffling] -It's okay.

-I'm so sorry. -I understand. Here.

I really think you're gonna want to see this.

[Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.

they all made a deal with you.

He told you about that, huh?

you gave some information on some drops thing,

and that's how he became mayor.

1929

[Falcone] Right.

Now, when the time arrives, I will already be unmasked.

We need to sweep the building for explosives

02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:35,732
[woman speaks indistinctly]

2479
02:39:35,799 --> 02:39:37,701
[helicopter blades whirring]

2480
02:39:39,169 --> 02:39:41,104
[Bruce] I'm starting to see now.

2481
02:39:42,472 --> 02:39:44,808
I have had an effect here...

2482
02:39:46,677 --> 02:39:48,812
but not the one I intended.

2483
02:39:50,914 --> 02:39:54,151
Vengeance won't change the past,

2484
02:39:55,419 --> 02:39:57,921
mine or anyone else's.

2485
02:40:00,257 --> 02:40:02,292
I have to become more.

2486
02:40:05,362 --> 02:40:07,931
People need hope.

2487
02:40:07,998 --> 02:40:10,400
To know someone's out there for them.

2488
02:40:14,004 --> 02:40:15,939
The city's angry,

2489
02:40:16,673 --> 02:40:18,175
scarred,

2490
02:40:19,109 --> 02:40:20,310
like me.

2491
02:40:22,412 --> 02:40:25,716
Our scars can destroy us.

2492
02:40:25,782 --> 02:40:28,752
Even after the physical wounds have healed.

2493
02:40:30,053 --> 02:40:32,055
But if we survive them,

2494
02:40:33,457 --> 02:40:35,359
they can transform us.

2495
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:39,196
They can give us the power

2496
02:40:39,963 --> 02:40:41,765
to endure...

2497
02:40:42,866 --> 02:40:45,168
and the strength to fight.

2498
02:40:47,904 --> 02:40:49,940
[reporter] We are live. As you can see,

2499
02:40:50,007 --> 02:40:52,909
the masked vigilante atop Gotham Square Garden,

2500
02:40:52,976 --> 02:40:54,378
helping to save the lives

2501
02:40:54,444 --> 02:40:56,413
-of hundreds of victims. -[Riddler moaning]

2502
02:40:56,480 --> 02:40:57,914
And now as first responders

2503
02:40:57,981 --> 02:40:59,349
desperately scramble to help the injured,

2504
02:40:59,416 --> 02:41:01,985
a mysterious masked man emerges,

2505
02:41:02,052 --> 02:41:04,521
heroically pulling the victims right through that skylight...

2506
02:41:04,588 --> 02:41:07,157
[man] Isn't that just terrible?

2507
02:41:08,458 --> 02:41:10,193
Him...

2508
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:14,798
raining on your parade like that? [tutting]

2509
02:41:18,935 --> 02:41:21,138
What is it they say?

2510
02:41:22,072 --> 02:41:24,408
"One day you're on top...

2511
02:41:25,842 --> 02:41:27,778
the next,

2512
02:41:28,879 --> 02:41:31,415
you're a clown."

2513
02:41:31,481 --> 02:41:33,216
[exhales ruefully]

2514
02:41:33,283 --> 02:41:34,418
Well...

2515
02:41:36,053 --> 02:41:38,922
let me tell you, there are worse things to be.

2516
02:41:38,989 --> 02:41:41,091
[Riddler weeping]

2517
02:41:41,158 --> 02:41:44,094
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

2518
02:41:45,328 --> 02:41:47,197
You did so well.

2519
02:41:51,601 --> 02:41:52,803
And you know,

2520
02:41:54,137 --> 02:41:57,507
Gotham loves a comeback story.

2521
02:42:07,551 --> 02:42:09,219
[Riddler] Who are you?

2522
02:42:09,286 --> 02:42:12,022
[man] Well, that's the question,

2523
02:42:13,190 --> 02:42:14,324
isn't it?

2524
02:42:17,427 --> 02:42:19,930
Riddle me this...

2525
02:42:21,998 --> 02:42:24,768
"The less of them you have,

2526
02:42:24,835 --> 02:42:28,905
the more one is worth."

2527
02:42:34,244 --> 02:42:36,046
A friend.

2528
02:42:38,482 --> 02:42:41,485
[laughing maniacally]

2529
02:42:44,755 --> 02:42:47,824
[both laughing maniacally]

2530
02:43:02,405 --> 02:43:03,874
-[Batman] You're leaving. -[gasps]

2531
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:05,208
[Selina] Jesus.

2532
02:43:06,943 --> 02:43:08,812
Don't you ever just say hello?

2533
02:43:11,014 --> 02:43:12,215
[cat meows]

2534
02:43:13,550 --> 02:43:15,085
Where will you go?

2535
02:43:16,486 --> 02:43:19,289
I don't know. Upstate.

2536
02:43:19,356 --> 02:43:21,124
Bludhaven, maybe.

2537
02:43:21,825 --> 02:43:23,026
Why?

2538
02:43:23,994 --> 02:43:25,362
You asking me to stay?

2539
02:43:32,202 --> 02:43:34,571
You know this place is never gonna change.

2540
02:43:34,638 --> 02:43:37,307
With Carmine gone, it's only gonna get worse for you.

2541
02:43:37,374 --> 02:43:39,409
There's gonna be a power grab.

2542
02:43:40,777 --> 02:43:42,078
It'll be bloody.

2543
02:43:42,579 --> 02:43:43,947
I know.

2544
02:43:45,582 --> 02:43:46,716
But the city can change.

2545
02:43:46,783 --> 02:43:48,151
It won't.

2546
02:43:49,019 --> 02:43:50,420
I have to try.

2547
02:43:50,487 --> 02:43:52,088
It's gonna kill you eventually. You know that.

2548
02:43:54,324 --> 02:43:55,425
Listen.

2549
02:43:57,794 --> 02:43:59,196
Why don't you come with me?

2550
02:43:59,963 --> 02:44:02,098
Get into some trouble.

2551
02:44:02,165 --> 02:44:03,967
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.

2552
02:44:04,034 --> 02:44:06,436
It'll be fun.

2553
02:44:06,503 --> 02:44:08,104
The bat and the cat.

2554
02:44:09,606 --> 02:44:11,341
It's got a nice ring.

Who am I kidding?

2557
02:44:27,290 --> 02:44:29,593
You're already spoken for.

[soft music playing]

2559
02:44:41,504 --> 02:44:42,973
You should go.

2561
02:44:56,186 --> 02:44:58,121
