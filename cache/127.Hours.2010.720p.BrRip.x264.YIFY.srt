1
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,780
Take it!

2
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,690
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

3
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,390
Hey, Aron. Sonja here, again.

4
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,940
I know that you're probably
gonna be away this weekend.

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,440
But listen, just think about
what we're gonna play. Please.

6
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,640
'Cause we have to decide, and we really...
We need to practice, okay?

7
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,970
Anyway, it will be fun. I promise.

8
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,780
And, oh, please call Mom. Please.

9
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,510
'Cause she worries, which you know already.

10
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,810
Okay. Later, A. Bye.

11
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,470
Whoa!

12
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,130
Hey! It's Friday night.

13
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,730
April 25, 2003.

14
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,430
I'm just entering Canyon-lands.

15
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,170
Just me,
the music and the night.

16
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,300
Love it!

17
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,250
Whoo!

18
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,750
Blue John Canyon.

19
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,990
Guidebook says four and a half hours
to the big-drop rappel.

20
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,000
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.

21
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,220
Whoo!

22
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,350
Your face.

23
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,390
- You looked like a dog.
- I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

24
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,500
I don't know.
I think we go that way.

25
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,560
But we went that
way and had to come back.

26
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,370
- Hey!
- Whoa.

27
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,900
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

28
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,140
Uh, no, actually. We're headed for the dome.

29
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,680
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

30
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,240
Hang on.

31
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,210
- Oh, my God.
- God.

32
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,890
Let's see this.

33
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,830
You are... here.

34
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,630
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,360
Oh, yeah. I knew that. I knew that.

36
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,770
And the dome is there.

37
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,140
Oh.

38
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,700
Um, I can take you that way if you like.

39
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,370
Uh...

40
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,310
I'm sorry. The, uh- Friday the 13th there.

41
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,710
Child-killer look.

42
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,040
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.

43
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,110
And today's Saturday, so...

44
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,980
Can't take this off. It's my face.

45
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,620
Nice.

46
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,330
- Aron.
- Kristi.

47
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,870
Allow me to introduce
you to my friend Megan.

48
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,770
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

49
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,400
What do you say?

50
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,500
You're lost. I'm a guide.

51
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,900
I'm good.

52
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,440
- Why not?
- Sure.

53
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,040
All right. This way.

54
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,710
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

55
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,590
What is that- like, 20 miles?

56
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,790
Seventeen on the odometer.

57
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh. Oh. I thought it was 17.2.

58
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,720
Uh, 17.3 actually.

59
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,930
Ah, you're one of those.

60
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,330
I'm not one of those.

61
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,630
Do you spend a lot of time out here?

62
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,800
It's my second home.

63
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Ah, see?

64
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,210
There's the fork right there.

65
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,410
Aah. Okay, totally missed that.

66
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,640
- Glad we bumped into you.
- Yeah.

67
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,810
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

68
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,380
Exactly. You go to the
one place in America...

69
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,120
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...

70
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,820
And what happens?

71
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,060
All right.

72
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,160
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

73
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,470
But I know a better way- the cool way.

74
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,270
Guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.

75
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,280
Although it's better with your clothes off.

76
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,040
It is a bit of a climb.

77
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,020
We climb.

78
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,060
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

79
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,220
So you get us all
the way back in here...

80
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,130
and then you tell us that
you are not a guide.

81
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

82
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,200
Oh, that's wonderful.

83
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,070
I've always wanted to be a supermodel...

84
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,910
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

85
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,100
Jesus, what if these things move?

86
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,740
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

87
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,310
- Oh, sure they will.
- What?

88
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,080
- Yeah. Everything's moving all the time.
- Oh!

89
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,810
Let's just hope not today.

90
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,650
Oh. Great.

91
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,890
All right.

92
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,830
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

93
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,530
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

94
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,430
- What...
- Where- Aron!

95
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,200
Are you okay? Aron!

96
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,260
Aron!

97
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,030
- Listen to the guy. He's fine.
- Yeah.

98
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,620
He's batshit.

99
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,670
You're batshit!

100
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,570
Come on! You gotta come down here!

101
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,730
- Trust me!
- Trust you?

102
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!

103
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,200
Oh, please. You love this.

104
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,380
Whoa!

105
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,420
Whoo!

106
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,590
Hey!

107
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,130
- Nice job!
- Oh, my God!

108
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,830
- Megan! You're missing it!
- Come on!

109
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,060
It's amazing!

110
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,570
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Just jump!

111
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,470
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan!

112
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,770
Fuck.

113
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,570
Oh, shit!

114
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,970
Are you okay?

115
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,540
- Nice jump.
- Oh, my God.

116
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,980
I can't believe I just did that.

117
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,980
- That's why we have to do it again.
- Again? Again?

118
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,620
- Camera! Camera!
- Camera? Camera!

119
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,680
Camera!

120
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,990
Whoo!

121
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,780
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John...

122
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,710
who was Butch Cassidy's cook...

123
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,880
- Ah. That's cool.
- from, you know, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

124
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,610
- The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
- Yeah.

125
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,990
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

126
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,650
But also what they'd do is they'd run horses...
wild horses- into here...

127
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,250
- and they'd trap 'em at the end of the canyons.
- Wow.

128
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,630
- That's how they'd catch the horses.
- Oh, wow.

129
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,430
You wanna take one more picture before I go?

130
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,990
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

131
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,400
Ready?

132
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,070
One, two, three.

133
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,270
Blue John. Blue Cheese.

134
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,330
Well, will I ever see you again?

135
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,680
That depends. Do you party?

136
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,980
Do I party? Uh, yeah, sometimes.

137
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,350
Tomorrow night, we're actually, seriously,
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

138
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,580
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

139
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,250
Okay. Where am I going?

140
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,050
It's about 20 miles away, near Green River.

141
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,390
You know the old motel? It's behind that.

142
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,930
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

143
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,520
- You can't miss it.
- Really? Okay.

144
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,460
- Yep. ...
Cool. - Okay.

145
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,030
It was good to meet you. See ya!

146
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,270
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

147
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,310
Yeah!

148
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,870
Rock on!

149
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,510
You think he's actually gonna show up?

150
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,950
I don't think we figured in his day at all.

151
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,180
Oh.

152
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,260
You liked him.

153
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,850
Shit!

154
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,940
This is insane!

155
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,930
Fuck.

156
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,970
Move this fucking rock!

157
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,890
Please.

158
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,520
Fuck.

159
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,790
Fucking save it.

160
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,850
Oh, God.

161
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,610
Kristi!

162
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,920
Megan!

163
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,480
Kristi!

164
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,260
It's Aron!

165
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,300
Megan!

166
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,000
Kristi! Megan!

167
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,160
Kristi!

168
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,590
Think.

169
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,580
Just think.

170
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,510
Ow!

171
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,220
Hmm.

172
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,920
Yeah.

173
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,830
Fuck.

174
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,360
Oh. Fuck.

175
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,390
Shit.

176
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,260
Oh, God.

177
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,460
Shit!

178
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,410
Fucker.

179
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,280
Come on. Please.

180
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,450
Sweet.

181
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,820
Ah.

182
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,190
Oh.

183
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,870
Nice and dull.

184
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,180
Look at the size of this one, man.

185
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,240
Like, how the fuck did this get here?

186
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,260
Yes.

187
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,710
Okay.

188
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,680
Hey!

189
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,890
Hey, buddy.

190
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,160
Here we go.

191
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,450
Um.

192
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,810
It's 3:05...

193
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,290
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

194
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,890
Uh, this marks 24 hours...

195
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,160
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon...

196
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,800
right where it slots up before the big drop.

197
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,000
My name's Aron Ralston.

198
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,340
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado.

199
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,710
Um.

200
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,350
Whoever finds this can keep the- the recorder.

201
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,720
Just please try
and get in touch with my parents...

202
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,660
and-and give them this tape.

203
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,290
I'd appreciate it.

204
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:16,100
Uh, I was descending Blue John yesterday...

205
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:22,510
uh, when this, uh, chockstone came loose...

206
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,130
and rolled onto my arm...

207
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,040
and now it's stuck.

208
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:32,920
Um, the thumb is kind
of this gray-blue color.

209
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,280
Yeah.

210
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,950
It's been without circulation for 24 hours.

211
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,190
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

212
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm low on food.

213
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,830
Um.

214
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,740
That's about 300, 400 mil...

215
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,910
and that's it for water.

216
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,850
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

217
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,220
Hello!

218
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,450
Please!

219
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,620
There's someone down here!

220
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,860
Help!

221
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm in the canyon!

222
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:25,630
Help!

223
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,370
Help! Help!

224
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,660
Please!

225
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,070
Help!

226
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,070
Help!

227
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,340
Down here!

228
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,810
Help!

229
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,260
Don't lose it.

230
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,830
Aron.

231
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,140
Do not lose it.

232
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,590
Not bad.

233
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,570
Oh, dinner.

234
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,180
Tomorrow night, we're actually,
seriously, throwing a party.

235
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,380
You should come by, have a beer, kick back.

236
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,050
There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

237
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,030
Scooby-Doo.

238
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,910
Hmm. Mountain Dew.

239
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,380
Plastic cup.

240
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,090
Thank you.

241
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,530
Oh.

242
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,930
Might take a beer as well.

243
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,570
Don't mind if I do.

244
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,380
Oh.

245
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,190
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

246
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,060
Aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.

247
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,040
Are you there?

248
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,880
Hello?

249
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,310
Okay. Nothing urgent.

250
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,750
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

251
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,380
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

252
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,510
- Where you going?
- Don't know yet.

253
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,610
Right there, Brion.

254
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,520
Maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.

255
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,950
Have a good one.

256
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,180
Always do.

257
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,050
Always do.

258
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,690
Let's go.

259
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,920
Oh, come on!

260
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,620
Crap.

261
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,190
This is freaking me out, looking at myself.

262
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,160
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

263
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,370
Uh.

264
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,040
It's Monday. Um.

265
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,710
Bummer, all day.

266
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,450
I tried to set up this pulley all morning...

267
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,080
but it didn't work.

268
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,090
It was worth a try.

269
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,920
But there's too much friction.

270
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,230
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

271
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,090
What I could really use...

272
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,040
is about 20 meters of
static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

273
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,300
Uh, three or four pulleys...

274
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,810
a rack of carabiners, a sling...

275
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,320
power drill... and bolt kit.

276
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,680
Oh, and, uh, eight burly men
to do all the hauling.

277
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,130
That should just about do it.

278
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,120
I have, uh...

279
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,030
about 150 milliliters of water left...

280
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,340
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...

281
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,440
if I'm lucky.

282
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,240
I peed twice.

283
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,720
Almost pissed my pants.

284
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,980
Uh, I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

285
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,230
The second time, I did it in the CamelBak.

286
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,300
Smells really bad.

287
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,500
But, uh, I'm sure it'll settle.

288
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,480
It's got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.

289
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,210
No number twos.

290
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,650
Which should disappoint my insect friends.

291
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,150
They'll just have to wait.

292
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,660
Let's see, what else could I tell you?

293
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,520
Um...

294
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,760
There's this raven that comes every morning.

295
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,940
Hey.

296
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,530
I clocked it at 8:17.

297
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,530
I'll- I'll film it for you tomorrow.

298
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,340
Every morning at, uh, 9:30...

299
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,910
I get 15 minutes of sunlight.

300
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,510
It's really nice.

301
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,560
I have been chipping away.

302
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,430
More to- More to keep warm than anything.

303
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,970
I'm beginning to think
that my hand is supporting the rock.

304
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,130
So when I chip away a little bit...

305
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,300
it actually settles more.

306
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,710
So...

307
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,380
I found this great tourniquet.

308
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,910
Oh.

309
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,950
Oh, yeah.

310
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,230
It hasn't been very useful.

311
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,740
Lesson:

312
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,980
Don't buy the cheap,
made-in-China multi-tool.

313
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,540
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but...

314
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,520
This thing came free with a flashlight.

315
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,580
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

316
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,220
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

317
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,820
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

318
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,600
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

319
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,210
And there's no way
you could have ever known...

320
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,110
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

321
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,770
When we watch this later,
will the camera have to be on?

322
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,510
Yeah. So you have to
leave the camera with us...

323
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,880
if we want to watch something
that you've made, right?

324
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,680
- Yeah.
- Good job, honey.

325
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,190
- Isn't that great?
- That is quite extraordinary.

326
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,160
- So he's filming her now.
- Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.

327
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,790
- Yes.
- We're seeing it now live...

328
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,700
but he's going to be
able to show this again.

329
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,000
Go away.

330
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,510
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a...

331
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,810
So good.

332
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,510
Well done. Okay.

333
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,550
Way to go, Sis.

334
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,180
- Keep playing?
- Yes, honey. Keep going.

335
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,710
Fuck.

336
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,670
Okay!

337
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,900
Go!

338
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,060
Whoo!

339
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,400
I love you.

340
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,360
So...

341
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
how do I get in?

342
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,210
What's the, um...

343
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,550
- You know?
- Combination.

344
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,820
Combination.

345
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,990
If I told you...

346
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,620
I'd have to kill you.

347
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,690
But already you kill me.

348
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,670
Combination?

349
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,760
I think I have it.

350
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,660
Fuck!

351
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,370
Ah, fuck.

352
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,220
Ah. Ah.

353
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,980
Fuck. Fuck.

354
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,260
Who's there?

355
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,110
Aron?

356
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,740
Please!

357
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,910
Please!

358
00:55:55,290 --> 00:56:00,630
Please!

359
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,900
Good morning, everybody out there. Steve.

360
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,470
- Good morning. 
- It's The Morning Show 
with Brian Stephenson...

361
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,140
Also coming up this half hour..

362
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,050
Good morning. This will
get you going today. 90 for your high...

363
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,010
Good morning, everyone!

364
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:28,390
It is 7:00 here in Canyonland, U.S.A.

365
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,190
And this morning on the boulder...

366
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,890
we have a very special guest...

367
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:38,560
self-proclaimed American superhero...

368
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,070
Aron Ralston!

369
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,700
Let's hear it for Aron!

370
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,000
Hey.

371
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,070
Hi. Oh, gosh. It's...

372
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,600
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,640
Um- Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?

374
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,850
Mom and Dad!

375
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,150
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

376
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,280
Yeah. That's right.

377
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,330
Uh- Hey, Mom.

378
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,230
I'm really sorry I...

379
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,990
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

380
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:13,660
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then...

381
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,730
Well, I probably wouldn't be here right now.

382
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,570
That's for sure!

383
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,300
But like I always say...

384
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,140
your supreme selfishness...

385
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,240
is our gain.

386
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,680
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

387
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,590
Um- Well, Brion at work.

388
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,320
- Hi, Aron!
- Hey.

389
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:35,360
Uh, I probably won't be
making it into work today.

390
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,090
Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.

391
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:46,000
We've got a question coming in
from another Aron...

392
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,510
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

393
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,040
Aron asks...

394
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,340
Am I right in thinking...

395
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,540
that even if Brion from work...

396
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,210
notifies the police...

397
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,550
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...

398
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,880
before they file a Missing Persons report?

399
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,090
Which means you won't become
officially missing...

400
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,290
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!

401
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,630
Ah, yeah.
You're right on the money there, Aron.

402
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,570
Which means I'll probably be dead by then.

403
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,340
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah. How do you know so much?

404
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,970
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

405
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,040
I volunteer for the rescue service.

406
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,050
Hmm?

407
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,950
You see, I'm something of a, uh...

408
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,450
well, a big fucking hard hero.

409
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:42,530
And I can do everything on my own, you see?

410
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,190
I do see.

411
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,420
Now...

412
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,900
is it true that despite...

413
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:56,500
or maybe because
you're a big fucking hard hero...

414
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,870
you didn't tell anyone where you were going?

415
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,040
Uh...

416
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,100
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

417
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,250
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

418
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,520
Oops!

419
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,490
Oops.

420
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,470
Oops.

421
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,910
Mom, Dad.

422
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,390
I just want to take this time to tell you...

423
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,120
that the times we've spent together
have been awesome.

424
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,430
And I haven't appreciated you in my heart...

425
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,490
as I know that I could.

426
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,610
Mom, I love you...

427
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,240
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

428
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,180
I love you guys...

429
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:18,190
and I'll always be with you.

430
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,460
Yeah.

431
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,780
Oh.

432
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,580
Ah.

433
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,890
Bone.

434
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:17,700
It's no Slurpee.

435
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,970
It's like a bag of piss.

436
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,450
- Yahoo!
- Nice!

437
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,100
Come on, Ralston!

438
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,670
Okay, I'm gonna go up again.

439
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,680
Give me that.

440
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,910
Quick, while he's gone.

441
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,810
- Listen.
- We could tell him.

442
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,610
- I know that.
- Okay? Tell him.

443
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,150
- We're very worried about you.
- 

444
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,190
- We're worried...
- About your music.

445
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,120
Your musical choices are really rough.

446
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:16,160
If you keep singing Phish,
you're never gonna get a girlfriend.

447
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:18,590
- Never.
- You might have one, but I really doubt that you do.

448
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,500
- You may be sort of cute, occasionally.
- I'm nervous and scared for you.

449
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:24,430
- Okay. This cannonball's for you.
- No one will care.

450
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,230
Okay.

451
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,110
That was a 10.

452
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,670
All right.

453
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,440
I'm going to test your theory...

454
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,850
about whether or not it's better to do it...

455
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,220
Oh, God!

456
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,810
without your clothes on.

457
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,880
I'm just gonna swim for a bit.

458
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,310
Don't.

459
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,750
No, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

460
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,480
Oh, please.

461
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,190
Don't.

462
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,890
Don't.

463
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,090
Ralston, rock on.

464
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,650
Whoo!

465
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,970
Oh, fuck.

466
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,570
You don't even
want me here, do you?

467
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,540
I'm gonna go, Aron.

468
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:31,480
Is that what you want?

469
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:37,350
It is, isn't it?

470
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,860
Okay.

471
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,330
Come back.

472
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:52,400
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

473
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:14,000
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50!

474
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,500
You hear that, Aron? I'm coming!

475
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,470
Um, I'm holding on.

476
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,110
Time's moving really slowly.

477
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,150
My heart's beating really fast.

478
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,940
I swear to God, it feels like...

479
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,250
- It feels like- - It's beating, like,
three times as fast as it should be.

480
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:43,920
So cold.

481
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,650
So cold.

482
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,670
Oh.

483
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,290
Hey.

484
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,770
Blue John.

485
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:03,300
I... love... you.

486
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,040
There you are.

487
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,480
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.

488
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,450
I've been thinking about you, girl.

489
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,180
I admit it. I admit it.

490
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,920
I know how I am. I tried to do everything.

491
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,190
- Where I was.
- I tried.

492
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,000
Aron? Where are you?

493
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:26,000
Where are you?

494
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,310
What are you guys doing here?

495
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,420
Eddie? Tom?

496
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:46,220
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

497
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,890
Eric? Hey.

498
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,860
You look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

499
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,030
Dorks.

500
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,260
Found you, Aron.

501
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,310
Sis, I'm sorry that I won't be at your wedding.

502
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:20,090
I know that I promised to play,
that we'd play.

503
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,750
I'm sorry.

504
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:24,600
I know it'll be a good one.

505
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,900
8:15. There's no raven.

506
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,300
8:20.

507
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,200
8:30. My raven didn't come.

508
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:39,570
I've been thinking.

509
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,570
Everything is...

510
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,710
- It just comes together.
- You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

511
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,950
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

512
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,250
Laters!

513
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,150
- It's me.
- Aron, it's Mom.

514
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,590
- I was hoping to catch you.
- I chose this.

515
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,920
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

516
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,220
I chose all of this.

517
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,560
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

518
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,430
This rock.

519
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:10,560
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

520
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,630
I hate this rock!

521
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,780
- In its entire life...
- ever since it was...

522
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,210
a bit of meteorite...

523
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,950
a million billion years ago...

524
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,680
How the fuck did this get here?

525
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,240
up there in space...

526
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,150
it's been waiting...

527
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,590
to come here...

528
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,860
right- right here.

529
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,360
I've been moving towards it my whole life.

530
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,100
The minute I was born,
every breath I've taken...

531
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,540
every action...

532
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:46,770
has been leading me to this crack...

533
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,010
on the earth's surface.

534
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,510
Oh!

535
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:43,280
Oh.

536
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,500
Oh. Oh.

537
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,530
Okay. Come on.

538
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,670
Don't pass out.

539
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,980
Don't fall asleep.

540
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,640
Thank you.

541
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,080
Easy.

542
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:03,350
Easy. Come on.

543
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,550
Oh!

544
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:29,430
Help!

545
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,970
Please!

546
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,940
Help me!

547
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,810
I need help!

548
01:25:57,330 --> 01:26:00,590
My name is Aron Ral- Aron Ralston.

549
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,860
This Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

550
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:05,990
I haven't had food or water for five days.

551
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,560
This morning I cut my arm...

552
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,440
This morning I cut my arm off.

553
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:14,540
Please. Some water?

554
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,810
Thank you.

555
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:30,890
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

556
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,760
You should stop and rest.

557
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,990
No. I've gotta keep going.

558
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:39,170
Can one of you run?

559
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,570
Can one of you run ahead?
