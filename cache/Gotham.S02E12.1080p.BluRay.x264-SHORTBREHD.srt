1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,673
<i>Bad guys in this town are changing.</i>

2
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,599
Hi.

3
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:23,942
Welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,737
The world sees criminal lunatics.
I see brilliance.

5
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,281
Theo Galavan, the new mayor of Gotham!

6
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,617
No! Mother.

7
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,119
<i>Any last words?</i>

8
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,704
<i>I am going to kill you.</i>

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,040
<i>They're going to pay
for what they've done.</i>

10
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello, Jim. Please step aside.

11
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,256
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

12
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:49,134
- You're under arrest.
- No! Tell me who killed them!

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,468
Hello, sleepyhead.

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,053
My mother was a saint!

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,264
A man with nothing to love is free.

16
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>Silver is bad news, Bruce.</i>

17
00:00:57,142 --> 00:01:01,354
What are you doing? Stop!
Malone! It's Malone. That's the name.

18
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,564
Goodbye, Silver.

19
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,899
Bruce, you can't do this. It isn't you.

20
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,152
<i>That's what you think.
But you're wrong.</i>

21
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:10,530
<i>You're right about my uncle.
He's everything everyone says.</i>

22
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,491
<i>I don't know how bad it's gonna get.</i>

23
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,452
There is no line. There's just the law.

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,620
<i>Jim, you see an abyss,
and you run toward it.</i>

25
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:19,038
I'm pregnant.

26
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,167
<i>We need every method at our disposal.</i>

27
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,128
<i>If there was ever a time for us
to work together, now is that time.</i>

28
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:26,546
<i>Gotham needs him dead!</i>

29
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:29,424
<i>Think of the greater good.
Think of Gotham.</i>

30
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,009
Goodbye, Jim Gordon.

31
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,183
After searching the premises,

32
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:42,353
I, along with Alfred Pennyworth
and Selina Kyle,

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,523
was able to locate the abductee,
Bruce Wayne.

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,691
Where was he?

35
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,276
Theo Galavan's residence.

36
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,236
- That's when you opened fire?
- Yes.

37
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:54,616
<i>We eliminated the threat posed
by Father Creel and his men,</i>

38
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,701
and were able to recover Bruce Wayne.

39
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,995
Sacrilege!

40
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:04,751
You then left to search
for Galavan on your own?

41
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,252
That's correct.

42
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,129
<i>Did you find him?</i>

43
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,380
Yes.

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,510
Theo Galavan, you're under arrest.

45
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,720
<i>- Did you detain Galavan?</i>
- No.

46
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,055
Why not?

47
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:24,062
Captain Barnes and Officer Vargas arrived
and placed me under arrest.

48
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,025
Jim. Jim! Put your gun on the ground
and put your hands on top of your head.

49
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,568
That's because at the time
of this incident,

50
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,904
some four weeks ago,
you were a fugitive from the law.

51
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,739
That was a misunderstanding.

52
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:39,661
What happened next?

53
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:44,165
Oswald Cobblepot
and two of his associates arrived,

54
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:47,043
<i>rendered Officer Vargas
and Captain Barnes unconscious.</i>

55
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:54,092
Cobblepot and his associates
escaped with Galavan.

56
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,763
Are you 100% sure that he won't beat this
and walk free again?

57
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:03,101
<i>You then pursued Cobblepot
and his men, correct?</i>

58
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,772
Yes, but I was unable to locate them.

59
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:11,067
You're a man of conscience, Jim.
You'll regret this.

60
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,737
I have many regrets.
This won't be top of the list.

61
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,740
At which point you decided
to flee the city

62
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,450
before law enforcement could question you?

63
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,619
<i>Yes. For that, I have no excuse,</i>

64
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,163
other than to say

65
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,749
I was concerned
for the safety of my fiancée.

66
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,130
She had informed me earlier that day
that she was pregnant.

67
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,007
Congratulations.

68
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:35,967
Thank you.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,265
Detective Gordon,
within hours of your encounter,

70
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:45,977
Theo Galavan was found beaten
and shot to death.

71
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,480
<i>Were you present
at the time of his murder?</i>

72
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,317
Oh, well. Here we are.

73
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,653
No, I was not.

74
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,614
Do you have any information
regarding the case

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,324
that you have not shared with us?

76
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,867
This is for my mother.

77
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:05,872
No, I do not.

78
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,084
Detective, did you have anything to do
with the murder of Theo Galavan?

79
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,592
<i>Detective, answer the question.</i>

80
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,263
Were you involved
in Theo Galavan's murder?

81
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,017
No, I was not.

82
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,533
Charges are lifted.

83
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,329
I'm cleared of all wrong-doing
and reinstated.

84
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,207
I knew they would see sense.

85
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,210
I didn't.

86
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,545
You told the truth.
What choice did they have?

87
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,047
Yeah.

88
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,096
Are you sure this is what you want?

89
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,098
After everything
this job has put us through?

90
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,976
Positive.

91
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,104
Then what's wrong?

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,189
Nothing. Long day.

93
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,108
Promise?

94
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,401
Promise.

95
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,322
Barnes.

96
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:22,907
Dent.

97
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,202
Captivating story.

98
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,954
Yes, it was.

99
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,165
Do you believe him?

100
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:37,797
I believe your investigation has found
no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

101
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,800
Careful. You're starting
to sound like a lawyer.

102
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:43,970
Any leads on Cobblepot?

103
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,932
His men have deserted him. He's all alone.

104
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,393
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

105
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,280
<i>It's now day 27 of the manhunt</i>

106
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,782
<i>for the crime lord, Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

107
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:05,950
<i>G.C.P.D. officers</i>

108
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,911
<i>continue to comb the city
in search of the man they say</i>

109
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:12,248
<i>killed controversial mayor Theo Galavan
in cold blood.</i>

110
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,626
<i>With public enemy number one on the lam,
the question remains,</i>

111
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,629
<i>just who is running Gotham's underworld?</i>

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,722
Take him away.

113
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,570
Hello, Butch.

114
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,660
Hey. How you doin'?

115
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,579
Your security stinks.

116
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,791
People are usually trying to get out
of this place, not in.

117
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,880
Why so glum?
You're the king of Gotham now.

118
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:05,218
I'm not glum. I'm just thinking.

119
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,053
I got a lot of responsibilities.

120
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,013
Not as much fun
as you thought it'd be, huh?

121
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,349
Yeah.

122
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,185
What do you want, anyway?

123
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,437
You got a lot of nerve showing up
after what you did to me.

124
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,730
Ooh.

125
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,066
Is that your mean face?

126
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:23,236
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

127
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,987
Maybe I will.

128
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,535
What I did for you, Butch,
is make you a free man.

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,412
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be king.

130
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,875
I bet that was your plan all along, huh?
You're just that fond of me.

131
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,797
Strangely enough,
I am kind of fond of you.

132
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,717
I mean, normally, I go for handsome,
intelligent men, not brutes,

133
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:52,306
but you have an amazing animal vitality
about you.

134
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,933
I'm smarter than I look.

135
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,476
Oh, you must be.

136
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:58,896
A funny lady.
What do you really want?

137
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,194
I wanna be your partner in crime.

138
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,573
Lonely, huh?

139
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,077
You and I would make a good team.

140
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,122
I'm not looking
for a relationship right now.

141
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,541
Honeybun, look at me.

142
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,631
We have history.

143
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,760
And you and I both know,
deep down in your heart,

144
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,512
that whatever I want,

145
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,973
you want.

146
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,237
<i>All units, all units,</i>

147
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,115
<i>reported armed abduction near
the 300 block of Kearny Avenue.</i>

148
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,410
<i>Any and all available officers
in the area, please respond.</i>

149
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,835
G.C.P.D.

150
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,587
Is there a problem, Officer?

151
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,672
There's been an abduction in the area.

152
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,216
How awful.

153
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,717
<i>Have you seen anything tonight?</i>

154
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,385
Anything out of the ordinary?

155
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,222
No. Can't say that I have.

156
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,432
Do you live in the area, sir?

157
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,643
- Not far.
- What's your address?

158
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:27,318
Well, what I mean to say,
I used to live in the area. I moved.

159
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,321
Would you open
the back of the van, please, sir?

160
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:32,907
Sure thing.

161
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,159
Happy to.

162
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,622
What the--

163
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,336
<i>Somebody get me a glass of water!</i>

164
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,883
<i>Hey! Mitch, separate those two.</i>

165
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:43,227
It's a good thing you're here.
We caught a weird one last night.

166
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,564
That's it? No hug? No kiss?
No welcome back?

167
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,482
You don't deserve these lips.

168
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,195
Way I see it, you finagled yourself
a month-long, paid vacation, you bastard.

169
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,740
Besides, Captain's pressing me
on this case.

170
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,408
Oh, yeah? What is it?

171
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,743
You didn't hear?

172
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,496
Last night, some psycho froze a cop
to death.

173
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,914
Froze her?

174
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,335
Yeah. Told you it was weird. Come on.
Nygma's waiting for us.

175
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,505
Frozen.

176
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,020
Interesting. It took nearly five seconds
to freeze this rose

177
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,022
- using liquid nitrogen.
- So?

178
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,107
Well, so, it'd take a human body
significantly longer,

179
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,276
depending on mass and body fat, of course.

180
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,446
So why would a cop stand around
for hours waiting to get frozen?

181
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,156
She wouldn't.

182
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,825
Which means your suspect
wasn't using liquid nitrogen.

183
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,620
He was using super-cooled liquid helium.

184
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,456
It's one of the most effective substances
in the world

185
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,208
for rapid temperature reduction.

186
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,710
This liquid helium, where do you get it?

187
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,295
Why do you need it?

188
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,797
He doesn't, dummy.

189
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,967
He just wants to know where it comes from
so we can track down the guy

190
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,260
that blasted our colleague with it.

191
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,975
I don't like
being called names, Detective.

192
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,146
Easy, Ed.
I'm sure Harvey was just being colorful.

193
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,439
Yeah.

194
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,151
I was just being colorful, Ed, I'm sorry.

195
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,531
It's extremely rare and expensive.

196
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,659
Can't imagine there's more
than one or two producers in Gotham.

197
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:24,286
I could research manufacturers,
if you would like.

198
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,831
That'll be really nice. Thank you, Ed.

199
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,504
You coming?

200
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,214
Uh, gimme a minute.

201
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,350
Listen, Ed, there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

202
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,601
- Penguin.
- Yes.

203
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,895
You want to know
the nature of my relationship with him.

204
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,147
Yes.

205
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,399
Because you're concerned I aided
and abetted a known criminal.

206
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,359
Did you?

207
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,781
I found Mr. Cobblepot wounded
and dying in the woods.

208
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,367
I nursed him back to health.

209
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:07,955
He owed me his life which is why I trusted
him when he said he had changed his ways.

210
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,207
It was an innocent mistake.

211
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,209
<i>Got him! We got him!</i>

212
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,711
Wonder what that is.

213
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,888
Silence!

214
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,309
What are you, a bunch of cheerleaders?

215
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,729
This is not a game! This is our job!

216
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,320
And this specimen,
this is just one sad, pathetic skell.

217
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,072
<i>There are plenty of scumbags out there.</i>

218
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,491
Plenty.

219
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,537
So stop waving your pom-poms
and go catch some!

220
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,583
Yes, stare all you want. Big whoop.

221
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,629
<i>- You got me. I'm cool.</i>
<i>- Get in there!</i>

222
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,714
It's all good.

223
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,221
I said I'd catch him, and I did.

224
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,430
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,517
Now we'll learn the truth
of what really happened to Galavan.

226
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,789
All right, Cobblepot.

227
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,299
Tell me what happened at Galavan's
that night.

228
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,302
Well, a lot of things happened.

229
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,179
Why don't you start with the moment

230
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,015
right after you knocked me out
with that vase.

231
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,727
I'm sorry for that.
Such an exquisite vase.

232
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,147
This is my amused look.

233
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,525
<i>Keep talking.</i>

234
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,527
I took Galavan to the river
and I killed him.

235
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,154
Slowly.

236
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,781
You confess to murder?

237
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,075
Yes, I do. Proud of it.

238
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,327
I'm not a criminal, you know.

239
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,039
I'm just insane.

240
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,003
- What did James Gordon do?
- What did he do when?

241
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,255
What did he do after you knocked me out?

242
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,673
What does he say he did?

243
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,758
I'm asking you.

244
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,818
You have something you wanna tell me?

245
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,238
No, sir.

246
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,246
Cobblepot backed your story.

247
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,249
You mean, he told the truth.

248
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,751
Yeah.

249
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,545
That's what I'm gonna choose to believe.

250
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,714
It's the right thing to do.

251
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,385
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back, sir.

252
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:13,057
Jim, I'm trusting you.
Don't make a fool out of me.

253
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,685
Yes, sir.

254
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,577
I was having a dream about you.

255
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,962
We were at that little red cabin
by the beach. Remember?

256
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,841
I remember. Six summers ago.

257
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,344
You looked like a movie star.

258
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,140
You look tired.

259
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,558
Work.

260
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,893
How's it coming?

261
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,898
Good. Good.
Slower than I'd like, but good.

262
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,483
Tell me.

263
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,779
I'm having trouble with reanimation.

264
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:57,244
I need to find the correct ratio of
liquid helium to glycerol cryoprotectant.

265
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,663
Now tell me what that means
in English, honey.

266
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,792
It means

267
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,795
I can freeze you, like we planned.

268
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,174
I can bring your temperature down
to 200 degrees below zero,

269
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,718
and I can stop this disease
from killing you.

270
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,136
But?

271
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,556
I can't bring you back.

272
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,312
Not yet. But I will.

273
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,066
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,401
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

275
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,863
I'm just thinking of all those poor mice
you're experimenting on.

276
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,117
They don't feel anything.

277
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,289
I just need more time. A little more time.

278
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,707
Hey.

279
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,169
I'll find a way. I promise.

280
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,307
- Got some good news and bad news.
- Good news.

281
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,768
Nygma did some digging and found
one company in all of Gotham

282
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,103
that makes liquid helium.
Wayne Enterprises.

283
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,897
- That's the good news?
- It's not,

284
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,983
but I thought bad news and more bad news
didn't have the same ring.

285
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,151
What's this?

286
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,904
Three abductions in the past month
all tied to a blue van,

287
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,948
same as our suspect's.

288
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,492
Three abductions? They find any of 'em?

289
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,993
Not a one.

290
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,622
Which makes you wonder what's this guy
doing with all those people.

291
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:32,214
Nora? I'm going to work for a few hours.
Knock if you need anything.

292
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,590
Okay.

293
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,639
Psst.

294
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,476
Psst.

295
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,020
- Ed?
- Shh.

296
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,980
Don't look at me.
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

297
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,110
You doing okay? You look kind of funky.

298
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,113
I confess I've felt better.

299
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,326
Is there anything I can do to help?

300
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,620
<i>I'm beyond help.</i>

301
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,289
Forget me, my friend.

302
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:52,878
But if you would take care
of my mother's grave,

303
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,630
I'd be very grateful.

304
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,886
If you'd visit occasionally,
tell her I'm thinking of her.

305
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,554
I will.

306
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,891
She likes lilies.

307
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,062
Occasional visits, lilies, check.

308
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,899
Thank you.

309
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,818
On your feet, Cobblepot.

310
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,781
What's going on? Where are you taking me?

311
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,325
Arkham. You are insane, right?

312
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,961
It is now Thursday,
February 21st, 2:44 p.m.

313
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:39,132
Test subject 014 is in his 40s,
appears to be in good health,

314
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,344
and shows no signs of damage sustained
during vitrification.

315
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:46,682
I'm now ready to commence
the reanimation experiment.

316
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,320
<i>You are correct.</i>

317
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,990
Wayne Enterprises does manufacture
liquid helium.

318
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,784
For years it was used
as part of our cryogenics program.

319
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,077
Cryo-whatics?

320
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,080
It's the branch of physics dealing
with the production and effects

321
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,790
of extremely low temperatures.

322
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,460
My understanding is that
there were some promising experiments

323
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,546
being carried out in the program.

324
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,256
But, alas, it was shut down.

325
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:20,841
When was that?

326
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,635
Two or three years ago.

327
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,931
Thomas Wayne killed it,
along with a few other odd programs.

328
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,433
Any idea why?

329
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,145
No idea. It was all kept very quiet.

330
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,189
Thanks, Lucius.

331
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,774
Detectives.

332
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:11,808
Penguin pie!

333
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,822
There seems to be some confusion.

334
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,035
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

335
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:34,164
Many of you, no doubt,
will have heard of me.

336
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,377
Some of you, clearly, have not.

337
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:44,883
For those poor ignorant souls,
I offer illumination.

338
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,470
I am not a man to be trifled with.
No.

339
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:56,895
I am powerful. I am vicious.
I'm King of Gotham.

340
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,193
I am King of Gotham!

341
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,571
I'm the King of Gotham!

342
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,533
I am! I am!

343
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,544
Look at me! I'm the King of Gotham!

344
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,048
I'm King! I'm King! Here ye, here ye!

345
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,245
The subject's core temperature
is now 39 degrees.

346
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,289
We are approaching the critical threshold.

347
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,300
41 degrees.

348
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,677
We hit 41 degrees.

349
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,930
Solution A14, I knew it would work,
I knew it!

350
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,266
Ha!

351
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,102
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

352
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,609
No.

353
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:29,738
No, no, no, no. Not again, please.
Not again, no.

354
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,434
<i>Nora?</i>

355
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,479
Breathe, Nora. I'm right here. Look at me.

356
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,566
Where's the formoterol?

357
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,419
That was the worst one yet.

358
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,510
That was the last pill.
Why didn't you tell me?

359
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:40,267
I'm sorry. I forgot. I have so many.
There's so many.

360
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:44,437
If you have another attack
and you don't have this medication,

361
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,023
you could die.
You can't let this happen again, Nora.

362
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,859
Why does it matter?

363
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,072
It matters.

364
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,206
I'll be back.

365
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,596
I need to get this refilled.

366
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,315
Next.

367
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,358
I need to get this refilled.

368
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,402
Do you have the prescription?

369
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:33,737
I have the bottle.

370
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,073
That's not the same thing, is it?

371
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,242
Please. I just need it refilled.

372
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:43,079
The original prescription
doesn't have a refill order.

373
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,874
If it doesn't have a refill order
I can't refill it.

374
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,171
This medication is for my wife.
She's sick. She's in pain.

375
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,717
Everyone that comes in here is sick
or in pain.

376
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:59,888
Have your doctor write a new prescription,
then I can refill it.

377
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,267
Just give me the medication.

378
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,648
- No.
- You son of a bitch!

379
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,442
Get out! Get him outta here!

380
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,111
Get outta here before I call the cops,
you kook!

381
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,492
You shouldn't have done that.
I'll be back.

382
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:32,962
Goodbye, Nigel.

383
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:38,385
Oh, and remember what I told you.
See no evil, do no evil.

384
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,304
Yes, sir. I will.

385
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,896
Mr. Cobblepot. My name is Hugo Strange.

386
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,651
Chief of Psychiatry here at Arkham Asylum.

387
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,945
Please come in.

388
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:07,831
<i>You're not listening.</i>

389
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,041
Maybe you should get a new hearing aid
while you're here.

390
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,334
Hey!

391
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:21,553
- Formoterol. Now!
- Okay. Okay.

392
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,014
Take it all.

393
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:29,811
Please, don't kill me. Please.
I'll do anything you want.

394
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,856
You and your friend here

395
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,443
are going to help save my wife.

396
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,694
No! No!

397
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,582
Excuse me!

398
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:52,876
Going to need some help out.

399
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,296
Yeah?

400
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,507
Our guy just hit a pharmacy on 9th.

401
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,179
<i>That's it.
Just slide him in there.</i>

402
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,390
Hey, careful.

403
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,061
Blue van.

404
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,734
- Go, get out of here.
- Thank you.

405
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,364
- Go, go, go, go!
- I got it, I got it!

406
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!

407
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,477
What is this, anyhow? Am I being punished?

408
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:54,062
No.

409
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:58,316
I make it a point to meet all new inmates.
It's part of the intake protocol.

410
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,778
Though I will ask you to refrain
from making speeches

411
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,114
atop cafeteria tables in the future.

412
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,617
I'll do my best.

413
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,703
How has your adjustment been so far?

414
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,873
Fine, I suppose.

415
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,251
Oh, come now, Oswald.

416
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:20,630
Periods of great transition
can bring on great stress.

417
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:24,717
Surely this must be a traumatic experience
for you.

418
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,387
Please.

419
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,103
This is a pillow fight
compared to what I've been through.

420
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,275
Yes. I have read
of your tribulations of late.

421
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:45,822
Attempts on your life,
having to survive being a fugitive.

422
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,914
The death of your mother.

423
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,630
Troubled times.

424
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,841
Is that your clinical diagnosis?

425
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:11,180
I know that if I were in your position,
I would be feeling some strong emotions.

426
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,351
Anger, grief, regret even.

427
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:17,687
For what?

428
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,025
The murder of Theo Galavan.

429
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:26,279
My mother died in my arms
because of Galavan.

430
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,657
The only thing I regret is that I couldn't
kill him more than once.

431
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,117
I see.

432
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:36,706
Perhaps we could pick it up
right there next time.

433
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:41,711
I so look forward to our work together.
And don't worry.

434
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,840
Here at Arkham, we have a number
of intensive treatment programs.

435
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:52,680
I am more than confident that we'll be
able to facilitate your rehabilitation.

436
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,768
My what?

437
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,978
Rehabilitation.

438
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,898
That's why you're here, after all.

439
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,233
To be cured of your sickness.

440
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:09,822
You are sick, aren't you?

441
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,992
Victor?

442
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,249
Victor?

443
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,086
Victor?

444
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:15,805
Honey? You down here?

445
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,685
Victor?

446
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,663
My God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

447
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,670
Surveillance system wasn't even on.
What's that?

448
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,964
Some witnesses saw our guy
throw this at the pharmacist.

449
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,674
It's probably his prescription bottle.

450
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,302
"Fries, Nora Fries." His wife, maybe?

451
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,845
Yeah, maybe, but it's "Fries."

452
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,805
- What do you mean?
- It's pronounced "Fries."

453
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,515
- How do you know?
- I'm really good with names.

454
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:02,643
Yeah, whatever. There's an address
on here. Come on, let's go.

455
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,655
G.C.P.D., we have a search warrant!

456
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,209
<i>Ma'am, don't move.</i>

457
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:28,920
Holy moly.

458
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,345
He told me they were mice.

459
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,852
Get her out of here.

460
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,189
Ms. Fries.

461
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,842
Nora.

462
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:49,208
You all right? Nigel?

463
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,923
See no evil, do no evil.

464
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,469
See no evil, do no evil.

465
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,306
No, no.

466
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,850
See no evil, do no evil.

467
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,483
We need to find your husband, Nora.

468
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,694
Before he hurts someone else.

469
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,195
I was asleep.

470
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:23,659
I woke up when I heard him leave.
That's all I can tell you.

471
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,080
If you don't cooperate, we'll be forced
to charge you with obstruction of justice.

472
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,834
You're going to jail, Nora.
You get that, right?

473
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:36,505
My husband did terrible things.

474
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,676
But he did those terrible things
for my sake.

475
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:46,390
I'm dying. He wants to save me.

476
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,686
<i>I can't tell you how sorry I am.</i>

477
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,856
But I can't betray him.

478
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,868
Oh, one more thing.

479
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,704
What's the correct pronunciation
of your last name?

480
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:10,998
It's Fries.

481
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,542
Fries. Thank you.

482
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,045
Told you.

483
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,594
Excuse me.

484
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,805
Yeah, what can I help you with?

485
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:11,058
I'd like to speak
with Detective Gordon, please.

486
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,351
What for?

487
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:15,062
I'd like to make a confession.

488
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,943
I'm the man that's been freezing people.

489
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,156
You too, huh?

490
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:29,201
That makes five in one night.
Must be a full moon.

491
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:32,705
Tell you what.
Why don't you have a seat with the others.

492
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,832
Detective Gordon,
he'll be out in a minute.

493
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:38,377
- No, no. You don't understand. I'm--
- I understand. Have a seat.

494
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,454
Huh.

495
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,501
Am I dead?

496
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,087
Hello?

497
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,425
Hello?

498
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,346
Am I dead?

499
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,058
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
- Take it easy, come on! Down!

500
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,560
A16. It worked.

501
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:38,437
Go get a blanket.

502
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:40,523
I can't believe it worked.

503
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,359
All right. I got him.

504
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:44,819
I got him.

505
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,738
<i>You? You!</i>

506
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,830
I'm coming for you, Nora.
I'm coming to save you.

507
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:33,909
New inmate Oswald Cobblepot exhibits signs
of extreme narcissism and megalomania.

508
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,329
Also seems to have had
a rather unhealthy relationship

509
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,999
with his deceased mother.

510
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:44,920
Treatments will include immersive aversion
therapy and radical psychotropics.

511
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,854
How are we this evening, Ms. Peabody?

512
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:05,232
Busy. The formaldehyde pump in silo F
needs replacing.

513
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:09,778
Our young lady arsonist refuses
to co-operate with our experiments.

514
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,199
And I had to reschedule your appointment
with Councilman Carter.

515
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,284
- Again?
- It's the third time.

516
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,536
- How very rude.
- Indeed.

517
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,206
And there's this.

518
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,792
Seems someone has solved the problem
of post-cryonic reanimation.

519
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,712
Nonsense.
I'm still years from solving that.

520
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:32,426
Fascinating.

521
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:36,680
Do you realize what this could mean
for our program? Who is this man?

522
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:38,974
His name is Victor Fries.

523
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:42,019
But the newspapers have already
given him a nickname.

524
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:46,815
Hello, Mr. Freeze.

525
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:32,528
English SDH
