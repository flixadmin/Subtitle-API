1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,800
I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,460
Is there any man here named Shelby?

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,340
I am planning an expansion.
Onto the racetracks.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,300
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,620
Nobody works with me.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,660
People work FOR me.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,020
'Danny, you are a good man
and a good soldier.'

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,780
Yes, Sergeant Major.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,580
Freddie Thorne is at the very top
of my list.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,660
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to this city.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,220
We're not going anywhere, Ada.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,100
We are going to stay here
and we'll marry here, with our baby.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,340
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,300
Thomas, you sell those guns
to anyone who has use for them,

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,460
you will hang.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,940
Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,740
No.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,300
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning,
middle and end of your mission.

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,940
So what shall I do?

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,020
You must do everything you can
to get close to him.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,900
Dig out a nice dress.

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,620
I want to take you to the races.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,180
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,980
Already broken.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:14,020
This programme contains some violent
scenes and some strong language.

26
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,580
Give me a bottle of whiskey
and three glasses please.

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,260
Scotch or Irish? Irish.

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,460
I've decided not to go.

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,260
To the races.

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,980
Not unless you give me two pounds,
ten shillings towards the dress.

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,660
I've already given you three.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,940
How much did you pay for the suit
you'll be wearing?

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,900
Oh, I don't pay for suits.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,740
My suits are on the house
or the house burns down.

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,180
So you want me to go
looking like a flower girl?

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,100
What I want makes no difference.

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,540
It's not me you're dressing up for.

38
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,630
Subtitles by s}http://UKsubtitles.ru.{c}

39
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,900
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby,
if I indulge a little.

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,980
Please.

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,300
It takes a lot for a man
from Sparkbrook

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,540
to step inside this pub.

43
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,740
Anyone with money
and good intentions

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,260
is welcome in the Garrison.

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,460
Now... you said you had business.

46
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,380
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.

47
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,860
It's a question of who knows what
about what.

48
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,660
It concerns the factory
down the road, at the BSA.

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,180
As you might know,

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,220
most of the paint shop there
is Irish.

51
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,500
Big old place like that,
rumours get started.

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,380
Rumours that there was a robbery.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,820
Robbery of what?

54
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,540
Guns, Mr Shelby.
A serious amount of guns.

55
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,620
What business is that of mine?

56
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,900
When it comes to speculation,
you can't beat a factory night shift.

57
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,540
Some say there was word
from the proofing bay

58
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,500
it was the Peaky Blinders
who took them.

59
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,540
Your night shift must be dreaming.

60
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,660
Maybe they are.
Maybe they're not.

61
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,740
What we are trying to say is,
Mr Shelby,

62
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,340
that if you were to hear about
the whereabouts of said items...

63
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,220
..we'd pay good money.

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,540
You have good money?
We have collections from the pubs.

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,460
For who do you speak?

66
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,380
The people of Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army.

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,700
For a fact?
For a fucking fact.

68
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,820
You think we're jokers?

69
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,900

I thought you only allowed singing

86
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,940
Whiskey is good proofing water.

87
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,060
It tells you who's real
and who isn't.

88
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,820
And what did my countrymen want?

89
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,940
They're nobodies.

90
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,260
They drink in The Black Swan
in Sparkbrook.

91
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,100
They're only rebels
because they like the songs.

92
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,220
You have sympathies with them?

93
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,380
I have no sympathies
of any description.

94
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,700
Their accents were so thick,

95
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,740
it's a wonder you could
understand them.

96
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,180
Next time, I could translate.
You'd work for me?

97
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,780
I thought I already was.
So you are coming to the races?

98
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,860
Two pounds, ten shillings.

99
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,260
Ten shillings.

100
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,540
Buy something red.

101
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,060
To match his handkerchief.

102
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,500
Whose handkerchief?

103
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,660
Ada, what the hell?

104
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,620
I dared myself to run through
their territory in my dress.

105
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,580
Are you mad? Yeah.
Mad as hell with all of them.

106
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,700
I love you.

107
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,820
I love you too.

108
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,980
The more they try to stop us,
the madder I'll be.

109
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,260
Come on, princess,
the vicar's waiting. Wait...

110
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,900
How do I look?

111
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Like an angel.

112
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,140
Moss?

113
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,540
What do we know about
The Black Swan?

114
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,020
An operative has provided
intelligence

115
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,860
that it is a place
where IRA men gather.

116
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,260
It's just a lot of drunken navigators
singing songs, sir.

117
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,660
The IRA wouldn't go near them.

118
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,340
Then why are two of them
looking to buy guns?

119
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Do you have names?

120
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,100
Must she do everything for you?

121
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,420
"She", sir?

122
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,620
One female operative
has proved more useful

123
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,220
than any of you great lumps of men.

124
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,620
We are regular police officers, sir.
Not spies.

125
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,460
We can only act
when a crime has been committed.

126
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,580
Perhaps I should send some men down
to The Black Swan to ask questions.

127
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,820
And scare them all into hiding?

128
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,060
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.

129
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,980
My tactics come from my experiences
in France.

130
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,180
Most of my great lumps of men
served in France too, sir.

131
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,020
I serve my country every day.

132
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,300
That will be all, Sergeant.

133
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,900
Away and shite!

134
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,260
Fancy me, do ya?

135
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,300
What are you? A copper?

136
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,100
Oh!

137
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Proddy bitch!

138
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,540
I've seen you. I've seen your face,
serving in the Garrison.

139
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,940
Come here...

140
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,300
I am taking you in for interrogation
on behalf of the Irish Free State.

141
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,460
All right?

142
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Are you armed?

143
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,260
No.

144
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,020
Then I'll tell you.

145
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,300
Ada and Freddie Thorne
were married today.

146
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,100
They defied your orders,
they haven't left the city.

147
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
I'll deal with it.

148
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,220
Thomas... I'll deal with it.

149
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,620
Where are they?

150
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,580
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?

151
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,940
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?

152
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,740
Would it be so bad if they stayed?

153
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,860
I promised I'd run Freddie
out of town.

154
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,260
Promised who?

155
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,420
I told the coppers
Freddie wouldn't come back.

156
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,900
It's part of the deal.

157
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,500
What bloody deal?

158
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,540
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?

159
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,260
If you let me deal
with Ada and Freddie,

160
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,420
it'll end in peace.

161
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,220
Christ knows
you've had your fill of war.

162
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,540
You get Freddie out of town, Poll.

163
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,460
Or else I'll deal with it myself.

164
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,580
The victim had been drinking
in The Black Swan pub, sir -

165
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,780
the pub you told me about.

166
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,060
And a neighbour said
she saw a young woman

167
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
leaving the street
where the body was found.

168
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,140
A woman, sir. I was wondering
if there was a connection.

169
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,100
A connection with what, Sergeant?

170
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,580
You said your spy was a woman, sir.

171
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,020
I wondered if now there was now
a policy.

172
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,460
Shoot to kill.
Like there was in Belfast.

173
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,500
The Republicans
are famously factional.

174
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,660
He was killed by one of his own.

175
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,380
That will be all, Sergeant.

176
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,500
And they're not called spies.

177
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,300
They're called operatives.

178
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,580
Operatives, sir. Right, sir.

179
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,620
It's how you say things. Yeah...

180
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,780
What the bloody hell
is she doing here?

181
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,380
ã200, Freddie.

182
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,340
For what?

183
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,500
For us. For a honeymoon
that goes on for ever.

184
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,100
Where did it come from?
Family fund.

185
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,300
The pockets of widows
and desperate men.

186
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,980
See sense, Freddie.

187
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,940
Tommy is not going to let this rest.

188
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,540
Times like these, a communist
in the family is bad for business.

189
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,380
You have to leave the city.

190
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,340
You think I can't handle
Tommy Shelby? You can't.

191
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm having trouble these days
and I'm twice the man you are.

192
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,260
I went into town.

193
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,820
The Cunard office.

194
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,620
I booked you both tickets
on the next boat

195
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
from Liverpool to New York.

196
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,500
America, Freddie.

197
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,020
They've already had
their revolution.

198
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,380
You won't have to bother.

199
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,740
Will you ladies at least
let a man sleep on it?

200
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,460
You had no business...

201
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,860
Observe and report.
That is your remit.

202
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,460
I decided we needed
to know where he lived.

203
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,940
I warned you not to let
your personal history

204
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,380
cloud your judgment.

205
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,180
You went after him
because he was IRA.

206
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,660
I followed him because I thought
he might have information.

207
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,420
According to the rules,

208
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,660
I should pull you out of
Garrison Lane immediately.

209
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,060
No. Cheltenham is tomorrow.

210
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,900
You take too much upon yourself.

211
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,060
This is an active military mission -
your words.

212
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,940
I'm doing my job.

213
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,940
Grace, the death of a base Fenian
doesn't concern me.

214
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,660
Your welfare does.

215
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,140
Killing a man affects the heart.

216
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,900
And as for my heart...

217
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,580
I know that because of
our family connections,

218
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,460
you take my progress personally.

219
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,820
But I don't need you
to be my father.

220
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,580
I will be thinking of you.

221
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,860
Mr Shelby, sir. Mr Zhang.

222
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,020
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.

223
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,100
I know.

224
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,980
Please, gentlemen.
No fighting in here.

225
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,540
It's all right. I come as a friend.

226
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,860
You're collecting your suit
for Cheltenham - it's very nice.

227
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,540
How the bloody hell do you know?
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.

228
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,020
And as I told you before,
I know the Lee brothers.

229
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,700
And I know they're going to be
at the Cheltenham races as well.

230
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,900
They're going to lose a lot of money
on fast women and slow nags.

231
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,980
No. They're planning on showing up
in numbers and robbing your bookies.

232
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Running chalk and rafflers.

233
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,140
You think I can't handle the Lees?

234
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,940
Just a word of warning
from a friend. That's all.

235
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,940
I'll see you at Cheltenham.

236
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,180
I'll wave at you from my box.

237
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,380
If you're coming to the races,
bring that pretty barmaid of yours.

238
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,060
Already invited.

239
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,580
Comrades -

240
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,940
as you know, to even gather
like this today is illegal.

241
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,740
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered
that we are not allowed to assemble

242
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,860
in groups of more than three people.

243
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,380
So, to comply with the law,

244
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,980
please now clump together
in groups of three.

245
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,820
You hear that, boys?

246
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,380
The same whistles they used to blow
to send us over the top,

247
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,820
they now blow
to try and break us up.

248
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,140
So before the Specials get here,

249
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,980
raise a hand,
all those who want to strike...

250
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,460
Now disperse!
Disperse and take the message home!

251
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,580
United, we will never be defeated!

252
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,220
Tommy! Oi, Tommy.

253
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,740
What the hell's been happening?

254
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,140
The police had just raided
a rally at the factory.

255
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,100
You thinking Freddie Thorne's back?

256
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,260
I know he is. And he's with Ada.

257
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,940
How hard can it be to find
the only girl in Birmingham

258
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,300
with four-inch heels, eh?

259
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,220
She's with the commies.

260
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,420
They have little rat holes
all over the city.

261
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,620
I just want to know where she is.

262
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,060
Tommy, you'd best have a word
with Arthur as well.

263
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,780
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?

264
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,740
He's got the Flanders blues again.

265
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,300
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answer to.

266
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,940
"Is it true your Ada got married?"

267
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,660
I say, "I don't know."

268
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,580
"Where is she living now?"

269
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,300
"I don't know."

270
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,660
"Arthur...

271
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,300
"..who killed the Paddy
from The Black Swan?"

272
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,380
I go, "What Paddy?"

273
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
They say...

274
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,460
.."Is it you, Peaky Blinders,
who stole the guns from the BSA?"

275
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,300
What guns, Tommy?

276
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,780
Arthur, after your beating,
I thought you needed a break...

277
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,420
What bloody guns, Tommy?!

278
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,340
Arthur, I was going to tell you.
You were going to tell me.

279
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,300
Arthur, listen to me.

280
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
You've had a hard time
these past few years.

281
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,660
God knows you have.

282
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,220
You deserve some rest.

283
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,460
We had some luck. Some bloody luck.

284
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,740
It fell off a wagon into our laps.

285
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,780
And all you need to know is, it's us
that has the machine guns now.

286
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,740
And it's them that's in the mud.

287
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,220
All right?

288
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,660
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

289
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,980
Come on.

290
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,300
A surprise? Where is she?

291
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,300
What is it you've always wanted,
Arthur? Eh?

292
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,980
When we were in France,
you used to say,

293
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,420
"When I get back to England,
I want to own my own pub."

294
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Well...

295
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,940
You've gone soft.
You've gone soft, Tommy.

296
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,420
How do we know it's for sale?

297
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,260
Everything's for sale to us, Arthur.

298
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,780
We're making a lot of money
these days.

299
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,180
We need a legitimate business
to pass the money from the shop.

300
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,100
I wouldn't know what to do.

301
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,620
You've spent two-thirds of your life
in pubs.

302
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,660
Just pour it instead of drinking it.

303
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,220
But I can still drink it, right?

304
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,180
Your pub - you do what you want.

305
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,860
Ah - sorry, gentlemen,
I didn't hear you come in.

306
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,940
What can I get you?

307
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,700
Bloody kids.

308
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,420
The other one's punctured as well.

309
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,540
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.

310
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,620
Today, some rabble-rouser Union man
brought the BSA out on strike.

311
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,020
It was Freddie Thorne.

312
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,140
I thought you promised
he wouldn't come back.

313
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,700
I know he's in town.
I'm dealing with it.

314
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,420
Inspector Campbell thought
you controlled your territories.

315
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,580
Yeah.

316
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,820
I said I'm dealing with it.

317
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,980
I heard that, er...

318
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,380
..Freddie married your sister.

319
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,340
Some family you've got, eh?

320
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,060
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.

321
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,380
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us

322
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,260
or we'll take your sister
in as an accomplice.

323
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,220
She'll get four years for sedition.

324
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,020
Or you can turn him in
and your sister goes free.

325
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,940
I'll say good night then, Tom.

326
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,980
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?

327
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,340
No. Or Tommy? Ahh!

328
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,140
I have to find Freddie.
Drink this first.

329
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,140
No, I have to find them, I think
they are going to kill each other.

330
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,300
Who is going to kill who?

331
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,500
We need to talk.

332
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
What exactly is it
that you want, Freddie?

333
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,300
I came to tell you...

334
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,100
..that's not going to work, Tommy.

335
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,660
Polly came round. She gave me that.

336
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,940
Well, Polly must have had
a rush of blood.

337
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,140
Or port wine.

338
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,940
Your honesty is appreciated.

339
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,900
Now, if you're not going
to use that thing...

340
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,300
I'm not finished. Sit down.

341
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,020
Sit down. Sit.

342
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,380
Talk to me about the guns.

343
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,140
Do you remember we used
to jump in here,

344
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,420
see who could swim the fastest...?
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.

345
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,020
Do you reckon we could still do it?

346
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,220
Ah!

347
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,460
You loaded Ada with your bastard
because she's a Shelby.

348
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,500
You thought it'd mean
you'd be somebody.

349
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
I won't let you fuck up
my sister's life for your cause.

350
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
My God.

351
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,940
You actually believe that.

352
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
I love her, Tommy.

353
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,660
I've loved her since she was nine
and I was 12.

354
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,500
And she loves me the same.

355
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,100
You even know the word?

356
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,100
This marriage will not stand.

357
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,100
Shh...

358
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Freddie didn't want your money.

359
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,620
And now the coppers are saying
if we don't turn Freddie in,

360
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,100
they'll put Ada
on the arrest warrant as well.

361
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,220
That's where your compassion
gets you, Poll.

362
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,700
From now on, we do it my way.

363
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,020
Or what?

364
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Ready?

365
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,380
They're getting closer.

366
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,580
I'll lead. Watch yourself, Danny.
Tommy.

367
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,540
Be careful, Danny.

368
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,740
Tommy!

369
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,700
Tommy!

370
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,860
Aargh!

371
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,100
Arrrggghhh!

372
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,980
Arrrggghhh!

373
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,060
Tommy!

374
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,460
Tommy?

375
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Tommy!

376
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,020
Tommy?

377
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
It's open.

378
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,340
Private Whizz Bang reporting, sir.

379
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
At ease.

380
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,860
So, what news from London?

381
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,060
I was in a pub -
it was called Mother Redcap.

382
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,020
An Irish pub.

383
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,740
I got talking to some old bloke
about Birmingham.

384
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,100
He said there's been trouble.
An IRA man shot.

385
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,180
He said a lot, but the only bit
I heard... was that their high command

386
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,980
think it's the Peaky Blinders
who shot him.

387
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,580
Came up on the next boat to warn you.

388
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,980
Is it true?

389
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,020
No.

390
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,620
But lies travel faster
than the truth.

391
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,980
Get a message to them.

392
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,500
Tell them to send someone to parley.

393
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,660
Tell them there's been
a misunderstanding

394
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,180
and we don't want any trouble.

395
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,660
You've got enough trouble -
right, Tommy?

396
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,180
A whisky and a smoke.

397
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,220
I can smell it in the air.

398
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,300
I use it sometimes myself.

399
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,020
I call it "my sweetheart".

400
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,460
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.

401
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,780
Yeah...

402
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,300
..and we fucking volunteered.

403
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,500
Sometimes, it lasts all night.

404
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:53,500
I lie here and I listen
to the shovels and the picks

405
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,100
against that wall there.

406
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,460
And I pray the sun will come up
at the curtains

407
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,500
before they break through.

408
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,180
'No, I don't pray - I hope.

409
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,180
'And sometimes, it happens.

410
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,740
'The sun beats them.

411
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,900
'But mostly...

412
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,100
'..the shovels beat the sun.'

413
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,460
Your sister was here.

414
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,420
She was worried. You and Freddie.

415
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,860
It had made her sick...

416
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,660
She's all right,
but in her condition,

417
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,660
she needs peace.

418
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,020
Women talk.

419
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,460
That is something they do.

420
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,180
She talked about you.

421
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,500
She said you keep everything
locked up.

422
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,380
Well, that's what men do.

423
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,380
Your sister's nice. I like her.

424
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,980
It can't be easy for her.

425
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,540
Her brother and her husband,
fighting over the same thing.

426
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,380
Men should talk, too.

427
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
To you?

428
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,300
Why not? I'm a barmaid. It's my job.

429
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,380
Men always tell their troubles
to a barmaid.

430
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,620
What is it you and Freddie
are fighting over?

431
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,580
I'll meet you here at nine o'clock
tomorrow morning.

432
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,300
Did you buy a dress?

433
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,940
Yes. I bought a dress.

434
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,580
How does it look?

435
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,660
He's changed the oil
and greased her up.

436
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,660
So will it get me
all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?

437
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,780
He's good with motors,
but it pains him.

438
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,700
No heart in motorcars.
I can't talk with them.

439
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,020
Yeah - Tommy might need
to make a fast getaway.

440
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,340
The Lees will be all over the track.

441
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,180
And Kimber's men. And his coppers.

442
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,940
They control the law down there,
Tommy.

443
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,460
Give her a turn for me, Charlie.

444
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,780
This car only seats four.

445
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,340
You'll need more men than that
if you're to come back alive.

446
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,980
It'll be just me and a girl.

447
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,140
Is it just the two of us
going to the races?

448
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,420
Something like that.

449
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,820
Attention!

450
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,020
Right.

451
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,500
This is what was known as the final
briefing before going over the top.

452
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,340
60 miles down that road
is Cheltenham racetrack.

453
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,180
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?

454
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,380
To stick it to the Lee family,
Arthur.

455
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,620
That's right. The Lees are skimming
money off legal bookies.

456
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:23,620
Running chalk, selling rafflers,
beating up them as won't buy.

457
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,060
But today, we're going to stop them.

458
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,020
What about Kimber's men?
I thought he had his own protection.

459
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.

460
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,460
They're on the take from the Lees
to look the other way.

461
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,900
We are going to show Kimber
how it should be done.

462
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,780
Now take what you're good at.

463
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,860
Those of you with guns,
keep them out of it,

464
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,140
unless a gun is pulled on you.

465
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,780
We want this done quietly.

466
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,860
So when do we share out the cash?

467
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,060
We don't.
We're not keeping the cash.

468
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,820
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.

469
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,980
Trust only kin.

470
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,700
Let's go.

471
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Are you sure we're allowed in here?

472
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Well, I prefer to come to the races
the back way.

473
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,700
It keeps me out of trouble.
Tracks are lawless places.

474
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,340
I can't stand petty criminals.
This way.

475
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,580
Will we get to lay a bet?
No - gambling is for mugs.

476
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,060
This way...

477
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,940
You're lucky you're with me

478
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,540
or you'd be wasting your money
on fixed races.

479
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,820
I always wondered,
how do you fix a race?

480
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,100
How should I know?

481
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,060
OK, you do the talking. What?

482
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,380
Tell security
you are Lady Sarah Duggan...

483
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,660
Excuse us, excuse us...

484
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,860
..Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.

485
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,340
You got lost when you went
to look for the boy

486
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,500
riding your horse - Dandy Flower.

487
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,540
If they ask about me,
say I'm Prussian

488
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,940
and don't speak a word of English.

489
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,860
Come on, posh girl.
Earn your three quid.

490
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,180
I still prefer the Garrison.

491
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,140
Do you dance?

492
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,100
If I'm asked properly.

493
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,260
Lady Sarah of Connemara,
will you dance with me?

494
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,460
Roberts.
The Peaky Blinders are here.

495
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,020
I told you, Mr Kimber.
He's got some balls, that one.

496
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,100
And she's got some body, that one.

497
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,340
Chalk for your blackboards.

498
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,860
Five pounds a stick.

499
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,700
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

500
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,220
Hello, Raz. How's business?

501
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,340
Argh! Ugh!

502
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,460
Fucking... get up!

503
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,740
Fucking...

504
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,060
ARRGGHH!

505
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,780
Stay still, Raz,
or I'll take the whole ear off.

506
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,460
And you're going to need
your ears to listen.

507
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,820
No more chalking
on Billy Kimber's boys.

508
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,220
Right?

509
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,220
We're the protection now.

510
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:18,180
I commandeer this stolen money
by order of the Peaky Blinders.

511
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,900
Agghh!

512
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,140
Either your left leg
is stronger than your right

513
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,300
or we're making a getaway.

514
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,580
Neither. I hope this doesn't involve
razor blades.

515
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,660
I've decided to move up
in the world.

516
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,820
Become a legitimate businessman.

517
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,100
My gosh. You're serious.
I'm always serious.

518
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,460
We chased the Lees across the track,
right the way down the Devon road.

519
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,900
We got every penny back.

520
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,340
Nice dress.
You can wear that to my pub.

521
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,700
Buy the boys a drink. Anybody hurt?

522
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,060
A few cuts and bruises.

523
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,260
Off we go, Lady Sarah.

524
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,100
Steady on...
Excuse me.

525
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,100
Your money, Mr Kimber.

526
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,860
Rescued from the Lee brothers

527
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,420
and returned to you
with a request for a fair hearing.

528
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,220
Your own protection is failing,
Mr Kimber.

529
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,180
Your boys are taking cuts.

530
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,220
I want to suggest that from now on,

531
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,700
you contract out your racetrack
security to the Peaky Blinders.

532
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,700
We would be saving you
a lot of money, Mr Kimber.

533
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
A lot of money.

534
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,060
In return, you give us...

535
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,420
..5% of the take

536
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,620
and three legal betting pitches

537
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,140
at every race meeting
north of the River Severn,

538
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,180
rising to six after one year

539
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,420
if we are all satisfied
with the service.

540
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,980
What do you say, Mr Kimber?

541
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,900
I say you talk business
to my accountant.

542
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,100
I want to dance.

543
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,020
Your man said it was all right
for me to have this dance.

544
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,660
How many men can you put
in the field at one time?

545
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,460
There's a lot of men out of work
at the moment.

546
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,100
Two guards for every bookie.
At every meeting?

547
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,900
We have contacts with good people
among the gypsies.

548
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,020
We'll always know where the Lees
plan to attack.

549
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,740
With all the strikes and troubles,
you can't depend on the police.

550
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,700
Anyway... we're more honest.

551
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,140
Looks like you two
are making a deal.

552
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,820
We are making progress.

553
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,420
Then let me throw a small condition
into the mix.

554
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:04,180
So, listen... we're going to go
for dinner at Kimber's house.

555
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,820
He has a place
a couple of miles away.

556
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,940
I have some business to settle first
with his accountant, so...

557
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,740
You go on ahead, with Kimber.

558
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,740
Just me and him?

559
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,460
Yeah... until I'm done here.
Is that all right?

560
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,540
I'll throw in an extra three quid
for your extra time.

561
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,420
You think I'm a whore?

562
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,540
Everybody's a whore, Grace.

563
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,980
We just sell different parts
of ourselves.

564
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,100
You said you wanted to work for me.

565
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,020
To do that, you have to sharpen up.

566
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,100
The deal is I give him
two hours with you.

567
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,420
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.

568
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,740
Whenever you want,
just kick him in the balls.

569
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,980
I'm a clause in a contract.

570
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,100
If you want to be part
of my organisation,

571
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,540
you have to make sacrifices.

572
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,620
Do we have a deal?

573
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,700
As a sweetener,
you can try your luck with mine.

574
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,780
Yes, we have a deal.
Two hours? Yeah.

575
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,820
Side bet. Ten pounds says
I'll have her fucked in one.

576
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,060
Mademoiselle.

577
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,940
I bet he said you could have me,
didn't he?

578
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,100
While he has her.

579
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,620
That's the arrangement, isn't it?

580
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,780
Yours might be a prostitute,

581
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,780
but I'm not.

582
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,780
I was a milliner when I met him.

583
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,420
I was independent.

584
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,820
I made this hat.

585
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,700
I was a good milliner.

586
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,620
It's a very pretty hat.

587
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,420
It really is.

588
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,740
So is she a prostitute?

589
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,460
God's honest truth?

590
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,820
I don't know what she is.

591
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,100
You showed me up
back there at the races.

592
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,740
Why don't you teach me
how to dance properly?

593
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,940
The music is too slow.
Put on a Charleston.

594
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,620
Then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.

595
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,340
Come on. You weren't so stiff
back there, were you?

596
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,180
You ever been in a house this big?

597
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,460
Hm?

598
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,180
Look at you.

599
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,700
You look like a bloody film star.

600
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,340
I want a cigarette.

601
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,820
Oh, look, I dropped something.
Pick it up.

602
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,180
Pick it up yourself.

603
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,380
You're a fucking barmaid.

604
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,580
If I drop a glass on the floor,
you pick it up.

605
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,420
I want to watch you pick it up.

606
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,540
Right, you little slag.
I have tried to be nice.

607
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,620
If I drop a glass on the floor,

608
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,420
you bend over and fucking pick up
the fucking glass, OK?

609
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,900
What?! No, sir... no.

610
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,620
What are you doing here?
I've got another hour.

611
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,980
Just wait - listen to me.
Just listen to me.

612
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,660
I was going to let you go through
with it, but in the end,

613
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,820
my conscience got the better of me.

614
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,340
She looks good on the outside...

615
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,220
..but she has the clap.

616
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,780
Yeah. Syphilis.

617
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,460
When you took a shine to her,
I thought I'd use her.

618
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,980
Somebody told me she had syph
and I thought, "What the hell?"

619
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,980
Call it my better nature.

620
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,260
She's... she's a whore.

621
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,060
Just go and wait in the car.
I can walk on my own!

622
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,980
Can we shake hands
and forget this ever happened?

623
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,380
Start of the day,
I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

624
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,620
By the end,
I was a whore with the clap.

625
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,420
You're a fucking bastard,
offering me like that.

626
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,140
But then you changed your mind.

627
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,500
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

628
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,140
