I know your new address, Lizzie,

on the import of liquor
into New York.

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,839
But if they move against you
in New York,

390
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,230
they'll start a war
between the families.

00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,840
But if you were to die in a vendetta

with some fucking bookmaker
in Birmingham,

they could take over your business
without a war.

He's also interested in moving into

that for business reasons

I would kill you.

So this is all purely for bad blood,
is it, Tommy?

- Yeah.
- Right. Yeah.

- No.

Right then. Well, his name is Cyril

484
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,553
and he'll be very upset
and distressed,

485
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,393
so you'll need to find him someone.

- No.
