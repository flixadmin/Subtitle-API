1
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,330
2.. 5..7.. 10 minutes..
he continued to stare.

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,450
I ignored him at first
but then I went to the table..

3
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,700
..and I said, any problem, sir?

4
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,580
I'm very sorry.

5
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,500
You look like someone
I know, he replied

6
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,540
I was going to walk away..

7
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,500
..but he was a 70 year old man.

8
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,950
Horny uncle!

9
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,660
Anyway, so I had to ask
him whom did I look like.

10
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,870
Any guesses on his reply?

11
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,330
His mother?

12
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,200
His daughter.

13
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,160
His 8th grade biology teacher.

14
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,910
Don't try to fit in your fantasy here.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,750
She was so hot, Mrs. Matthews..
I promise. Oh my god!

16
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,000
He said I look like his dog.

17
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,330
What? I'm serious!

18
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm serious.
His dog was called Princess.

19
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,330
That's a terrible name.

20
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,910
Forget the name, listen to the story.

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000
I said, you made fun of me, uncle.
Can I go home now?

22
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,370
He said, please listen to me.

23
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,910
Princess died in
a car accident in 1985.

24
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,950
She freed herself and
ran into an oncoming car.

25
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,330
The car ran over her and by the
time he reached there, she was dead.

26
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,540
She was dead. Her throat was crushed.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,370
This happened on 17th June, 1985.

28
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,950
You're joking. - No.

29
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,870
That's my birthdate.

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,410
No.. - Yeah!

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,120
And it gets stranger because
I have a birth mark on my neck.

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,330
Lying!

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,830
I have a birth mark on my neck.

34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,700
See!

35
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Very funny.

36
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,120
Shaan.. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,540
Shaan.. Shaan!

38
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,200
Gulp it down, you'll feel better.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
What happened?

40
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
Half of the critics hadn't
Even arrived, you should've waited.

41
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,040
I don't know why but
I suddenly felt so weird.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,830
I saw something that wasn't
actually there, but it felt so real.

43
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,750
I don't understand
what you are saying, Mehak

44
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,370
I don't know.

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
You're okay now, right? - Yes.

46
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Because everyone
really liked your work.

47
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,330
You think? - Yes.

48
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,580
Stop, pull over.

49
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,580
Come up.

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,120
Why?

51
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,910
We'll have a drink,
listen to some music.

52
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,330
You know..

53
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,580
Just because it happened
once after getting drunk..

54
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,120
..doesn't mean it's
gonna happen every time.

55
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,040
You know what,
I don't know about your past life..

56
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,330
But in this life you definitely are..
a princess

57
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,370
Bye-bye.

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,540
Bye! - Goodnight.

59
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,450
Goodnight.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,370
Hello.. madam?

61
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,250
Oh my God!

62
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
Ma'am, are you ok?
- Ma'am, are you ok?

63
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,500
Get some water! - What happened?

64
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,370
She's bleeding! - Get some water.

65
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,120
What happened?
- Have you found any ID?

66
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,080
Mehak, open your mouth.
Show your tongue.

67
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,620
Hold my hand. You're in a hospital,
I'm a doctor. Just relax.

68
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,750
Show your tongue. Calm down.
You're in hospital. Open your eyes.

69
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,330
Open your eyes.

70
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,120
C'mon, Mehak.
The doctor has been waiting for long.

71
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,080
I was six and you were
around three years old.

72
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,580
Do you remember the
terrace on our Jammu home?

73
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,620
I was spinning you around in circles..

74
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,910
..when you suddenly
slipped out of my hand.

75
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,040
You fell to the ground floor.

76
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,200
Do you remember that song that
dad sang to calm you down..

77
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,200
Relax, Mehak.
You can't step out right..

78
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,660
..that's why I've brought
the outside world to you here.

79
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,910
Oh my god!

80
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,120
This is virtual therapy.

81
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,870
For people like you.
Go on, walk ahead.

82
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Very good, Mehak.

83
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,870
Do you like shopping?

84
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,410
Anusha told me that you
always did the grocery shopping.

85
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,580
C'mon, Mehak, keep going.

86
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,750
That's good, Mehak.
So what do you feel like buying today?

87
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,540
Buy me a chocolate, aunty.

88
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,580
Yes, pick up a chocolate for Joey.

89
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,950
You can do it, Mehak.
- The biscuit ones.

90
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,410
Biscuit chocolate, c'mon Mehak.

91
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,120
Where's the chocolate?

92
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,830
There are people there.

93
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,870
Please.. please.. - No, no.

94
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,040
Please don't touch it. Mehak.
Please don't touch it.

95
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,450
Keep going.

96
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,700
You're almost there, Mehak. Relax.

97
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,160
Look for the chocolate.

98
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
You can do it, Mehak.

99
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,950
Be brave. Very good.

100
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,330
She hit me. - Who hit you?

101
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,580
Relax.. relax..
- She hit me! She hit me!

102
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,750
Relax. Mehak! Mehak!

103
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,160
Mummy! - She hit me!

104
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,450
Calm down. - Mummy!

105
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,750
Relax, relax. - Don't touch me!

106
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,160
Mehak!

107
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,580
What happened to aunty? - Nothing.

108
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,620
Go, get your drawing book.

109
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,660
I'm sorry, Anusha.
Mehak suffers from Agoraphobia.

110
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,290
She has a deep-seated
fear of the outside world.

111
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,370
She's not being difficult,
she's just unwell.

112
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,580
If not treated,
Mehak can become completely unstable.

113
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,500
She is certain that if
she steps out of the house..

114
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,410
She will be made to experience the
same horror she went through that night.

115
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,910
But that taxi driver is in prison.

116
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,830
Mehak knows that very well.

117
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,160
He can't do anything now.

118
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,870
What happened that night?
It's not like she was raped!

119
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,620
I understand, Anusha. If you want,
you can admit her to the clinic.

120
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,580
There is a good clinic in Byculla..
- Just a second, doctor.

121
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,620
There's no need to put Mehak in an
institution. And please, she's not crazy.

122
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,200
Take it.

123
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,700
Thanks.

124
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,330
I don't want to talk,
I just need some time.

125
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,040
Do you know how long its been
since you stepped out of this house?

126
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,160
Two weeks. - Two?

127
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,080
Four. - Yes, four weeks.

128
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,950
Not four weeks, but four months.

129
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,700
That's true.

130
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,700
What crap!

131
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,200
Mehak, I have other
responsibilities as well.

132
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,450
Did you see Joey today?

133
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,580
He gets so frightened seeing
you that he can't sleep at night.

134
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,080
Then why do you call
that therapist home?

135
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,910
What have I done?
It's always my fault!

136
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,500
He is a five year old kid, don't
you feel he deserves some normalcy?

137
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,700
Are you blaming me for that?

138
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,410
If he wants normalcy,
take him to his father. - Mehak.

139
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,330
Her kid gets screwed up,
is it my responsibility?

140
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,120
Mehak, it's not
necessary to involve him.

141
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,370
And I'm just talking about Joey,
let's just stay there.

142
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,950
What happened last week?
Tell him. - Get lost seriously.

143
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,080
Joey returns from school
and rings the doorbell.

144
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,580
But he isn't able to
get into the house. Why?

145
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,370
I wanna know that.
- How many times will she say that!

146
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,540
Exactly!
- She's said it thrice already!

147
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,250
I'll say it again and again, the kid
stood on the street for four hours.

148
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,750
Why couldn't he get into the house?

149
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,450
Because you couldn't go upto
the door and let him in.

150
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,500
Yes. - Yes, so?

151
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,700
I said I'm sorry. - What if
something had happened to the kid?

152
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,450
I'm sorry. - What do I do?

153
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,580
What do I do? Quit my job?

154
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,080
Shall I shop for normalcy from that
virtual supermarket for you?

155
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,200
What do you want?

156
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,620
What do you want? - What do you want?

157
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
You want to send me to an institution!

158
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,330
I don't want to send you
to an institution.. - Shut up!

159
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,080
I heard you.

160
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,450
What did you hear? - Mehak.

161
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm feeling dizzy.

162
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,120
Ok.. calm down.. sit down.

163
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Sit down.

164
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,660
Look, Mehak.

165
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,450
You can't throw me
out of my own house.

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,870
This house belongs to me too.
- Of course, Mehak.

167
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,500
It'll always be your house.

168
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,830
I'm just telling you that..

169
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,950
Mehak?

170
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,040
Anusha, be strong. We need to do this.

171
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,580
I don't know if we're
doing the right thing.

172
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,040
Anu, I'm taking responsibility.

173
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,540
Trust me, she'll become fine in
a new place. Away from you guys.

174
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,370
Jiya?

175
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,120
Jiya?

176
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,750
Jiya!

177
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh!

178
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,370
Hi, ma'am - Go!

179
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,750
Who are you? - I didn't do anything.

180
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,450
Mehak.. please.. calm down.

181
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,200
Relax.

182
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,290
It's me. - Where were you?

183
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,120
I can't.. I can't move.

184
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,500
You got scared.

185
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,700
Who are you? How did you get in?

186
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,080
The door was open.

187
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,830
I'm Manu. Manu Malhotra,
your next-door neighbour.

188
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,910
I stay in
602.

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,250
I'm so sorry if I frightened you.

190
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,580
I thought that Jiya was back. - Jiya?

191
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,580
Jiya is my friend.

192
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,870
Manu, actually we've just moved in.
Let us settle down first. - Of course.

193
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,370
If you need anything. - Sure.

194
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,120
Please don't hesitate,
I'm just a doorbell away. - Thank you.

195
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,370
Shall I make tea for you? - No.

196
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,910
Water..

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,700
I'll give it, thank you.
- I want water.

198
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,830
How about coffee..
- No, Thanks, Manu.

199
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,160
He's laughing. - I didn't
arrange the welcome party.

200
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,410
Where's the house?

201
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,750
This is going to be
your house for sometime now.

202
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,290
100 years later?

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,370
You are very young.

204
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,450
This is my friend's house,
it's been lying vacant.

205
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,580
We can stay here as long as we want.

206
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,290
We? - You, of course.
C'mon, get up now.

207
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,540
Come. - Get up. Do this, do that.

208
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,540
I've asked Anu for some time..

209
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,620
..because there's no point
sending you to a clinic.

210
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,950
Being independent again will help
you face this problem. Really.

211
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,660
Will you give it a try?

212
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,160
Best keep this one closed.

213
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,540
The bedroom has such a nice view.

214
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,870
Shaan, please close it.
- No, you need vitamin D.

215
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,660
Who does this belong to?

216
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,160
The house belongs to my friend but he
had rented it out to a girl named Jiya.

217
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,950
Some of her clothes and stuff
might be lying around.

218
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
Throw away whatever you don't need.

219
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,910
What if she comes back for it?
- She won't.

220
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,910
What?

221
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,370
She didn't pay the rent,
didn't come to collect her deposit.

222
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,160
Maybe she skipped town.

223
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,080
Sorry, chips.

224
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,450
Shall we clean up the place?

225
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,330
I'll do it.
Don't you have to go to work?

226
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
I thought I'll take my Diwali
leave from today itself.

227
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,700
No need, Shaan.

228
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,120
I'll take some time
out of my busy schedule.

229
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,540
How much is the rent?
- Don't worry about that.

230
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,370
Get well soon, start painting
and you can pay me back, ok?

231
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,500
What did you and
Anusha put in my coffee?

232
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,950
You thought I'll not come to know.

233
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,000
Would you've agreed
if I had asked directly?

234
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
If my motor skills don't come back.
I'm not talking to you again.

235
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,830
You should go now.

236
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,080
Don't forget your medicines.

237
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,700
"this girl is going to drive me crazy"

238
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
Hello?

239
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,950
Don't need

240
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,580
Don't need.

241
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,660
Hi, it's me. Open up. - Wait a second!

242
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,620
I'm opening, but count to ten
before you step in. Ok? - Yeah, ok.

243
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,040
Huh? - Yeah!

244
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,910
Ok.

245
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,410
Shall I come in?

246
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,830
What are you doing?

247
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,250
Nothing.

248
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,620
Hey, dance with me, c'mon.

249
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,870
C'mon. - No, thanks.

250
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,620
C'mon!

251
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,330
What are you doing?
Let me eat. - C'mon, play along.

252
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,120
Ok, fine. I'll watch you dance.
Shaan's got talent - M, c'mon!

253
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,000
It's ok.. it's ok.

254
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,950
It's ok.

255
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,660
Chemist, grocer, milkman,
I'm leaving all their cards here.

256
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,330
I'll find you a maid.
- I don't need a maid.

257
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,750
Ok, no maid.

258
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,250
Anyway, why would
you need a maid, when..

259
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,120
I'm there.

260
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,870
I'm 100% going to get well

261
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,330
Of course,
what goes down must come up.

262
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,250
It's a law of physics.
- you got it all wrong

263
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,450
No, I'm telling the truth.

264
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,830
Many famous entertainers, actors,

265
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,330
..philosophers suffered
from agoraphobia.

266
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,660
Barbara Streisand, singer.

267
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Kim Basinger, actress. Even Freud..

268
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,370
Not one of them is Indian?

269
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,580
What can I do if you've a phobia of
white people! - You're still doing this.

270
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,080
I have a phobia of capsicum,
what can I do!

271
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,790
Have you heard of Paula Dean? Even she
had a problem stepping out of her home.

272
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,410
She started cooking
from home and is now famous..

273
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,830
..for cooking on TV.

274
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,580
And I've brought all your things.

275
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,790
Sit at home and paint.

276
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,950
I'm trying but I'm
not being able to paint.

277
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
You've to be more positive.

278
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,500
It's a mental block, it'll go away.

279
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,290
Just try harder.
- Why don't you try that?

280
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Happy? And you have so many offers.

281
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,750
Just think about it.

282
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,870
Did you check my mails?

283
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,620
No, the page was open so I Just happened
glance through. - What the hell!

284
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,580
Mehak, please relax. - Don't ask
me to relax because I don't like that.

285
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,040
If I look through
your personal things..

286
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,450
..how'd you like it?
- Mehak, what are you doing?

287
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,370
Where are you going?

288
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,660
Nowhere.
I thought I'll stay the night.

289
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,870
.. it's a new place,
that's all.

290
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,910
What did you think?

291
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,000
What exactly did you think?

292
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
Mehak is crazy..

293
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,580
Dance with her, feed her, give her
some attention and then this!

294
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,120
Where will she run away to?

295
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,950
She can't even step out of the house.
Get out of my house! - Mehak!

296
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,160
Relax, you're just losing it..
- You ask me to relax one more time..

297
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,330
..and I'll cut your tongue out! - Mehak,
there are three rooms in this house.

298
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,910
You can sleep there
and I can sleep here.

299
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,580
Do I have to tell you this,
you retard!

300
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,410
Control that crazy mind of yours.

301
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm just sick of this.

302
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Who is that for?

303
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,410
who are the condoms for?

304
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
You don't know her.

305
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,790
Don't come back here again.

306
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,290
This isn't your house,
Don't forget that.

307
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
Thanks.

308
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,500
Because I'm leaving?

309
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,000
If you feel bad,
I can stop seeing her.

311
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,950
It's not serious.

312
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,330
Hmm..Can you throw the garbage
on your way out? - What?!

313
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,080
No, Mehak. I won't dispose your garbage,
That's the least you can do for yourself.

314
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,200
You don't want to help me?

315
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,540
That's what I'm doing. - Get lost!

316
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,290
Disposing the garbage is no big deal.

317
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,540
First he says it's my house
and then he says it isn't!

318
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,950
You are so swee..

319
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,250
Who are you?

320
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,040
Hormoz!

321
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,000
Send him out.

322
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,790
Who?

323
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,580
How many times have I told you
not let hormoz hide in your place!

324
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,450
There's nobody here.

325
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,750
Hormoz! - Oh god!

326
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,870
There's nobody here.

327
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,080
You've come back?

328
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,950
He'll kill you this time.

329
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,580
Is hormoz in there?

330
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,080
Do you have a fan at home?

331
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,450
Yes, I do.

332
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,200
Then did you check on top of it? He must
be sitting on it and moving in circles.

333
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,500
Are you teasing me?

334
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,500
You think this is a joke?
- No, I think it's really late, babe.

335
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,450
Three times one equals three.

336
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,660
Three times two equals six.

337
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,950
Three times three equals nine.

338
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,620
Three times four equals twelve.

339
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,410
Three times five equals fifteen.

340
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,910
Three times six equals eighteen.

341
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,540
Three times seven equals twenty-one.

342
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,950
Three times eight equals twenty-four.

343
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,830
Three times nine equals twenty-seven.

344
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,910
Oh no! Oh god! I'm so sorry.

345
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,450
Sorry!

346
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,000
Sorry!

347
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,450
Sorry!

348
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,660
I'm just.. a little..

349
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,370
You're welcome.

350
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,580
Thank you.

351
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,540
Anu, pick up.

352
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,500
Just because I didn't answer your
call, you are not answering mine?

353
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:25,040
But you know what? I just went out
and disposed of the garbage myself.

354
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,000
Please call me.

355
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,870
Bye.

356
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,580
Captain Nichani is just horrible.

357
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,370
Each time I ask him what
the temperature outside is..

358
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,910
..before landing he looks
at my boobs and says, 36.

359
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,830
If Manu finds out about this,
he'll flip out and kill me.

360
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,040
Hey M! - There's a cat in my bedroom.

361
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,830
And where are you? - In the bedroom.

362
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,450
I'm not sure whether
it's actually there or not.

363
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,290
What do you mean?

364
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,040
Shaan, there's something wrong
with the house. I'm seeing things.

365
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,620
Mehak, make some noise.
If the cat isn't deaf, it'll run away.

366
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,450
What if it doesn't?

367
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,580
then I'll come running to you.

368
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,290
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

369
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,790
Of course, you are. - Ok.

370
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,370
Hey, it ran! It was really a cat!

371
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,580
Kitty?

372
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,950
Kitty!

373
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,660
Go.. go!

374
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,790
Hey, go!

375
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,580
Go, kitty!

376
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,450
Hi.

377
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,000
Are you ok?

378
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,250
I'm ok.

379
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,370
Are you sure?

380
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,000
Are you fine? - What?

381
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,620
Are you sure? - Yes.

382
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,000
Do you need some help?

383
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,950
I can call the..

384
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,290
No, it's fine.

385
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,790
Are you alright? You just fell down.

386
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,410
Come inside and sit.

387
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,500
No, I'm waiting for my dad.

388
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,200
I forgot the house
keys and he's at work.

389
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,660
I'm fine outside.

390
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,580
No, no, you can come inside and sit.

391
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,620
I'm Nikki, by the way.

392
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,660
Namaste, my name is Nikki.

393
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,410
Mehak. - Hi Mehak.

394
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,660
Are you sure you're fine?

395
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,830
There's someone in my room.

396
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,950
Someone you know, right?

397
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,830
Someone whom you know?

398
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,040
No, actually it's a cat.

399
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,080
Cat?

400
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,910
You are so frightened by a cat?

401
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,750
I'm very scared of cats,
please come. Please..

402
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,580
Of course.

403
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,330
Black cat with yellow eyes, isn't it?

404
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,620
Must be Gul aunty's cat.
She wanders about the building.

405
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,330
Comes in through the window.

406
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,830
Give me a spoon and plate.

407
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,660
What?

408
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,620
The hunters in the jungles..

409
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,410
..make noise to lure the tigers out,
so they can shoot them.

410
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,660
I hate hunters, but I love tigers.

411
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,160
Ready?

412
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,910
Why did you scream?
- Why did you scream?

413
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,950
Because you screamed.

414
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,120
There's a spider inside.

415
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,250
There's nobody in the bathroom.

416
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:39,870
Nobody?

417
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,790
There's nobody in the cupboard either.

418
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,040
But, there's a spider
under the bed. Eww..

419
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,620
What happened?
You look like as if you saw a ghost!

420
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,870
I'm glad to have met you.

421
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,790
Actually, I don't have too many
friends and everyone calls me a freak.

422
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,580
But you're a step ahead of me.

423
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,910
I have agoraphobia. - Agoraphobia?

424
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,290
How exotic!

425
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,580
Can you please get the ice? - Yes.

426
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,910
So basically, you can never
visit the Taj Mahal, right?

427
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,620
Forget the Taj Mahal, I can't
even visit the Gateway of India.

428
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,370
You've come to the right place.

429
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,160
This building is filled
with crazy people.

430
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,120
Manu, always keeps smiling.
The creepiest smile ever.

431
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,540
Gul aunty keeps looking
for her husband Hormaz all day.

432
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,620
She has a husband?

433
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,160
I've never seen him.

434
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,000
Who knows whether he actually
Exists..

435
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,700
And now you, welcome.

436
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,500
This 'Taj Mahal' phobia of yours..

437
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,910
Did you always have it or..

438
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,870
I'm an artist, I used to paint.

439
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,580
Are you serious?
- Jiya used to live here, right?

440
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,790
Yes. - You knew her as well?

441
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,330
Of course.

442
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,000
She was so weird.

443
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,950
Very weird.
She and Manu were a couple.

444
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,910
This Manu?

445
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,620
Romeo and Juliet style..

446
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,620
The noises from their house
Sounded more like Cain and abel.

447
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,330
Screaming, shouting all the time.

448
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,040
I heard that she disappeared.

449
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,450
I heard that she
Disappeared all of a sudden.

450
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,790
That Manu is..

451
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,370
One minute, sorry.

452
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,040
Where are you? - Dad?

453
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,620
I'm in the neighbour's house.

454
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,540
I'm coming, bye.

455
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,620
I'm so sorry; I've got to go.
- What happened?

456
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,120
That Manu is a weirdo.
Nice meeting you.

457
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,620
I'll see you soon.
I'll catch up with you later.

458
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,830
Excuse me.

459
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,830
Oh shit!

460
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,410
Hello? Did you get hurt?

461
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,620
Ma'am! I'm terribly sorry.

462
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,500
Are you hurt? I'm coming.

463
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,580
No, I'm fine. I'm ok.

464
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,410
Thank god.

465
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
Should I come over
and repair your wall?

466
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,580
It'll only take a few minutes.

467
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,040
No, not required.

468
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,620
These buildings
look good from outside.

469
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,660
But they are completely
rotten from inside.

470
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,450
Are you alright, ma'am?
- I'm fine, ok.

471
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,580
Sometimes I am afraid of Manu.

472
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,120
Today again he hit me.

473
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,700
He threw a ketch-up bottle at me.

474
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,540
The mirror behind me shattered.

475
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,870
7 years of bad luck.
But I was so turned on.

476
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,370
He wants babies.

477
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,870
But I don't want to.. Want it.

478
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,580
when I refused..

479
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,450
..he held my hand so hard
that the marks never left.

480
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,410
His grip is like iron.

481
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,040
We're engaged.

482
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,790
He made me wear his
grandpa's old ring..

483
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,620
..and said, 'Chotu, we were engaged'.

484
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,120
Ring my foot!

485
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,250
I'm in love with a crazy man,
but I'm the bigger idiot.

486
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,330
I need to leave but
he won't let me. Help me God.

487
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,040
M!

488
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,830
Hey, Princess. It's me.

489
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,370
M, the food is getting cold. Come.

490
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,580
M!

491
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,410
Do you know which Indian
celebrity is Agoraphobic?

492
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,200
I'm coming in.

493
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,040
Mehak!

494
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,540
Mehak, are you inside?

495
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,790
M!

496
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,330
M?

497
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,330
M, are you ok?

498
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,500
Mehak!

499
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,750
M!

500
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,200
M?

501
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:04,750
Now whatever you see
will be recorded here.

502
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,870
You still don't believe me?

503
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,580
What proof do you
have that Jiya is dead?

504
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,200
For all you know, she is out there,
dancing in some night club as we speak.

505
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,910
Living her life. - Rubbish.

506
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,660
She used to live here earlier,
And Now she doesn't.

507
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,540
That's it, you had a panic attack.

508
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,250
No, she's dead.

509
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,950
What did you see? - Shaan, I told you.

510
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,790
She was lying there
in a pool of blood.

511
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,620
Someone had attacked her.

512
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,290
Nikki, go and open the door.

513
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,500
Hi, is Mehak there? - Yes, Nikki.

514
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,290
Mehak!

515
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,370
Hi, happy Diwali. I'm Nikki.

516
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,080
How did you like my knocks?

517
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,540
Three knocks means it's me.

518
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,620
Because you panic on
hearing the doorbell.

519
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,500
And what's with all the cameras?

520
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,200
So much for a cat?

521
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,950
No, the other thing..

522
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,620
Ghost?

523
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,410
Hey, hello.. no ghosts here, these
cameras are for security purposes.

524
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,370
anyway, we were talking
about something important..

525
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,870
..so you can come back later.

526
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,370
I just thought you wanted company.

527
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,910
Come back later for some cold coffee..

528
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,290
..when he's not around.

529
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,000
Is she even old enough
to drink coffee?

530
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,000
Excuse me, I'm in college.
I'm studying Political science.

531
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,580
Wow, good for you.
Don't you have homework to finish?

532
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,080
Ok, uncle.

533
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,120
I'll come back.

534
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,040
Namaste!

535
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,950
I want to go home.

536
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,700
It's just been two days, Mehak.

537
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,250
It's a new place.
It takes time getting used to.

538
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,410
It's not about getting used to.

539
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,750
I am afraid of stepping out and
now I'm afraid of staying in.

540
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:16,830
Where do I go?

541
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,370
Come here.

542
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:20,830
Come here.

543
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,700
Shaan.

544
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,500
Shaan!

545
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,200
Shaan!

546
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,910
Mehak. Mehak. – It's Shaan!

547
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,500
There's nobody, Mehak.

548
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,500
Only you and me.

549
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,410
Mehak, ghosts are not real.

550
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,330
Whatever you saw was
just your imagination.

551
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,830
There's a conflict between
reality and fantasy within you.

552
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,410
Please remember.

553
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,500
If you don't confront this fear..

554
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,620
..then it'll keep growing like this.

555
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,870
You'll have to face
this phobia, Mehak.

556
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,370
We'll help you.

557
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,660
If you want,
you can get out of this situation.

558
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,950
Don't you want to
be free of this phobia?

559
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:39,910
Good.

560
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,500
Then..

561
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,830
You'll have to trust me.

562
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:49,830
No.. - C'mon, Mehak.

563
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:02,950
Ok.

564
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,950
Where do you want to go shopping?

565
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,330
Mehak, you've done this before.
Remember?

566
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,450
This is virtual reality.

567
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,450
Nobody will harm you, don't be afraid.

568
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:23,830
Keep walking.

569
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:28,950
If you like a shop, walk in.

570
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:33,660
Very good, Mehak.

571
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,200
Ok, go in.

572
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,330
Great.

573
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:50,950
Excellent.

574
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,950
No, no..
don't go there, Mehak. Turn back.

575
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,620
Anu..

576
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,950
Anu?

577
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,410
Anu! - Mehak!

578
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,450
C'mon, let's go home.

579
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,200
Anu is not in the mall.

580
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:20,750
What's going on, doc?

581
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:25,040
This is showing something else.

582
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,700
Mehak, where are you?

583
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:29,790
Anu..

584
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,750
Oh god!

585
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,200
Get me out! - M, it's not real, relax.

586
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:38,580
Get me out!
- Mehak, don't panic. We're here.

587
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,160
Mehak, calm down.

588
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,540
Calm down, Mehak!

589
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,910
Mehak! - Get me out!

590
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,330
Get me out!

591
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,660
Mehak, what have you done!

592
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,910
Psycho!

593
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,450
C'mon, we've to take
you to the hospital.

594
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,870
Mehak is not
Getting any better, Shaan.

595
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,950
She has gone mad.

596
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,540
Admit her to a clinic.

597
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,750
Lock her up.

598
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,410
Lock her up.

599
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,120
Lock her up.

600
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,450
Hello, this is the
Khurana's residence.

601
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,330
There's nobody at home right now,
so please leave a message. Thank you.

602
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:15,450
Hello, my name is Mehak.

603
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,660
I want to talk to you about Jiya.

604
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,750
So please call me back.

605
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,540
Actually..

606
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,580
I know what happened to her.

607
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,040
I live in the place where Jiya died.

608
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:39,250
So, I think she's trying
to tell me something.

609
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,910
Call me urgently for Jiya's sake.

610
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,040
I'm sorry, Jiya.

611
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,950
I shouldn't have killed you.

612
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,830
Please forgive me Jiya..

613
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,450
Jiya was killed with this.

614
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:11,580
With this drawing?

615
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,620
No, Nikki, with the blade cutter.

616
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,250
Do you know who it belongs to?

617
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,450
Weird Manu?

618
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,950
Not weird, he has crossed the line.

619
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:27,160
Did Jiya tell you all of this?

620
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,450
She showed it to me.

621
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,580
So, you know something must
have happened between her and Manu..

622
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,660
..and then Manu killed Jiya.

623
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,540
He's a bit psycho Romeo type..
but he's no murderer.

624
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,580
I'll prove it to you.

625
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,660
He still has the bladecutter.
I saw it.

626
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,950
We'll give it to the cops.

627
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,790
Jiya's blood stains will surely
be found in the forensic tests.

628
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,830
Nikki, you've to help me.

629
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,330
I've to prove myself that I'm not..

630
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:58,660
Genuinely cuckoo.

631
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:09,830
Go, home.

632
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:18,750
Mehak.

633
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,450
It's ok, I'll help you.

634
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,120
Tell me what to do.

635
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,160
Manu goes to the jogger's
park every evening.

636
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,080
He's the president
of sunset laughter club there.

637
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,120
How do you know?

638
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,910
My dad's a member.

639
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,540
Anyway, he leaves the spare
house keys outside in the planter.

640
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,790
As soon as he leaves for the park,
we'll go in and get the bladecutter.

641
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,370
Where has he kept Jiya's body?

642
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,750
Buried her in the walls of the house?

643
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,160
He's an architect.

644
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,830
He'd surely know how
to hide a body behind walls.

645
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,500
No wonder he's renovating
the house by himself.

646
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,250
Your boyfriend hasn't come today?

647
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,830
Shaan isn't my boyfriend.

648
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,660
Does he know that? - Yes.

649
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,790
If you say so.

650
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,200
Isn't he a bit possessive?

651
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:38,620
He cares for me.

652
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,450
We're very good friends.

653
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:43,790
He's leaving.

654
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,950
I can't step out.

655
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:03,790
Ok, you watch the tv and
call me if a problem arises.

656
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:04,660
Ok.

657
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,870
I don't have your number.

658
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:09,620
Oh, Catch this.

659
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,330
Ok.

660
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:13,410
Ok.

661
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,370
Throw me yours.

662
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,580
I'll call myself. - Ok.

663
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,580
Be careful.

664
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,500
My god, this place is a mess!
Can you see it?

665
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,540
Yes.

666
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,450
He has broken the entire house down.

667
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:39,330
There's a really bad stench in here,
Mehak..and I know it's not just paint.

668
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:43,500
I swear if something jumps at me,
you better..

669
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,950
Hey, what happened?

670
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,950
I thought someone was
standing behind me. - Please.

671
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,750
But I'm ok now.

672
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,870
See this, the cement is still wet.

673
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,500
He could have buried her in the wall.

674
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,410
I'm going to the next room now.

675
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,870
And the Manu horror show continues.

676
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,750
Oh my god, he plays with a doll!

677
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,450
Does he play dollhouse games?

678
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,160
Mehak, meet Jiya.

679
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,410
Jiya, meet Mehak.

680
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:27,160
Nikki, he's here.

681
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,750
What?! Stall him.

682
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,330
I don't know, do something.

683
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:41,580
Oh, he's inside, Nikki.

684
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:44,250
I couldn't help you, sorry.

685
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,950
If he catches me, I'm dead.

686
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,790
Nikki, hide under the bed, quickly!

687
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:05,700
Yuck!

688
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,040
I've officially seen everything.

689
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,330
Nikki!

690
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,370
Nikki.

691
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,200
Manu!

692
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,580
Manu!

693
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,410
Manu!

694
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,540
Malhotra!

695
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,450
Malhotra!

696
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,790
Hi. Happy Diwali.

697
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,620
Go inside.

698
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,040
Repair my wall.

699
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,660
Can I.. I'm a bit tied up,
can I do it tomorrow?

700
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,620
No, no.. – no Tomorrow?

701
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,160
I've been waiting so long..
Malhotra..

702
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,870
Please repair the wall now..
It's just a 2 mm hole.

703
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,620
I'll fix it tomorrow, I'm a bit busy.

704
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,790
You told me you would do it,
you promised..

705
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,450
Please fix the hole,
it's causing me a lot of trouble.

706
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,790
Please fix it- I'll
just get my toolkit.

707
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,370
No, no, not required.

708
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,700
It's not required, please.

709
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,750
Not required.. Malhotra!

710
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,080
Thank you.

711
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,040
Did the entire wall come down?

712
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:35,040
No, no. That..
I was having a problem..

713
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,580
I'm coming.

714
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,410
You go to the room, please, I'll come.

715
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,790
In the first place, it shouldn't have
happened, you know. I'm an architect.

716
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,660
I'm getting a bit late for my laughter
club, but it's alright. Two minutes.

717
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:52,580
Are you coming? - I'm coming.

718
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,620
This room, right? - Yes, that room.

719
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,450
I know the bedroom.

720
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,200
Come.

721
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:12,750
By the way, it's Diwali today,
what are you doing in the evening?

722
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,870
Why don't you join us?

723
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,040
We'll burst some crackers
in the building compound.

724
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,910
Everybody will be there, it'll be fun.

725
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,040
Why are you so stressed?

726
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,330
I used to be very stressed also.

727
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,040
But laughter therapy
has helped me a lot.

728
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,040
Shall I teach you a technique?

729
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,660
It's called the Milkshake Technique.

730
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:51,080
Imagine two glasses in your hands..

731
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,370
Why don't you join me?

732
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,250
I had bought this for Jiya.

733
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,250
On our anniversary.

734
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:45,830
She was so beautiful.

735
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:50,950
Baby

736
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,250
Hello! Ma'am.

737
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,370
Open the door please.

738
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:16,250
Open the door!

739
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,040
Stop that!

740
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,160
Open the door!

741
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,580
I won't open it,
I know what you did to Jiya.

742
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,450
What did I do? - I'm getting
the police to get you arrested.

743
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,370
What? - Oh thank god!

744
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,450
Listen, we've to go.

745
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,450
What did you do?

746
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,870
By god, I'm getting angry now.
- That's Malhotra, forget him.

747
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,040
NIki is in there.. - Open the door.

748
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,750
Mehak, open the door.
- You don't understand!

749
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,830
Wait, Shaan. You can't take a risk.
- Open the door.

750
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,450
Mehak, you can't do this.

751
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,580
M.. - You don't know..

752
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,700
Stop, please. Ok?

753
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:52,250
Dead!

754
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:54,500
We're dead!

755
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,160
I'm so sorry, Manu.

756
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,410
Hold him!

757
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,910
Why did you lock me in?

758
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,450
Why did you lock me in?

759
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,910
You know Jiya?

760
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:07,790
I know what you did to Jiya!

761
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,750
What did I do? - You tell me.

762
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,080
You tell me what did I do!

763
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,120
No, You tell me first!

764
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:12,540
What's wrong with her?

765
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:15,040
Where's Nikki? - What are you saying?

766
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,450
What were you saying about Jiya?

767
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,370
Where's Nikki?
- Don't change the topic.

768
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:19,660
What were you saying about Jiya?

769
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,160
But where's Nikki?

770
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,370
She needs help.

771
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,750
He's a murder.

772
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,580
M, for god's sake!
Manu, she doesn't mean it.

773
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,580
You.. - Why?

774
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,950
I'm telling you all. - Stop it!

775
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,080
Manu, you gotta go.

776
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,790
Manu, you gotta go home.

777
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,120
She's confused,
she thinks you're someone else.

778
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,580
Please go home,
I'll come and explain later.

779
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:36,910
Manu, you gotta go.

780
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,750
Manu, just go.

781
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,790
Don't let him go.

782
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,790
I'll come back later for my toolkit.

783
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,950
Mehak.

784
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:06,450
If something happens,
it's your responsibility.

785
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,700
What the hell happened!
Where were you?

786
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,200
Relax, mom!

787
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:28,870
There was a whole nest
of spiders under Manu's bed.

788
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,120
So I panicked.

789
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,540
And you should charge your phone.

790
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,250
Anyway, look what I found.

791
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,580
Unbelievable!

792
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,250
Wow!

793
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,500
Even I have this.

794
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,660
Does that make me a murderer too?

795
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:45,580
Maybe.

796
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,200
Mehak, I told you to please
tell this girl to leave.

797
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,540
Listen, Mehak can have
friends other than you as well.

798
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,620
Stop getting so J.

799
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,620
Do you want to put
this girl in trouble again?

800
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:57,200
If you suffer a panic attack,
what will she do?

801
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,620
Listen, you don't
need to worry about me.

802
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,580
I can take care of myself.
I'm a black belt. - Right.

803
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,450
And Mehak can never harm me.

804
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,950
What if Malhotra files
a police complaint against you?

805
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,200
You broke into his house.

806
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,450
He won't do that, he's guilty.

807
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,120
Oh Mehak, please! This is madness.

808
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,160
Why aren't you helping us?

809
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:18,250
Now Jiya will help us out.

810
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,870
What?!

811
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:24,830
Ok, it's written here that
to get in touch with the dead.

812
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:29,540
To make contact, you've to
be in the same place where she died.

813
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
Check.

814
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,500
And it's written that you need..

815
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,700
..to be in possession of
something that belonged to her.

816
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,410
We have Jiya's clothes. Check.

817
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,040
Why are we doing this in the bathroom?

818
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,910
Mehak said that Jiya died in here.
- Right.

819
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:48,870
Mehak..

820
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,950
No Nikki, that's Jiya. Can't you tell?

821
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:56,830
Sorry.

822
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:12,620
Jiya, we come in peace.
We mean no harm.

823
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,580
We're here to listen
and help you move on.

824
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:21,330
Jiya, we come in peace.
We mean no harm.

825
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,830
Please talk to us.

826
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,700
Maybe Jiya isn't in a mood to talk.

827
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,830
That's because your
energy is very negative.

828
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,160
Sure, its always my fault..

829
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,950
Please keep quiet.

830
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,500
We'll try again.

831
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,410
Jiya, please talk to me.

832
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:49,080
What happened to you in this house?

833
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:53,040
We're here to help you.
Please talk to us

834
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:56,250
Where are you..

835
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:40,950
What the hell!

836
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:45,830
Jiya tell us who killed you?
- What nonsense! Who are you people?

837
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,750
What's all this?
Have you all gone mad?

838
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:49,830
You're alive?

839
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:51,330
Of course, I'm alive.

840
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,700
You're supposed to be dead. - What?!

841
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,580
Why is she wearing my uniform?

842
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:00,750
And you have my ring.
- Sorry.. I'm Shaan, I can explain.

843
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:02,830
Please explain, Shaan.

844
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,160
Actually, I can't explain but..

845
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,370
What?

846
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,750
Did you call up my parents?

847
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,500
Huh! Are you mad?

848
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:19,450
Do you know how troubled my parents
were after hearing your message?

849
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,120
Who does such a thing!

850
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,250
'I know who killed your
daughter.' Manu made you say that?

851
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,120
No, We thought Manu murdered you.

852
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,450
I've overheard your fights.. - Shut up,
you nosey rat! I'm gonna kill Manu!

853
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:54,120
Jiya, you're back! - Get off me!
Stay away from me, you sicko!

854
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,750
Don't you understand it's over?

855
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:57,910
I don't want your
grandma's rotten ring!

856
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,040
Stay away or I'll
call the cops. - Jiya..

857
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,910
Jiya, it's for you. - I don't want it.

858
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,450
What did you tell them about us?

859
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,870
Don't listen to them.

860
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,870
They're all mental.
I love you.

861
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:07,870
No, you don't. - Please come back.

862
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:09,160
You hit me. – I'm sorry.

863
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:10,790
Please calm down. - No, I won't.

864
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,910
Sorry, I shouldn't have hit you.

865
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,410
Too late for- sorry now.

866
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:17,200
You know, I've done an advanced
course in laughter therapy.

867
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:19,620
Shut up!

868
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:22,200
I don't get angry anymore, see.
- Shut up!

869
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,660
What do you want?
You want to continue flying?

870
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,540
No problem. You don't
want to marry me? No problem.

871
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,450
You don't want kids? No problem.

872
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,620
You want to work with other guys?

873
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,950
No problem.

874
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,200
You don't want this ring now? Ok.

875
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:41,080
I'll put it in my pocket.
I'll try later.

876
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,410
I love you, baby.
Just come back.

877
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,580
Get off! What are you doing?

878
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,660
Please.. please, I'm sorry.

879
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,250
I won't be stupid again.
Come back, please.

880
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,910
I hate you.

881
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:53,950
I know.

882
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,620
If you laugh again, I'll slap you.
- I won't laugh.

883
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:18,330
I have seen her in
the bathroom, Shaan.

884
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:20,620
In the bedroom.

885
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,120
All over the house.

886
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,450
But she's alive.

887
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,950
Why don't you say something?

888
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,500
Mehak, I believe in you.

889
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,250
There's definitely something
wrong with this house.

890
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:34,200
Maybe it wasn't runaway Jiya but..

891
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:36,700
..how do we now communicate
with the real ghost?

892
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:40,330
We don't even have their clothes.
- Go home, Nikki. That's enough!

893
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,410
Go home.

894
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,870
And thank you for everything.

895
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:48,200
Hey, what thank you?

896
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,370
Say that when we catch the ghost.

897
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,700
Happy Diwali.

898
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,830
Are you going to send me
to mental hospital now?

899
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:05,330
What?!

900
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:07,580
No, M, never.

901
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:17,120
I've never seen a more stronger
girl than you all my life.

902
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,540
You will be fine,
I promise, just don't give up.

903
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:31,790
Reality or imagination..

904
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,950
Right or wrong,
I can't tell difference.

905
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:39,620
I'm crazy.

906
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,250
Please go.
- I'm not going anywhere, Mehak.

907
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,500
I love you.

908
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:48,120
I've always loved you.

909
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,080
I'm so sorry.

910
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,410
I hate your hands.

911
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:41,830
Your touch disgusts me.

912
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:46,040
Your hands are dirty..

913
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,290
..ugly

914
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,500
You've lost your mind.

915
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:07,870
Not me.

916
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,830
You need treatment, not me.

917
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,410
Scoundrel..

918
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:22,160
How dare you stare at me! - M?

919
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:28,540
Who gave you the right to touch me?

920
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,250
It's you who stinks

921
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,200
Because you're rotten.

922
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:50,410
I'm not wrong, you are.

923
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,330
Wicked.

924
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:57,790
Evil. Filthy.

925
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:03,540
Sick.

926
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,040
Why did you do it?

927
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,080
What did you gain?
- Will you stop it?

928
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,160
Do you know whom you're talking to?
- I'm talking to you, Shaan.

929
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,200
You just don't understand me!

930
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,450
You tell me to be brave.

931
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,500
Go out. Go where?

932
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:28,540
You told me, I wasn't raped.

933
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,500
Should I have been raped?- Enough!

934
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,540
If you touch me again,
I'll call the cops.

935
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,450
Go ahead, call them over.
- You are Disgusting!

936
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,750
The more people see this drama,
the better it will be

937
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,410
I took you as my friend and what did
you do the moment you got a chance!

938
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,330
How are you any different from him?

939
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,120
How dare you say that!

940
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,200
What about all the
stress you've been..

941
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,450
..putting me through
over the past three years?

942
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,500
We're friends today, lovers tomorrow,
who knows what we are the day after!

943
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,080
Make up your bloody mind!

944
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,160
I've done so much for you.

945
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,450
I'm going to call Anu.

946
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,450
I'm talking to you, you freak.

947
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:05,040
M.. M..

948
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:08,450
M, please.. that's enough!

949
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:28,910
Oh god!

950
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:31,250
M..

951
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,160
I'm sorry, M. Are you hurt?
Let me check

952
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,250
Stop it. - Help!

953
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,450
Get away from me!

954
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:43,410
M..

955
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,700
Oh my god!

956
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,330
Oh my god!

957
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:53,500
Stay away from me!

958
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,120
I'm not mad, you'll kill me.

959
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,620
It wasn't Jiya, it was me. I was
seeing myself. I won't let you kill me.

960
01:32:58,700 --> 01:32:59,830
What are you saying, Mehak?

961
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,870
Drop that blade,
you'll hurt yourself.

962
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,580
I saw all of this!

963
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,290
Drop the blade, M!

964
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:12,080
No. - M, drop the blade.

965
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:32,910
Look at me.

966
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:47,450
Look at me.

967
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,580
M, I'm going to take you
to the hospital. Look at me.

968
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,580
M..

969
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:02,790
Let's..

970
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:05,040
The ice box..

971
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:09,750
I'll be right back..wait..

972
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,950
Hi, Mehak was..
- Nikki, do you know what time it is?

973
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,750
I know, sorry but I got a
call from Mehak. - She's sleeping.

974
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:57,660
I just thought it's something urgent.

975
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:00,370
It's alright, she's sleeping.
I'm here, go home.

976
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,790
Just tell her..

977
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,450
What was that?

978
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,790
Maybe the cat entered.

979
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,450
Cat? Gul aunty's cat is back?

980
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,040
She keeps coming
in through the window.

981
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,660
Yes, I have to go now..

982
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,580
Nikki, go home.

983
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,620
What's that? - Over here.

984
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,870
What? – On your...

985
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,120
It's nothing, Nikki. Go home.

986
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,870
No, I have to meet Mehak. - I'm
telling you she's sleeping. Go home.

987
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:28,410
I don't believe you, Shaan.

988
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,370
What do you mean
you don't believe me?

989
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,750
She's sleeping, I can't wake her up.
- I'm not going.

990
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:33,250
If she's sleeping, wake her up.
- Just relax.

991
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,540
Nikki.. - I won't leave
without meeting her.

992
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,330
Have you lost it?
Don't you understand?

993
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:38,830
Nikki, get out.
- Not without meeting..

994
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,750
Mehak! - Nikki!

995
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,870
What have you done?
- I haven't done anything, Nikki.

996
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,950
She fell in the bathroom. - Liar!

997
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,540
I swear, Nikki. I'm not lying.

998
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,200
It was an accident, I swear.

999
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,370
Mehak, I'm calling my dad.

1000
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:00,500
Everything will be fine.

1001
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,120
Nikki, listen to me. - No.

1002
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:05,750
It was an accident, I swear. - No.

1003
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:07,080
No! – Give me the phone.

1004
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,620
Give me the phone! Let go! - No!

1005
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,200
Leave it! Let me call the ambulance.

1006
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:22,330
Stop it!

1007
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,160
No, no.. Nikki.. Nikki!

1008
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:32,540
Nikki, wake up!

1009
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:34,950
Mehak, she's alive.
We need to take her to the hospital.

1010
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,450
Mehak?

1011
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:39,040
Mehak?

1012
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,120
Mehak..

1013
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,040
Mehak! Hey!

1014
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:49,660
Mehak, open the door.

1015
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:52,120
Mehak, open the door.

1016
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,540
Mehak, open the door.
What are you doing?!

1017
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:58,700
Why are you afraid of me, Mehak?

1018
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,200
Why are you running away from me?

1019
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:05,410
Your fight is not with me, Mehak.

1020
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:07,660
It's with your self.

1021
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,750
I know you're
standing outside, Mehak.

1022
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:17,870
I won't do anything now.

1023
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,540
I'm tired.

1024
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:25,370
I'm so tired.

1025
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,830
You need to get to
the hospital, princess.

1026
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:49,870
And your finger's in the freezer.

1027
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:08,410
Ma'am, I'm calling from B-603,
Overlook Apartments.

1028
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,500
Malad East.

1029
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,910
I need an ambulance,
it's a medical emergency.
