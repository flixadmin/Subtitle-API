<i>She has put me in trouble
and is having fun at my expense.</i>

162
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:59,755
<i>Once I find her I'll rip her apart.</i>

163
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,289
<i>But how could I?</i>

164
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:04,119
<i>That Jackass Tyagi
didn't file case</i>

165
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,485
<i>and I couldn't find
an excuse to go home.</i>

166
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:07,860
[Door opens] 

167
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:10,039
- Has the FIR been filed?
- Yes.

168
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,288
We have interrogated people
at the girl's college.

169
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,431
But no one has told anything.

170
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:17,279
Anusha didn't talk with anyone.

171
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:20,154
It was just her and her security.

172
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:22,565
I feel you were right.

173
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,422
The girl was living
under such restrictions.

174
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,181
She might have kidnapped herself.

175
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:27,636
You think this is a joke.

176
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,448
Is this how
the case will be solved?

177
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:33,787
Sorry. But I have some good news.

178
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,305
There was firing at the college
a few days ago.

179
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,180
But no one lodged a report.

180
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,680
Because Anusha's bodyguard
had fired.

181
00:11:41,064 --> 00:11:42,805
I have called the security guys.

182
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,102
Come. Come, sir.

183
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:48,689
[Mishra] Answer what you're asked.
Got it?

184
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:49,734
[Awasthi] Come, sir.

185
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:53,386
Sit.

186
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,636
Sir, can we go?

187
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:01,546
We are having this special
program for your guys.

188
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:02,953
Should we send
the chief guest home?

189
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:05,404
- [All laughing]
- But we are not at fault in this.

190
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:08,565
[Awasthi] We'll find the fault.
Don't worry.

191
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:10,566
Sir is here.
He'll take good care of you. 

192
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:12,108
- Yes.
- [Both laughing] 

193
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:13,932
What's happening here?

194
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,342
Interrogation of course.

195
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:23,905
How can you call my men here
without my permission?

196
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,182
Who are you?

197
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:26,879
Sir, this is Lakshman.

198
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,325
He was in the force before.

199
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,593
They are from his agency.

200
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,540
Yes. So?

201
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,556
Do you remember Gauri?

202
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,815
You came to my office
looking for a job a month ago.

203
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:48,235
Yes. I might have.

204
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:52,119
I didn't have a job then.
But now I do.

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,091
I can rarely tolerate
anyone interfering in my work.

206
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,765
Who was with Anusha in the toilet?

207
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,281
Who would go inside?
We were standing outside?

208
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,719
Who fired?

209
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:07,987
What firing? Who's this?

210
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,898
[Gunshots] 

211
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:11,934
So there was no firing
at the college.

212
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,005
No.

213
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:14,085
There was no firing.

214
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:15,326
Jackass.

215
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,692
You gave a statement
that there was firing.

216
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:18,835
How would I know?
I was doing my job.

217
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,353
You're lying.

218
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:22,879
[Man] Trust me. I'm not lying.

219
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,272
[Awasthi] Mishra, never mind him.

220
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:25,424
Just a second.

221
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:28,031
Joshi, bring him.

222
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,992
I'll fix them good. Don't worry.

223
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,808
Sir, he has seen him.

224
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:58,709
Saw whom?

225
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,691
At whom the security guards fired.

226
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:02,941
The guy with Anusha
in the bathroom.

227
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:04,673
Speak up. Wasn't there firing?

228
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,200
Absolutely.

229
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,353
Hey! Talk about what happened.

230
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,879
Gave me 2000 rupees.

231
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,986
He said go and tell the guard that I want
to meet Anusha Tyagi.

232
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:18,075
Tell the guard you want
to talk to Anusha Tyagi.

233
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:19,120
<i>Send her out.</i>

234
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:20,460
[Man] So I went.

235
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,246
Sir, the 2000 rupees
proved very costly.

236
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,057
I had to spend 2500 on medicines
because of the 2000 rupees.

237
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:32,612
The jackasses beat me up
really bad.

238
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:33,612
How dare you use bad words,
jackass?

239
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,987
How was that man built?

240
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:46,988
It's him. Who else?

241
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:58,319
Put this cloth on him.
He'll look exactly like him.

242
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,542
Darn you.

243
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,336
What quality have you drunk?
You talk rubbish before sir.

244
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:06,174
Jassi, take him out.
Make minced meat of him.

245
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,220
- [Shukla] Control.
- [Mishra] I'll kill him.

246
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,265
- [Shukla] He is...
- [Mishra] He'll die. Control.

247
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,283
It means there was firing
at the college.

248
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:16,229
- Awasthi, can a FIR be filed?
- [Awasthi] Yes, sir.

249
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,764
- Can we start the investigation?
- Certainly.

250
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,272
Where would Tyagi be now?

251
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,042
I remember what you told me, sir.

252
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,319
But this case is different.

253
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,131
Someone has lodged a complaint that
there was firing in the college

254
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:38,631
and perhaps
Anusha can identify him.

255
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:41,006
We'll have to conduct
a routine interrogation.

256
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,756
If I don't, someone else will.

257
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:45,895
Do this.

258
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,772
Call all your family members.
I'm preparing a report.

259
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,557
Can you call your wife?

260
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:54,678
What has she got to do with this?

261
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,951
Sir, Anusha is not here.

262
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,010
So we'll have to mention
in the report where the witness is.

263
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,281
It's a procedure.

264
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,442
Please call everyone.

265
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,228
Call madam wherever she is.
Quickly.

266
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,578
[Door opens] 

267
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:30,532
[Woman] Sir, she is taking bath.

268
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,014
[Cell phone ringing]

269
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,034
Excuse me.

270
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,559
Sir.

271
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:39,987
Yes, sir?

272
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:45,969
Yes, sir.

273
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:48,554
Yes.

274
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:50,411
Yes.

275
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:03,715
Sir, SSP wants to see you.

276
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:12,859
I knew he would exact revenge
for what happened yesterday.

277
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:19,494
He has sent you here
to arrest, right?

278
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:20,786
Wait.

279
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,885
Wait, you jackasses. Wait.

280
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:26,938
I will make the mothers
of all you dance naked at once.

281
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,063
- Darn you.
- Sir. Sir. Not arrest.

282
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:31,010
[Tyagi] You scoundrel.

283
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:33,950
You've been called to the hospital.

284
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:37,418
A body has been found.

285
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:16,312
[Rudra] <i>I wasn't able to feel bad
for the girl despite wanting to.</i>

286
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,526
<i>Because when you're in deep
trouble you think of escaping</i>

287
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,040
<i>and not of sorrow or joy.</i>

288

[Rudra] <i>The thin line between right
and wrong in my life had blurred.</i>

290
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:33,136
<i>Everyone present here had pain</i>

291
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:35,439
<i>for the girl and his father
in their hearts.</i>

292
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,501
<i>But there was only
one question in my heart.</i>

293
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,797
<i>What the hell.
The entire city is mourning here.</i>

294
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,467
<i>The father is weeping.</i>

295
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,270
<i>But where the hell
is the girl's mother?</i>

296
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,334
<i>Now I had no option
but to drag Madhu out.</i>

297
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:56,985
[SSP] Control yourself.

298
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,190
- Mishra, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

[Jeep door closes]

Mishra, go tell the security
that we want to meet madam.

302
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,064
[Mishra] Sir, she has left
for the hospital.

303
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,190
You have showed the right gesture.

304
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,527
You came to inform the family
of the deceased personally.

305
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,690
I'm really impressed by you.

I swear. I am very impressed.

[Tyagi crying] 

310
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,298
- Sir.
- Where had you been?

311
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:00,851
To make arrangements
for the post mortem.

312
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:02,431
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Sir.

313
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,832
Don't become slack because
the girl's gone.

314
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,305
There will be an uproar
if the case doesn't get solved.

315
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:09,233
Yes, sir.

316
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:11,081
[SSP] Be careful for a few days.

317

She has just died.
It's an emotional matter.

- Yes, sir.

- Send samples for the DNA report.
- Yes, sir.

00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:25,447
A lone man can't hang someone.

322
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,143
Right?

323
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,473
- Sir...
- [Tyagi] You finished her.

324
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:38,576
You finished the one
for whom I was alive.

325
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:42,064
I have suffered a loss alright.

326
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:45,501
But now only I won't cry
for my child.

327
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,924
You have a huge reputation.

328
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,994
In solving kidnapping cases.

329
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,461
Place a reward.

330
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,063
Reward of 10 crores.

331
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:12,201
Any man or woman
who can get those rascals nabbed,

332
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:14,826
I'll give him 10 crores.

333
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,897
I swear on my daughter.

334
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,919
If I don't rip them apart
limb by limb before their mothers...

335
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,306
I swear on my daughter.

336
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:29,032
[Weeping]

337
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:32,923
That's enough. Stop.

338
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:37,369
Don't you have any humanity?

339
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,924
You want to carry out
all the procedures now itself?

340
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,241
Let's go.

341
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,108
And I have a request.

342
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,065
Don't come to probe him
for a few days.

343
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,955
He has lost his daughter.

344
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:54,241
Ask me whatever you want to ask.

345
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,464
Here's my phone number.

346
00:21:57,368 --> 00:21:58,451
You are?

347
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,424
I'm her wife. Madhu Tyagi.

348
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,018
[Woman] <i>Do you know Govind Tyagi.
The sugar mill owner.</i>

349
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:13,458
<i>He is my husband.</i>

350
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,471
<i>You have to kidnap.
My daughter.</i>

351
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:18,602
<i>She is my step daughter.</i>

352
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,187
<i>It's the matter of one crore.</i>

353
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,000
