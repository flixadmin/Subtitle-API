That's right. Our right

171
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,416
is to kill these motherfuckers.

172
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,504
MAN [on radio]: Yeah, yeah.
It's up to us tonight

00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:15,939
to fight these things.

174
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,113
It's up to us

MAN [on radio]: That's right.
They're not gonna do it for us.

178
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,679
We have to do it for ourselves.

ARANDA: <i>I trust that everyone
made plans for your loved ones.</i>

I know it's not easy.

181
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,330
We have a nine-hour window

182
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:38,461
to assess, test,
and report our findings.

183
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:41,896
I would like to introduce
Wesley Marshall,

184
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:44,157
Global Rapid Response
team leader

185
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:45,767
and lead molecular biologist.

186
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,940
Evan Radcliffe
is second in command.

187
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,766
And Amy Chen,

188
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:55,418
chief <i>Canis lupus</i> biologist
and behavioralist.

189
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:58,158
They have been spearheading
our work here tonight.

190
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:01,810
[TV clicks on]

191
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,157
Now we know that the supermoon

192
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,897
triggers rapid DNA mutation,

193
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,810
and is photosensitive
to moonlight.

194
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:11,854
We hope to see
if this mutation can be blocked.

195
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,332
This team standing behind me
has developed a liquid

196
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,854
we call "Moonscreen."

197
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:19,550
It is our hope

198
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:22,202
that this Moonscreen
acts as a barrier

199
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:24,856
between the moonlight
and human DNA.

200
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:33,332
What we discover tonight could
go a long way to finding a cure.

201
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,898
It is not hyperbole to say

202
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,551
that our discoveries
could save millions of lives.

203
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,333
Emergency services
will be suspended

204
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,898
from sunset to sunrise.

205
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,247
Please stay out
of the moonlight.

206
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:56,509
Good luck tonight.

I love you, Dr. Chen.

220
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,250
Don't worry, Dr. Chen.

221
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,512
We've taken
every safety precaution.

He's gonna be okay.

Myles can feel the supermoon
is about to rise.

All the Year Oners
know it's close.

225
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:05,948
They can feel it.

226
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:12,164
Whatever turned him last year
left a compulsive craving.

He's an addict without a fix.
