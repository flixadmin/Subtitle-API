1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,545
- I'm telling ya, I know what I saw.
-.

2
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,848
There was a dinosaur creature

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,769
runnin' right through my backyard.

4
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:21,486
You don't say.

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,515
And there were glowing lights
coming from the treetops.

6
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,426
You don't say.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,455
And these giants orbs fell from the sky!

8
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:34,398
You don't say.

9
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:37,234
Then, after I came out of hidin',

10
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:39,704
they'd all disappeared.

11
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:42,261
Something ain't right.

12
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,476
Well, that's that.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,211
Yeah, I'm kind of nervous.

14
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,647
Things rarely wrap up
in a neat, little bow for us.

15
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:51,315
Come on, babe, don't be paranoid.

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,707
Life, it's gonna start going our way.

17
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,718
What the hell?

18
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,074
What the hell happened?

19
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,677
Did that look like another
Waverider to you guys?

20
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,245
Why is someone trying to kill us?

21
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:22,746
There must be hundreds of reasons

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,015
why someone would want to kill us.

23
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,982
Well, we're not gonna let 'em
get away with it, are we?

24
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:27,384
I say we portal back in time

25
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:28,985
and on to that rogue Waverider

26
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,654
and make them pay.

27
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:33,591
That is a perfect plan.

28
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,392
Now let's go gear up,

29
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,361
'cause we're gonna storm that ship

30
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:40,331
and save our Waverider.

31
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:42,433
Remember, when we get on that ship,

32
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:43,967
stealth is our friend.

33
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,136
Silent takedown. Got it.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,838
Wake me when the firefight starts.

35
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,240
You guys take out the crew,

36
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:51,108
and Behrad and I'll
take control of the ship.

37
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:53,644
Nate, let's do this.

38
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,931
Here we go.

39
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:00,683
It's out of juice.

40
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:02,652
- What?
- Every time with those things.

41
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:05,921
Wait, no time couriers, no Waverider...

42
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:08,991
we're stuck in 1925.

43
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:11,894
Everybody just calm down.

44
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,730
We just need a little time,
and we'll think of a plan.

45
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,798
Well, we definitely don't
belong in this time period.

46
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:18,119
We need to avoid any unwanted
attention from the locals.

47
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27,443
Afternoon, ma'am. Name's Pastor Hanson.

48
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,711
Is Gloria home?

49
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,380
Yeah, she's not here right now.

50
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,649
Oh. I just heard this, uh,

51
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:34,417
loud explosion over yonder,

52
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:36,519
and I wanted to make sure
everything's all right.

53
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:37,820
Flash him.

54
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:40,155
What? Oh!

55
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:41,823
Well, you know, there's all sorts

56
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:44,092
of strange things happening in Odessa.

57
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:47,796
Everyone in town has seen
these bizarre lights in the sky

58
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,932
and strange lizard creatures
in their backyard.

59
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,034
Yeah, well, nothing strange around here.

60
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:54,369
Flash him.

61
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:57,839
It's out of battery. I don't...

62
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,509
Say, are those claw marks?

63
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,977
Yeah, I... I'll tell Gloria
you stopped by.

64
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,347
Goodbye now.

65
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:06,981
Hoo! So much for laying low.

66
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,216
So town's already buzzing
with conspiracy theories

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,318
after the Zaguron invasion...
you guys, if we stay here,

68
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,021
- it could get really bad.
- It's gonna be okay.

69
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,856
And now that we have no timeship,

70
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,327
we are just a bunch of weirdos
with truly random superpowers.

71
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,896
And John, the one person with
a useful ability, is gone, so...

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,398
Well, hey, I was his student.
I mean, I'm not

73
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:26,834
a master sorcerer yet,
but maybe I could...

74
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,370
What, turn the townspeople
into household objects?

75
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:30,739
- Come on.
- Too bad we don't have

76
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:34,876
the Time Bureau timeship or
it would have that fail-safe.

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,377
Gary, you're a genius.

78
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,146
The last time the Waverider
was impounded,

79
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,914
I had a fail-safe installed.

80
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:42,516
- And fail-safes are?
- T-they're indestructible

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,285
lockboxes filled
with emergency supplies,

82
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:46,154
like a time courier or a mind flasher.

83
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,455
Breath mints, if we're lucky!

84
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,224
You realize the blast
could've sent that thing

85
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,159
flying anywhere on Gloria's
property, right?

86
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:54,095
So, we will split up
so we can find this damn thing

87
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,330
and get the hell out of here.

88
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,999
Now, let's go. Come on!

89
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,334
How you holding up, Z?

90
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:00,869
If you want to talk, I'm here to listen.

91
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:02,669
I know a thing or two
about getting dumped.

92
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:03,904
I was not dumped.

93
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,339
It was a mutual mucking up of things.

94
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:09,475
I am, however, annoyed that
John poofed his way out of 1925

95
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,278
without making sure
the rest of us were okay first.

96
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:12,746
To be fair, when he left, we still had

97
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,981
a working time machine.

98
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,615
Defending him is not listening.

99
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,751
Right, sorry. Continue.

100
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,052
I just can't believe,

101
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,387
after everything
we went through together,

102
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,923
all he left me with was this.

103
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:24,358
Ooh, freaky old key.

104
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,725
- Yeah.
- What's it for?

105
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:28,028
All he said was, "You'll find out",

106
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,798
with his trademark dramatic delivery.

107
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,499
In hindsight,
I probably should've gotten

108
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,801
- a little more clarification.
- Probably.

109
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,436
Whatever! I'm just gonna do

110
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,905
what I always do in these situations.

111
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:40,039
I need a makeover.
No, no, no, not a makeover.

112
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,474
I need a reinvention.

113
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,309
Like Madonna.
I think there's a headpiece.

114
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,378
Wandering through the woods.

115
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,847
Why am I not surprised
this is our honeymoon?

116
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,482
I know, babe, but as soon
as we find the safe,

117
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:50,650
we can get out of here, all right?

118
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,285
Yeah, well I'm way out
of my comfort zone.

119
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,521
- Which is?
- The Waverider.

120
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,589
- Lists.
- Rules. Don't...

121
00:04:56,613 --> 00:05:00,259
Well, mine is improvising, so together,

122
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,863
we are unstoppable.

123
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,554
Come on.

124
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,968
Based on the blast radius,
we're basically looking

125
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,137
for a needle in a haystack.

126
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,139
Look, I can track animals and people,

127
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,643
but random futuristic safes, not my bag.

128
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,144
All right, so what you got?

129
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,746
Any magical cheats to find this thing?

130
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,135
Yeah, I think I can remember
John's tracking spell.

131
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,708
Adiuva nos invenire aliquid.

132
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,746
Hey, not bad.

133
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:47,763
I think someone moved it.

134
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,401
That's not good.

135
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,126
Where did you find it, anyway?

136
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,152
Amongst them bushes at the
edge of Gloria Cruz's property.

137
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,601
Okay, the good news,
we found the Waverider's safe.

138
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,103
Yeah, bad news,

139
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,537
it's at the Sheriff's station.

140
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,272
Pastor found it nearby and turned it in.

141
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,807
That guy will come poking around again

142
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:24,742
now that he's even more
suspicious of your mom.

143
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,444
Yeah, and other neighbors could get nosy

144
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:27,979
and discover the remains
of the Waverider,

145
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,814
which would be disastrous
for the timeline.

146
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:32,283
We just need to buy
ourselves some time so we can

147
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:33,718
- come up with another plan.
- How?

148
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:35,720
We need to go on the defensive.

149
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:38,255
Right, and keep the heat off
of Gloria and this property.

150
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,757
And how are we supposed to do that?

151
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:42,011
If we don't have time travel
or mind flashers?

152
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:44,629
Rule 44.

153
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,263
- Rule 44.
- Yeah.

154
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:47,899
- I love Rule 44!
- Yeah!

155
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:48,999
What's Rule 44?

156
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,868
Uh, it's from our Time Bureau training.

157
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:53,237
The intent of Rule 44
is to create a diversion,

158
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:55,239
a cover story, when things
go sideways on a mission.

159
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:58,509
Specifically, Rule 44 states
that our cover story

160
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,110
must be a circus.

161
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,346
That is oddly specific.

162
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,114
We talking Cirque? Sideshow?

163
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,616
Straight up three-ring affair?

164
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,618
No, research shows
that the general public

165
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:09,286
is willing to accept the bizarreness

166
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,288
of any kind of circus without question.

167
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:12,790
So we have to put on a circus?

168
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:15,392
What? No, we... he's not listening.

169
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,927
We just have to make them
think we're in a circus

170
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,146
to allay their suspicions.

171
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,331
Group makeovers. Yes, I love it.

172
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,969
I'm gonna reinvent
each of you as performers.

173
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:27,637
Friends, you're in excellent hands.

174
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,106
Well, you heard her,
let's circus up, eh?

175
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,675
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

176
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,142
Good, 'cause I need your magic

177
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,310
to help fix my mom's porch.

178
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,712
- Sure.
- Hey, Nate,

179
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,547
while we are playing
defense as a circus,

180
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,315
you will be playing offense.

181
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,951
Time to use your superpower.

182
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:42,552
So, you want me to turn to steel

183
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:44,153
and knock around some skulls?

184
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:47,356
No, your other superpower.

185
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,559
You are a white man in 1925.

186
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,194
You go sweet talk that sheriff

187
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,529
and get him to give you the safe.

188
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,398
- Ava will go with you.
- What? No.

189
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:56,699
All right, come on, Gary.

190
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,386
Those period costumes
aren't gonna sew themselves.

191
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,164
Okay.

192
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:30,833
Yes.

193
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,334
Tie.

194
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,503
Button, please.

195
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:37,161
Mm, voilà.

196
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:40,575
My mom's not gonna be happy

197
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,076
when she sees
what we've done to her stuff.

198
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,445
Sorry, it's desperate times.

199
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,447
Oh! Nate borrowed your dead dad's suit.

200
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,149
Hope that's okay.

201
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:48,617
He better not ruin it.

202
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:52,654
Good afternoon, Odessa!
Come one, come all!

203
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:55,190
I know you have seen and heard

204
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,091
some peculiar things lately.

205
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,361
Well, I am here to assure you

206
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,697
that it is just business
as usual for us.

207
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:03,831
Why, you ask?

208
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:06,468
Because my compatriots and I,

209
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,437
we are members...

210
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,757
of the Guggenheim Circus.

211
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,160
You know, it's actually a very good fit.

212
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,428
Hey, do I look like a grandma?

213
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:27,397
Yeah.

214
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,366
- You the sheriff?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,502
I was just finishing up some paperwork.

216
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,670
How can I help you?

217
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,300
My name's John Edgar Hoover.

218
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,903
I'm the newly appointed director

219
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:39,673
of the Bureau of Investigation
in Washington, D.C.

220
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:43,677
This is my trusted secretary, Ms. Gandy.

221
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:45,979
You seem different in real life.

222
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,380
You probably saw an old photo.

223
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,215
I've been cocktailing my hair products.

224
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,851
But that's neither here or there.

225
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,719
Now listen up, Sheriff.

226
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:55,571
We're here to talk to you
about a very important matter.

227
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,874
There are so many exciting
things to see at our circus.

228
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,843
For example, exotic animals.

229
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,978
My cohort and I, we are animal handlers

230
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,481
from a land far, far, far away.

231
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,382
And of course,

232
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,952
what circus would be complete

233
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,909
without a little fire?

234
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:18,145
That's hot, that's hot.

235
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,630
Now, don't be alarmed,
but several of our creatures

236
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,799
escaped their confinements last night.

237
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,469
You may have, uh, heard some explosions

238
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,339
or seen some mysterious
lights yesterday.

239
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,542
That was just me,
testing out some, uh, displays.

240
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,878
True story, so if
you saw something yesterday

241
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,913
that looked like a dinosaur,
for example,

242
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,082
it was actually a Komodo dragon,

243
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,784
which is just a big, smelly lizard,

244
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,074
despite it's terrifying appellation.

245
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,790
Pastor Hanson found this strange box

246
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,859
over by Gloria Cruz's property.

247
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,794
I thought maybe it belonged to her,

248
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,596
since she's foreign and all.

249
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,263
Oh, well, we can tell you for sure

250
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:59,634
that it's not hers, sir,
but it is very dangerous.

251
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:03,004
Say, how did you boys
in Washington learn

252
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,305
about the safe so quickly?

253
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,308
The pastor only found it this morning.

254
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,243
I mean, if I told you

255
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,645
all of our nation's secrets,

256
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,714
they wouldn't be secrets
anymore, would they?

257
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,348
Yes.

258
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:16,583
And who knows, there may even
be a commendation for you

259
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,985
from President Warren G. Harding,

260
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,553
once the case is declassified, you know.

261
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:21,488
I believe she means Calvin Coolidge,

262
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:23,490
'cause Mr. Harding is dead.

263
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:27,327
People always get their
interwar presidents mixed up.

264
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,530
I need you to focus.

265
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,866
Are you ready to do the right
thing by your country?

266
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,836
Mister, mister,
tell us when the circus is.

267
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,270
I want to go.

268
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,306
When is it, you ask?

269
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,365
Like, uh, exactly what time?

270
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:46,847
You told them what?

271
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,515
I'm sorry, Sara, I just panicked.

272
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,116
I didn't mean to invite
the whole town over tonight.

273
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,351
Just take a breath, Gary.

274
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,452
We'll figure something else out.

275
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:53,520
Okay, wait, you're saying

276
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,755
people are coming here
for an actual circus?

277
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,089
Gary!

278
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:58,958
All right, all right, everyone!

279
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:01,360
Just calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine

280
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,096
once we open the safe.

281
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,965
Ah! That's right.

282
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,300
When the whole town comes over,
we flash the hell out of 'em,

283
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:11,203
and then we time courier
our butts out of here!

284
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:13,039
- Yes! All right.
- Classic. Classic.

285
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,974
That's right, another successful.

286
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:16,442
Legend missions in the books!

287
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:18,143
Ugh, it feels so good
to be back on track.

288
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,211
All right.

289
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,019
There's no time courier.

290
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,243
There's a note.

291
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,992
"Taking courier, beer run. Rory".

292
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:36,462
- Classic.
- What?

293
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:38,497
There's no couriers,
there's no flashers.

294
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,121
There's no...

295
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,869
At least there's a Time Bureau manual.

296
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:47,072
And gummy bears.

297
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:51,276
That's where I stashed
my emergency supply.

298
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,612
So that's it. Just a book
and some gummies.

299
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:55,647
- No couriers.
- No flashers.

300
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:58,317
- No mini-Gideon.
- No breath mints.

301
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:01,520
Hey, look, it's okay.
You guys, it's gonna be okay.

302
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:04,723
Look, as long as the town
keeps buying our cover story,

303
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:07,091
then we'll come up with plan B.

304
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:08,749
It's gonna be great.

305
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:17,102
That fella wasn't Mr. Hoover at all!

306
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:21,072
Hair products, my foot.

307
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:23,441
Is this the Bureau of Investigation?

308
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,944
This is Sheriff Thomas Wood
of Odessa, Texas.

309
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:29,536
I've got a situation down here
you ought to know about.

310
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,927
Wow, so we're really doing this?

311
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:36,959
We're living in 1925 for a spell.

312
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,828
1925 is a total hayseed year.

313
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,596
These people are covered in sunspots.

314
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,698
Microdermabrasion, still decades away.

315
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,133
Main thing I know about the '20s is that

316
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,168
they invented a lot of dance moves.

317
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,737
Maybe we should get out
of this small town

318
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,572
- and find the parties...
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

319
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,140
No, that goes against Rule 23,

320
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,009
which states that in order
to limit potential damage

321
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,945
to the timeline, marooned time
travelers should stay in one...

322
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,479
one location.

323
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,082
Okay, then we will stay put. All right?

324
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,084
We'll figure it out. First things first,

325
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,452
we got the whole town
coming over tonight,

326
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,654
and they are expecting a circus.

327
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,589
We have to put on a show
to protect our cover.

328
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,691
If there is no circus,
they may inadvertently

329
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,527
- see the Waverider wreckage...
- Whoa!

330
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,228
Which violates, like,
half of this manual.

331
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,729
- That cannot happen.
- Okay, well,

332
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,334
I just hope that
we get this done before...

333
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,269
Mami!

334
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,071
- You're early!
- Hi!

335
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,239
It looks like the humans
won the War of the Worlds.

336
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,808
We're all still here.

337
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,377
Mija, tell me, why are people in town

338
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,679
asking about a circus on my property?

339
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,248
We need to talk.

340
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,282
Are those my curtains?

341
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,903
- Is that Celso's suit?
- Yes.

342
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:41,489
I don't see how this circus act

343
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,224
gets us any closer
to getting out of here.

344
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:44,525
This is just triage, Astra.

345
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,759
Dealing with the problem at hand.

346
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:46,860
Without the Waverider,

347
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,196
we don't have a lot of options.

348
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,798
So if we are to convince
these town people

349
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:53,401
that we are actually a circus,

350
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,170
we need to practice. Let's go.

351
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,172
Want those juggling skills on point!

352
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:01,698
- You juggle, right?
- Is it that obvious?

353
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,679
They need to distract everyone

354
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:07,215
from seeing the remains of the timeship,

355
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,816
which blew up.

356
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,283
After the aliens attacked the house,

357
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:13,353
and we were saved by space mushroom...

358
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:15,523
Look, mija,

359
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,357
I'm already on thin ice here.

360
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,893
It's not easy for these people
to accept a magical hero

361
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,919
from another land living in their town.

362
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:29,570
But I trust you.

363
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,472
And if I am ostracized

364
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,675
or arrested,

365
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,711
then so be it, I'll deal with it.

366
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:39,947
Because you're my daughter,

367
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:43,038
and I would do anything for you.

368
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,030
Looking good, looking good.

369
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,365
I'm sorry, guys.

370
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm pulling the plug on this circus.

371
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,302
What? What's wrong?

372
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:04,103
Look, what's wrong is
that this circus is going

373
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:06,606
to bring a lot of unwanted
attention to my mom,

374
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,441
and she already feels persecuted.

375
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,143
This isn't just about us anymore.

376
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,444
Every time we try to fix something,

377
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,945
we just dig a bigger hole,

378
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,300
and my mom is going to be
the one stuck paying for it.

379
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:21,387
Look, we're sorry, Spooner.

380
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,589
You're right. This isn't just about us.

381
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,591
We'll get out of town and...

382
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:26,959
we'll figure something else out.

383
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:29,462
No more circus, no more commotion.

384
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,730
Thank you.

385
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,387
Where's Astra?

386
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,578
Surge a mortuis.

387
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,513
- What are you doing?
- What does it look

388
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:48,781
like I'm doing?

389
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,049
Well, it looks like
you're trying to fix the ship

390
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:52,350
using John's resurrection spell,

391
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:54,252
but that would be stupid,
because it's for humans,

392
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:55,621
not for timeships.

393
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,846
If John were here, this is
exactly what he would do.

394
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:03,629
Now shut up and let me concentrate.

395
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:04,949
You might want to stand back.

396
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:14,940
- Sheriff Thomas Wood?
- In the flesh.

397
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,374
You called the office in D.C.

398
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:18,343
about someone impersonating
a federal agent,

399
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,211
namely me.

400
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,347
J. Edgar Hoover.

401
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,948
Luckily, we were just
down the way in Midland,

402
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:27,006
so I thought I'd pay you a visit myself.

403
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,956
Welcome to Odessa.

404
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,025
I can't believe
the top lawman in the country

405
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,396
is standing in my very own station.

406
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,066
Again! The real one this time.

407
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,088
Now, tell me more about this scoundrel.

408
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:50,827
Surge a mortuis.

409
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,679
Surge a mortuis!

410
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:27,110
Is she doing what I think she's doing?

411
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,311
Whatever it is,

412
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,398
it's pretty cool.

413
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,858
It's likely that this
imposter is a member

414
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:43,693
of the Midland Robbery Gang,

415
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,829
an outfit we've been
tracking for some time.

416
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,864
- Bank robbers.
- That's right.

417
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:49,165
And you just handed that degenerate

418
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:51,167
a brand new safe to crack.

419
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,769
Now, which way did he go?

420
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,728
Hell's bells, he could
be anywhere by now.

421
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:06,716
Astra? Maybe you should stop.

422
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,116
You know, 'cause of the blood?

423
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,154
If John could do this, I can do this.

424
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:14,156
Damn it, Astra, stop it!

425
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,811
Multi facti sunt...

426
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,617
Astra!

427
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,410
Well, Sheriff, I reckon I know just

428
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:38,635
where this imposter is trying
to blow open that safe.

429
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,721
I feel like I was run over by a bus.

430
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,322
And since isn't the med bay,

431
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:03,025
I'm guessing my spell didn't
resurrect the Waverider.

432
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,961
No, it didn't.

433
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,996
What were you thinking?

434
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,999
Hey, a little sympathy?

435
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,935
I got injured trying to help you.

436
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,871
By creating another huge
spectacle at my mom's house.

437
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,573
Not what she needs right now.

438
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:19,474
I was the only one doing anything

439
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,266
to get this clown show out of Texas.

440
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,582
Think it through next time.

441
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:30,792
No offense, but your mom
lives in the boonies.

442
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:33,079
I doubt anyone noticed.

443
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,787
Someone did.

444
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,734
Guys, it's J. Edgar Hoover.

445
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:48,303
The real one.

446
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:49,771
He's gonna want to know who we are.

447
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:52,507
So, we are doing the circus!

448
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:54,876
No, no! Esperanza and I,

449
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,044
we will talk to the men.

450
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,612
Astra has to stay in bed,

451
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,948
but the rest of you cannot be here.

452
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:02,116
- Okay, um...
- Go, hide!

453
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,319
It's too open concept in here to hide!

454
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,954
Bedroom, bedroom. Go, go.

455
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,441
Go, go, go.

456
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,535
Evening, ladies. J. Edgar Hoover,

457
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,970
Bureau of Investigation.

458
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,906
Which one of you is Gloria Cruz?

459
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,308
I am.

460
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:28,810
How can I help you, sir?

461
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,145
I've heard about some
bank robbers in the area.

462
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:33,280
Unsavory fellas.

463
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:35,249
Just checking to make sure you're safe.

464
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,251
Oh, well, no bank robbers.

465
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,487
Just enjoying a quiet afternoon.

466
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,122
If you don't mind,
I was talking to the owner

467
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:43,714
of the property in question.

468
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:49,830
- I don't think it's working.
- Why not?

469
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:51,787
Try the closet.

470
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,070
- It's locked.
- Zari, the key.

471
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:58,605
John said we'd find out what it's for.

472
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:00,807
Maybe it's this.

473
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:02,376
Okay.

474
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,830
Fine.

475
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,004
No!

476
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:21,361
I think we'll have a look around.

477
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:23,797
Just to be sure.

478
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:27,756
I have a patient in there.
She's recuperating.

479
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:33,929
Go, go. Just go, go, go.

480
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,740
Where are we?

481
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:54,716
The Mansion?

482
00:22:58,254 --> 00:23:00,287
Hey.

483
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:21,687
So if we're in the Mansion,

484
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,055
does that mean it's present-day?

485
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,157
Did we make it out of 1925?

486
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:26,658
No, and yes.

487
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:29,194
But we're not in any year at all.

488
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:31,062
Gary.

489
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,331
This isn't really the Mansion.

490
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:33,999
It's a pocket dimension

491
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,834
that John made for himself.

492
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:37,736
John wanted a place
where he could be all alone,

493
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,705
so he... he conjured it.

494
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:43,661
So, if we go out the front door...

495
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:54,653
Is this a pocket dimension
in Hell, Gary?

496
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:58,882
I'd recommend only exiting
through the door we came in.

497
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:05,930
Why would John give me this place?

498
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:08,527
Is it possible that man is so conceited

499
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:12,637
he thinks I need an alternate
dimension to get over him?

500
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,406
I don't know everything about John,

501
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,142
but I know he loved you.

502
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,610
Maybe he just thought
you could use a nice,

503
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:22,213
quiet place to be alone,

504
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:24,816
out of the spotlight for once?

505
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,485
Out of the spotlight?

506
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,620
B, I thrive in the spotlight.

507
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,690
It's where I'm most me.

508
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:34,592
You're acting like I need to
find myself,

509
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:38,821
but I'm not hiding. It...

510
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,369
There's an answer in here somewhere.

511
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:49,039
It's just a book of rules, babe.

512
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:51,041
Rules we should be following, okay?

513
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,442
We almost ruined Gloria's life,

514
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,911
and we almost interacted with Hoover,

515
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:55,645
which means we almost changed history.

516
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:58,481
Yeah, but we didn't, huh?

517
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,218
Just...

518
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:02,886
Babe.

519
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,123
Hey, will you look at me?

520
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:08,192
I know it feels like
the walls are closing in,

521
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,627
- but we will figure this out.
- You keep saying that.

522
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,129
Okay, Sara? But we're getting sloppy.

523
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:13,563
And without memory flashers

524
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:15,331
or time couriers or Gideon to guide us,

525
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:17,166
we are lost, okay?

526
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,235
And you really think
that manual will help?

527
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:22,338
Probably not, but I just...

528
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:24,907
I need to.

529
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:28,344
- Okay.
- Okay.

530
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:31,933
You keep reading.

531
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:37,686
I have reason to suspect

532
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,821
that the Midland Robbery Gang

533
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:40,289
are holed up around here.

534
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:42,058
Sheriff Wood said
one of the gang members

535
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,461
got a hold of a peculiar safe
that was in his possession.

536
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,864
Mind if we search your property, ma'am?

537
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:52,074
Does it really matter
if I say yes or no?

538
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,165
Smart woman.

539
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,112
Okay, I overheard Hoover leaving.

540
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:06,136
All right, guys, let's go!

541
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:11,052
Hey, you coming?

542
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:13,789
Actually, I think I'm gonna just

543
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,390
stay for a little bit.

544
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:18,193
Oh, good for you, sis.

545
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:20,929
And in case you feel like
slowing things down a little...

546
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:24,198
What does that mean?

547
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:26,152
Oh, brother.

548
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:32,091
Come on.

549
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,481
You're back.

550
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,117
How did Hoover not see you guys?

551
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:45,519
Oh, we just hopped over
to another plane of existence

552
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:47,321
where space and time
don't function normally.

553
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:49,890
- No big whoop.
- You know, we could just

554
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,225
hide out in the Mansion.

555
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,659
We'd be out of Gloria's way.

556
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,728
Hiding isn't gonna get us
back to our timeline

557
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:56,495
or help us figure out
who blew up our ship.

558
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,299
- So, where do we go?
- New York City.

559
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:01,801
Guys, the manual mentions
an obscure scientist

560
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:03,736
who laid the foundation
for all of time travel,

561
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,039
a guy named Dr. Gwynn Davies.

562
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:08,308
He's alive right now, in 1925,

563
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:09,976
and he lives in New York.

564
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,344
- That could work.
- Right?

565
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,246
And you're okay if we leave here?

566
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,114
I guess, as long as we have a plan.

567
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:17,917
Good, because y'all gotta go.

568
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,952
I mean, J. Edgar Hoover's
suspicious of my mom.

569
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:22,222
Thinks she's harboring
some bank robbers,

570
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:24,924
the Midland Gang or something.

571
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:26,559
Hoover's indefatigable.

572
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,161
He's a bloodhound.

573
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:31,850
He won't let go of our scent
until he's won.

574
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,372
Then let's give him what he wants.

575
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:42,408
Make him think he was right.

576
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:44,744
We will be the bank robbers.

577
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,245
We'll lead him out of Texas,
away from Gloria,

578
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,882
and all the while, making
our way to New York City.

579
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:52,818
Bank robbers were a big deal
in the 1920s.

580
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:54,553
And we'd certainly grab his attention.

581
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,288
Yeah, and all we have to do

582
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:57,756
is rob some banks.

583
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,224
I mean, yes, please...

584
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:01,848
Can I just have a word
with you for a minute?

585
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:04,863
You want to go on a crime spree?

586
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:06,812
I mean, I don't even like
the idea of leaving this house,

587
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:08,781
but since we have to... listen to me,

588
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:11,450
we need to make very small footprints.

589
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:13,052
And remember, we don't
even have our equipment.

590
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:15,955
- What if somebody...
- Babe, look, you're right.

591
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,690
And I'm scared too.

592
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:20,826
But I believe in us,
and I believe in our team.

593
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,529
We're more than
time travel and superpowers

594
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:25,197
and gadgets and manuals.

595
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:27,733
We are the Legends,
and we can pull this off.

596
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:29,301
I know we can.

597
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:32,303
And as soon as we can time travel again,

598
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,273
we'll go and fix all
the changes that we made.

599
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,342
You can make a... you can make a list

600
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,311
of timeline IOUs.

601
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:41,846
You love lists.

602
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,848
And then we will cross
them off, every single one.

603
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:47,737
- Every single one.
- Every single one.

604
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,412
Mm! Fine.

605
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,095
All right, crime spree it is.

606
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,763
But just until we can time travel again.

607
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:01,699
I'd like to stay here
with my mom for a bit.

608
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,168
Astra should say too,
until she's fully recovered.

609
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,903
Okay, we'll just pick you guys up

610
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:07,705
after we help invent time travel.

611
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:10,008
Guys.

612
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:12,395
Hoover's back.

613
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:20,551
Y'all are gonna get my mom arrested.

614
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,319
Gloria!

615
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,774
Do you have any rope?

616
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:26,891
Gloria Cruz,

617
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:30,628
you've been withholding information.

618
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,663
It's the Midland Gang. They just left.

619
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,331
They forced us to cooperate!

620
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,619
They said they were going to kill us.

621
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,503
Come on, babe, let's go!

622
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,839
- Hurry, Sara!
- I'm coming, hold on!

623
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,540
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Get in the car!

624
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:46,999
Come on, Nate! Come on, come on, get on!

625
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,332
- See ya later, J. Edgar!
- Whoo!

626
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,748
Should've peed before we left Gloria's.

627
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:31,616
Sorry.

628
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:55,373
Hit the floor, boys, this is a robbery.

629
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:00,647
Not our first rodeo.

630
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:04,696
Whoa, sorry, little lady.
Uh, bank's closed.

631
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,933
Little lady? Who do you think you are?

632
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:09,768
Why are your teeth so pretty?

633
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:10,836
Fluoride.

634
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,971
Now, you heard me. Go on, get. Get!

635
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:14,439
This is a robbery.

636
00:31:14,463 --> 00:31:17,442
I know robberies.
You're running crowd control.

637
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:18,943
Ya heard the lady.

638
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,378
Get on the ground.

639
00:31:20,402 --> 00:31:22,347
And you, I want you to go to the safe

640
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,382
and get me $93.65.

641
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:26,751
Okay, okay.

642
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:27,786
- 93...
- Yeah.

643
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,987
I did the calculation, babe.

644
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:30,288
It's all we need
to get to New York City.

645
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,857
Small footprints, you promised.

646
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:33,525
- And give me the money!
- Well, actually,

647
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,259
I have enough here in the till.

648
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:38,262
No need to open the safe.

649
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:39,498
All right, look.

650
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,799
We weren't gonna say anything

651
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:44,403
till after the robbery, but come here.

652
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,704
We're the Midland Gang.

653
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:46,737
- No, way!
- Yeah.

654
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,539
I love the Midland Gang!

655
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:50,793
Huge fan.

656
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,312
I said get all the way
down on the ground, boys.

657
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,013
Ava keeps shooting the ceiling.

658
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:57,948
She hates ceilings.

659
00:31:57,972 --> 00:31:59,583
Two women?

660
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:02,419
There's no women in the Midland Gang.

661
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:05,055
You can steal money from a bank, fine.

662
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,357
But you don't steal
somebody's gang name!

663
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:09,326
All right, lady, look,
we don't have a gang name.

664
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,562
- Okay?
- Well, gotta have a gang name.

665
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:12,596
It's patriotic.

666
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,431
Oh, oh, what about

667
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,799
the Legends...

668
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:17,568
of Tomorrow?

669
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:18,869
Uh, it's wordy.

670
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,322
It is.

671
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:24,241
The Bullet Blondes.

672
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:25,642
Well, it's not just Sara and Ava.

673
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,910
We're in the gang too.

674
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:29,913
They're doing all the heavy lifting.

675
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,181
Bullet Blondes.

676
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:33,883
Damn it, B, it is catchy.

677
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:36,986
- Hmm, the Bullet Blondes.
- The Bullet Blondes.

678
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,922
The Bullet Blondes.

679
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:43,132
This robbery is the work
of the Bullet Blondes!

680
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:45,901
The Bullet Blondes!

681
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:47,337
You gotta be kidding me.

682
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,998
Now, y'all gonna put your heads down

683
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:50,733
and count to 100,
and pretend you never saw us.

684
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:51,768
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

685
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,303
Ooh, wait, wait, and, um,

686
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:54,938
go about your lives like
none of this ever happened,

687
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:57,207
completing any historically
significant events

688
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,907
you might otherwise have done.

689
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:01,510
Let's go.

690
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:03,045
Make way for the Bullet Blondes!

691
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:05,747
Whoo, the Bullet Blondes! Whoo-hoo!

692
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,551
Thank you all for you cooperation!

693
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:10,319
Sorry about the guns!

694
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:13,422
The Bullet Blondes! Bullet Blondes!

695
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,491
The Bullet Blondes, I like it.

696
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:16,858
Have to admit you were right, babe.

697
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:18,060
That went off without a hitch.

698
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:19,881
Guess we're the Bullet Blondes now.

699
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,053
Come on, Gary, let's go!

700
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:36,743
Whoo! $93.65 never felt so sweet.

701
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,179
I don't think that's gonna
change history,

702
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:39,880
but I am gonna write it down
on our to-do ledger,

703
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:41,349
just to be sure that it doesn't.

704
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:42,850
Hopefully Hoover is on our scent.

705
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,085
He's gonna follow us out of town,

706
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,153
away from Gloria's house.

707
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:47,173
Next stop, New York City.

708
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:51,381
Guys, something's up ahead.

709
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:56,030
What he already roadblocked us?

710
00:33:56,054 --> 00:33:57,632
Damn, that Hoover works fast.

711
00:33:57,656 --> 00:34:00,668
He's indefatigable.

712
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:02,670
It's over, Bullet Blondes.

713
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:06,663
Get out of the car and put
your hands on the ground.

714
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:10,845
- Gun it.
- What?

715
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:12,246
Are you sure?

716
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,214
I bet he's a pretty good aim
with that gun.

717
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:16,183
That's a good point.
Nate, get behind the wheel

718
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:17,451
in case he opens fire. Come on, Gary,

719
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:18,653
Let's go, come on, let's go.

720
00:34:18,677 --> 00:34:22,322
Go, Gary.

721
00:34:22,346 --> 00:34:23,924
Feet out of my face.

722
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:26,927
Oh, God, oh, God.

723
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:28,896
- All right, let's do it.
- Everyone else,

724
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,132
get down, get down, get down.

725
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,267
I said small footprints, Sara.

726
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,367
Don't worry about it, babe.

727
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:37,156
We'll fix everything, I promise.

728
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:01,027
Yeah!

729
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:02,996
We made it!

730
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,765
Did you guys hear something?

731
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,201
Yeah.

732
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:10,269
Oh! It's a fan...

733
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:12,505
- What?
- It's a fabbable.

734
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,907
- What are you trying to say?
- Something about bubbles.

735
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:18,062
- Indefatigable!
- What?

736
00:35:26,643 --> 00:35:28,787
Oh, my...

737
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:31,142
- what did you do?
- I don't know.

738
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:38,397
This is not happening.
This is not happening!

739
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:39,731
Hoover can't die.

740
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:43,120
Hoover... Hoover can't die!

741
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:47,606
Oh, my God. Thank God, he's alive.

742
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,693
Indefatigable.

743
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,677
What? What'd he say? What'd he say?

744
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:54,579
- I don't know.
- What'd you say?

745
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:58,015
I said...

746
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,370
"I never miss twice".

747
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:10,762
I killed J. Edgar Hoover.

748
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:14,288
I killed J. Edgar Hoover!

749
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:19,091
I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to.

750
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:20,360
That was... that was...

751
00:36:20,384 --> 00:36:22,193
- Sara, I am sorry.
- I know, I know.

752
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:25,892
He's, uh, very important
to the timeline.

753
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,227
The timeline? The timeline is ruined.

754
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:31,130
History is ruined, and
we don't even have Gideon here

755
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,798
to tell us how badly we've ruined it.

756
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:33,966
That's it.

757
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,501
I want to die. Goodbye.

758
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,536
I give up.

759
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,003
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

760
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:40,506
- Goodbye!
- Babe?

761
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,707
Did we break Ava?

762
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,375
Hey, hey, babe, you okay?

763
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,945
- No.
- Yeah, you're okay.

764
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,547
Look, I know I talked you
into this plan,

765
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,882
and it has admittedly gone sideways.

766
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:52,217
But we are... we're
pretty committed, okay?

767
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:53,653
So we gotta see this one through.

768
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,754
- I can't...
- Yes, you can, and then

769
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,255
when we get back to 2021,

770
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,490
we are gonna go on a real honeymoon.

771
00:36:59,514 --> 00:37:01,893
It'll be on the beach,
we'll walk hand-in-hand.

772
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:05,263
We'll... we'll listen to one
of your Stabcast podcasts

773
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:07,165
and watch the sunset. It'll be like...

774
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:10,134
Stabcast.

775
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:13,004
That's it.

776
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:14,973
There are no witnesses.

777
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:16,742
We're lucky.

778
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:18,443
We gotta hit the road, fast.

779
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,979
But first,

780
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,982
we gotta get rid of the body.

781
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:26,485
- Ava?
- Gary, that's your job.

782
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:27,772
Lose the glasses.

783
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:30,854
You want me to eat

784
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,089
one of the most important figures

785
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:33,591
of the 20th century?

786
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:35,492
We gotta get to New York,
and we gotta there fast.

787
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:36,927
We gotta find this Gwynn Davies

788
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:38,462
without messing up
the timeline any more,

789
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:40,197
and the first thing to do

790
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:41,664
is to eat this body.

791
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:43,500
What has gotten into you?

792
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:46,770
I have been reading true
crime stories my entire life.

793
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:47,871
This is my time to shine.

794
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:51,208
Shut up and eat up, Gary.

795
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,811
You're in the Bullet Blondes now.

796
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:56,413
I'm a Bullet Blonde?

797
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:58,616
I swear I take no pleasure in this.

798
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,217
Beyond just the taste of human meat,

799
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:03,353
which as you know, I find...

800
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:04,855
quite delicious.

801
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,474
Do it, Gary.

802
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:19,228
Astra, you're up.

803
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:22,632
Yeah, thought I'd make myself useful.

804
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,022
That's very sweet.

805
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:29,238
You're capable of so much more
than picking vegetables.

806
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:31,240
I have just recovered.

807
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:33,698
You have a terrible bedside manner.

808
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:38,902
Tell me, what did you do
to hurt yourself so much?

809
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:42,651
I tried to perform a spell
that I wasn't ready for,

810
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:44,507
and it nearly destroyed me.

811
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:47,722
My former mentor would be

812
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:50,091
so disappointed
if he were here right now,

813
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:52,226
saying I have to be willing
to walk alone

814
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,518
and risk it all if I want to succeed.

815
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,674
You know, my mother was a great healer.

816
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:09,010
She taught me everything that she knew.

817
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:12,480
But I was terrible at it.

818
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:15,483
It wasn't until I was able
to cast off her training,

819
00:39:15,507 --> 00:39:19,693
start fresh in a way
that reflected who I am,

820
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:22,022
that I truly became a healer myself.

821
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,192
Yeah, but...

822
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:27,828
walk alone, sacrifice yourself,

823
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:30,386
that's what magic is about.

824
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:39,045
Your mentor taught you
how he did magic, yeah?

825
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:41,569
But you're not him.

826
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,547
R.I.P.

827
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:50,283
So you're just gonna bury
the pieces of the Waverider?

828
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,986
Well, it ain't gonna bury itself.

829
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,521
I'm gonna miss the old girl.

830
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:55,722
Really?

831
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,979
Astra Logue getting sentimental.

832
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:02,129
Look, I'm sorry

833
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,863
I brought the cops to your mom's place.

834
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:05,665
I don't blame you
for being pissed about it.

835
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:08,568
No, I get it. You were trying to help.

836
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:10,903
I wasn't just trying
to help you, though.

837
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:15,132
I was trying to prove myself
to replace John.

838
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:18,044
I just wanted to show everyone
that I was worthy,

839
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,979
which I guess I'm not.

840
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,914
John?

841
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:25,251
We don't need another John.

842
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:27,253
We need you.

843
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:31,357
Astra, I wasn't mad about the cops.

844
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:32,724
I wasn't happy about them,

845
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:36,128
but I was upset that you almost died.

846
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:37,729
I like having you around.

847
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:39,787
You're like my best friend.

848
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:45,393
No one's ever said that to me.

849
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:50,108
But you're mine too.

850
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:51,443
Good.

851
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:54,413
And if anything goes wrong,
we'll handle it.

852
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:57,415
I got your back.

853
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,417
You know, it's too bad.

854
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,054
I almost finished that spell.

855
00:41:02,078 --> 00:41:03,155
You didn't finish it?

856
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:05,891
No, it was too much for me.

857
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:08,560
I bet John would've finished it.

858
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:10,062
Unum.

859
00:41:10,086 --> 00:41:11,963
That was the last word.

860
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:15,567
Unum? Sounds mysterious.

861
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:17,903
Wish Gideon was here
to make us a nice steak.

862
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:19,938
Steak? Okay, I wish Gideon was here

863
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:21,773
to make us a drink.

864
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:24,795
- Mezcal.
- Eh?

865
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:31,801
Who the hell is that?

866
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,700
Ay, dios mio.

867
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,640
Gideon?

868
00:41:52,664 --> 00:41:54,864
