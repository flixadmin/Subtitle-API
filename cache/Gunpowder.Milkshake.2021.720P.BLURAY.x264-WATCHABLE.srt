You're no longer

[Nathan] In your little massacre
earlier tonight,

722
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
you killed the wrong people.

723

And you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

to do with this?

I can assure you, this is not how
The Firm conducts its business, sir.

749
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:29,866
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

Now, I'm sending you

this is satisfactory, sir.

Yes.

So that makes you a killer.

And you've killed
more than one.

790

That is serial.

791

It's more
complicated than that.

Serial killers are, uh,
you know, mentally unstable.

They kill people
out of a compulsive urge.

So, why do you kill them?

796

For money?

are still paralyzed?

Yes. After that,
I'll get you to your mother.

[Sam] Right.

813
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:14,075
Yes, I've got it already.

"D" is for drive.
"R" is for reverse.

And you get to do the easy part,

-Hi, Anna May.
-No.

1023
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,366
No, no. You don't get to talk.

1024
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:31,158
Because you're a ghost,
and ghosts can't talk.

1025

You know how I know that?

Can we do this later?

1027
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,491
Because if ghosts could talk,

1028
01:08:37,366 --> 01:08:40,075
they would say something
before disappearing.

1029

Or at least leave a note.
But they can't.

So, ipso facto,
you're a ghost.
