1
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,516
- We're running late.
- We'll make it.

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,594
Keep it under the limit.
I don't wanna get stopped.

3
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,663
Never got a ticket in my life.

4
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,994
Roadblock up ahead.

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,905
How did they find out we were coming?

6
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,634
Keep it cool.
Maybe we can bluff it out.

7
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,683
Good evening, officer.
What's the problem?

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,487
We've had an infestation
of fruit flies in the area.

9
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,096
Any fruits or vegetables in the car?

10
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,428
No. We've been on the road
all afternoon.

11
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,592
We didn't even stop for dinner.

12
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,761
Mind opening the trunk?

13
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,497
It's empty.

14
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,438
- Is it really necessary?
- Afraid so.

15
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,969
All right.

16
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,875
Open the trunk for the officer, Parry.

17
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,280
I'd be delighted.

18
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,892
Can you recommend
a good motel in Central City?

19
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,298
Sure thing.

20
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,332
It's stuck. Maybe you can get it open.

21
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,542
What?

22
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,052
Get out of here!

23
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,270
I knew we'd be late.

24
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,969
- Where's our regular guy?
- How should I know?

25
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,011
- You want this or not?
- We're closed.

26
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:40,050
- It ain't even 7:00.
- I lock up when I want. So beat it.

27
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,623
Yeah, well, I'm sure as hell
not lugging this back to the truck.

28
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,776
Nine-eighty, pal.

29
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,874
You want me to keep
the meter running or what?

30
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,517
Keep the change.

31
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,856
You laughing at me?

32
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,694
Hell, a 20-cent tip
makes you a hell of a comedian.

33
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,066
No!

34
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,448
- Oh, I'm sorry, man.
- It's okay.

35
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,992
- Barry, I thought you went home.
- I changed my mind.

36
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,255
I wanted to check out
that security briefing.

37
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,559
Oh, my hero. Look, if you need anything,
just call me at Sabrina's.

38
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,397
Better yet, don't call.

39
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,964
You're still representing the department.
I'm going on my own.

40
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,905
There's someone I want to see.
A little unfinished business.

41
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,274
Business? If you'd get off of
this sugar train, you could slow down.

42
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,109
- Take a night off.
- You're late, Julio.

43
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,545
Go on. I'll get this.

44
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,434
I'm federal agent Mitch Lestrange.

45
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,870
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got
a serious problem here in Central City.

46
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:55,378
This evening, one of my field agents
transmitted snapshots from East Helltown.

47
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,176
The photos you're about to see
cost him his life.

48
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,183
Lights, please.

49
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,621
By now you're all familiar
with this thing.

50
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,750
The death mask of Rasputin,
Russian national treasure.

51
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,830
First and only time away from home.
Everybody wants to see it.

52
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,433
We think six people wanna steal it.

53
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,765
Here they are:
Kate Tatting, cat burglar.

54
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,770
Careful, son.

55
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,001
This one would tear
that whistle out of your throat.

56
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,875
Mark Bernhardt, pyro freak,
demolitions ace.

57
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,983
Franco Mortelli, professional driver.

58
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,552
Known in the Italian press
as the fastest man on earth.

59
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:40,556
Parry Johnson, chemist.
Did the gas in that Munich hanger heist.

60
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,957
Darrell Hennings. Has guns, will travel.

61
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,328
And Chu Lee, formally aligned
with the Green Dragon cult...

62
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:53,939
...until he realized his electronics expertise
was more profitable on the open market.

63
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,965
Everyone came into town tonight.

64
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:01,739
They're all here for one reason.
Believe me, it's not the local cuisine.

65
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,814
Lights, please.

66
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,474
- Questions?
- What's the mask worth?

67
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,388
Stones recut,
pull down about 15 million or so.

68
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,992
Intact, it's priceless.

69
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,561
Gold, jewels, of course.

70
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,063
But its history
makes the mask irreplaceable.

71
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,169
For those of you who don't know him,
this is Ted Preminger...

72
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,396
...head curator of the museum.

73
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,473
I came down here tonight
to let you know that my staff and I...

74
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,043
...are willing to cooperate in any way
to protect the mask.

75
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,704
There are some people who would just
as soon move the tour past Central City.

76
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,876
But the museum needs
this exhibit, desperately.

77
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,012
We've sold thousands of tickets.
And if Miss Wayne could have arranged...

78
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,524
...a longer stay,
we could have filled the hall for months.

79
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,629
Look, let's just get through
the next couple of days, okay?

80
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,165
Two hours ago we raided the pool hall
where the photos were shot.

81
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:00,601
The suspects scattered,
and we have nothing to go on.

82
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,307
Remember, don't call.

83
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,684
Ted.

84
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,817
Barry Allen.

85
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,254
It's been a long time.

86
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,927
So, what do you think?
Did I inspire the troops to greatness?

87
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,257
I think the reward money
is inspiration enough.

88
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,922
Right.

89
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,263
Last time I heard,
you'd been in some sort of lab accident.

90
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,769
- You all right now?
- Yeah, I guess you could say...

91
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,170
...I was a little under the weather,
that's all.

92
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,837
Lestrange is sweating.

93
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,606
If so much as a housefly gets through
security tomorrow, he'll pull the exhibit.

94
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,713
- Celia Wayne, Barry Allen.
- Hi.

95
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,616
- Haven't we met before?
- Maybe.

96
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:56,328
- I think we both took Ted's classes.
- And Celia made a career out of it.

97
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,226
I asked special permission
for duty at the museum.

98
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,959
- You don't have to.
- I want to do everything I can...

99
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,501
...to help it go smoothly.
- It's not necessary.

100
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,733
But if you've already made
the arrangements...

101
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,409
Yeah, besides it's been years
since I've been to the museum.

102
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,943
Why's that?

103
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,082
Well, I haven't had the time.

104
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,447
Yeah, you and the rest of the city.
But it's no surprise really.

105
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,916
I'm counting on the box office
from the mask to save our necks.

106
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,492
I've seen it happen in museums
all over the country.

107
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:32,529
Civic art funds drying up,
private patrons disappearing.

108
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,794
These days it's hard to keep
the wolf from the door.

109
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,630
There are six wolves I'm worried about.

110
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,639
Barry, cool. You're just in time
to try some of Sabrina's herbal tea.

111
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,805
- It's from her own garden.
- No, thanks.

112
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,009
Come on, Barry, it's terrific.
It's all-natural.

113
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,087
- Looks like a backed-up sink.
- Great for your digestive system.

114
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,316
One cup after every meal, man.
And you know the way you eat, right?

115
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,391
- What was that?
- Earthquake?

116
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,228
- Been getting enough sleep?
- Yeah.

117
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,102
Sabrina's got this brew.
It'll knock you out all night.

118
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,369
Julio, lay off, will you? I'm fine.

119
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,472
This wouldn't have anything to do
with your old pal at the museum, would it?

120
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,880
- No! Now, can we just drop it?
- Okay, fine. With pleasure.

121
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,715
Sabrina's got this girlfriend.
Came in town from New York.

122
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,483
She's a model. Lingerie catalogs, man.

123
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,992
I'll bet she has a lot of interesting little
hobbies too, like ant farms and voodoo.

124
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,688
So that last chick Sabrina set you up with
was a little spacy.

125
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,165
A little spacy?
Julio, she was engaged to Elvis' ghost.

126
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,381
- Now, what was that?
- I'm a little tense.

127
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,009
I think I'm gonna bounce down to the gym
and punch the bag a while. Okay.

128
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,883
Okay. I'll catch you later, man.

129
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,147
Sorry.

130
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,807
And put your gloves on.

131
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,956
Mr. Hennings, begin the operation now.

132
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,618
Yes, sir.

133
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:08,252
Johnson, ready for alarm-circuit interrupt.
Go ahead and cool the box.

134
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,282
Three minutes, Mr. Kovacs.

135
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,883
- Oh, you scared the life out of me.
- Sorry.

136
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,885
Have to work on that back draft thing.
It's hell with doors.

137
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,285
It's after midnight.
What are you doing here?

138
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,790
- Well, I just wanted to talk to you.
- You might have phoned.

139
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,122
Well, I called you at home.
You weren't in.

140
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,561
I can almost beat
a phone signal here, so...

141
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,723
In that case, you must be starved.

142
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:02,201
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- Barry, this is about something, right?

143
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,641
Yeah.

144
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,471
Yeah.

145
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,704
This speed thing.

146
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,213
Now, it's possible
it's affecting my brain, right?

147
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,875
I mean, psychologically, emotionally.

148
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,147
Maybe. Why?

149
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,918
I feel like my mind is stuck
in overdrive, you know?

150
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:25,325
I mean, if I start thinking about something,
anything, it's like opening a floodgate.

151
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,590
I haven't slept in three days.

152
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,998
- So, what happened three days ago?
- You don't have to play therapist. I know.

153
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:37,199
It was a newspaper article about
the Russian mask. The one on tour.

154
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:43,076
It was a nice big photo of Ted Preminger,
my archaeology professor in college.

155
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,946
- I didn't know you were interested in...
- Archaeology? Oh, yeah. Big time.

156
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,452
I even worked a couple summers
at the museum.

157
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,451
It was great.

158
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,093
Before I met Ted,
I was afraid to walk into the place.

159
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,094
Did you think one of the Aztec mummies
was gonna grab you?

160
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,926
No, I did not. I thought my father would.

161
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,492
See, he was always hoping
I'd be in a hockey rink...

162
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,638
...or a duck blind somewhere,
I don't know.

163
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,671
And when I went to work at the museum,
for the first time in my life...

164
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,971
...I could do what I wanted,
without fear of criticism from anybody.

165
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,604
Then my junior year
I switched my major to police science.

166
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,219
And this man, my mentor, my friend...

167
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,222
...he didn't speak to me for 10 years.

168
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,756
- Until tonight.
- Well, that's good, isn't it?

169
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,025
Tina, you don't get it.

170
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,599
Henry Allen wasn't much
of a father to me, all right?

171
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,166
Ted sort of took his place.

172
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,771
And when he shut me out...

173
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,135
...it hurt.

174
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,975
Maybe more than I realized.

175
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,912
And then tonight, like a damn idiot...

176
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,713
...I volunteered for security detail
at the museum.

177
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,253
Well, what's wrong with that?

178
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,551
Every time I close my eyes,
I see those thieves who blew into town...

179
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:05,356
...crawling all over the museum, ready
to snatch that mask from Ted's fingers.

180
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:09,831
So come on, hook up one of your sensors
to this brain and find out what's going on.

181
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,572
I don't need to do that, Barry.
The problem is painful. But it's human.

182
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,369
You'd see that if only
you'd stop whipping yourself.

183
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,444
- Whipping?
- Yes.

184
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,046
You didn't let Preminger down.

185
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,150
You didn't owe him your life's work
any more than your father...

186
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,876
...for not becoming a street cop.

187
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,580
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
you wound up square in the middle.

188
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:37,525
I mean, what is a police scientist if he's not
one half cop and one half archaeologist?

189
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,543
An apple for the therapist?

190
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,020
- What was that?
- Is there anyone else in the labs?

191
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,318
- No.
- Stay here. And I mean, stay here.

192
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,627
It's Hennings.

193
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,199
I'm in the main corridor.

194
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,566
<i>Nailed it, Mr. Kovacs. No guards.</i>
<i>Just a lot of quiet alarms.</i>

195
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,969
<i>I'll keep scanning until the</i>...

196
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,075
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

197
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,802
Hennings?

198
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,607
<i>Sorry. I thought I saw</i>
<i>a red light or something.</i>

199
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,410
Impossible. All security's down.

200
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,314
<i>Damn, there it goes again.</i>

201
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,079
<i>It's not a light, though, it's a</i>...

202
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,621
What the hell are you?

203
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,443
What happened to Hennings?

204
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,020
Just drive, Mortelli.

205
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,249
Did you see that?

206
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,620
Nothing.

207
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,321
Pull over, Mortelli.

208
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,068
Shut up and drive.

209
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,284
- What's that on the car?
- Don't panic.

210
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,254
- He must be on the car.
- Don't panic!

211
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,951
- Try to do something.
- Shut up!

212
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,596
Get him off or something!

213
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,560
- But he's not off!
- Hold back.

214
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,845
- What about Franco?
- Leave him. The damn job's a disaster.

215
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,256
Oh, great.
I got everything we were after.

216
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,857
<i>Precinct.</i>

217
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:05,629
Dispatch desk. I got a
single-vehicle collision, Fourth and Garrick.

218
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,066
<i>How many people?</i>

219
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,763
One injury.

220
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,341
Robbery suspect.

221
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,637
- Send an ambulance.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

222
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,609
Code three.

223
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,481
Thanks for taping me up.

224
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,822
- You don't want to go home instead?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

225
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,556
- As long as no one pokes me in the ribs.
- Take it easy.

226
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,359
Last night those ribs were cracked.

227
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,368
And today, just bruised.
Benefits of a messed-up metabolism.

228
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,836
I was thinking about
things stolen from the lab.

229
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,532
The components could be assembled
into a cutting laser.

230
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,270
- Powerful enough to cut up gem stones?
- Sure.

231
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,040
Check this out.
There was a guy in the car with Mortelli.

232
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,581
He wasn't one of the six photographed.

233
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,881
- I'm gonna get these guys.
- You can barely walk.

234
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,580
If they'd found you in the lab
they'd have killed you.

235
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,091
And I'm glad you were there.
But next time you get the urge...

236
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,130
...to chase a car
like a crazed Doberman, well...

237
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,393
- Yes?
- Well, don't.

238
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,881
So, Barry, what's your position?

239
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,044
Right here. I asked permission
to be assigned to you.

240
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,247
Sort of a liaison.

241
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,450
- Lf that's all right.
- Why wouldn't it be?

242
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,027
It's mainly so Lestrange
won't have to deal with you.

243
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,664
The man is paranoid.

244
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:46,202
In Rome, Michelangelo's <i>Moses</i> has nothing
more than a velvet robe for protection.

245
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:50,137
Sure. But six known thieves weren't seen
drinking espresso outside the Colosseum.

246
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,743
You agree with Lestrange,
we should pull the exhibit.

247
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,176
- I didn't say that.
- Maybe they're after something else.

248
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:00,114
The accumulated wealth of Central City
isn't stored here, for God's sakes.

249
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,118
Although, for all I know, it could be.

250
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,280
I don't even have the manpower
to catalog anymore.

251
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,622
Who knows what's stashed away
in some dark corner gathering dust.

252
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,896
Yeah, I think there's a few corners
around here that could use sweeping.

253
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,036
Ted, the mask is here.

254
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,494
The original presentation case...

255
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,435
...given to the czarina
by Rasputin himself.

256
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,934
The mask is in place.
Activating vacuum and sensor.

257
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,101
I may be a local boy,
but what's the big deal?

258
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,676
You've seen one Rasputin mask,
you've seen them all.

259
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,574
I don't think so.

260
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,706
Rasputin wanted to exert influence over
the Russian czars even beyond death.

261
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,252
He designed the mask himself
for the czarina's private chambers...

262
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,414
...so that he could always be near.
The secret's in the rubies.

263
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,422
When the sun is at the right angle...

264
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,960
It's all set up. Let me show them.

265
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,046
I referenced recent files
of the <i>Central City Daily</i>.

266
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,473
I think you should see this.

267
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,615
"A man witnessed a red phantom
sweep the outlaw motorcyclists...

268
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,192
...from their machines,
and then apparently vanish into thin air."

269
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,555
That's what I saw.

270
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,293
That's what hit me.

271
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,457
There's a couple other incidents
in the past few weeks.

272
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,101
He's even picked up a nickname.

273
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,328
- What?
- The Flash.

274
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:37,339
It's a spiritual vengeance.
He could be protecting the mask.

275
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,033
Like the curse of the pharaohs.

276
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,703
That's idiotic. There's an explanation.

277
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,748
Yeah, a hologram perhaps,
or a hallucination.

278
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,782
It doesn't matter!

279
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,650
Whatever it is,
it's either a cop or it's working for them.

280
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,950
Now who sounds like an idiot?

281
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:59,427
He called Mortelli by name.
And I checked the hospital report.

282
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:04,467
A cop called in the accident
not 30 seconds after I left it.

283
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,501
And the streets were empty.

284
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,935
I want out.

285
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,335
Anyone else?

286
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,543
- You won't get a nickel if you leave now.
- So?

287
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,116
But if you do one thing
more for me, Bernhardt...

288
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:25,755
...l'll give you
a generous cancellation fee.

289
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,593
- What do you want?
- That troublesome red ghost.

290
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,656
We're gonna send him back to hell.

291
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,999
Out of 238 days...

292
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:44,267
...twenty-two cities,
and maybe I can put my feet up.

293
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,037
Hey, what finally convinced you
to bring the mask here?

294
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,715
Ted Preminger.

295
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,983
I thought that was fairly obvious.

296
00:25:56,321 --> 00:26:00,951
Besides, it gave me a chance
to come back and see the old place.

297
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,663
I really missed it. Cobwebs and all.

298
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,995
Yeah. I did too, I guess.

299
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,365
What made you finally quit, Barry?

300
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,272
Well, a lot of things really.

301
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:23,371
I couldn't see myself locked in a museum
basement cataloging bones, you know.

302
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,685
And I wanted to have
some effect on the world.

303
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,616
Do something.

304
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,218
What?

305
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:38,385
I'm sorry. But you did finally
end up in a lab anyway, right?

306
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,094
I do my share of running around.

307
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:52,106
Nice one, Murph.
That's first-century Etruscan bronze.

308
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,802
It'll be all right.
It's made out of metal, isn't it?

309
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,984
Yo, ham and eggs, hit the spricks.
The night shift has arrived.

310
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,985
- How you doing, Barry?
- Great. What do you got there, Bellows?

311
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,889
Snacks. We're here for the long haul.

312
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,087
Good evening, my dear.
I'm Officer Murphy.

313
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,664
Will you be staying with us
for the late show?

314
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,302
No, actually,
I need to get back to my hotel.

315
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,770
Oh, what a shame. And my partner
has prepared a most superb cold buffet.

316
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,809
Will you can it?
Just corned beef sandwiches, you know.

317
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,337
- I'll see you later.
- Good night.

318
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,117
Good night.

319
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,780
What's happening at the station?

320
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:45,328
Usual dull stuff. Oh, yeah, there was
some nut who left a message for the Flash.

321
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,795
- What?
- The Flash. You remember?

322
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:52,027
- His buddy.
- He's out there. I saw him once.

323
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:56,537
- Yeah, sure.
- So, what did this nut want?

324
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:01,474
It was about the Star Lab robbery.
Said he wanted El Flasho to meet him...

325
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,479
...at midnight
at some poolroom on River Street.

326
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,847
Probably wants to play a real quick game
of eight ball. Right, Bellows?

327
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,018
Well, I'm off.

328
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,387
- See you, Bar.
- Good night, guys.

329
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,356
Hey, Barry.

330
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,428
- Take a sandwich.
- Thanks.

331
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,029
I'll probably need it.

332
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,860
- These look fantastic.
- Not yet.

333
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,019
I'm here.
What was it you wanted to tell me?

334
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,862
Hurry up, darling.
You're missing my favorite program.

335
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,929
You've never seen anything like this guy.

336
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,305
Bernhardt?

337
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,799
You missed the show.

338
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,098
I don't think so.

339
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,318
Oh, that's fine
right there, Charlie. Thanks.

340
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,730
Look, it took a day,
but that's every jewel thief...

341
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,596
...who's stolen more than a rhinestone
in the past five years.

342
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,997
But I'd better warn you...

343
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,732
...there are file clerks coast-to-coast
that are calling for your head.

344
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,405
I see you took my advice
about slowing down.

345
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,877
Did you get out to Crystal Beach?

346
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,209
You're sunburned, man.

347
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,113
Beach? Yeah.

348
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,719
Yeah.

349
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,445
What are you looking for, anyway?

350
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,420
I got a description of the guy
in the car with Mortelli.

351
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,287
Anonymous witness.

352
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,657
It will be midnight
before you even dent that pile.

353
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,530
Julio, we're gonna be hungry pretty soon.
Why don't you get us something to eat?

354
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,500
Bagels and borscht.
My pleasure, your treat?

355
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,664
- Bagels and borscht?
- There's a new deli over in Little Moscow.

356
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,404
- I figured I'd just...
- Ham, eggs, toast.

357
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,307
White toast?

358
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,483
Damn.

359
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,308
I ran an exhaustive
background cross-check.

360
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,807
Kovacs has worked with
Tatting and Johnson before.

361
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,412
You trust this anonymous witness?

362
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,072
- Like I trust myself.
- Kovacs. That makes sense.

363
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,846
Nice work, Allen.
Not bad for a lab guy.

364
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,352
Thank you.

365
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:43,756
Now, I've got a complete dossier, m.o.,
everything we need to prepare for him.

366
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,386
Prepare? You don't prepare for Stan Kovacs.
You take your toys and go home.

367
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:51,399
- What? Mitch, you can't just...
- Oh, yes I can.

368
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,629
I warned you and I warned your boss
in Washington, this is my call.

369
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,707
Lestrange, I didn't think
you'd back off from a fight.

370
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,242
With Kovacs in, everything changes.
I'm not gonna take responsibility.

371
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,347
- I want the mask out in six hours.
- That's impossible.

372
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,676
I can't arrange proper transport
till morning.

373
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,250
You got six hours, lady.

374
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,252
Or else I throw the thing
in a paper sack and drive it myself.

375
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,550
Triple the guard on the mask.
You can break it to Preminger.

376
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,628
I'll talk to Ted. You've done enough.

377
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,360
They know you're in town.

378
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:28,335
Lestrange is gonna move
the mask within six hours.

379
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,100
Stan, I tried to stall them.

380
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,234
We have to make it work tonight.

381
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,780
Ted?

382
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,509
How did you find me here?

383
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,343
Only place left.

384
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,656
- Did Celia explain about...?
- Yeah.

385
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:53,263
Well, we had a couple days
of glory, anyway.

386
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,203
- Remember this room?
- Sure.

387
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,634
It got flooded one spring.

388
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,835
Guess it never reopened.

389
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:09,469
I was gonna use the extra revenue
to refurbish the whole wing.

390
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,344
- New exhibit cases, dioramas.
- Ted, I'm sorry.

391
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:18,478
I wanted to protect the mask for you. I
never expected Lestrange to pull the exhibit.

392
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,817
You did your job.

393
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,792
You were always thorough.
It's what I liked about you.

394
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:29,797
I could count on your research.
Like your little speech about the mask.

395
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,832
I'm just sorry it took your job
to bring you back here.

396
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,267
I'm here because I want to be.

397
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,973
As far as the mask,
I didn't have to research that.

398
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,634
You told me that story
and I never forgot it.

399
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,974
I never forgot any of it.

400
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,017
The last time we talked,
I told you I was leaving the museum.

401
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,623
I was 19.
I'm sorry, but the relics of the world...

402
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,090
...hundreds or thousands of years old
just didn't seem to matter.

403
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,424
But now I need you to understand
that your time...

404
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,868
...and your attention
weren't wasted on me.

405
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,170
You were wrong to shut me out.

406
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,509
And I guess I was wrong
for not telling you all of this sooner.

407
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,116
Barry, you were my favorite student.

408
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,217
I made a mistake.

409
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,552
And it looks like it was my loss.

410
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,164
I'm sorry.

411
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,807
Chief Cooper just pulled all
Central City P.D. Units from the museum.

412
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,138
You've got a crime wave
out there, Allen.

413
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:52,180
Half a dozen major jobs already
all over the city and more in progress.

414
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,113
Kovacs.

415
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,179
It's been a setup all the time.

416
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:01,052
While every cop in town sits on the mask,
they pick Central City clean.

417
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,888
And there's no way
we can be in 10 places at once.

418
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,927
Get your jewelry off and into the bag.

419
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,794
And do it now!

420
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,605
There's a substantial penalty
for early withdraw.

421
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,926
Going somewhere?

422
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,430
I must have inhaled some residual gas.

423
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,104
- You can't exist.
- You need a reality check.

424
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,879
Please! I'm claustrophobic.

425
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:23,483
I prefer you in a tux,
but I'll take you any way I can get you.

426
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,629
Get me...

427
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,795
...rich.

428
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,706
That's treason, Miss Tatting.

429
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,682
Well, phantoms don't bleed.

430
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:53,381
So unless you'd like to be sliced up,
I'd stand very still.

431
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:33,186
This officer is transporting the mask.
We'll need an escort.

432
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,834
In the bag. Let's go. Let's go.
Move, move, move.

433
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,029
In the bag. Let's go.
Come on, hurry up, hurry up. Put it in here.

434
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,107
In the bag. All right, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on.

435
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,574
May I see your invitation, sir?

436
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,541
It won't work without this.

437
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,951
Or this. Had enough?

438
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,181
Get up, get up, get up. Come on.
Get up. Get up.

439
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,331
Four down, Kovacs to go.

440
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,000
But where?

441
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,006
<i>Several of the components could be</i>
<i>assembled into a cutting laser.</i>

442
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,378
<i>Powerful enough to cut up</i>
<i>gem stones, right?</i>

443
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,780
<i>Sure.</i>

444
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:34,288
It's a double fake.
He was after the mask all along.

445
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,560
- They'll be out for another 20 minutes.
- I switched off all the sensors.

446
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,767
Five years I've planned and waited.

447
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:28,267
You can plan for the next
25 in Leavenworth, Kovacs.

448
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,574
Lestrange. Thank God you're here.

449
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,308
He knocked out all the guards
and he forced me to...

450
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,681
Can it, Wayne.
That's one hook I won't bite. Drop it.

451
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,526
Nice shot, love.

452
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,187
- Stan, when do we meet the others?
- We don't.

453
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,662
If we're lucky,
they've been arrested by now.

454
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,496
Get the mask, damn it!

455
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,065
How many times do I have to kill you?

456
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,069
Celia, what's happening?
I heard a shot.

457
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,269
What are you doing with the mask?

458
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:44,779
Just get away from me, Ted.
Just be smart and let it go.

459
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,943
I can't.
I worked too hard to bring it here.

460
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,247
So did I. Just get out of my way.
I don't wanna hurt you.

461
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,185
Then don't.

462
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,516
Take the mask, Ted.

463
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:06,033
- Where the hell did you come from?
- Right here.

464
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,366
I never really left.

465
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:15,143
- My God, you're bleeding.
- Yeah. Would you call my doctor?

466
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,577
Her name's McGee.

467
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,253
Did you see this?

468
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:33,226
I can't believe this rag.
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

469
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,696
As long as you stay in the tabloids,
you're still just a rumor.

470
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,960
It looks like this Flash name
is gonna stick.

471
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,465
Swell.

472
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:44,198
I don't know, I think it's kind of sexy.

473
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,069
I beg your pardon?

474
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:50,275
I don't believe I've ever heard you
use that word before.

475
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,812
Sexy, huh?

476
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,382
Yeah. You know,
like a sports car or an after-shave.

477
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,416
Oh, thank you.

478
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,853
Where is that kid?
I told Eve I'd have him home by 3.

479
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,822
Hey, Uncle Barry.
Can I stay a while longer?

480
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,691
Dr. Preminger is gonna show me this room
that hasn't been opened for a long time.

481
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,457
Shawn, it's getting kind of late.

482
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,295
But there's swords and spears
and knights in there.

483
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,403
Come on, it's the boy's first time here.

484
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:17,768
- I'll have him back in 10 minutes.
- Ten minutes.

485
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,239
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

486
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,105
Why didn't you go? You loved those
forgotten corners of the museum.

487
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,646
Not that one.

488
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:28,410
They're still looking for the guy
who punched 12 holes...

489
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,053
...in that 500-year-old tapestry.

490
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,417
