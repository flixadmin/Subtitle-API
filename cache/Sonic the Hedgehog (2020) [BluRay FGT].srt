1
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,113
So, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,365
Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog

3
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:17,119
being chased by a madman
with a mustache from the Civil War?

4
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,328
Well, to be honest,

5
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,956
It feels like I've been running
my whole life.

6
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,709
Is this too much? Am I going too fast?

7
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,420
It's kind of what I do--
You know what? Let's back up.

8
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,930
This is the island where I'm from.

9
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,349
It had everything.

10
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,768
Sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls,

11
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,729
public access to loop-de-loops.

12
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,647
And I never had to catch a school bus

13
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,983
because I could run
across the entire island

14
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,860
in less than two seconds.

15
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,695
Also there was no school.

16
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,905
I know, pretty sweet island, right?

17
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,574
Yeah!

18
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,786
I was born with extraordinary powers
and was told to keep them secret.

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,956
And like any kid,
I did the exact opposite.

20
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,836
That's Longclaw. She took care of me.

21
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,382
She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi
if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.

22
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,010
Sonic, someone could have seen you.

23
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,763
No one saw me. I'm too fast!

24
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,765
And I wanted to bring you this.

25
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,936
Get down!

26
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,152
Turns out, with great power
comes great power-hungry bad guys.

27
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,237
And I led them right to us.

28
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,212
Listen carefully, Sonic.

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,675
You have a power unlike
anything I have ever seen.

30
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,094
And that means someone
will always want it.

31
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,889
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

32
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,104
This world is on the far side
of the universe.

33
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,480
You should be safe there.

34
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,316
- I don't want to go without you.
- You must.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,985
These rings will be
your most important possession.

36
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,409
If you're ever discovered, use one.

37
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,869
Never stop running.

38
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,913
Now go!

39
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,876
Longclaw!

40
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,546
Goodbye, Sonic.

41
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,588
No!

42
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,384
No!

43
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,828
Come on, one car?

44
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,381
I'm bored.

45
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,008
Tom, do you read me? Are you there?

46
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,845
No, Wade,
I'm actually on a yacht in Barbados.

47
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,555
With Rihanna.

48
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,682
O-M-G.

49
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,350
That's amazing. Please send pics.

50
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,478
No, Wade. I'm at the speed trap.

51
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,731
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean!

52
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,566
Hang on, I think I got something.

53
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,743
Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?

54
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,620
Got kids living around here.

55
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,248
I thought that was kind of funny. Sorry.

56
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,130
What?

57
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,630
Tom, we need you down on Main Street.

58
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,549
There's been a violent gang shoot-out.

59
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,428
Just kidding. A duck stole a bagel.

60
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,180
But they do need it back.

61
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,361
Whoa, buddy. You almost
got yourself killed out there.

62
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,488
What are you,
some kind of adrenaline junkie?

63
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,657
It must be rough being slow ail the time.

64
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,035
Tell you what. Today is your lucky day.

65
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,834
Have you ever felt so alive?

66
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,754
This is great. You're doing amazing.

67
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,339
Geez!

68
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,842
Good recovery.

69
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,763
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

70
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,017
You never saw me. I was never here.

71
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,074
So, what were you expecting?

72
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,162
A dirty little hedgehog eating berries
and struggling to survive?

73
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,750
Think again. Because I am
living my best life on Earth.

74
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,501
I've got a library...

75
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,880
a home gym,

76
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,090
and a state-of-the-art security system.

77
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,604
No.

78
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,067
And if I'm ever discovered,
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions

79
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,986
and use my rings
to escape to a new planet.

80
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,240
A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.

81
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,745
Gross, smelly mushrooms.

82
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,373
I hate mushrooms.

83
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,834
But let's not worry about ail that.

84
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,339
This is Green Hills,
the greatest place on Earth.

85
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:50,637
These are my people, and, dare I say,
I am their lovable space creature.

86
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,555
So what if they don't know I exist?

87
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,727
My favorite person is the Donut Lord,

88
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,188
protector of this town

89
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,984
and defender of all creatures,
big and small.

90
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,068
Morning.

91
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,945
Donald. Daisy. Daffy.

92
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,615
Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady.

93
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,867
She is super nice to animals

94
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,996
and strangely was born without bones.

95
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,998
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

96
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,292
There is one person in town
who's actually onto me.

97
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,586
He calls me the blue devil.

98
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,547
I almost caught him last night.

99
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,465
Say hello to Crazy Carl.

100
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,595
We have fun together.

101
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,808
I know you're out there!

102
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,811
And I know you're real!

103
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,439
No, I'm not!

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,607
Movie night is my favorite.

105
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,609
Please, please.

106
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,653
Yes! Keanu!

107
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,363
You are a national treasure.

108
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,824
- When I find you--
-Pop quiz, hotshot.

109
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,659
There's a bomb on a bus.

110
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,161
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

111
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,871
It's a classic line.

112
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,540
Basically, we're like a family.

113
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,043
Even though we haven't met yet.

114
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,630
You don't think your prolonged isolation
is making you a bit crazy perhaps?

115
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,632
Crazy? Me?

116
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,302
No way, Doc. You got me ail wrong.

117
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,765
And despite ail these so-called friends
of yours, deep down,

118
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,892
you're still rather lonely?

119
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,901
Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?

120
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,919
Hey! No, no.

121
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,629
Get out of there. Come on.

122
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,048
Come on! Get out of there!

123
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,550
Get out of there, you trash pandas.

124
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,930
Maddie, as Green Hills'
most respected veterinarian,

125
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,058
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a raccoon?

126
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,602
Hi, Ozzy. Hello! You're glad to see me.

127
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,853
You don't eat garbage, do you?

128
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,022
What's that?

129
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,526
- Is that what I think it is?
- Open it.

130
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,986
It's kind of small. Is that bad?

131
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,780
Just open it.

132
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,537
"Dear Thomas,

133
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,456
We have reviewed your application
to the San Francisco Police Department,

134
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,209
and pending interdepartmental review
and background check,

135
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,671
we are happy to inform you that you have
been selected to join our team."

136
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,172
- My God!
- Wow.

137
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,174
My God.

138
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,634
Ta-da!

139
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,137
"San Francisco Sucks."

140
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,515
Wrong one!

141
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,893
Ta-da!

142
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,523
- You never had a doubt?
- No!

143
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,987
- I can't believe this.
- I know! You did it.

144
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,115
Hey, what are those?

145
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,743
Apartments for rent I found on Zillow.

146
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:05,832
I thought Ozzy and I could fly there
tomorrow and check out some neighborhoods.

147
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,252
I mean, this is ail happening so fast.

148
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,005
Man. It's the craziest thing.

149
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,340
You apply for the job, you get the job.

150
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,925
Well, pending a background check.

151
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,093
Man.

152
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,597
Hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

153
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
Correction: I'm still using
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

154
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,644
But, Maddie, are you sure
you're okay with this?

155
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,771
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

156
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,191
what did you do the entire time
I was in veterinary school?

157
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,234
I worked a second job
to pay the rent and--

158
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,111
A third job to pay tuition.

159
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,115
You sacrificed for me.
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

160
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,077
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

161
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,748
I mean, there's been
a Wachowski protecting this town

162
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,791
for more than 50 years.

163
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,211
This is a big change.

164
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,588
I'm positive.

165
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,217
It's time for this guy to get out there
and prove himself.

166
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,179
I love Green Hills, but, you know,
I want to help people in real trouble.

167
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,474
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-and-death situation

168
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,226
and I'll be there for 'em.

169
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,144
I get it.

170
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,189
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

171
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,068
And so it is with a heavy heart
that I tell you all

172
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,363
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco Police Department,

173
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,156
effective immediately.

174
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,035
It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown
and all my friendships.

175
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,121
But this is something
I feel like I need to do

176
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,293
to grow... as both an officer and a man.

177
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,215
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

178
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,968
That wasn't so bad, right?

179
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,012
Now all I got to do is...

180
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,556
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

181
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,978
Whoa, the playoffs!

182
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,316
So cool.

183
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,488
Bottom of the ninth, tie score.

184
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,117
And exactly who you want at the plate
with the game on the line-- Sonic!

185
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,994
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

186
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,289
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills--

187
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,749
also Sonic.

188
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,292
Okay. Focus, Sonic.

189
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,337
If you win this game, you'll be
the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

190
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,219
Hit it to the guy in left!
He's a real space case.

191
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,391
I can't with that guy.

192
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,604
Hey, batter Sonic. Hey, batter Sonic.
"Suh-wing," batter Sonic.

193
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,613
I got it, I got it, I got it!

194
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,907
I don't got it.

195
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
Go home! Go home!

196
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,669
Come on!

197
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,634
Safe!

198
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,806
Yes! Yes! I did it!

199
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,683
Did you see that? I did it. I did it.

200
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,782
I really am alone.

201
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,035
All alone. Forever.

202
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,698
I'm sure no one noticed
that giant blue explosion, right?

203
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,626
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom.

204
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,420
Wade here.

205
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,172
What is going on?

206
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,174
Well, gosh, I think the power's out.

207
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,594
Yeah, no dur! The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

208
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,679
- What should I do?
- Okay, relax.

209
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,598
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

210
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,766
see if they can locate
the downed line, then...

211
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,270
call Zim and see if he can
get his generator over to the Super Q

212
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,605
so the food stays fresh.

213
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,484
Call Zim before Gil?

214
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,986
- Call Gil-- Hello?
- I'll call you back.

215
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,322
Wait! Hello?
Was that the end of the instructions?

216
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,826
Okay, all right. You can do this.

217
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,747
What was the first thing he said to do?

218
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,501
Right. Relax.

219
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,730
Twenty minutes ago,

220
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,484
an energy surge knocked out power
across the entire Pacific Northwest.

221
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,568
What do we know?

222
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,071
Well, our first instinct was
it was an EMP.

223
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,574
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

224
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,244
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

225
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,746
The Department of Energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

226
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,707
Well, sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

227
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,085
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

228
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,337
I'm suggesting we scramble
the Fifth and Sixth Regiment.

229
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,505
No, no, no, no.

230
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,132
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.

231
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,009
Someone who understands technology.

232
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,845
- You want to send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

233
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,430
A lab rat with teeth.

234
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,683
You're not suggesting
who I think you're suggesting.

235
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,518
- I know, he's a little weird.
- Weird?

236
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,145
- No. No way.
- He's a psychological tire fire!

237
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,649
But he's also brilliant.
Five PhDs, IQ off the charts.

238
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,402
And his drone tech is revolutionary!

239
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,362
You're sure he can handle this?

240
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,364
He has a perfect operations record.

241
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,366
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

242
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,909
Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?

243
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,078
- That's not even a country.
- Exactly.

244
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,372
And you can thank Robotnik for that.

245
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,584
I can't believe
you're bringing that freak into this.

246
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,003
Neither can I, but...

247
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,046
we have no choice.

248
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,865
What the...

249
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,347
Are you in charge here?

250
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,598
-Yes, I am--
-Nope!

251
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,599
-My--
-Wrong!

252
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,017
-Name--
-I'm in charge!

253
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,435
-Is Major--
-Me!

254
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,187
-Ben--
-I'm in charge.

255
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,649
You've never seen
anything like this before.

256
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:14,654
It says I'm the top banana
in a world full of hungry little monkeys.

257
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,072
Allow me to clarify.

258
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,867
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance,

259
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,078
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify.

260
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,455
- Agent Stone?
- The doctor thinks you're basic.

261
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,624
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

262
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,710
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

263
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

264
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,757
Tell him to stop
or I'll pull up his search history.

265
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,550
If you don't stop looking at the doctor,

266
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,302
-he'll take a closer look--
-I'm not deaf.

267
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,346
And tell him his men report to me now.

268
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,141
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize--

269
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm sorry, Major. What was your name?

270
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,812
-Benning--
-Nobody cares!

271
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,274
Nobody cares. Listen, Major Nobody Cares.

272
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,652
You know why nobody cares who you are?

273
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,113
Because nobody cares
about your feeble accomplishments.

274
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,074
And nobody cares how proud your mommy is

275
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,660
that you're now reading
at a third-grade level.

276
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,289
Have you finished Charlotte's Web yet?
Spoiler alert-- she dies in the end.

277
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,417
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

278
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,004
My babies.

279
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,091
Look what came out of my egg sac.

280
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,260
You know what I love about machines?

281
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,556
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

282
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,976
They don't need time off to get drunk
and put the boat in the water.

283
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,562
Now you do what you're told.

284
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,356
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss...

285
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,443
and watch my machines do your job.

286
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,656
- Can you feel it, Stone?
- I can feel it, Doctor.

287
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,825
It's evolution, Stone.

288
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,369
It's evolution!

289
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,532
- Agent Stone?
- Doctor.

290
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,534
Do you see anything useful in this image?

291
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,538
- Nothing at ail, Doctor.
- Of course you don't.

292
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,499
Your eyes weren't
expertly trained to spot tracks

293
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,168
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

294
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,262
That's extraordinary.

295
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,472
No.

296
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,142
What's extraordinary is
I've determined the exact height, weight

297
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,769
and spinal curvature of this creature,

298
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,355
and my computer
can't find a single match for it

299
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,982
anywhere in Earth's animal kingdom.

300
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,571
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby bigfoot.

301
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,158
This guy is something else...

302
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,203
entirely.

303
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,039
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

304
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,501
That's one small step for man,

305
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,878
one giant leap for me.

306
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,141
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

307
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,310
You played some baseball,
got a little upset,

308
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,397
lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

309
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,525
All right, ail right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

310
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,527
Time for plan B-- Mushroomville.

311
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,405
But I gotta take my stuff.
Okay, essential items only.

312
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,824
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.

313
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,951
Funny hat. This half-eaten cantaloupe.

314
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,911
And my scented candle.

315
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,080
My entire comic book collection.
Beanbag chair.

316
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,748
Can a beanbag chair fit in a backpack?

317
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,834
No, no, no. Of course not. That's stupid.

318
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,546
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course.

319
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,215
Here we go. Ring time.

320
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,967
Mushroom planet, here I come.

321
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,177
No. They're right outside.

322
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,971
I gotta go somewhere else.

323
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,311
Goodbye, cave.

324
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,108
- Hey.
- Hey.

325
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,192
Whatcha doing?

326
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,778
Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.

327
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,947
That sounds half fun.

328
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,199
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

329
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,160
The whole town went dark.

330
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,579
It was like a sign telling me
to get out of Dodge.

331
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,706
- Wade must have lost his mind.
- Yeah.

332
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,208
And he does not have much to lose.

333
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,920
How's your sister?
Did she convince you to leave me yet?

334
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,256
No, but she did tell me
to check your phone for dating apps.

335
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,425
The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.

336
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,469
And the Olive Garden.

337
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,471
- Because when you're there...
- You're family.

338
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,016
No way.

339
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,895
The raccoons are back.

340
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,855
And they are in for a surprise.

341
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,358
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun.

342
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,442
They're just hungry.

343
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,195
And also, that's for bears.

344
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,281
- Good. Now I know it'll work.
- Tom!

345
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,492
I'm kidding. I'm just gonna
use it to scare 'em.

346
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,826
Possibly to death.

347
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,953
- Love you, honey. Bye!
- Tom--

348
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,210
D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

349
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,922
Okay, I'm in.

350
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,675
With minimal damage
to Donut Lord's property.

351
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,760
Here we go.

352
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,345
It didn't work out on Earth,
but that's okay.

353
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,721
You're going to a safe world.

354
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,307
A nice, safe world full of mushrooms--

355
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,560
mushrooms that'll be your only friends.

356
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,562
That sounds awful. I can't do this.

357
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,690
You have to do it.
There's no other option.

358
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,776
All right.

359
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,738
SFPD, pending background check.

360
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,323
Paws in the air!

361
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,703
Meow?

362
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,256
"San... Francisco"?

363
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,571
No.

364
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,994
What?

365
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,060
The blue devil.

366
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,450
- Donut Lord?
- It can talk.

367
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,578
You're not here to abduct me, are you?

368
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,080
You abducted me.

369
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,833
Okay, that's a fair point. What are you?

370
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,752
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

371
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,170
I needed somewhere safe.

372
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,631
And you're the only person
I could think of, Donut Lord.

373
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,007
Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?

374
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,968
'Cause you talk to donuts
and then eat them if they get out of line.

375
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,804
Again, fair.

376
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,306
Wait. Where are all the mushrooms?
Why am I still on Earth?

377
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,684
What is-- No! I lost my rings.

378
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,061
What?

379
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,361
What's happening?
Is this your mother ship?

380
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,655
I'm not in the mood to get probed.

381
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,449
You think you're worried?
I'm not even wearing pants.

382
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,329
What the...

383
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,209
- They're coming for me!
- Who? What's that got to do with me?

384
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,378
I don't have time to explain,
but you have to help me.

385
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,547
No, I don't. Why?

386
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,134
Well, my legs, which normally
would be classified as lethal weapons,

387
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,343
feel like spaghetti.

388
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,221
I need your help.
Please. It's life or death.

389
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,730
Fine. Come with me.

390
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,610
Little help?

391
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,832
All right, stay here. And be quiet.

392
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,668
Good plan. Great plan!
We're already working so well together.

393
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,670
Practically finishing
each other's sentences.

394
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,715
Okay, bye.

395
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,428
Hello there!

396
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,430
Can I help you?

397
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,685
Good morning, my rural chum.

398
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,690
I'm... from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

399
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,110
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

400
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,029
No kidding? You're from the power company?

401
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,656
You must know my buddy Spencer.
We play softball together.

402
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,158
Spence.

403
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,368
He's a good man.

404
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,914
- Yeah. Come on in!
- Great.

405
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,373
Take all the readings you need.

406
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,209
Except,

407
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,337
doesn't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

408
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,464
That way they can check them
even if you're not home.

409
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,550
Also my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,

410
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,219
and he's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy.

411
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,930
So, you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough

412
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,556
to just let you walk inside my house?

413
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,734
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Wachowski.

414
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,694
But everyone calls me Tom.

415
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,655
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

416
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,366
But it's gone on for so long
that it would be weird if I corrected him.

417
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,577
Well, Tom Whose Dentist Calis Him Tim,

418
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,373
you may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

419
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,500
Yep, no lights. Picked up on that.

420
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,419
Twenty minutes ago, I tracked
an energy pulse with a similar signature

421
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,588
to the one that caused that disruption.

422
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,438
Listen, Mister--

423
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,815
Doctor.

424
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,651
Dr. Robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob.

425
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,823
Look, Dr. Robotskeez.

426
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,075
I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

427
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,535
but it's got nothing to do with me.

428
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
You can ask anyone in town.

429
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,955
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

430
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,292
I'm sure you're hella popular
with the Jebs and Merles and Billy Bobs

431
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,961
in this glorified gas-station rest stop.

432
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,255
Betcha go way back
to the days of tippin' cows

433
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,923
and playin' in a jug band!

434
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,054
And maybe someday you'll achieve your goal

435
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,807
of getting a Costco card
or adopting a Labradoodle.

436
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,479
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do...

437
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,357
before I was a toddler.

438
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,361
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

439
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,238
I was breastfed, actually.

440
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,325
Nice. Rub that in my orphan face.

441
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,243
Mr. Wachowski,

442
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:33,040
are you familiar with US Code 904,
Title 10, Article 104?

443
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,042
Yeah, who isn't--

444
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:39,338
"Anyone who attempts to aid an enemy
of the United States shall suffer death."

445
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,632
And if I'm the one that catches you,

446
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,593
it'll be even worse.

447
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,013
Worse than death?

448
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,393
Okay, I'm a ball, just a normal ball.
I'm blending in like a ball.

449
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,813
Stop talking. No, you stop talking.
Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic.

450
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,483
I hope they aren't
scanning me with X-rays.

451
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,318
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

452
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,286
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

453
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,830
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

454
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,291
I'm freaking out!

455
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,129
Why don't you have
your staircase carpeted?

456
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,547
Compared to what I--

457
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,427
- Old pipes.
- Yeah.

458
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,970
Probably just the house settling.

459
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,722
Nothing to see here!

460
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,016
Hey!

461
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,773
Here's the thing.

462
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,734
I'm never wrong.

463
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,904
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

464
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,364
Would you like some cake?

465
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,700
I hear raccoons have the cleanest mouths
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

466
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,381
Look at that.

467
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,758
I was right.

468
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,553
Note the lack of surprise.

469
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,304
Shall we try this again?

470
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,694
I'm going to give you five seconds
to tell me where it is.

471
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,362
- Five.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

472
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,947
- Four.
- Hey, tough guy. I'm a cop.

473
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,240
And you're threatening an officer.

474
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,909
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed? Three.

475
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,287
Come on! Rack your brain.

476
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:40,709
You might be able to come up with some
lame excuse to go on living, in two...

477
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,752
one.

478
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,963
Wait! Don't hurt him!

479
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,395
This feels excessive.

480
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,192
Stay behind me.

481
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,627
Don't worry.
I got it right where I want it!

482
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,716
Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver
packages with these things?

483
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,180
This was a horrible plan!
What was I thinking?

484
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm gonna puke!

485
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,107
Come on! We gotta get out of here.

486
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,193
Don't tell me that's all you got!

487
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,528
I'm just getting started!

488
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,821
Let me know if you want to go
round two with the blue.

489
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,593
Doctor! Are you okay?

490
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,096
I saw a guy race out of here and thought--

491
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,889
That you should stop them?

492
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,100
Open your mouth

493
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,602
and say you thought
that you should stop them.

494
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:26,231
No, I thought that maybe I should check
to see if you were okay.

495
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,900
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

496
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,153
- Everyone else seems stupid.
- Stupid, yes! Way to go!

497
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,363
You got that one.

498
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,994
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

499
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,998
neutralize it,
uncover the source of its power.

500
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,499
And if it resists...

501
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,795
we take it apart... piece by piece.

502
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,965
See what makes it tick.

503
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,676
- Stone?
- Doctor?

504
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,386
Call Optical Illusions.

505
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,722
Tell them I need new frames.

506
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,890
They know what kind I like.

507
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,977
And bring that quill.

508
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,479
Yes, Doctor.

509
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,527
All right, pal,
you need to start talking right now.

510
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,030
Who are you? What are you?

511
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,741
I'm a hedgehog!
I feel like that's obvious.

512
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,200
And I'm in big trouble.

513
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,535
You're in big trouble?

514
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,038
You're not the one who punched
some government weirdo back there.

515
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,915
You think you have problems?
I lost my rings.

516
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,709
- Rings? What are you talking about?
- Okay.

517
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,463
Rings are how all advanced cultures
travel between worlds.

518
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,007
And now mine are
on top of a pointy building

519
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,468
I've only ever seen
on your skintight T-shirt.

520
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,469
Hey.

521
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,512
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco

522
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,849
so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the mushroom planet.

523
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,436
- Mushroom planet.
- Yes!

524
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,396
Right.

525
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,818
Okay, pal, out you go.

526
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,654
- I'm sorry, what?
- Look.

527
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,823
This is the worst possible time
for me to get myself into trouble, okay?

528
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,034
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

529
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,287
Now, please, go find your rings
and your mushroom land.

530
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,039
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in a hospital bed

531
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,583
and the doctor's gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

532
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,668
Okay? So goodbye.

533
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,962
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

534
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,718
- Why aren't you leaving?
- I don't know where San Francisco is.

535
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:19,886
- It's west.
- West?

536
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,263
- Straight shot, can't miss it.
- Fine. That's cool.

537
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,182
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

538
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:33,483
So, as I crashed into the cold,
dark water of the Pacific,

539
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,276
I realized a few things.

540
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,321
A, I have no idea where I'm going.

541
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,657
B, salt water stings.

542
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,036
C, I shouldn't even be
on this planet right now, but I am.

543
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,996
Why? Because you shot me!

544
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,998
- I know.
- You shot me!

545
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:53,253
All right, I heard you the first time.
You don't have to pile it on. Good grief.

546
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,214
I'm wet. I'm cold.

547
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,174
There's a fish on my head!

548
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,469
And clearly, I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

549
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,768
All right, get in the truck.

550
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,603
Really? You're gonna help me?

551
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,273
I guess it is a little bit my fault
that all this is happening to you.

552
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,484
Not a little bit. Entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

553
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,278
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

554
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:19,904
Yes.

555
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,366
Road trip!

556
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,618
What am I doing?

557
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,580
All right,
there's gonna be rules on this trip.

558
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,499
Number one,
do exactly as I say all the time.

559
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,668
- Got it?
- Got it, Donut Lord.

560
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,378
Would you stop with the "Donut Lord"?

561
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,797
I have a name. It's Tom.

562
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,424
I'm Sonic.

563
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,135
Sonic. Sonic.

564
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,638
So you've been spying on us ail for years.

565
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,098
I mean, I wouldn't call it "spying."

566
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,516
We were all just hanging out,

567
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,186
only I wasn't invited
and no one knew I was there.

568
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,772
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right ail this time.

569
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,566
Yeah. You should call him
Super Observant Carl instead.

570
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,986
- My God, stop the car right now!
- What? What?

571
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,238
"The World's Largest Rubberband Bail"?

572
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,532
- We gotta see it!
- No. No.

573
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,285
No, this is not some
fun family road trip, okay?

574
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:11,080
The government wants to dissect you
and arrest me. This is serious.

575
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,250
You're right. It was lame.

576
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,753
Gift shop was cool though.
I got you a mouse pad.

577
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,505
When are we gonna get there?

578
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,673
We will get there when we get there.

579
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,654
I'm gonna go check in with Wade,
see if he knows what's going on.

580
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,240
You're gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

581
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,283
What is it, a teleportation box?

582
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,119
It's a pay phone.

583
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,581
It's mostly for drug dealers
and fugitives from the law, which is us.

584
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,291
Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody seeing you.

585
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,335
Fine.

586
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:20,567
Okay, okay. That is the coolest place
on Earth, but you have to stay in the car.

587
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,537
Be strong. Be strong.

588
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,838
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

589
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,673
- Wade, it's me.
- Hi.

590
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,258
I'm so glad that you called.

591
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,802
So, some guys came in
asking some questions.

592
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,554
They're a little creepy.

593
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,307
Kind of reminded me
of the guys from Men in Black,

594
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,685
but not as likable
or charming as Will Smith.

595
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,061
Wait, what kind of questions?

596
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,523
Questions about terrorism?

597
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,735
I told them that
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

598
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,236
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.

599
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,697
He can't even make bait in the cold.

600
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,741
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

601
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,326
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

602
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,956
You know, I think they already know.

603
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,126
Mr. Wachowski.

604
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,378
Tom.

605
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,881
I want you to know
that the only other person

606
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,176
who ever punched me in the face
was the school bully.

607
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,803
He hit me in the cafeteria,
causing a blunt-force contusion

608
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,514
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

609
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,642
Humiliated me
in front of the entire school!

610
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,393
And do you know what I did in response?

611
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,605
I'm assuming that you reported him
to the principal's office

612
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,565
'cause that kind of behavior
is really unacceptable.

613
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,944
No. I examined the inefficiency of a world
where brawn trumped brain,

614
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,988
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

615
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,158
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

616
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,993
And I have never lost a fight again.

617
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,495
Until today.

618
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,080
Hey, hooray for me then?

619
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,166
No, because you're about to become
the bully with the straw!

620
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,835
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

621
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,295
And when I catch you, I'll--

622
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,839
Hello.

623
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,007
Hello?

624
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,676
Hello, hello, hello?

625
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,012
I think he actually hung up,
because I notice that the light isn't on.

626
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,597
Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

627
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,808
If you give me a second,
I can get an outside line.

628
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,102
No. Don't be bothered.

629
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:24,107
You just sit there and be "u"... 'seless.

630
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,783
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

631
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,786
I will tell people about this!

632
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,292
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

633
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,503
Sonic?

634
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,883
No.

635
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,177
No, no!

636
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,767
Yeah!

637
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,652
Howdy, pardner!

638
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,112
I'm not your partner.
Come on. We're leaving.

639
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,948
But there's a ZZ Top cover band.
You gotta see their beards.

640
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,492
You're gonna have to catch 'em
some other time. Let's go. Get up!

641
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,537
If we stay, I promise I won't say
another word for the rest of the trip,

642
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,164
starting... now.

643
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,876
Welcome to the Piston Pit.
What can I get you fellas?

644
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,253
I want nachos and buffalo wings.
And guac.

645
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,714
Funny word, isn't it? Guac, guac! Guac.

646
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,968
Hey, no kids allowed in here.
What's he got on, some kind of mask?

647
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,598
He's actually 43 years old
and suffers from a very rare skin disease

648
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,977
that stunts his growth
and makes him look... like that.

649
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,270
The face, I was born with.

650
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,731
The confidence, I picked up along the way.

651
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,776
- Make his a Mello Yello, please.
- Okay.

652
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,654
- You owe me one.
- I never sat on a barstool before.

653
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,198
So squishy!

654
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,866
Look at this. It spins.

655
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,868
- Yes.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

656
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,661
- That's nice.
- I feel sick.

657
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,831
Are you having fun? Gonna check
this off the ol' bucket list?

658
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,917
- Big night for you.
- What's a bucket list?

659
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,836
A bucket list is...

660
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,506
It's a list of things
you want to do in your life

661
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,966
before you, well, kick the bucket.

662
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,676
I've never kicked a bucket either!

663
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,470
I gotta make my list.

664
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,893
Sonic!

665
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,276
What? What's the matter?

666
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,695
There's so much stuff I've never done.

667
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,574
And now that I'm leaving Earth forever,
I guess I missed my chance.

668
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,708
Well, I guess this is the kind of place
you could get a lot of living done

669
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,460
in a short period of time.

670
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,546
I suppose we can spare an hour.

671
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,173
What? You're gonna bucket-list with me?

672
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,093
- Sure, why not?
- You won't regret this.

673
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,678
I'm pretty sure I will.

674
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,495
New high score!

675
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,130
Wait a second. Is this bull
missing a head, or does it have two butts?

676
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,467
This is easy.

677
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,677
Okay.

678
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,683
I'm a cowboy, baby!

679
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,563
I'm okay.

680
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,195
Yeah!

681
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,532
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

682
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,117
Nice work, Romeo.

683
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,537
- Glad you're having a good time.
- I am having a good time!

684
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,498
I'm having the best time.
I mean, what could go wrong?

685
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,213
Can we help you?

686
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,923
We don't like your kind around here.

687
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,966
Our kind? What kind is that?

688
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,261
Hipsters.

689
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,639
- How dare you.
- Hey. You know what?

690
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,183
We were leaving anyway. Weren't we?
There's not a problem here.

691
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,352
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- No, no, no, we're leaving.

692
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,188
I know exactly
how to handle this situation.

693
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,899
Pop quiz, hotshot.

694
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,318
You just picked a fight
with a poorly disguised hedgehog

695
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,528
who's seen way too many action movies.

696
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,031
What do you do? What do you do?

697
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,160
Am I crazy? it's supposed to break, right?

698
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,706
Break, please. Break, please.
Break this bottle, please.

699
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,291
- Please, please, please.
- Sonic?

700
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,763
Nice going!

701
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,556
Thanks! it's awesome right?

702
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,016
All right, who's next? Who wants some?

703
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,768
Who do I get to beat up?

704
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,688
Hey! Has anybody seen my waitress?

705
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,815
Still waiting on those buffalo wings.

706
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,359
Why, you!

707
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,579
Really?

708
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,340
Olé!

709
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,566
- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.

710
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,822
That was amazing!
Wait a second. Did we even pay our tab?

711
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,281
It doesn't matter!

712
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,367
Watch this, watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

713
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,915
- Get 'em!
- See ya, suckers!

714
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,168
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

715
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,380
Come on! Don't let 'em get away!

716
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,967
- Yes!
- Yeah!

717
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,385
- Yes!
- Ouch!

718
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,179
- He got you pretty good.
- I'm all right. I've been hit harder.

719
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,098
Did you see how much toilet paper I used?

720
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,393
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with!

721
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,563
The floors were sticky.
The crowd was rough.

722
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,148
And the odds were against us.

723
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:05,526
But there was no stopping
Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

724
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,070
Scratch another one off my list.

725
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,365
You are a weird little dude.

726
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,628
Okay.

727
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,963
So, what are we gonna do now?

728
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,010
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.
I think you should too.

729
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,636
But this is my last night on Earth.

730
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,472
I want to soak up every last second.

731
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,641
All right, anything you can find to do
in this room, you knock yourself out.

732
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,400
Good times.

733
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,279
Come on.

734
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,781
That's awful. What did you eat?

735
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,242
I think it's called a chili dog?

736
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,828
You might want to check your fur
on that one, buddy.

737
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,999
Hey. So, what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

738
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,418
It's no Earth, I can tell you that.

739
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,255
There's no people, just breathable air
and giant mushrooms and stuff.

740
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,508
Well, look at it this way.

741
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,302
At least you won't be the only "fun-guy."

742
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,388
No. Don't ever do that again.

743
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,891
I liked it.

744
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,103
I'm really gonna miss this place.

745
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,899
I know I have to leave Earth to be safe,
but what if Longclaw was wrong?

746
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,027
Maybe I could have a life here.

747
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,117
All right. We should get some sleep.

748
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,912
You sleep. Don't worry about me.

749
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,165
I'm gonna stay up all night
enjoying Earth while I can.

750
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,501
Sure, kid.

751
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,753
As long as we're on the road by 8:00.

752
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,679
I had a chili dog.
That's why my farts smell.

753
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,365
Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.

754
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,285
Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.

755
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,245
Any information regarding his whereabouts

756
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,081
should be reported
to local authorities immediately.

757
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,797
Did he say where he was going?

758
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,928
Maybe. Maybe not.

759
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,180
Like I'd ever tell you.

760
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,434
Stand down, Agent Stone.

761
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,811
This well-meaning citizen
obviously doesn't understand

762
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,187
the urgency of the matter.

763
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,150
Really?

764
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,280
Now that's what I call good cop, bad cop.

765
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,535
Left yourself open.

766
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,914
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

767
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:09,168
the approximate speed of their vehicle,
and local weather conditions...

768
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,212
they should be...

769
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,840
right about...

770
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,426
here.

771
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:21,138
- That's brilliant, sir.
- Thanks... for nothing.

772
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,518
- So, what's on your bucket list?
- Who, me?

773
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,187
Yeah. Everyone has a bucket list, right?

774
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,939
Sure, but, I mean,
you're the one leaving Earth,

775
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,359
and I'm not planning on dying
anytime soon.

776
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,779
Don't be so sure.
Your best friend is a magnet for danger.

777
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,199
Are you anointing yourself as the bestie?

778
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,660
A little presumptuous,
but-- I mean-- What, no--

779
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,455
I like you, of course, but,
you know, we're not best friends.

780
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,083
You tucked me in last night.

781
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,793
Fine, fine, fine. Best animal friend.

782
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,628
- That would be my dog, Ozzy.
- Okay.

783
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,173
Let's drop this increasingly humiliating
topic of conversation.

784
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,966
Bucket list. Give it to me!

785
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,094
Okay, there is one thing.

786
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,681
In Green Hills, I've always felt,

787
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:07,059
I don't know, more like a babysitter
than a real cop, you know?

788
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,062
So I want a chance to prove myself,
under real pressure.

789
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,399
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

790
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,984
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

791
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,112
What?

792
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,989
Why-- Why is your face doing that?

793
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,033
You're leaving Green Hills?

794
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,785
Okay.

795
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,621
B-B-But why?
Why would you leave Green Hills?

796
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,290
This may be hard for you to understand,
but Green Hills is a small town.

797
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,583
It's a very small town.

798
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,503
It's not small.
There are hundreds of people.

799
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,004
That's a small town, dude!

800
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,924
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

801
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,386
Please. I clean out their gutters.
I jump-start their cars in the winter.

802
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,804
They could call anybody to do that.

803
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,933
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't. They call you.

804
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,453
Eeny, meeny, miny...

805
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,455
mayhem.

806
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,843
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

807
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,554
You come from a great town
with great people and, by my count,

808
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,556
zero bad guys trying to kill you!

809
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,684
Besides,

810
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:34,396
what could possibly be more important
than protecting the people you care about?

811
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,279
Look, I get your poi--

812
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,657
Yeah!

813
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,794
You know what? I was wrong about you.
You're not the Donut Lord at all.

814
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,587
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

815
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,048
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?

816
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,096
Sonic!

817
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,890
I was forced from my home.

818
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,600
Your home is perfect,
and you're leaving it.

819
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,352
Why would you do that?

820
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,563
- Your body!
- No, not again!

821
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,689
Hey! Hold on!

822
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,525
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna do this.

823
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,670
Sonic!

824
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,047
Sonic!

825
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,679
Guess I had a bonus life.

826
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,599
Yeah, baby!

827
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,936
Sonic, one. Big tank, zero. I'm sorry.

828
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,313
- Did we get that on camera?
- How are you not dead?

829
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,107
I have no idea.

830
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,401
- Do you see me dancing?
- Yes, I saw you dance.

831
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,944
Is that ail you got?

832
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,946
No, but thank you for asking.

833
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,369
Sonic! Get back in the truck!

834
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,329
You go. I'll catch up.

835
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,593
I think that tank just had a baby.

836
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,189
Incoming!

837
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,445
- It's my turn!
- You just had one. It's mine!

838
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,614
Hey, stop fighting
or I'm taking that thing away!

839
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:49,740
Yeah, right, Dad.

840
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,628
Where are you going?

841
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,464
Just drive the car.
I'll take care of this.

842
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,424
And if I don't make it, just ditch me.

843
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,759
You seem good at that.

844
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,771
Hey, everyone!
Welcome back to my livestream.

845
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,065
Today we're destroying robots. Step one.

846
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,905
Yes, we did it!

847
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,079
We did not do it. Who is this guy?

848
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,706
Ever wonder
where your tax dollars are going?

849
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,832
My turn.

850
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,835
Here, just keep us going straight.
I put it in cruise control.

851
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,671
I feel just like Vin Diesel.

852
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,589
"It's all about family, Tom."

853
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,806
Quick suggestion.

854
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,767
Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

855
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,187
Where'd you learn how to drive?

856
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,690
Here. In this truck.
It's happening as we speak.

857
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,987
I can't reach it. Bring him in closer.

858
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,531
- What?
- Bring it in closer! Hit the brakes.

859
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,824
You mean this one?

860
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,993
The other brakes!

861
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,343
Give me a big, fat break!

862
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,435
This one is cute. Let's keep him.

863
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,023
Come on!

864
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,608
How could something so adorable
be so terrible?

865
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,238
You've got car insurance, right?

866
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,371
Buzz off.

867
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,081
That doesn't sound good.

868
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,500
- No, beeping is bad. Get rid of it!
- I'm trying.

869
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,335
Throw it out the win-- Throw it anywhere!

870
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,713
- I can't get it off.
- Ail right, I'm pulling over.

871
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,514
- Did I get it?
- Nope.

872
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,225
Here. Hold still.

873
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,395
It's going, it's going...

874
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,730
It's still here.

875
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,151
Get off me.

876
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,195
Nailed it!

877
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,039
Sonic!

878
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:52,631
No, no.

879
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,475
Hey. Come on.
You're all right. Wake up. Wake up.

880
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,900
Did we get 'em?

881
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,611
No, there they are.

882
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,197
They are real survivors, those two.

883
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,703
Can we have a moment?

884
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,083
Pin yourself to the wall.

885
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,795
You know,
I won't miss you when you're gone.

886
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,757
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,
and I care very little about them.

887
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,552
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

888
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,470
They're everything to me!

889
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,843
Come on, buddy.

890
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,304
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right.

891
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,019
- Is Maddie here?
- No, no.

892
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,437
- Not today. Goodbye.
- It's an emergency!

893
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,480
- Bye-bye.
- Rachel, stop! Please! Maddie!

894
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,065
Don't do this. This is important.

895
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,234
- My God! Rachel, let him in.
- I am calling the police.

896
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,528
No, I am calling the FBI.
I am calling the CIA.

897
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,405
- Stop. Don't do that.
- I am calling your mother.

898
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,157
- Okay, got it.
- Maddie, can we talk?

899
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,158
Tom, what's going on?

900
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,285
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

901
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,078
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

902
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,580
- Ditch his phone?
- Track you?

903
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,082
- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo! Hey!

904
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,668
Now your niece is an accessory to treason.

905
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,253
- No, she's not.
- Would you calm down?

906
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,339
Calm down? I will not calm down!

907
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,049
- Enough.
- Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

908
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,301
No. Ozzy, please. Good to see you too.

909
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,179
Little Lord Baby Jesus.

910
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,555
What is that, Tom?

911
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,015
Is that plutonium? is it e-mails?

912
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,808
Yes, it's plutonium.

913
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,728
Can we please go in the other room
and talk-- Stop it, Ozzy. Quit it!

914
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,521
This is why I told you he was no good.

915
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,982
- I'm not engaging.
- No, Ozzy, quit it.

916
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,195
Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no!

917
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,114
Catch me, Jojo.

918
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,284
Thank God.

919
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,579
Can I get a glass of water?

920
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,683
I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

921
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,519
What do I look like, an imbecile?

922
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,814
Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!

923
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,990
Ready the prototype.

924
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,825
With this kind of power,

925
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:34,829
my machines can finally reach
their full potential.

926
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,004
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

927
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,092
Thank God. He's gonna be okay, right?

928
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,677
I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

929
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,888
He's a hedgehog. Or so he says.

930
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,640
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

931
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,225
Okay.

932
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,269
- Holy...
- What?

933
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,813
His pulse is super fast.

934
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,731
That actually might be normal for him.

935
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,441
I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.

936
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,276
I don't know his physiology.

937
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,904
He doesn't seem to have any broken bones.

938
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,198
He's just really banged up.

939
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,702
Look at his poor little feet.

940
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,542
Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

941
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,339
Jojo? Untie your mother. Jojo!

942
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,508
Untie Mommy.

943
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,718
Sweetie. Jojo!

944
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,390
I have to go to the bathroom.

945
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,600
He's gonna be okay, right?

946
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,602
He'll snap out of this.
He'll wake up soon?

947
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,354
Smelling salts!

948
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:44,816
Don't you have, like, vet smelling salts,
like, for cats or parakeets or something?

949
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,319
- No. They don't make cat smelling salts.
- They should.

950
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,574
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

951
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,201
Okay.

952
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,913
- Here we go.
- Come on, buddy.

953
01:05:58,997 --> 01:05:59,998
Gotta go fast!

954
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,753
Where am I? What year is it?
Is The Rock president?

955
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,505
Whoa, buddy, you're okay. Calm down.

956
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,798
Hi, Pretzel Lady!

957
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,341
Hi.

958
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,510
- Tom?
- Yeah.

959
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:13,761
Can I talk to you, please?

960
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,267
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

961
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,935
You got it. I am great at resting.

962
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,520
I rest faster than anybody.

963
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,855
Still talking.

964
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,734
First of all, can we take a moment to
acknowledge how under control I've been?

965
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,527
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

966
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,946
- No.
- Totally calm.

967
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,156
Thank you.

968
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,617
Second of ail...

969
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,370
What the heck is going on?
Is that thing an alien?

970
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:43,208
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl
is always going on about the blue devil?

971
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,709
The blue devil!

972
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,920
- That's him? He's real?
- Yeah.

973
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,963
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

974
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:53,468
I kinda, sorta, shot our
little blue friend with your tranq gun.

975
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,095
- No, you did not.
- I didn't mean to.

976
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,139
Okay. This is kinda hard
for me to explain.

977
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,974
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

978
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,686
He has to get to the Transamerica
building, and I promised I'd take him.

979
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,022
Aliens?

980
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,566
Maddie, your husband's lost his mind.

981
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,652
Use this as an opportunity to leave him.

982
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,445
No one would judge you.

983
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,118
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

984
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,704
Really?

985
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,541
No one's ever given me a gift before.

986
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,377
I gotta check that off my bucket list.

987
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,972
All right! Looking good!

988
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,142
Okay.

989
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,062
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

990
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,398
Well, that's what you're doing.

991
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,985
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as people. Right?

992
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,361
- I think so too.
- Yeah.

993
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,654
- I think.
- Okay.

994
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,906
I love you. Did I tell you that already?

995
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,825
I don't deserve you. You know that?

996
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,201
I know that.

997
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,250
So, you're supposed to be Tom's
best friend that he won't shut up about.

998
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,545
Well, I don't see the appeal.

999
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,965
Stop!

1000
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,259
That is very gross.

1001
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

1002
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,181
So, my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

1003
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,267
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

1004
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,935
You have got to be kidding me!

1005
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,521
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1006
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,275
This is my house!

1007
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,485
Coming through!

1008
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,572
Now this is my turn, and I go around him.

1009
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:41,075
Sorry! And, perfect park.

1010
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,077
- What are you, crazy?
- Is there anything you didn't hit?

1011
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,871
Why did we let the alien drive?

1012
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,915
Hey, I got us here.
And please, five stars.

1013
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,629
- So, this is it?
- That's it. That's your pyramid.

1014
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,131
Wow, look at that thing!

1015
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,382
What happens now?

1016
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,886
- He's... gone.
- Yep.

1017
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,598
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

1018
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,975
What now?

1019
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,395
Time for me to abuse
the power entrusted to me.

1020
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,823
We got a jumper on the roof.

1021
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,743
Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna
have a human pancake on our hands.

1022
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,079
You came ail the way from Montana.

1023
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,915
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

1024
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,796
Okay.

1025
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,007
You just saved a life.

1026
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,477
How much longer? I can't breathe in here.

1027
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:54,107
Hello? Anybody there?

1028
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,943
- Do you have your child in that bag?
- No.

1029
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,154
I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

1030
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,281
It's not your child.

1031
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,867
Relax. I'm a cop, okay?

1032
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,411
Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

1033
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:07,995
Why would I like it in here?

1034
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,915
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

1035
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:12,875
Such a kidder.

1036
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,463
- Okay.
- No, I'm scared of the dark!

1037
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,298
Is anybody there?

1038
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,397
What were you keeping in this bag?

1039
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,023
A jar of pickled farts?

1040
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,608
All right. What are we looking for?

1041
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,280
This.

1042
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,074
Okay. What happens now?

1043
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,161
Now all I have to do is think of where I
want the other end of the ring to appear,

1044
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,203
and I throw it.

1045
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,330
So, that's it? We did it?

1046
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,749
Yeah. We did it!

1047
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,044
Hey. Sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

1048
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,839
It's okay.
I did the ones I needed the most.

1049
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,301
You two are so cute.

1050
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,636
- Please. What?
- We are not.

1051
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,054
No. We're not cute.

1052
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,807
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

1053
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:10,892
Exactly.

1054
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,101
- Really?
- Yeah.

1055
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,937
And our rules include
expressing heartfelt emotions.

1056
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,439
If you say so.

1057
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,941
- Okay, then.
- Ail right.

1058
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,069
- You gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

1059
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,404
I gotta go. We gotta go too.

1060
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,072
See-- Ali right, bye-bye.

1061
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,579
Just one more thing.

1062
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,547
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1063
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:47,428
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

1064
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:51,933
Walking away from something
you care about has to be painful.

1065
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,227
You're not sure
you really want to go?

1066
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,689
I don't want to go, but I can't stay.

1067
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,275
As long as I'm here,
I put everyone in danger.

1068
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,402
I can't do that.

1069
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:08,366
I just want you to know
that these last two days have been

1070
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,993
the best two days of my life.

1071
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,748
You know, I never thought I'd say this,

1072
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,834
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little blue devil.

1073
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,211
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

1074
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,255
Thank you.

1075
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:23,923
For what?

1076
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,384
For saving my life.

1077
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,238
Okay. Did someone leave
their "Find My Phone" on?

1078
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,642
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

1079
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,520
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

1080
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,772
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us.

1081
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,316
Unsuccessfully!

1082
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,276
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to Comic-Con.

1083
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,569
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1084
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:33,075
It's a flight suit, designed to modulate
my body temperature and reduce drag.

1085
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,744
Yeah, and yet you still are one.

1086
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,621
Good one.

1087
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,664
You are catching fire, Thomas.

1088
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,125
And speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1089
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,338
Does she have a name, or should we
just call her "collateral damage"?

1090
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,547
Hey, watch your mouth.

1091
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,008
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier.

1092
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,551
I punched him in the face.

1093
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,887
He punched him right in the face!
It was awesome!

1094
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,890
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1095
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,143
Your flying eggs are pretty impressive,
Mr. Eggman,

1096
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,520
but let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1097
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,481
Confidence!

1098
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,608
A fool's substitute for intelligence.

1099
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,784
That's not good.

1100
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,788
Sonic, I know you got the super speed
and everything, but Maddie and I--

1101
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,623
Totally defenseless?
Probably gonna get blown up?

1102
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,041
Pretty much, yeah.

1103
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,336
Don't worry. I know exactly what to do.

1104
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,720
I was not expecting that.

1105
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,807
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1106
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,577
Come on!

1107
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,620
Come on, come on, come on.

1108
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,135
No, no, no!

1109
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,774
Hi, Tom.

1110
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,068
Glad you're here. Could use some help.

1111
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,903
Old Bessie's about to give birth.

1112
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,363
Give me a minute.

1113
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,369
Can I give you one genius piece of advice?

1114
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,455
Don't run.

1115
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,874
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1116
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:29,251
And it's bad for your joints.
They've proved it.

1117
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,670
All right, Eggman. You wanna get fast?

1118
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,922
Let's get fast.

1119
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,551
The hard way it is.

1120
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,489
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1121
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,285
So, here we are again.

1122
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,079
We've been through so much together.

1123
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,748
Now you understand
why there's a psychotic robot doctor

1124
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,084
chasing a supersonic blue hedgehog.

1125
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,753
Want to know how it ends? Yeah, me too.

1126
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,730
How is this possible?

1127
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,899
No one's ever caught up to me before.

1128
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,324
Coming through!

1129
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:44,618
Sacrebleu!

1130
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,913
Excusez-moi, monsieur!

1131
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,211
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1132
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,638
I can't lose him!

1133
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,655
If you can't beat 'em, blind 'em.

1134
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,827
Lost visual contact.

1135
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:35,544
You're not allowed up there!
It's one of the Seven Wonders!

1136
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,581
You're an astonishing little creature.

1137
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,086
It'll be fun to take you back to the lab

1138
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,421
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1139
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,049
Any last words?

1140
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,761
Guac. I like that word.

1141
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,765
I don't have to tell you
how many scientific breakthroughs

1142
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,226
have been made possible by animal testing.

1143
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:33,394
You're being very selfish.

1144
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,645
Going my way?

1145
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,938
What the--

1146
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,320
Who the hell do you think you are?

1147
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,158
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a--

1148
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,999
Autopilot, adjust.

1149
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,167
Why?

1150
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,045
Why would you throw
your life away for this thing?

1151
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,006
That's why I don't have friends.

1152
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,174
Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.

1153
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,428
They want to have the wedding out of town.
Like nobody has anything better to do!

1154
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,764
Anyway, where were we?

1155
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,392
Yes. You were about to die.

1156
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,354
That's our sheriff you're messing with.

1157
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:22,359
And our blue devil, who,
as everyone can see,

1158
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:26,864
is a very real creature
and not at ail invented by me.

1159
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,285
- Careful.
- Just-- Just put it away.

1160
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,578
Tom?

1161
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,177
I don't mean to be indelicate here,

1162
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,680
but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.

1163
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,935
He's just a silly little alien.

1164
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,854
He didn't belong here!

1165
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,358
That little alien...

1166
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,737
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1167
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,530
His name was Sonic.

1168
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,075
This was his home.

1169
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,494
And he was my friend.

1170
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,770
He's all yours.

1171
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,856
Everyone get back!

1172
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,113
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1173
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,000
This is my power.

1174
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,670
And I'm not using it to run away anymore.

1175
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,215
I'm using it to protect my friends.

1176
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,649
Now you've done it!

1177
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,026
Guess what, Eggman?

1178
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,653
I'm not leaving Earth. You are.

1179
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,572
Donut Lord?

1180
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,957
- I told you, you got this.
- Hey, we got this.

1181
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:19,888
- I think these belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1182
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,643
- No more pushing people off of buildings.
- You know I can't promise that.

1183
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,233
- You did pretty good, space 'hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

1184
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,444
You're gonna have to explain
this "Donut Lord" thing.

1185
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,613
Nope, sorry.
That's for me and the little guy. Right?

1186
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,700
We got our thing,
you got your thing with your... sister.

1187
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,784
My God, my sister.

1188
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:45,581
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1189
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,291
Jojo, put on my Fitbit...

1190
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,043
so I can at least get some steps.

1191
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,461
We can never go back there.

1192
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:53,839
I mean, are we?

1193
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,760
'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.

1194
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:00,637
Really?

1195
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:06,727
I kind of feel like I checked
the "save a life" box off my bucket list.

1196
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:13,150
Now all I want to do is spend my life
with the people I care about.

1197
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,819
I want to check that box.

1198
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,864
Okay, I like that.

1199
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,034
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1200
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,201
Let's disperse.

1201
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,162
Just another ordinary day in Green Hills.

1202
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,705
Carl, I'll take that chain saw.

1203
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,249
Come on. Let's go!

1204
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,876
You act like you've never seen a fight

1205
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:35,547
between an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1206
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,016
You got enough there?

1207
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,602
- Yes, Mr. Manager.
- Need any more?

1208
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,103
You get that away.

1209
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,157
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1210
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:03,825
Yes?

1211
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,747
A token of appreciation
from your government

1212
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,875
for keeping quiet about recent incidents
which never occurred.

1213
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,629
Wow!

1214
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,799
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1215
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,134
- Letter from the president?
- You'll see.

1216
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,636
Okay.

1217
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,849
- Olive Garden.
- Yeah.

1218
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,394
The way you said "You'll see"
made me think

1219
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:32,312
it was something better
than the things we said.

1220
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,564
Have you tried their
Never Ending Pasta Bowl?

1221
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,692
It never ends.

1222
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:39,069
That sounds... fancy.

1223
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,321
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1224
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,367
Hey. I guess we can close the file
on that Robotnik guy?

1225
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,451
Just disappeared.

1226
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:51,081
I'm sorry, but no such person exists
or ever has existed.

1227
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,750
I wish that were true.

1228
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,837
You haven't by any chance been in contact
with a certain alien creature

1229
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,255
since the incident, have you?

1230
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,551
Uncle Sam would love to have a chat
with him. Very casual. Brunch, perhaps.

1231
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,555
You mean the little blue guy. No.

1232
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,640
No, nothing. No.

1233
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,892
Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.

1234
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:12,978
Very well.

1235
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,980
Okay.

1236
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,606
- Thank you.
- Great.

1237
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:19,735
Yep.

1238
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,782
To be honest,
I'm pretty pumped about the pasta bowl.

1239
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,493
So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?

1240
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:31,413
Sorry, buddy. It's a school night.
It's time for you to go back to your cave.

1241
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,623
What? It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

1242
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,292
You know how you get when you're tired.

1243
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,877
Me? I'm not like anything.

1244
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:40,172
- You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah, we know.

1245
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,592
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- You said I have to go back to my cave.

1246
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,552
We did.

1247
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,903
My-- Are you kidding me?

1248
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,822
I can't believe it.

1249
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,491
How did you--

1250
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,452
It's-- It's all here.

1251
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,215
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the beanbag?

1252
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,300
No way! How did you even get this?

1253
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,968
And you got it all the way over--

1254
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,930
I love it, I love it!

1255
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,269
Well, welcome home.

1256
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,897
Thank you, so much.

1257
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,449
No, you don't.

1258
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:52,285
No second-best animal friends
allowed in my room.

1259
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,037
Wait. What are you doing?

1260
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,456
Stay away from me. Stop it!

1261
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,542
I'm warning you. I've got nunchucks!

1262
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,127
Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay.

1263
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,815
My grasp on sanity remains... absolute.

1264
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,151
Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

1265
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,450
Why don't you get a head start?

1266
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,246
Do some rock-connaissance.

1267
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,542
Rock-connaissance!
Come on! That's hilarious!

1268
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,377
What's the matter with you?

1269
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:46,006
Here's the "sitch." Uninhabited planet.

1270
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:51,219
No resources. No supplies.
No apparent way home.

1271
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,348
A lesser man would die here.

1272
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,312
I'll be home by Christmas.

1273
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,875
Rock-connaissance!

1274
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,963
Come on! Cheer up!

1275
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,421
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

1276
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:32,797
I found him.

1277
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,674
I just hope I'm not too late.
