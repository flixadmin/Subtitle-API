00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,280
Ironic that it's 112.

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
Like the emergency number.

159
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
It's a miracle you're okay.

160
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
[Berta] I didn't manage to take them all.

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,040
My mom got home earlier
than she said she would.

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
I think that, um,

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,960
I think she had a hunch
that I might try again.

164
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,880
Wait, you've tried before?

165
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,880
[Berta] Two times.

166
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Holy shit, Berta.

167
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
But,

168
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I mean, why?

169
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,440
I can't bear it anymore.

170
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
I feel like I don't have the energy to

171
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,520
withstand another fucking crisis.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
I'm tired.

173
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm tired of the anxiety attacks.

174
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Of the tremors.

175
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,840
The diarrhea, the vomiting.

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,280
Stop looking at me like I'm abnormal.

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm not.

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
I've been this way
since he began to rape me.

179
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Who?

180
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,840
You know him.

181
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm sure he's still
teaching your History class.

182
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
What?

183
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,960
[Berta] It all started
with my parents' divorce.

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,040
[indistinct shouting]

185
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,080
[Berta] <i>It was a horrible time in my life.</i>

186
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>I was majorly fucked up.</i>

187
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,080
[Berta's mom] Listen to me! Fucker!

188
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,240
I hate you!

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,040
You fucking son of a bitch!

190
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
[door slams]

191
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
[door opens]

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
[Berta] <i>He was the only one who...</i>

193
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
<i>Who noticed.</i>

194
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,120
<i>He was nice to me. He...</i>

195
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,240
[teacher] Berta?

196
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,880
[Berta] <i>He told me
that he'd been through the same thing.</i>

197
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,560
<i>And that he knew how I felt.</i>

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,480
[Berta laughs]

199
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
<i>So, I</i>

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,040
<i>clung to him like a lifeline.</i>

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,880
<i>- I would...</i>
- Berta!

202
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,720
<i>...look for him in the schoolyard.</i>

203
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,680
<i>He made me feel good.</i>

204
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,920
<i>- He said that... that I was special.</i>
- [indistinct chatter]

205
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,600
I came to think
that he liked me like I liked him.

206
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,440
I told him my secrets.

207
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,200
Private things.

208
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,440
I sent him pictures.

209
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Then one afternoon,

210
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720
he made me go up to his office.

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,440
And... [clears throat]

212
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
[breathes shakily]

213
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,160
He made me touch him.

214
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,240
He forced me.

215
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
He wiped himself on my uniform.

216
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,040
After school,
I threw it in a trash container.

217
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,200
That way I could pretend

218
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,000
as if nothing ever happened.

219
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,920
Or as if it wouldn't happen again.

220
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,320
But that isn't how it happened.

221
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,560
[tense music plays]

222
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,000
So you haven't told anyone?

223
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Like who?

224
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
[poignant music plays]

225
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
I was afraid no one

226
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,480
would believe me.

227
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Or they

228
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
would think that I was the one
who started it.

229
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,200
[Berta] <i>The abuse stopped. But...</i>

230
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
<i>something had broken inside of me.</i>

231
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>I fell into a deep, fucked up depression.</i>

232
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,040
<i>Every night,</i>

233
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
<i>I'd get as fucked up as I could
on anything I could get my hands on.</i>

234
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,880
And that's when I first attempted
to commit suicide.

235
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,960
Young ladies. Back to your own bed.

236
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,160
[nurse] I'm going to give you something
so you can sleep, okay?

237
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,560
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

238
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400

[panting]

240
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,560
Are you gonna keep acting
like you didn't know, Alma?

241
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
You were there.

242
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,160
[panicked crying]

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
[panting]

244
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
Morning, sweetheart.

245
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
- How are you feeling?
- Where's Berta?

246
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,760
They took her up to the ward.

247
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,280
[Christian] You think she told anyone?

248
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,960
I don't know.

249
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,080
[Christian] Fuck.

250
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,920
But after what happened yesterday,
I'd expect anything.

251
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,520
- [Alberto] Hey, babe.
- Hello.

252
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,240
I sent you a bunch of texts last night.

253
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,680
Hm, I fell asleep early.

254
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,880
[Christian] Hey, you're not mad, are you?

255
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
We were just messing around.

256
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Course not. I know that. Gonna go pee.

257
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,520
[puffs] Full of shit.

258

TYPES OF COMPANIES

259
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
The origin of the funds can be net,

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,160
which are those funds
that are the company's own,

261
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,480
or they can be passive...

262
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,160
[girl] This means that the profits
increase little by little.

263
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
Now that they've
returned from their work trip.

264
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,920
We went to this awesome country house.
You'd love it.

[chatter, laughter]

269
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Take care.

270
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
So? Nata, how'd you do?

271
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Nata!

272
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Hey!

273
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,800
I was walking home and I...
I saw a Guardia Civil car.

274
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,880
But it went straight.

275
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,720
Listen, after uh...

276
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,760
After... last night,

277
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
I think we should call it off.

278
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,320
- What?
- I mean the house thing.

279

[scoffs]

280
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,480
So I have spent all fucking day preparing
for this moment and you come and screw it.

281
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,440
I don't know why it surprises me.
You're capable of ruining anything.

282
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
But you know what?

283
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Whatever.

284
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,760
We're done. We're officially over.

285
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,520
- What? Why? Wait, Nata. No, listen.
- Don't fucking touch me!

286
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,960
You wanted your friends to fuck me.
You're fucking disgusting.

287
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,096
What are you saying? You told me you
wanted to fuck around with multiple guys.

288
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,880
But it was a fantasy, you moron!

289
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,400
I wanted to make you horny.
But if you wanna set something up,

290
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,256
call Christian, let him fuck you
in the ass, since you like that anyway.

291
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,976
- You'll not talk to me like that.
- I'll talk to you however I please.

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,960
And don't fuck with me or I'll tell my mom
and you can kiss Canada goodbye.

293
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
- [Alberto] Nata.
- And one more thing.

294
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
I ended this, okay?

295
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,616
So until the school year ends,
you're gonna put on a sad face

296
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,320
and you're gonna shut your fucking mouth.

297
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Nata, wait.

298
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,640
Forget about taking this bus,
because there's no way we're sharing one.

- [Nata] Why aren't you at work?
- Answer my question.

Um...

303
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,816
I borrowed it from a friend. It's, um...

304
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,976
It's my costume for a party.
I'm going as Mariah Carey.

[Nata's mom] Another house
got broken into yesterday.

And the neighbors said
they saw a group of guys run out

with a girl who was wearing
Christmas pajamas just like these!

No. Papa!

She shit herself.

Soon as we arrive,
a poor toothless junkie says, "Hi" to her.

No partying on the weekends.

Well, doesn't matter anyway,
because I don't have anywhere to go.

The fact that the three of them
tried to rape you.

- [Nata] That I provoked them,

408
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,240
that I'm a slut,
that I wanted it to happen, for example.

Nata,

413
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,800
everybody should be aware
of how shitty Alberto and his friends are.

414
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,920
They should be forced
to stand in front of everyone,

and confess what they tried
to do and beg your forgiveness.

you have? Because you sound unhinged.

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Berta, Alma's come to see you!

632
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,600
[knocking on door]

633
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Hey.

634
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
How are you?

635
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,880
Pretty good, actually.

636
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,040
I'm on these new pills that are the shit.

637
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,800
Now everything looks so colorful again
and I have this incredible urge to live.

639
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
That's great.

640
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,880
Why are you here so early in the morning?

641
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,520
Um... I wanted to talk to you.

642
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
What's wrong?

643
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,960
Three years ago,

644
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
I was there.

645
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,480
<i>I had a stomach bug,</i>

646
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,280
<i>and like always, our toilets were clogged.</i>

648
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720

649
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,400
<i>Then I heard his voice.</i>

650
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,720
[teacher] Look me in the eye.

651

[tense music plays]

652
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,880
[teacher] You'll always look me
in the eyes, right?

653
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,840
You know I like that.

655

<i>I couldn't hear what he said to you,
but it didn't sound good.</i>

656
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,000
[teacher grunts]

[teacher talking indistinctly]

<i>[Alma] I replayed it
in my head a million times.</i>

659
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,840
I couldn't find a logical explanation,

660
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,720
so I decided not to tell anyone
and to just pretend it never happened.

661
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,000
- I really am sorry, Berta, honestly.
- Mm.

662
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,000
- Forgive me, please.
- No, no.

663
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,800
You don't have to apologize for anything.

664
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,400
You were only 13 years old
and you were frightened.

665
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,016
- It wasn't your fault.
- But if I'd said something...

666
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,160
Maybe he would have been arrested
and I could've avoided this depression

667
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,400
and the three suicide attempts. Or not.

668
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You know,

669
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,440
I always suspected
that you may have known.

670
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,080
Couldn't be a coincidence
that around that time

671
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,560
you walked in the opposite direction
every time you saw me.

672
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,400
After school,
in between classes, at recess.

673
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,800
- Berta, you should really turn him in.
- No.

674
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
Berta, I'll go with you.
I'll back you up, yeah?

675
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
No way.

676
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
No way, Alma, you've already helped me
more than you can imagine. But...

677
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,160
No.

678
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
At least,
say what he did to you to others.

679
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,680
I can't, Alma. I will not do it.

680
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,720
But this isn't just about you.

681
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,920
We have time to avoid this
happening to other girls

682
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,400
In the same position
who could suffer like you did.

683
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,120
I bet that son of a bitch
is looking for a new victim right now.

684
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,600
I can't. I can't do it!
And besides, I've no proof,

685
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,000
so if I chose to accuse him,
it's my word against his.

686
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,960
- But I saw you there.
- No, you saw us both talking.

687
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,800
You don't even know
what happened in that room though.

688
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,200
I trust you.

689
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,640
But Alma, that's the thing!

690
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
It doesn't matter.

691
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,880
If it did, I'd have to relive
what happened in there over again.

692
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,120
Relive it all.

693
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,920
Every single day
of that fucking school year.

694
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,240
And it's too much, Alma.

695
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,800
It'd be easier for me to die
than to think about that.

696
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Please, Alma.

697
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,800
Promise me that you
won't tell anyone anything?
