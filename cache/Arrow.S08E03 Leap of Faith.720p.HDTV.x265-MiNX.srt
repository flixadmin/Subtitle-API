1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:01,968
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:04,406
For 7 years, I have fought
with only one goal...

3
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:05,765
to save my city,

4
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:07,509
but now a new threat has emerged,

5
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:09,145
a danger so severe, it has forced me

6
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:11,228
to leave my family in order to face it,

7
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:13,731
and it won't be enough for
me to just be the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:15,285
To prevent the crisis that's coming,

9
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:17,454
I am going to have to
become someone else.

10
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:20,688
I am going to have to
become... something else.

11
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,937
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,341
Turns out Connor
doesn't know his brother

13
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,281
as well as he thinks.

14
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:26,752
We're all still alive, aren't we?

15
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,062
Which means what exactly,

16
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:29,785
that your brother's not such a bad guy?

17
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:30,789
What did you do?

18
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,334
You are not gonna touch me.

19
00:00:32,337 --> 00:00:34,148
- Oh, my God.
- Because if you do,

20
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,117
the men who are storming
your bunker right now

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,257
will kill your brother.

22
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,675
I ignored the orders of a cosmic being,

23
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:41,111
and as a result, I watched

24
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:42,914
an entire world disappear.

25
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,782
We're facing the
destruction of everything?

26
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:46,668
That's the very definition
of all hands on deck.

27
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,200
A lot of people have died already

28
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:49,360
for the sake of this mission.

29
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:51,114
I owe it to all of them to find out who

30
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,421
the Monitor really is.

31
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:53,456
So what's the plan?

32
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,078
I'm going to Nanda Parbat.

33
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,593
_

34
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:35,432
Ollie?

35
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:36,992
Hi, Speedy.

36
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:41,781
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

37
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,786
Well, I'm guessing Mia's for Mom

38
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,445
and not my Corto Maltese alias.

39
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:49,813
Good guess.

40
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,317
She's beautiful, Ollie.

41
00:01:58,457 --> 00:01:59,923
Where'd you get that?

42
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:01,558
Athena.

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,635
I wasn't expecting to
find you here alone.

44
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:05,395
Where's Nyssa?

45
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:08,097
Thailand, I think. I don't know.

46
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,982
After we destroyed the Lazarus pits,

47
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:14,404
she said she had some League
business to take care of.

48
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:17,440
You destroyed the pits.

49
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:18,989
Why didn't you come home?

50
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:23,480
Pits may be gone, but
the Thanatos Guild isn't.

51
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:26,349
I have to take them down
after what they did to Roy.

52
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,901
That's fair. Have you seen him?

53
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:31,821
He came back here after Star City.

54
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,890
He told me what happened,

55
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:37,349
how he killed those men and...

56
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:40,430
He's dealing with his own demons.

57
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,898
He'll be back.

58
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:46,236
I missed you.

59
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,104
I missed you, too.

60
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:51,307
But I'm pretty sure I'm not
the reason why you came here.

61
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:53,109
Last year, I made a deal

62
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:56,613
with a cosmic being named Mar Novu.

63
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,322
Recently, he came to collect his debt.

64
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:00,747
He asked me to help him,

65
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,820
but he's not very good
at sharing information

66
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:07,257
with the people he's working with.

67
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,694
Sounds like somebody else I know.

68
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,330
I need to be 100% sure
that I can trust him.

69
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,466
I know it's a long
shot, but I was hoping

70
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:20,744
that Nyssa could tell
me what, if anything,

71
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,372
the League knows about him.

72
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:25,074
Okay. What are you not telling me?

73
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:26,708
He's seen the future.

74
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:31,381
He's seen me die.

75
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,886
It's soon, Speedy.

76
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:42,959
And?

77
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:46,696
Take as much time as
you need to be upset.

78
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,932
Ollie, come on. You've cheated death

79
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:52,682
more than any of us have by this point.

80
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:54,518
This is fundamentally
different than anything

81
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,272
that we've ever dealt with before.

82
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:00,577
Okay.

83
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:04,847
Well, let's try to figure
out what we're dealing with,

84
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,684
but like I said, Nyssa's not here.

85
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,520
Sara hasn't been able to help either.

86
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:14,090
We've kind of killed off every
League member, haven't we?

87
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:18,361
I can think of one more.

88
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,566
William?

89
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,270
William?

90
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,738
Frak!

91
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,108
William!

92
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:36,379
Where is he?

93
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,014
- Aah?
- Oh. It's you.

94
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,415
I'm here. I'm okay.

95
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,551
I remembered how Mom hardwired

96
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,886
the bunker's power
grid through the floor.

97
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,651
Gave those guys the
shock of their lives.

98
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:47,290
Guys.

99
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,892
This is why JJ was going after William.

100
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,114
He's targeting all the members

101
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:52,841
of the Star City unification movement.

102
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,963
The ones that are still alive anyway.

103
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,433
This was a city-wide assault.

104
00:04:57,435 --> 00:05:00,239
There's 10 confirmed dead.

105
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,239
And now that JJ knows who they all are,

106
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:05,607
it's only a matter of time before
he wipes out the entire movement.

107
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,911
Unless we trap him first.

108
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:12,148
All we really need is the right... lure.

109
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,916
You want to use yourself as bait?

110
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,085
No way. It is too dangerous.

111
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:17,708
Look. I know you don't
want to hear this,

112
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,555
but the Deathstrokes have
been 5 steps ahead of us

113
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:20,536
this whole time.

114
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,864
We need to gain the upper hand.

115
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:24,493
Which is why we are going
to bring the fight to them,

116
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:26,496
take them out in one fell swoop.

117
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,486
How? It's not like we're gonna waltz

118
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:31,434
back into their headquarters.

119
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:33,607
Unless that's your plan.

120
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,154
Mia, that didn't work out

121
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:36,513
too well for us last time.

122
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:37,908
Right, but we've been there before.

123
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,209
We know the layout.

124
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:40,739
We can use that to our advantage.

125
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,104
I think this is a mistake.

126
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,780
I'll remember that.

127
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:45,014
Get ready to move out.

128
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,596
_

129
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,271
Something wrong with the uplink?

130
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,022
No, no. It's our timing that's off.

131
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,558
JJ already went to sleep.

132
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,708
Well, we can call him back, wake him up.

133
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,896
No. Little man's gone
through enough already.

134
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,965
Besides, I need to know
what mission was so important

135
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,868
that you wanted me here
instead of Nanda Parbat.

136
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,538
Ben Turner is currently
on a deep cover op,

137
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,707
so I've been keeping
an eye on his family.

138
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,110
Sandra Hawke has
never missed a check-in

139
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,091
until yesterday.

140
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,205
So you think something
happened to Sandra and Connor?

141
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,549
I know it.

142
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:24,387
These pictures were taken
at an airfield in Kasnia.

143
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,756
Kasnia? That's far from home.

144
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,956
Any chance Sandra and Connor
are meeting up with Turner?

145
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,895
Kasnia's nowhere close to
any of Turner's missions

146
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,229
past, present, or future,

147
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:34,997
and then there's this man.

148
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,718
Abdul Nardoc. He owns that plane.

149
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,588
Nardoc bills himself
as a philanthropist,

150
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,739
but intel suggests that he
has ties to local terrorists.

151
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,611
- Hmm.
- He's throwing a fundraiser

152
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,375
tomorrow at his home.

153
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:48,752
Odds are good that Sandra and
Connor are being held on site.

154
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,214
We need to infiltrate
and get eyes on them.

155
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,149
Why not just take an
A.R.G.U.S. recon team?

156
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,658
I've spent the past few months
trying to untangle the web

157
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,553
of corruption at A.R.G.U.S.

158
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:00,890
Until I eliminate it, I
can't trust this with anyone.

159
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:03,192
I need you with me, John.

160
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:06,596
Hmm. Must be really important

161
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,398
if you call me John.

162
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,933
Guess I need a suit.

163
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,569
I already picked one out.

164
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,037
Hmm.

165
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:22,512
I thought you guys were friends now.

166
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:26,849
Well... not exactly.

167
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:30,591
Okay. Well, this place
isn't the least bit creepy.

168
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:46,135
Hold!

169
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,704
Leave us.

170
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,607
Your students used to
ask questions first.

171
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,376
I have learned

172
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,896
that hesitation often proves fatal.

173
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,686
You should not have come to this place.

174
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:06,322
You owe me a debt.

175
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:07,989
I'm here to collect.

176
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:15,005
You come here at great peril.

177
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,707
Especially you.

178
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,909
Word of your exploits has traveled far.

179
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:20,878
How is my sister?

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,013
She's great. Vacationing,

181
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,581
working on a tan.

182
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,350
I see you survived prison.

183
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:29,453
Mm-hmm. Dr. Parker didn't.

184
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,422
Heard he was killed with a sword.

185
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,575
He received the justice he deserved.

186
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,552
So now you're back to your old exploits?

187
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:38,428
With the League gone, the
region has become quite unstable.

188
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,564
And you think training
a bunch of assassins

189
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:43,033
in a place like this
is gonna stabilize it?

190
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,560
I think it a wiser course of action

191
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:46,174
than declaring a one-woman war

192
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,247
on the Thanatos Guild.

193
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,318
Much as I would like
to have a debate, Talia,

194
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,377
I need to know whatever
the League might know

195
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,747
about Mar Novu.

196
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,051
That's an unusual name. I'd remember it.

197
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:01,427
If it helps, he's apparently
some kind of cosmic know-it-all.

198
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,065
Well, such beings
often go by many names.

199
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:06,923
If I help you,

200
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:09,893
I can consider my debt paid?

201
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:12,364
Yes.

202
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,731
If the League has any
information concerning this man,

203
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,734
it will be found
underneath the Karan Shah.

204
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:19,303
The League's stronghold.

205
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,161
It has since been destroyed,

206
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:24,140
but my father kept the League
records in the catacombs,

207
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:27,444
so with any luck, they're
still there waiting to be found.

208
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:32,015
We leave at nightfall.

209
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,350
She's still fun.

210
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,160
- You good?
- I'm fine.

211
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,762
I think I just... ack...
Got some dust in my mouth.

212
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:49,199
Ack! Was it this dusty last time?

213
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,467
It was worse.

214
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:51,989
Are you sure this is gonna work?

215
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,837
If I can tap into the
old Galaxy One cameras,

216
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,506
we should be able to see everything,

217
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:59,009
including JJ and his
Deathstroke maniacs.

218
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,811
Pstt. Hey.

219
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,312
Someone's coming.

220
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,607
Guys, there's an office
just up here I can use.

221
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:23,450
Okay. System's gonna need a minute
to reboot before I can access it.

222
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,539
Look. I know you think
this is a bad idea.

223
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,374
The 4 of us taking on all of JJ's forces

224
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,276
on their home turf?

225
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:33,977
Wasn't my first choice.

226
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,812
Thanks for coming anyway.

227
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:38,916
We're a team. I just...

228
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,752
I hope you're doing this
for the right reasons.

229
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:43,474
What do you mean?

230
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,322
I'm pissed that JJ tried
to kill William, too,

231
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,659
but we can't let fear
dictate our strategy.

232
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:51,762
I'm not afraid of JJ or his idiot goons.

233
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,831
I know, but you are afraid
of losing your brother.

234
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,036
Bad news, guys. System's in
worse shape than I thought.

235
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,802
I'm gonna need more time.

236
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:02,438
We should get into position.

237
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,041
I'll stay with William until he's done.

238
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,741
Let us know when you're up and running.

239
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:07,044
Yeah.

240
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,541
_

241
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:18,029
See a lot of unfriendly faces here.

242
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:19,333
How you looking?

243
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,968
Just waiting for the security feeds

244
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,939
to finish uploading.

245
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:29,599
Hmm. Dancing undercover's like déjà vu.

246
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:32,936
There's Nardoc.

247
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:34,605
What do you say we take a closer look,

248
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,306
find out who his friends are?

249
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:41,278
You've come a long
way since Afghanistan.

250
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,864
Heh heh heh.

251
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:45,315
Yeah. Well, sometimes, I wish
we were still on that tour.

252
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,317
Life was a lot less complicated.

253
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,083
But we wouldn't be married.

254
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:53,255
Hmm. That's true. Or divorced.

255
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:58,662
Or remarried, and we wouldn't
have our beautiful boy.

256
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:00,163
All the feeds are complete.

257
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,598
Copy that.

258
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:08,331
Sandra and Connor are here.

259
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:09,767
They're being held in a room

260
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,161
in the northeast corner.

261
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,443
Good. We'll exfil them out
before Nardoc knows what hit him.

262
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,122
I don't think it's gonna be that easy.

263
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,691
- Why?
- We just got a hit on one

264
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:19,715
of Nardoc's friends.

265
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:22,819
The man in the black
suit and blue tie...

266
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:24,788
Farzad Qadir.

267
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,657
Gholem Qadir's son.

268
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,846
- Who Ben Turner killed?
- To save me.

269
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,443
I doubt his family's
kidnapping is a coincidence.

270
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:37,167
Wow. Love what they
haven't done with the place.

271
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:38,869
Assuming the Karan Shah
hasn't been plundered,

272
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:40,437
we're likely to find
what we're looking for

273
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,005
in "The Chronicles of Al-Fatih."

274
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,840
He was the first Ra's al Ghul.

275
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:45,976
According to legend, he was
bestowed primordial knowledge

276
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,778
by one of the sky gods.

277
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,646
Now my father kept a secret room

278
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,214
with his most valued possessions,

279
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:55,018
including information on Al-Fatih.

280
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:16,806
Looks like we're too late.

281
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,508
Not necessarily.

282
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,015
Heh heh heh.

283
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,029
"The Chronicles of Al-Fatih."

284
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,365
So the looters just
happened to leave behind

285
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,013
the one thing we're looking for?

286
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,857
Because the thieves did not
consider it to be of value.

287
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,526
Right. What's it say?

288
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,362
"The Phoenix is reborn in the fire.

289
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,232
The path to your destiny follows me."

290
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:44,234
Speedy, you just read Arabic.

291
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,002
You speak Russian.

292
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:50,006
Yes, but what does it mean?

293
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,744
To join the League,
your old self must die

294
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,046
so that your new one may be reborn.

295
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,150
Oh.

296
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,021
We need to burn the scroll.

297
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,544
The scroll is centuries old.

298
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:07,747
Yeah.

299
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,794
Al-Fatih took great
pains to hide his secrets

300
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,196
lest he be betrayed.

301
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:24,074
I believe this leads to Al-Fatih's tomb.

302
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:25,742
It stands to reason
that he would attempt

303
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,677
to take his secrets with
him beyond the grave.

304
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,045
So it's a scavenger hunt.

305
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,580
It would appear so, yes.

306
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:33,099
Why can't everything just be easy?

307
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:36,787
Actually, your situation is
more difficult than you think.

308
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,091
- Athena.
- You have always been

309
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,768
treacherous, Talia,
but bringing outsiders

310
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,895
into our sacred heart is a betrayal

311
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:48,231
of the highest order.

312
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,767
I'll take that.

313
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,107
Relinquish it or perish.

314
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,341
As you wish.

315
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,879
Attack them!

316
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:42,850
Athena showing up right when
we did can't be an accident.

317
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:45,853
No, and neither was her
giving Athena the sphere.

318
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:48,446
If you're accusing me, I'd
like to point out two things.

319
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,735
First, Athena and I are blood enemies.

320
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:51,826
And second?

321
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,494
She was likely trailing you.

322
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:56,497
The woman who's declared war on her.

323
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:58,899
Still, I don't see why Athena would give

324
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:01,302
a crap about a rusty, old
scroll buried with Al-Fatih.

325
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:03,571
She wouldn't. She would give a crap

326
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,139
about what else is buried with him,

327
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:06,841
namely his sword

328
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:08,743
as revered as the ring of Ra's.

329
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:10,644
Whoever wields it
commands absolute devotion.

330
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:12,313
Clearly Athena wants
to use it to restart

331
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,676
the League of Assassins.

332
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,484
Yeah. Well, now she's got the
marble of destiny or whatever.

333
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:18,119
Actually, it's a map.

334
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,942
The markings on it were constellations

335
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,489
indicating the tomb's
location, but we don't need it.

336
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:24,625
I've memorized them.

337
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:26,694
What?

338
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,929
- You memorized them?
- You didn't?

339
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,734
Okay. Listen. I'm gonna
go head with Talia.

340
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,010
I'd like you to go back to
her camp and wait for us there.

341
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:38,539
You can't be serious.

342
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,674
I will give you two a moment.

343
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,679
Ollie, I thought we were way

344
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:47,415
past this overprotective brother thing.

345
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:48,849
It's not about that.

346
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:50,970
You came to me for help.

347
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,582
I came to you for answers.

348
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,665
I wasn't counting on
getting attacked by Athena.

349
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:58,592
Athena and I were fighting
long before you showed up here.

350
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:00,644
I can take care of myself.

351
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:02,579
I know you can take care of yourself.

352
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:05,366
If Athena is trying to restart
the League of Assassins,

353
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,235
that makes you her chief rival.

354
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:09,645
- I don't care.
- I care, Thea.

355
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:13,777
If you want to help me,
just... just let me handle this.

356
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:27,688
Qadir must be using Turner's
family to lure him out.

357
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,057
Okay. Then we have to
get out of here right now.

358
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,759
What? What are you talking about?

359
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,329
If Ben Turner's a
target, then so are we,

360
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,899
and every second we stay
here, we risk being made.

361
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,365
What about Sandra and Connor?

362
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,234
Call an A.R.G.U.S. team, Lyla.

363
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:41,899
- Exfil them.
- It would take a team

364
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:43,500
at least an hour to get here.

365
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,103
A lot can happen between now that then.

366
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,032
Okay, fine, but we can't
risk doing this alone.

367
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,459
- We have to do something.
- Then you leave.

368
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:51,362
I'll get Sandra and Connor myself.

369
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,750
Johnny...

370
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,854
What's really going on here?

371
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,089
You've never been one
to shy away from risk.

372
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:05,137
I'd never seen a world just
disintegrate in front of my face.

373
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:13,434
I know what we do requires risk.

374
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:14,969
I've always accepted that,

375
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:18,672
but this is different, Lyla.

376
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:24,445
Seeing a universe just disappearing,

377
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:27,615
I don't know, it's like...

378
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:31,852
like looking into the eye of God.

379
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,988
It changes you.

380
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,489
It changed me.

381
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,693
I can't risk losing you.

382
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,328
I can't risk that.

383
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:49,634
No one knows the future.

384
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:52,473
All we can do is enjoy the time we have

385
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,657
with the people we love
and make our choices

386
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,980
from a place of strength, not fear,

387
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:02,267
and if the world ends today,

388
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,949
there is no one I'd
rather have by my side.

389
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,535
How much further?

390
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,863
Patience. You realize
your sister is involved

391
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:18,184
in this whether you
want her to be or not?

392
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,586
She's a daughter of the demon.

393
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:20,785
She has a claim to the sword.

394
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:22,957
She's carried enough
of Malcolm's burdens.

395
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,239
Fate does not care what
we believe we're owed.

396
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,807
You're very familiar with that.

397
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,143
Isn't that why you're here?

398
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:30,578
What do you mean?

399
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,079
You carry yourself with a heaviness

400
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,673
I've not seen since Russia.

401
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,849
This is the place.

402
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,918
I've been here before.

403
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,421
Yes. When my father vanquished you.

404
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,022
Hopefully you have better luck

405
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,691
with the mountain this time.

406
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:54,935
Down!

407
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,939
The Phoenix up there,
triggering the spears.

408
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:00,407
Here's an idea.

409
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,434
The key to the Crypt of Ra's.

410
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:26,400
Looks like the entrance right there.

411
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:27,768
Yes.

412
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,707
Agh!

413
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:36,110
Wh... what are you doing?

414
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,814
I am sorry, Oliver.

415
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,883
I can't let Athena get to the sword,

416
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:41,645
but I can't let you get it either.

417
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:56,804
Looks like you're down
one evil companion.

418
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:58,172
Hmm.

419
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:07,080
I thought I told you
to stay at the camp.

420
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,250
You did. Looks like I didn't
ignore you soon enough.

421
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:14,321
Hey. I don't have time
for an I told you so.

422
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,323
All right.

423
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:20,728
So Talia will take the
trail to the summit.

424
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,963
It's safer, you conserve energy,

425
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:25,899
but going up the face of
the mountain is faster.

426
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,735
Thought you said it was harder.

427
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:30,237
Yeah. I've done it before.

428
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,873
Okay. If you can do it, I can do it.

429
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,509
- Thea.
- Ollie, just stop it.

430
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,777
Start walking.

431
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,784
Tell me you're almost
done hacking those cameras.

432
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:43,340
You ever hear that thing
about patience being a virtue?

433
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,388
Since when have I ever
cared about virtue?

434
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,723
All right. Seriously, how much longer?

435
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,352
Okay. I just activated the
northwest quadrant cameras.

436
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,989
I just need a few more minutes to
get the rest of them up and running.

437
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,730
How many is a few?

438
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,198
Look. I know what I'm doing, okay,

439
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,991
so just trust me.

440
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,303
I do.

441
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,005
I d... I just...

442
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,276
William, this has to work.

443
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:10,811
If we're gonna bring Star City

444
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:12,139
and The Glades back together,

445
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:15,148
we have to take out the
Deathstrokes for good this time.

446
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:19,520
Well, we could have if you'd
let the team use me as bait.

447
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:21,588
No. That is too risky, and you know it.

448
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,957
Well, how many times have you
risked yourself for this team?

449
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,393
How many times have you beaten
up a guy 10 times your size

450
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,195
to protect someone you care about?

451
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:30,296
- That's different.
- Why? Because I'm not a fighter?

452
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,899
No. Because you're my brother.

453
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:41,141
You are the only family I have left.

454
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:45,082
Mia... look.

455
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:46,780
I...

456
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,616
I appreciate you
looking out for me. I do,

457
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,164
but operating from a place of fear

458
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,200
is not the way to protect each other.

459
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,832
We need to trust each other.

460
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:58,158
It's the only way we'll survive.

461
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,530
Found them.

462
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:07,201
Oh, boy. That is a lot of Deathstrokes.

463
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:08,702
You sure about this?

464
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,609
- Connor, Zoe, we have eyes.
- Roger that.

465
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,241
- Get ready to move.
- On it.

466
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,048
Mia.

467
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,216
Be careful.

468
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,750
I will.

469
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:29,121
Oh, and if you tell anyone

470
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,991
about this conversation,

471
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,826
I will kill you myself.

472
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,070
Err!

473
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,281
Thought you said this was the hard part.

474
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:58,652
Don't get cocky.

475
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,722
Okay. What is going on with you, Ollie?

476
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,190
You were never this overprotective

477
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,193
when I left Star City.

478
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:09,096
Things have changed.

479
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:13,834
I left my family behind, Speedy,

480
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,269
and I miss them.

481
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,173
And every day, I wrestle
with whether or not

482
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,576
I made the right decision
because maybe I didn't,

483
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:23,777
and...

484
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:30,871
I saw an entire world
wiped out of existence,

485
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:34,009
a world that you weren't in, by the way,

486
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:36,512
because I wasn't around to protect you.

487
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,329
I'm sorry, Thea, but the
only way that I can bear this

488
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:48,201
is if I become 100% certain

489
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:51,772
that my sacrifice, that my death...

490
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:59,046
Will protect the people I love.

491
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,782
I need my family to be safe.

492
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:06,274
You know, I've been thinking a lot

493
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:09,913
about Mom and Dad lately,

494
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,698
wondering what they would think

495
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:15,761
about the lives we've chosen.

496
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,464
All the mistakes they made,

497
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:20,754
all the... lies they told

498
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:26,540
in their own very, very messed up way.

499
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,241
They thought they were protecting us.

500
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:30,277
They weren't. They didn't.

501
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,114
No, but... it did help us become

502
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,849
the people we are today.

503
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:42,756
They turned us into heroes.

504
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:45,792
We can't change the future, Ollie.

505
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,562
The past teaches us you might as well

506
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:51,331
not bother trying to.

507
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,699
Heh.

508
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:58,305
When you'd stop being my baby sister?

509
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,442
No. I never did.

510
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:05,612
I just grew up a little bit.

511
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,148
Now can we please get off this mountain?

512
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,416
Yeah.

513
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,828
We're not alone.

514
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,535
Apparently, this day
is not going the way

515
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:30,070
either of us have planned.

516
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:32,372
Surrender your weapons.

517
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:33,796
What do you want?

518
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,544
The route to Al-Fatih's
Crypt will be dangerous.

519
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:41,715
Always good to have a
few sacrificial lambs

520
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:43,843
to tell us where not to stray.

521
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,487
After you.

522
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,980
Underground in Nanda Parbat.

523
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:07,053
What could possibly go wrong?

524
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:27,650
Well, Indiana Jones made
this look way more fun.

525
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,925
"To survive death, you must embrace it."

526
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:38,561
Well, how do you embrace death?

527
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:40,797
The coffin. Come on.

528
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:50,039
Go on.

529
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,307
Okay.

530
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,120
I miss watching you kick ass.

531
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:05,454
This way.

532
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:10,659
Must be passcode-protected.

533
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:12,061
This should be able to crack it,

534
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,228
but it'll take a few minutes.

535
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:14,764
We may not have a few minutes.

536
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,500
If this is Qadir and his men,

537
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,968
he'll recognize us
the minute he sees us.

538
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,302
Maybe we can use that.

539
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:22,049
I was standing next to Gholem Qadir

540
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:23,439
the night that Turner killed him.

541
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:24,940
I can distract Farzad.

542
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,308
Lyla that's too dangerous.

543
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,844
It's our only option.

544
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:31,347
Hey. Just be careful.

545
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:40,121
Pardon me.

546
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:41,424
Wait.

547
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:47,229
You know, usually, I
detest party crashers,

548
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:49,965
but I'll make an exception for you...

549
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:51,801
Lyla Michaels.

550
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,276
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
It's okay. My name is John Diggle.

551
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:02,078
I'm a friend of Lyla
Michaels and Ben Turner.

552
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,636
I'm here to help you. I
can get you out of here,

553
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:06,414
but you have to move quietly.
Come on, come on. Shh, shh shh.

554
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:09,118
Did you know I was there
the night my father died?

555
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,053
I was supposed to stay in my room,

556
00:29:11,055 --> 00:29:13,055
but I wanted to hear the music.

557
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,857
Do you have any idea
what it's like to watch

558
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,792
your own father be murdered?

559
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:19,295
I was just a boy.

560
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:21,797
I'm sorry you had to see that,

561
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,399
but your father was a criminal.

562
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,201
So he deserved to die?

563
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:29,002
I will have my vengeance.

564
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,213
You all right?

565
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:38,714
I've got Sandra and Connor.

566
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:40,049
Let's go home.

567
00:29:45,723 --> 00:29:46,989
Prisoners first.

568
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:50,335
Watch your step.

569
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:07,009
Ollie, a Phoenix.

570
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:09,712
All right. Crypt must be through there.

571
00:30:09,714 --> 00:30:11,113
Okay.

572
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:12,548
Thea!

573
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:16,369
Thank you.

574
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:17,705
Yeah.

575
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,626
"All beings burn,

576
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:26,562
but a Phoenix rises from the ashes."

577
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:28,874
Okay. I think we need
to use the Phoenix tiles

578
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,499
to get across.

579
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:48,350
You hold them off. I'll get Talia.

580
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:49,818
- Thea!
- Just trust me.

581
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:08,771
Talia?

582
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,510
You're too late.

583
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,686
As heir to the demon, I have the right

584
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:25,421
to challenge you to combat.

585
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:28,290
You wish to fight me?

586
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,793
Very well. I accept.

587
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:33,111
I hope you prove to
be a worthy opponent.

588
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:51,012
Your brother trained you well.

589
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:54,183
Pity the tools you learned
from him he learned from me.

590
00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:55,951
Less talk, more fighting.

591
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:20,158
You were a fool to think
you could defeat me.

592
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:25,913
Actually...

593
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,650
You're right where I want you.

594
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:28,917
Unh!

595
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:34,723
Do you yield?

596
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:39,928
I yield.

597
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:54,745
Ahem. What's it say?

598
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:57,148
It says Al-Fatih was visited by a god

599
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,186
who possessed the power to see
all that is and all that will be.

600
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,222
He believed that if he
failed to keep the balance

601
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:07,725
between good and evil this god would

602
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:11,562
bring forth the end of times,

603
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:14,532
the annihilation of all things.

604
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,068
Ollie, if that's true,
this means that...

605
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,871
It means Mar Novu is
not trying to prevent

606
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,540
what's going to happen

607
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,542
because he's gonna be what causes it.

608
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,007
You're leaving?

609
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,111
I have betrayed my honor

610
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:37,088
and the sacred traditions of the League.

611
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,791
The sword was destined to
be yours, daughter of Merlyn.

612
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:43,727
I am sorry for the pain
I've caused you both.

613
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,262
What about your students?

614
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,525
I've released them.

615
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:48,466
They will follow you if
that is what you wish.

616
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,361
It's not.

617
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,763
You're their teacher.

618
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,437
They need someone to follow.

619
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,596
If I was meant to lead them,

620
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,272
I would wield Al-Fatih's sword,

621
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,309
but you do,

622
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:01,045
so the honor and the burden are yours.

623
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:02,580
Yeah. Hard pass.

624
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,914
It is your destiny.

625
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,635
Yeah, but, see, about that.

626
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,900
I don't really believe in
the whole fate, destiny thing.

627
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:13,757
We can all make our own choices.

628
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,626
Meaning?

629
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:17,962
Meaning I don't think the world needs

630
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:21,632
another League of Assassins.

631
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:26,170
It could use League of Heroes.

632
00:34:26,172 --> 00:34:30,674
It wouldn't be a one-woman job.

633
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:32,109
You'd extend me that honor

634
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,178
despite my betrayals?

635
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,646
You made a mistake.

636
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,915
We've all made mistakes.

637
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,885
Not one but two women to
wield my father's sword?

638
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,030
He would be aghast.

639
00:34:53,032 --> 00:34:55,499
Heh.

640
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:56,834
I accept.

641
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,971
New phone, better encryption,

642
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,733
and a one-way ticket home via Hong Kong.

643
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,283
No one will be expecting that.

644
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,377
I can't thank you
enough for all your help.

645
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,752
I mean, without you two I'd...

646
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:11,881
No, no. It's the least
we could have done,

647
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,852
and you were very brave.

648
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:16,654
Your father would be proud of you.

649
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,756
Thanks, Mr. Diggles.

650
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,322
Call me Dig.

651
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,860
Let's go get our things.

652
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:33,404
Hey. They're gonna be okay.

653
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:37,274
Yeah... and so are we.

654
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,781
The world's gonna keep coming for us.

655
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,549
There's nothing I can do to stop it.

656
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:49,887
Neither can you, but you were right.

657
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:52,723
We just hold on to each
other, we'll be fine

658
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:56,827
like Sandra and Connor.

659
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,529
What? What is it?

660
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:04,935
Johnny, promise me that
no matter what happens

661
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:08,072
you'll always remember the good times.

662
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:12,543
I won't have to because
I'm not going anywhere,

663
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,879
and neither are you.

664
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:18,716
I love you, Lyla Michaels.

665
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,084
I love you.

666
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:24,221
I love you, too.

667
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,258
Always have, always will.

668
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:33,097
I'm sorry you didn't get the
answers you were looking for.

669
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,066
Got to see you.

670
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,999
- Here's what I don't get.
- Okay.

671
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:41,905
If Mar Novu causes
whatever's gonna happen,

672
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:44,575
why does he bring you
in in the first place?

673
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,444
I don't know.

674
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:50,781
Look. I just... I know that if he

675
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:53,183
ends up being on the
wrong side of this...

676
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:57,588
I'm gonna stop him.

677
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,791
If you're gonna take on a god, Ollie,

678
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,060
you're gonna need all
the help you can get.

679
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:05,729
Pretty good on help actually.

680
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:09,833
I have John, I have
Laurel... believe it or not.

681
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:12,436
Seems to me you have your hands full

682
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,305
rebuilding the League of Assassins

683
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:16,540
into a League of Heroes.

684
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,109
Yeah.

685
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:24,615
I can't believe I'm saying
good-bye to you again.

686
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,719
Well, you're not. Think of it as a...

687
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:31,689
"See you later,

688
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:33,726
and please don't die."

689
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,838
One of us is gonna have to let go first.

690
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,773
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:54,845
No hozen this time?

692
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:57,881
Uh, Felicity gave it to William.

693
00:37:57,883 --> 00:38:00,951
I'm gonna miss you.

694
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:02,986
Every day, I miss you.

695
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:09,727
Good-bye, Speedy.

696
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,366
Bye, Ollie.

697
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:27,010
Tonight is the night that
we have all been waiting for,

698
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:31,515
the night that we destroy
the unification movement.

699
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:35,119
The city will be ours,

700
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:39,223
and there is nothing
anyone can do to stop it.

701
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,425
Actually, I think there is.

702
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,293
You just don't know when to quit.

703
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,879
Damn. What an entrance.

704
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:16,115
Mia!

705
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:19,395
You know, the human
body holds an average

706
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,199
of 5 liters of blood.

707
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,735
Let's see how much you have, huh?

708
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,303
Hyah!

709
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,575
Are you okay?

710
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,943
Thanks.

711
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,314
Zoe!

712
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:46,790
Zoe.

713
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:50,494
JJ!

714
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:53,597
Stay with me. We're
gonna get you out of here.

715
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,168
Tell... tell my dad...

716
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,338
Just tell... tell him that...

717
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,774
I'm sorry about everything.

718
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:09,705
That I love him.

719
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:14,280
Hey. Hey. You're gonna
tell him yourself, okay?

720
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:15,919
You are because we are...

721
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,754
We're gonna get you safe.

722
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:20,157
Okay? I got you.

723
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,807
Zoe, I got you.

724
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,910
Zoe?

725
00:40:24,913 --> 00:40:29,783
No. No, no, no, no.

726
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,096
No. Zoe.

727
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:36,535
Aah!

728
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,922
You don't have the guts, do you, huh?

729
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:54,558
You're wrong.

730
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,559
What is this?

731
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:10,073
Oliver?

732
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:16,713
What's going on?

733
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:18,549
That's a very good question.

734
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:28,794
Dad?

735
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:36,536
