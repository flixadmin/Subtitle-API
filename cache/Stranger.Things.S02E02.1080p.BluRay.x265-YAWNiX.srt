1
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,837
<i>Goodbye, Mike.</i>

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,296
Mike?

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,223
Mike?

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,723
Mike? Mike!

5
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,729
Mike!

6
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,651
Mike!

7
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,308
Bravo team, check in.

8
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,215
What about the Russians?
What if they come looking for her?

9
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,405
They don't know where she is.

10
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,578
And she can't contact you
without us knowing.

11
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,874
The most important thing
is for you to try to go on with your lives

12
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,078
- and to keep all of this...
- Top secret. Yeah.

13
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,961
Understood.
We're all patriots in this house.

14
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,155
- Go back to the beginning.
- I told you everything.

15
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,798
- I understand this is difficult, Michael.
- I don't know where she is.

16
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,883
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.

17
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,551
I would never tell you.

18
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,853
I know it's difficult to accept,

19
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,147
the stories she told you
were not true.

20
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,646
She's a very dangerous individual.

21
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,149
If she contacts you,
you must tell us.

22
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:45,484
Otherwise, you're putting yourself
and your entire family at risk.

23
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,867
Do you understand, Michael?
Do you understand?

24
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,041
Michael?

25
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,788
Michael?

26
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,632
Fan out.

27
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,051
Somebody check the left side,
I'll check the right side.

28
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,297
Oh, Jesus!

29
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,384
Ghost.

30
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,510
Yeah, I see that.

31
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,304
- Halloween.
- Sure is.

32
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,259
But right now, it's breakfast, okay?
Come on, let's eat.

33
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,594
They wouldn't see me.

34
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,271
- Who wouldn't see you?
- The bad men.

35
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,732
What are you talking about?

36
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,602
Trick or treat.

37
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,773
You want to go trick-or-treating?

38
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,786
You know the rules.

39
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,659
- Yes, but...
- Yeah, so you know the answer.

40
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,457
- No, but they wouldn't see me.
- No. Hey. I don't care.

41
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,910
- But they wouldn't see me.
- I don't care, all right?

42
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,917
You go out there,
ghost or not, it's a risk.

43
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,374
We don't take risks. All right?

44
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,048
They're stupid, and...

45
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,800
We're not stupid!

46
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,767
Exactly.

47
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:02,393
Now, you take that off, sit down and eat.
Your food's getting cold.

48
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,369
All right, look...

49
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:23,369
How about I get off early tonight,
and I buy us a bunch of candy,

50
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,421
and we can sit around and get fat,
and we watch a scary movie together?

51
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,711
How's that for a compromise?

52
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,009
"Compromise"?

53
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,723
C-O-M-promise. Compromise.

54
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,552
How about that's your word
for the day? Yeah?

55
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,106
It's something that's kinda in-between.
It's like halfway happy.

56
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,652
By 5-1-5?

57
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,231
5:15. Yeah, sure.

58
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,367
Promise?

59
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,327
Yes.

60
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,705
I promise.

61
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,118
Halfway happy.

62
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,772
Will?

63
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,976
Come on, honey, up and at 'em.

64
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,646
Will?

65
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,399
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

66
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,647
Where's Will?

67
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,858
- What?
- Where's Will?

68
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,442
- He's not in his room?
- No.

69
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,947
Uh...

70
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,199
Will?

71
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,831
What are you doing?

72
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,918
Peeing?

73
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,910
Okay.

74
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,173
Okay.

75
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,130
Let's get this... on.

76
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,085
Oh!

77
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,886
You need some tape. Hold on.

78
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,486
What's this?

79
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,698
Nothing.

80
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,321
Did you have another episode?

81
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,404
No, it's just, um...
a sketch for a story I'm writing.

82
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,370
All right.

83
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,294
Three, two, one...

84
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,861
Great. Hold up the proton blaster.

85
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,050
All right, now turn to the light.

86
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,423
Oh! I want to see those pearls. Yeah!

87
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,883
Who you gonna call?

88
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,057
Oh!

89
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,644
Adorable, baby. Just adorable!

90
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,856
- God. You are such a nerd.
- Shut up.

91
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,188
No wonder you only hang out with boys.

92
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,899
- Erica!
- Just the facts.

93
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,859
Nerd.

94
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,153
My God,
I love this costume. Keep it up.

95
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,290
- All right, that's the last one.
- No, just one more. Come on, please?

96
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,534
Ah!

97
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,994
- Can I go to school?
- Wait, wait.

98
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,920
- Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?"
- No!

99
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,048
Hey, Spengler!

100
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,849
- Egon! Yeah!
- Venkman!

101
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,935
Whoa! Whoa!

102
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,931
- What?
- Why are you Venkman?

103
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,888
- Because I'm Venkman.
- No, I'm Venkman.

104
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,473
Why can't there be two Venkmans?

105
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,981
Because there's only one Venkman
in real life. We planned this months ago.

106
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,359
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz,
you're Egon, and you're Winston.

107
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,192
- I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
- Yes, you did!

108
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,698
- I don't think he did.
- No one wants to be Winston, man.

109
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,119
What's wrong with Winston?

110
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,199
What's wrong with Winston?
He joined the team super late,

111
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,329
he's not funny,
and he's not even a scientist!

112
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,503
- Yeah, but he's still cool.
- If he's cool, then you be Winston.

113
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,796
- I can't!
- Why not?

114
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,296
- Because...
- Because you're not black?

115
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,172
- I didn't say that!
- You thought it.

116
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,009
- I didn't say that!
- Mike!

117
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,012
Guys... Guys! Guys!

118
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,389
Why is no one else wearing costumes?

119
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,027
Crap.

120
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,858
Oh, my God!

121
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,065
When do people make these decisions?

122
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,990
Everyone dressed up last year.

123
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,239
- It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
- Just be cool.

124
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,616
Who you gonna call?
The nerds!

125
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,257
- We gonna do this?
- Not right now. We look like morons.

126
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,882
Maybe she likes <i>Ghostbusters?</i>

127
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,511
Of course she likes <i>Ghostbusters,</i>
but that's not the point.

128
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,058
The point is
we're dressed up and she isn't.

129
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,904
I didn't bring
regular clothes. You?

130
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,845
No.

131
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,727
Then we have no choice.
We gotta do this. It's now or never.

132
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,979
- Right.
- Let's engage.

133
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,864
We could ask her after class.

134
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,111
- Yup.
- Okay.

135
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,409
See? It's an exact match.

136
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,085
- But... why would he lie to me?
- He's a kid, Joyce.

137
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,542
I mean, you heard him
describe these episodes.

138
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:28,597
It's not like he's describing a nightmare.
He talks about them like they're real.

139
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,970
Yeah, because they're not nightmares,
they're flashbacks.

140
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,643
I know a couple guys
who have had these things,

141
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,690
and it feels like you're there,
like it's happening.

142
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,818
- Then what the hell is this?
- Owens said it would get worse.

143
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,424
- That place...
- What do you wanna do?

144
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,025
You wanna take him back to Chicago?

145
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,109
Well, there's that guy in Boston
that's supposed to be...

146
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,534
They're all a bunch of quacks.

147
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,237
They'll all tell you the same thing,
just cost you more money.

148
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:59,083
I think he's right... about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.

149
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:03,963
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you... Will most of all.

150
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,429
I think we just gotta get through
the next few weeks.

151
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,144
Nothing's gonna go back
to the way that it was.

152
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,720
Not really.

153
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,180
But it'll get better.

154
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,353
In time.

155
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,699
- Here.
- Thank you.

156
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,910
Jesus! Hopper...

157
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,037
Brings me back to old times.

158
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,127
What?

159
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,585
- Sharing my cigarettes between...
- Fifth and sixth period.

160
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,757
Yeah, under the steps.

161
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,960
Mr. Cooper caught us that time, remember?

162
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,467
He was like,
"Hey, assholes."

163
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,390
We ran. We just ran.

164
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,443
God, I want this to be over.

165
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,409
I know.

166
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,207
How's it looking out there, cowboy?

167
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,956
<i>Uh, you know, Doc. The usual.</i>

168
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,753
<i>Nice and nasty
with a chance of radioactivity.</i>

169
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,182
<i>Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right.
Anyone hungry?</i>

170
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,943
And...

171
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,900
...we're back on!

172
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,947
<i>There was this storm.</i>

173
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,452
<i>Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?</i>

174
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,079
<i>I felt frozen.</i>

175
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,419
<i>Actually frozen? Cold?</i>

176
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,842
<i>No, like how you feel
when you're scared,</i>

177
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,012
<i>and you can't breathe
or talk or do anything.</i>

178
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,132
<i>I felt... I felt this evil...</i>

179
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,617
<i>Nancy, this isn't you.</i>

180
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,002
<i>Barb, just go ahead
and go home, okay?</i>

181
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,796
<i>Nancy?</i>

182
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,345
<i>Nancy!</i>

183
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,265
Nancy.

184
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,099
What's going on? Are you okay?

185
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,270
- I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

186
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,694
- Pretending like everything's okay.
- What are you talking about?

187
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,573
Barbara.

188
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,740
It's like everyone forgot.

189
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,614
It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.

190
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,624
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance...

191
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,790
And they're going to spend
the rest of their lives looking for her.

192
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,332
- I know.
- It's destroying them.

193
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,413
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen,
there's nothing we can do about it.

194
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,127
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.

195
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,920
- Well, you know that we can't do that.
- We don't have to tell them everything.

196
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,724
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any...

197
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:31,233
They could put us in jail. Okay?
Or worse, they could destroy our families.

198
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:36,026
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.

199
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,285
Hey...

200
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,411
Hey, hey...

201
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,910
Hey, it's...

202
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,327
It's hard, but let's...

203
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,169
let's just go to Tina's stupid party...

204
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,752
wear our stupid costumes

205
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,714
that we've been working on
for a stupid amount of time,

206
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,972
and just pretend
like we're stupid teenagers, okay?

207
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,846
Can we just do that, just for tonight?

208
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,027
Okay.

209
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,238
Come here.

210
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,289
Um...

211
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,580
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is...

212
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,257
- Lucas.
- Yeah, I know.

213
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,424
The stalkers.

214
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,761
Uh, no. Actually...

215
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,930
We weren't stalking you.

216
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,851
No, we were just concerned because,
you know, you're new and all.

217
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,303
Yeah, for your safety.

218
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,231
Mmm-hmm.
There are a lot of bullies here.

219
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,309
- So many bullies, it's crazy.
- Yeah.

220
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,773
- Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
- Well, these don't function. But...

221
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,906
I do have this
handy-dandy little trap here.

222
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,329
And look, it even opens and closes.
Look, look, look...

223
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,911
Voilà!

224
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,117
It's cool, right?

225
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,164
No? Okay. But, um...

226
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,498
So, we were talking last night,
and you're new here,

227
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,335
so you probably don't have any friends
to take you trick-or-treating,

228
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,467
and you're scared of bullies,
so we were thinking

229
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,765
that it would be okay if you come with us.

230
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,013
- "It'd be okay"?
- Yeah. Our party's a democracy,

231
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,463
the majority voted you could come.

232
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,241
Didn't realize it was such an honor
to go trick-or-treating with you.

233
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,186
We know where to get
the full-sized candy bars.

234
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,608
We figured you'd want in.

235
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,276
That's presumptuous of you.

236
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,449
Yeah. Totally.
Uh, so, um... you'll come?

237
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,656
We're meeting
at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00.

238
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,161
That's 7:00 on the dot!

239
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,869
"Presumptuous."

240
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,788
That's a good thing, right?

241
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Is it bad?

242
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,890
Lucas, is it bad? Lucas?
Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?

243
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,187
<i>How does it feel?
Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.</i>

244
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,023
<i>Inhuman. Relentless.</i>

245
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,898
<i>Arnold Schwarzenegger is...</i> The Term...

246
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,605
<i>Well, I'm stunned.
I don't know what to think.</i>

247
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,844
<i>- Don't you love me?
- Of course I love you.</i>

248
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,612
<i>It's just that it's so sudden.
I mean, it's not like you.</i>

249
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,288
<i>Erica, I am this way because of you.</i>

250
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,706
- <i>Me?</i>
- "Me?"

251
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,658
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

252
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,210
<i>You have made me wild and impetuous,</i>

253
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,628
<i>- just like you.</i>
- "Impetuous."

254
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,171
<i>People are going to be aghast.</i>

255
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,097
- "People are going to be aghast."
<i>- They're gonna love it.</i>

256
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,388
<i>I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town.
The whole world!</i>

257
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,138
<i>Erica, tell me that you will marry me,
in this house, tonight...</i>

258

259
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey.

260
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,494
I'm not gonna hurt you.

261
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,287
What's your name?

262
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,451
What're you doing out here in the cold?

263
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,246
So, you're telling me that
Merrill poisoned your farm,

264
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,083
because he thinks you poisoned his,
which, of course, you didn't?

265
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,340
No, sir. And I got me an alibi
the night he accuses me.

266
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,046
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.

267
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,975
- Did you actually see Merrill?
- No need. That man done lost his mind.

268
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,769
Went around slandering me,
threatening all sorts of madness.

269
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,266
A pumpkin conspiracy.

270
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,893
Hawkins' very own <i>Chinatown.</i>

271
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,272
Merrill threatening to do something
and him actually doing something

272
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,569
are two very different things.

273
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,738
- You got a better explanation?
- Cold weather.

274
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,860
- It's October.
- Yeah, it's a cold one.

275
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,152
- You see these hands?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,238
- You know why they look like that?
- Because you're old?

277
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,790
You're damn straight.

278
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,619
And I've been doing this
a long time, Chief. A long time.

279
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,079
And I ain't never seen
anything the likes of this.

280
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,790
- None of us have.
- None of us?

281
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,173
Merrill didn't just hit me last night.
He hit damn near everyone.

282
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,423
What are you talking about?

283
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:38,225
Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling,
Rick Neary, the Christensens.

284
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,098
All of their crops, dead.

285
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,398
Give me those names again.

286
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,125
You're late again.

287
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,452
- Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
- Jesus. I don't care.

288
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,538
You're late again,
and you're skating home.

289
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,631
Do you hear me?

290
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,519
God, this place is such a shithole.

291
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,312
- It's not that bad.
- No?

292
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,360
Mmm!

293
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,735
You smell that, Max?
That's actually shit.

294
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,611
- Cow shit.
- I don't see any cows.

295
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,738
Clearly, you haven't met
the high-school girls.

296
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,620
- So what, you like it here now?
- No.

297
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,866
- Then why are you defending it?
- I'm not.

298
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,166
Sure sounds like it.

299
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,336
- It's just we're stuck here, so...
- Hmm.

300
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,756
You're right. We're stuck here.

301
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,793
And whose fault is that?

302
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,637
Yours.

303
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,464
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

304
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,509
- Did you say it's my fault?
- No.

305
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,804
You know whose fault it is.

306
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,565
Say it.

307
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,101
Max...

308
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,571
say it.

309
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,149
Say it!

310
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,370
Really, everyone dressed up last year.

311
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,830
Billy, slow down.

312
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,291
- Oh, these your new hick friends?
- No! I don't know them.

313
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,046
I guess you won't care
if I hit 'em, then?

314
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,253
I get bonus points,
I get 'em all in one go?

315
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,758
No, Billy, stop. It's not funny.

316
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,269
Hey, guys?

317
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,264
Billy, come on, stop it.
It's not funny. Stop!

318
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,353
- Go!
- Mike, you need to haul ass!

319
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,355
Billy, stop it!

320
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,061
Whoa!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

321
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,697
Yeah! That was a close one, huh?

322
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,868
Holy shit!

323
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,990
Was that...

324
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,947
Mad Max.

325
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:38,279
Now, you tryin' to tell me,
with a straight face, cold did this?

326
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,278
How far does it go?

327
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,904
<i>Hey, Chief, you copy?</i>

328
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,179
Uh...

329
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,301
<i>Hey, Chief.</i>

330
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,973
<i>How's it looking over there?</i>

331
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,223
Like a giant pissed
all over Jack's bean field.

332
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,930
<i>Smells, too. It smell over there?</i>

333
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,640
Uh, yeah, little bit.

334
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,647
Smells like a nursing home, man.

335
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,275
<i>Listen. I want you guys to track the rot,
see how far it goes.</i>

336
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,856
Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.

337
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,567
- That's gonna take some time.
- So take it.

338
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,244
<i>And, look, we don't know what caused this.
Could be poison.</i>

339
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,243
<i>So don't touch anything without gloves.</i>

340
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,876
Copy that, Chief.

341
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,672
You got any marking flags?

342
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:55,224
So you hit "T" to zoom in,
and "W" zooms back out.

343
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,350
See? Easy-peasy.

344
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,027
Just make sure to turn off the power
to save energy there.

345
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,571
Listen. Stay close to your brother, okay?

346
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,365
And listen, listen, listen...

347
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,910
If you get a bad feeling or anything,
you tell him to take you straight home.

348
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,658
- You promise?
- Okay.

349
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,205
- Are you ready, bud?
- Yeah.

350
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,542
Be safe.

351
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,086
I hope it doesn't suck!

352
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,669
I just don't get
what she sees in him.

353
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,799
What?

354
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,596
Bob.

355
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,970
At least he doesn't treat me different.

356
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,020
I mean, I can't even go trick-or-treating
by myself. It's lame.

357
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,310
What? You think I'm lame?

358
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,691
No, but it's not like Nancy's coming
to watch over Mike, you know?

359
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,327
Will! Hey!

360
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,783
Hey, don't cross the streams.
Don't cross the streams!

361
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,341
Hey, listen.

362
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,292
Yeah?

363
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:09,677
If I let you go on your own,
you promise to stay in the neighborhood?

364
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,554
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, totally.
- And be back at Mike's by 9:00.

365
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,886
- 9:30?
- 9:00.

366
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,845
- Yeah.
- Deal?

367
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,100
- Yeah, deal.
- All right.

368
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,108
Hey, Will. Don't let any of your
spazzy friends use this, all right?

369
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,401
Okay.

370
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,353
I hope it doesn't suck.

371
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,524
Will!

372
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,985
- Egon!
- Yeah! You ready for tonight, man?

373
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,826
Awesome!

374
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:48,970
...thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty,
forty-one, forty-two!

375
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,549
- Yeah!
- Forty-two!

376
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,932
We got ourselves a new Keg King!

377
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,356
- Billy! Billy! Billy!
- That's how you do it, Hawkins!

378
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,684
Billy! Billy! Billy!

379
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,548
We got ourselves a new Keg King,
Harrington.

380
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,377
- Yeah, that's right!
- Yeah. Eat it, Harrington.

381
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,727
What's in this?

382
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,030
Pure fuel! Pure fuel!

383
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,232
Whoo!

384
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,197
Hey... Whoa, whoa!
Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy.

385
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,289
Take it easy. Nance, Nance, Nance...

386
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,835
We're just being stupid teenagers
for the night. Wasn't that the deal?

387
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,813
Yeah.

388
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,031
- No. No, no.
- Come on. Yes.

389
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,206
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Come on.
- No. No. No.

390
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,035
Oh, there it is.

391
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,254
You playing Frankenstein to my Dracula?

392
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,380
- Come on, you're stiff as a board. Relax.
- I'm sorry. It's...

393
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,089
He's fine. Okay? Jonathan's with him.

394
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,765
I know.

395
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,142
It's just every time he's away from me,
it's like I can't function.

396
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:09,269
- I know it sounds silly.
- No, it's not silly. It's not silly.

397
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,197
What if we were to move out of Hawkins...
together?

398
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,403
- What?
- I know.

399
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,331
Whoa, Nellie, right? No, I just...

400
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,518
I've been thinking about what you said.

401
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,209
About how we've got
all these memories here,

402
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,288
and you wish you had enough money to move.

403
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,998
Well, my parents
are selling their house in Maine.

404
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,926
There's a RadioShack nearby.
I'm sure they'd take me on.

405
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,048
We could just...

406
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,597
- My turn to be silly now.
- Bob...

407
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,520
No, it's fine. Wine makes me crazy.

408
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,186
Oh, it's just so hard to explain.

409
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:54,398
It's just this...
This is not a normal family.

410
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,115
It could be.

411
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,243
It could be.

412
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,917
Finally.

413
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,470
Huh?

414
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,841
Victims.

415
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,559
Trick or treat!

416
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,261
Oh!

417
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,723
Well, aren't you cute?
The little exterminators.

418
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,486
If I get another
3 Musketeers, I'm gonna kill myself.

419
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,532
- What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?
- "What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?"

420
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,950
- No one likes 3 Musketeers.
- Yeah, it's just nougat.

421
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,447
Whoa. "Just nougat"?

422
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,905
Just nougat? It is top three for me.

423
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,581
- Top three?
- Top three!

424
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,953
Oh, God. Give me a break.

425
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,581
Seriously, I can just eat a whole bowl
of nougat. Straight up.

426
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,713
Holy shit! You should have seen
the look on your faces.

427
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,467
And you? Who screams like that?
You sound like a little girl.

428
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,306
Hey, you guys coming or not?
Oh, I heard we should hit up Loch Nora.

429
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,763
That's where the rich people live, right?

430
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,525
Yeah!

431
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,574
You're dead.

432
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,447
Yeah, you got me, kid.

433
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,159
Happy Halloween.

434
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:18,254
Oh, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

435
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,448
Hey, kid. Give me some
of that candy, would you?

436
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,287
No way.

437
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,534
All right. How about now?

438
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,587
<i>Who are you? I'm Maria.</i>

439
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,257
<i>Will you play with me?</i>

440
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,387
<i>Would you like one of my flowers?</i>

441
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,404
L...

442
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,489
A...

443
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,440
T...

444
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,702
E.

445
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,238
Late.

446
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:38,811
Another full-size. Like, seriously,
rich people are such suckers.

447
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,273
- Wait. You're not rich, right?
- No, I live up Old Cherry Road.

448
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,649
Oh.

449
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,152
No, it's fine. I mean,
the street's good for skating.

450
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,278
Hmm.

451
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,734
Yeah, totally tubular.

452
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,656
What? Did I say that right?
Or is it, like, tubular.

453
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,663
It's, like,
totally tubular.

454
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,587
- Totally tubular!
- What a gnarly wave, dude.

455
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,166
- Totally brodacious, bro!
- Stop. My ears are hurting.

456
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,759
- Did you agree to this?
- What?

457
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,890
To her joining our party.

458
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,688
- It's just for Halloween.
- You should have checked with me.

459
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,767
Well, they were excited.
I guess I thought you'd be okay with it.

460
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,602
She's ruining the best night of the year.

461
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,289
Watch it, Zombie Boy.

462
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,913
Trick or treat, freak.

463
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,040
Boo!

464
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,187
Mike?

465
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,723
Mike?

466
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,645
Mike!

467
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,368
Will!

468
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,652
Will, what's wrong?

469
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,282
I couldn't find you. Are you hurt?

470
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,368
Holy shit!

471
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,020
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

472
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,754
I'm gonna get you home, okay?
I'm gonna get you home. Hold on.

473
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,876
- All right, take it easy.
- I got him.

474
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,967
Mike?

475
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,418
Keep trick-or-treating. I'm bored anyways.

476
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,047
What's wrong with him?

477
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,665
Nice costume.

478
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,925
- Huh?
- Nice costume.

479
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,800
Oh, uh, yeah. I'm going
as a guy who hates parties.

480
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,383
- I'm Samantha.
- Uh, Jonathan.

481
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,030
Kiss?

482
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,064
The band.

483
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,364
- No, no, no.
- Get off.

484
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,912
- No, you've had enough, okay?
- Screw you!

485
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,742
Nance, I'm serious. Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop.
No, I'm serious.

486
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,326
- Put it down.
- No!

487
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,127
- Nance, put it down.
- Steve! Stop.

488
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,920
Stop. Stop.

489
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,880
What the hell?

490
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,181
Nance.

491
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,941
Nance, I'm sorry.

492
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,316
- That's not coming off, Nance.
- It's coming.

493
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,023
Come on. Let me just take you home, okay?
Come here.

494
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,951
- Let me take you home. Come on.
- You wanted this.

495
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,120
No, I didn't want this.
I told you to stop drinking.

496
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,448
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit. Okay?

497
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:10,661
- No, it's not bullshit, Nancy.
- No, you. You're bullshit.

498
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,587
What?

499
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,542
You're pretending like everything is okay.

500
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:22,427
You know, like we didn't...
like we didn't kill Barb.

501
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:29,017
Like, it's great. Like, we're in love
and we're partying.

502
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:34,151
Yeah, let's party, huh?
Party. We're partying.

503
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,146
This is bullshit.

504
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,108
"Like we're in love"?

505
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,237
It's bullshit.

506
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,908
You don't love me?

507
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,039
It's bullshit.

508
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,825
It's like... like I'm stuck.

509
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,702
Like, like,
stuck in the Upside Down?

510
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:28,999
No.

511
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,868
You know on a View-Master,
when it gets, like...

512
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,954
- Caught between two slides?
- Yeah. Like that.

513
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,336
Like one side's our world,
and the other...

514
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,547
The other slide is the Upside Down.

515
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,433
And...

516
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:51,930
And there was this noise
coming from everywhere.

517
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,725
And then I saw something.

518
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,280
- The Demogorgon?
- No.

519
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:07,407
It was like this huge shadow in the sky.

520
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,791
Only, it was alive.

521
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,206
And it was coming for me.

522
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,176
Is this all real?

523
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,049
Or is it like the doctors say,
all in your head?

524
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,007
I don't know. Just...

525
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,972
Just please don't tell the others, okay?

526
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,642
They won't understand.

527
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,271
Eleven would.

528
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,153
She would?

529
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,198
Yeah.

530
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,899
She always did.

531
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,868
Sometimes I feel like I still see her.

532
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,161
Like she's still around, but she never is.

533
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,916
I don't know.
Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.

534
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,422
Me, too.

535
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,096
Hey, well, if we're both going crazy,
then we'll go crazy together, right?

536
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:16,598
Yeah. Crazy together.

537
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,625
Jonathan?

538
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,973
Hey, kid. Open up, all right?
Look, I know I'm late.

539
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,802
I got candy here, all right?
I got all the good stuff.

540
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,986
Please, will you open the door?
I'm gonna freeze to death out here.

541
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,256
Hey, kid. Open up, would you?

542
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:56,049
I got, uh... stuck somewhere,
and I lost track of time.

543
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,427
And I'm sorry.

544
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,522
El, would you please open the door?

545
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:06,818
El?

546
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,232
All right.

547
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,488
I'm just gonna be out here
by myself, eating all this candy.

548
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,039
I'm gonna get fat.

549
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,538
It's very unhealthy to leave me out here.

550
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,125
Could have a heart attack or something.

551
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:32,501
But, you know, you do what you want.

552
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,724
<i>One quarter pound of all-American beef,</i>

553
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,474
<i>fresh-cut tomato,
and four strips of crispy bacon.</i>

554
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,473
<i>Did somebody say bacon?</i>

555
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,336
<i>Refreshing lemon...</i>

556
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,852
<i>...and they're perfect
for dunking. Mmm!</i>

557
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,060
It's day 353.

558
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,531
I had a bad day today. I don't know. I...

559
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,409
I guess I wish you were here.

560
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,371
I mean, we all do.

561
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,412
If you're out there,
just please give me a sign.

562
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,471
Mike.

563
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,516
Eleven?

564
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,361
Tubular.

565
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,273
Tubular.

566
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,609
Tubular.

567
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,575
Mews, is that...

568
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,883
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

569
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,786
Holy sh...

570
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:52,810
