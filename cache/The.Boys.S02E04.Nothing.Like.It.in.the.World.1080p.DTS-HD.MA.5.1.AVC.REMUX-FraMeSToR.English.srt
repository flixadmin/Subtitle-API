[reporter] <i>Federal authorities have
initiated a manhunt for William Butcher.</i>

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:09,093
It's Vought.
It's a fucking coup from the inside.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,887
I know who killed Raynor.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,514
Something to do with the Supe terrorist
smuggled into Jersey.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,725
Her brother.

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,561
I just want me wife back.

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,980
[Grace] Bring Langley the terrorist
and you'll have her.

8
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:26,194
[Becca] I was told he would never know
about Ryan or me, that was the deal.

9
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:27,695
You need to make him leave.

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,823
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan and I'm gonna run.

11
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:34,577
<i>Superheroes are not born
but made by Compound V.</i>

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,457
We got a Supe terrorist below deck,
and shit could go sideways just like...

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,502
[groaning]

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,340
Fucking diabolical!

15
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,674
[woman screaming]

16
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,014
[Homelander] I said he was mine.

17
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,183
[Stormfront] You snooze, you lose, gramps.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,061
[Edgar] <i>Our newest hero, Stormfront,
stopped the terrorist before</i>

19
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,604
<i>he could take more innocent lives.</i>

20
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,442
Communication is everything.

21
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,279
Steve and I had been dating for two years
when he asked me to marry him.

22
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:11,405
At the rehearsal dinner,

23
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,909
my dad said we should look
into a 529 account for our kids.

24
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,955
Steve laughed and said that was nuts,
and that we were never having kids.

25
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,958
Which was news to me. Yeah.

26
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,962
Long story short, the caterer
was totally cool with everything,

27
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:29,757
but the Marriott did keep our deposit
on the banquet room, so...

28
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,426
Yeah. Communication.

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,220
[Kaaris' "Le Temps" playing]

30
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,573
<i>...details are still emerging

<i>His name, Kenji Miyashiro,</i>

<i>a Japanese expatriate
living in the Philippines,</i>

35

40
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,475
<i>- killing innocents indiscriminately.</i>
- It wasn't your fault.

<i>Many of the 59 victims have not yet

00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:28,774
[sniffles]

44
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:29,775
Look at me.

45
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,080
I... I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry, I was just...

[woman] There you are.

57
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,150
I was beginning to worry.

00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,742
Oh, I've missed you...

59
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,453
so much.

60
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,417
Are you thirsty?

61
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,091
Hmm. Mm, mm-hm.

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,094
Mm.

63
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,389
[both moan]

64
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,436
Hmm. My good boy.

[both moaning]

66
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,718
I ever tell you about my recurring dream?

67
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,263
I'm on stage, alone, at Carnegie Hall.

68
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:10,019
Audience is made up of every poor bastard
who got killed by the superheroes.

69

[Butcher] What are they doing?

70
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,234
Nothing. They're all just watching me.

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,404
Waiting for me to do something.

72
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,993
We hit a dead end on Raynor.

73
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,078
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,582
Christ, I don't want to hear sorry.
Sorry is not an option.

75
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,128
We can't have anonymous
skull-exploding assassins walking around.

76
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:39,215
What if they hit the Speaker next?
Or the President?

77
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,769
[Butcher]
Liberty. You mentioned her before.

78
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:56,440
Second-tier Supe, active in the '70s.
She was all over Susan's private server.

79
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,943
Get Marvin to talk to this Liberty.

80
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,819
Address on the back. North Carolina.

81
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,656
All right.

82
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,034
We'll see what we can find.

83
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,370
[Grace] Wait.

84
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,294
I found Becca.

85
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,549
Or at least our best guess
of where she is.

86
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,094
Vought facility, armed to the teeth.
Won't be easy.

87
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,973
We had a deal. I didn't come through.

88
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,058
Jesus, Butcher, I'm just giving it to you.

89
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,064
It's my fault
you stopped searching for her.

90
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:42,611
I put a target on Homelander's back
and pointed you right at him.

91
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,364
I didn't know Becca was still...

92
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:53,497
It'd be good to have one less person
in that audience staring at me.

93
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,179
<i>Hey!</i>

94
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:17,521
See? When you get disrespected over
and over and over, that's what happens.

95
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,024
I mean, how much shit
is he supposed to take?

96
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,276
Everybody respects you.

97
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,281
That fucking terrorist was my save,
not hers.

98
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:28,907
It was mine.

99
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,997
What, now that media whore
is the face of The Seven?

100
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,291
- No, she's not. No, you are.
- Come on!

101
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,460
It's not just her, it's the entire team.

102
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,878
- No.
- Yes, it is.

103
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,381
It's a whole chain of weak links.

104
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,763
- It's very hard not to take it personally.
- Oh, I know. I know.

105
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,808
- [Homelander sighs]
- [shushing]

[groans]

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,853
I'll tell you one thing...

108
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:02,650
- you wouldn't put up with this shit.
- Mm-mm.

109
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,902
One little raise of the eyebrow

110
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,987
and you would've knocked them all
back in line.

111
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,865
- Yeah.
- God, I miss that about you.

112
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,701
You don't need me to do that.

113
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,539
The Seven is your team.

114
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:21,210
You nurtured them.
You watered and fed them.

115
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,211
That's... I did!

116
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,298
Yes, and if they can't respect that,
or you...

117
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:32,971
well, it may be time to tear out the weeds
and start all over again.

118
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,603
[groaning]

119
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,524
[gasps]

120
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,610
Change back. Change back!

121
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:50,781
I'm sorry! I can only hold a shape
for so long before it really hurts.

122
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:55,160
Change the fuck back now, Doppelganger!

123
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,245
[groans]

124

[grunting]

125
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,545
It's okay. Come here. It's all good.

126
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,256
Oh, my little boy. Come on.

127
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,716
Okay.

128
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,428
It's okay.

129
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,017
I love you.

130
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,437
I love you.

131
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,316
You're the most powerful man
in the whole wide world.

132
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,696
And there's nothing that you cannot do.

133
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,039
[Milk] Storming an off-the-books
Vought compound alone.

134
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,417
How is it possible that you're dumber
than you look?

135
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,586
Mate, it's Becca.

136
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,630
No shit.
But win or lose, you ain't coming back.

137
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,631
Of course I am.

138
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,633
That's bullshit.

139
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,972
Look, it's not like Vought's
gonna let us settle down in Orlando.

140
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,766
We got to get gone and stay gone.

141
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,478
And what about us? Hmm?
We're the Spice Girls, right?

142
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:09,359
You're in charge now. Mazel tov.

143
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,740
I don't want to be in charge.
Matter of fact, I don't want to be here.

144
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,326
I gave up my family for this. For you.

145
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,411
Now, when do I get them back?

146
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,916
You find this Liberty slag.
See what you can rumble.

147
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,418
You jump through a few hoops
for the colonel,

148
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,629
and she'll help you
the same way she helped me.

149
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,714
She always liked you more, anyway.

150
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,552
What about Frenchie?

151
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,638
He's been high as a kite for days.

152
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,641
- He won't even notice I'm gone.
- Mm.

153
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:42,935
And Hughie?

154
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,023
Kid's a weeper.

155
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,108
Don't want him to get snot
all over me jacket.

156
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,197
Hey, Homelander.

157

So we got the Compound V out there
and Vought is still kicking,

00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:11,623
[chuckles softly]

314
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,689
[door thuds]

315
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,608
[speaking French]

316
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,407
You smell like a wet dog.

317
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,953
- Oh, you want a drink?
- Mm-mm.

318
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,705
Whoa, who says I'm alone, asshole?

319
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:10,473
So are you gonna tell me what's wrong?

320
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:15,103
Or you just gonna stain my clean sheets
with your sweaty despair?

321
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,482
I tried to kiss her.

322
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,442
Kimiko?

323
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,319
Her brother died.

324
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,447
I wanted to make her feel better.

325
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,616
You thought a kiss
would make her feel better

326
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,576
or you feel better?

327
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,161
She was in pain. I wanted to help.

328
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,330
You always want to help.

329
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,582
So?

330
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,211
You think that by saving her...

331
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,465
you can make amends
for all the people you hurt.

332
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,430
For those children
that Lamplighter burned.

333
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,475
- Okay.
- You don't know anything.

334
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,565
Look, she's not a kitten up a tree.

335
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,068
Just leave her alone.

336
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:05,903
Hmm?

337
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,781
Let her grieve.

338
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,827
What good does grieving all alone ever do?

339
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:18,625
[reporter] <i>And in our continuing coverage
of the recent revelations over Compound V,</i>

340
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,919
<i>protesters all over the Middle East
have taken to the streets demanding...</i>

341
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,338
- Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

342
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:38,561
Um...

343
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,107
Hmm.

344
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,943
You two want a room?

345
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,572
You and the donut.

346
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,033
Oh. [chuckles]

347
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,534
I'm sorry.

348
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:58,706
It's just my mom
never let me have this stuff.

349
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:03,670
Just, weight gain in our household
was a capital crime.

350
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,132
But my dad,
he'd take me to Dunkin' on the sly

351
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:12,011
and he would get me
a chocolate cream-filled donut...

352
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,140
and he'd ask me to tell him about my day.

353
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:23,648
And he'd... he'd listen.

354
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,778
Baskin-Robbins...

355
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,573
every Sunday after church.

356
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:38,204
My pops, he'd always ask for samples.

357
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,791
Now, this place had 31 flavours,

358
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,086
and that man would taste
each and every flavour,

359
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,296
every time we'd go up in there.

360
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,798
There'd be a line out the door.

361
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,467
People would be mad as hell,
yelling, cussing.

362
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,846
"Yo, my man,
get your fucking ice cream and bounce!"

363
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,682
- [laughing]
- You think that stopped him? Hell, no.

364
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,101
He would stand right there
and order another sample.

365
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,563
"Can I please try
the Jamoca Almond Fudge, please?"

366
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,856
[Annie chuckles]

367
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,233
My ass was so embarrassed.

368
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,779
I'd be sitting there, wishing the floor
would open up and just swallow me whole.

369
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:12,905
Man.

370
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,703
Of course, now I'd give a year off my life
just to be able to see that man

371
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:22,832
going through spoon after spoon
just one last time.

372
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,921
- When did he...?
- Sixteen years ago.

373
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,429
To fathers and sugar.

374
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,724
To fathers and sugar.

375
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:50,193
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you dry-wiping?

376
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,988
- Am I what?
- Come here.

377
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,075
Listen, any part of your body,
and I mean any part,

378
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,537
when you dry-wipe,
you're not cleaning anything.

379
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,498
You're just smearing shit
all over your skin.

380
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:07,293
Here, got to use wet wipes.
There you go.

381
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,754
- You just carry these around with you?
- Damn right.

382
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,182
- No, no, no.
- They're hurt, they need help.

383
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,810
No, no, no.
This is not the time to be a Supe, okay?

384
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,269
We're low-key. Not with us here.

385
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,187
- Annie.
- I mean...

386
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,565
There's a ton of people here.
Okay, that guy, he's calling 911.

387
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,026
- It'll be okay.
- [crowd chattering]

388
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,737
Come on. Come on. We got to go.

389
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,739
- Told you this was a bad idea.
- Calm down.

390
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,476
Anyplace around here
without a million bloody cameras?

391
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:43,723
[sobs]

392
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:54,775
- Are you okay? Did he hurt you?
- No. I'm okay. I'm fine.

393
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:58,946
I thought you were dead.

394
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,990
I stopped looking,
I shouldn't have stopped.

395
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,116
I couldn't call anybody.

396
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,994
I can't imagine
what it must have done to you. I'm sorry.

397
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,829
I'm so fucking sorry.

398
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,664
No, you've done nothing wrong.

399
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,172
Look at you.

400
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,342
My girl.

401
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:23,679
Always. [chuckles softly]

402
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,978
Billy, it's not safe for you to be here.

403
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,149
He finds you, he's gonna kill you.
And you know that.

404
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,609
Fuck him.

405
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,862
I got out of the last scrape all right,
didn't I?

406
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,572
That was a one-time deal.

407
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,616
What'd you say to him?

408
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:49,538
I said if he hurt you,
I would kill myself in front of Ryan.

409
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,793
And my last words would be,
"Your father did this to me."

410
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,715
He seems desperate for a relationship
with his son, so it worked once.

411
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,133
Well...

412
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,428
it's a good thing
he don't know your tells.

413
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,389
I wasn't bluffing.

414
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,142
I'm gonna get you the fuck out of here.

415
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,686
Yeah? How?

416
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,438
Over the fence.
The same way that I come in.

417
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,068
No. No, Ryan can't climb that fence.

418
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:21,654
Right.

419
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,329
I saw his eyes glow.

420
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,957
I thought he might...
Don't he got no powers?

421
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,461
No. I mean, yes,
but I'm not raising him like that.

422
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,388
Hey. There's a garbage truck
that comes by the house

423
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,681
every morning at 11.

424
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,725
I doubt anyone checks the hopper.

425
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,103
- You sure it's not a fucking compacter?
- Yes, I'm sure.

426
00:30:55,813 --> 00:31:00,693
- Okay. Then that's the plan.
- Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,992
I have to go.

428
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,829
They get suspicious
when I'm gone too long.

429
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,210
Wait here. I'll be back. Okay?

430
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,883
[engine starts]

431
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:33,100
Okay, so we got two rooms,
there's three of us.

432
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,019
So I guess I'll be...

433
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,190
bunking with M.M., naturally.

434
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,274
Good choice.

435
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,987
[snoring]

436
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:56,916
[cell phone buzzes]

437
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,225
- Hmm.
- [Hughie] That an Almond Joy?

438
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,518
Mm-hm.

439
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,561
Nobody likes Almond Joy.

440
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:19,897
Jeffrey Dahmer.

441
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,399
That's it. He's the only one.

442
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,402
This is in my top three for sure.

443
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:26,904
What are your other two?

444
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,322
Mm...

445
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,118
Charleston Chew and Bit-O-Honey.

446
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,203
Jesus Christ.

447
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,706
Those are the, like, three worst
candy bars in the history of candy.

448
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,127
- [laughs]
- That's it. You're sick. In the brain.

449
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,045
[Hughie chuckles]

450
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,010
- Hey, what's up with M.M.'s OCD?
- Wait, what OCD?

451
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:56,684
You know, when he changes lanes,
he taps the steering wheel three times.

452
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,604
He stirs the coffee three times.

453
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,648
The antiseptic wipes. Really?

454
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,152
- You haven't noticed any of this?
- No. But, wow, you're right.

455
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,236
Mm-hm.

456
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,196
Yeah.

457
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:13,701
It's just control over things
he can't control, I guess.

458
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:18,247
I mean, I should be the last one
talking about that.

459
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:22,501
Says the girl
who's just stress-eating all day.

460
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,879
Oh, my God! That was...

461
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,463
- [shushes]
- I... It was so good.

462
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,425
That was really good. I enjoyed that.

463
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,471
- It's harder than it looks.
- Meh.

464
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,517
I think, you know, actually, I think
I went the other way with the eating.

465
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:42,771
- I think I've lost like seven pounds.
- Mm.

466
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,565
I did not have seven to lose.

467
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:49,862
Well, [sighs] I sleep
about four hours a night.

468
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,156
I wish I slept four hours a night.

469
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:57,036
I mean, I'm too busy
chewing my fingernails down to the quick.

470
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,498
I don't know, whatever a...
I don't know what a quick is, but...

471
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,211
Here's one. [chuckles]

472
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:11,133
I walk around The Seven Tower

473
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:15,554
with this knot in my gut,

474
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:23,604
just wondering if Homelander
is waiting around every corner to kill me.

475
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,275
It's like living
with a loaded gun in my face.

476
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,320
Do you feel that way now?

477
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,703
[chuckles softly]

478
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,301
[both moan]

479
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,348
Wait. Wait. I got it.

480
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,523
I still want to see you.

481
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,279
[Elizabeth] <i>Love is a leap of faith.</i>

482
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:17,783
Like, my last boyfriend was obsessed
with Ed Sheeran.

483
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:21,537
Yeah, I know. But he was obsessed.

484
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,331
"Shape of You," "Galway Girl,"
the whole catalogue.

485
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,377
So he asked me
to get one of these with him.

486
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,507
Two weeks later, he broke up with me.

487
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,594
I fucking hate Ed Sheeran.

488
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,154
[car approaching]

489
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,500
Took you ages to quit.

490
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,170
- All them little patches, eh?
- [chuckles]

491
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,090
Do you want one?

492
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:57,966
No.

493
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,809
[chuckles]

494
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,313
The beard's new.

495
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,440
Fancy it, eh?

496
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,444
Eh. Haven't decided yet.

497
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,326
How long you been here for then, eh?

498
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,372
Since I gave birth.

499
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,376
Fucking hell.

500
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:33,836
Hmm.

501
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,047
How are you holding up?

502
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:44,972
Yeah. You know,
you forget about reading the news

503
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,016
or going to a restaurant...

504
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,688
smoking pot on the couch
and eating Cheetos.

505
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,861
I just act like, you know,
Carol-fucking-Brady all day.

506
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,990
It's okay.

507
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:08,537
You know?
Ryan's happy, and that's what matters.

508
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,085
You're gonna like him.

509
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,965
He's sweet...

510
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:25,554
and very smart and... so kind.

511
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,808
I know you hate kids and all,

512
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:33,645
- but I think that he's pretty...
- No, no, no, I don't hate kids.

513
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,272
I'm just...

514
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,443
not a very good role model, am I?

515
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,073
How have you been?

516
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,036
Oh, you know, all right.

517
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,916
Started a private security company.

518
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,542
- Mm.
- Mm.

519
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:59,505
- You know, weddings, bar mitzvahs...
- Bullshit.

520
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:07,721
Homelander...
said you were "a man possessed."

521
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:11,266
He said you've been
chasing after him for years.

522
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,646
Well, I thought he killed you,

523
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:19,900
so, yeah, I've been on a bit of a warpath.

524
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,197
But on the bright side,
I'm sleeping in a basement

525
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,699
beneath a pawn shop in East Flatbush.

526
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,370
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,665
I never wanted that for you.

528
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,334
Well, what was I supposed to do?

529
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,004
Huh? Let him get away with it?

530
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:44,967
What was I before you?

531
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,718
Nothing.

532
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,971
And you saved me.

533
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,602
And here you've been,
fucking living in this shithole,

534
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,897
for all this time,
and I haven't been here for you.

535
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,236
I'm gonna make it up to you.

536
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,781
I'm gonna make it up to you
from now till the day I die.

537
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:08,991
I swear to God.

538
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,397
Is the supervillain threat real?

539
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,817
Hundred percent. Very real.

540
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,235
But The Seven will protect you.

541
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,821
[Homelander] That's right. Right.
Always listen to Maeve.

542
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,990
She always tells the truth.

543
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,576
And we're grateful, every day.

544
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,370
On a related subject, Compound V.

545
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,206
Did either of you know about it
before the news broke?

546
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,334
No. Absolutely not.

547
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,377
Madelyn Stillwell, she lied to all of us.

548
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,630
Turns out she was a monster.

549
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:09,092
We're just as hurt and upset
and confused as everyone else.

550
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,303
Let's talk hashtag "Heroes So White."

551
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,222
The numbers are rather startling.

552
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,975
Ninety-two percent of heroes
are Caucasian.

553
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,936
African American, 6 percent.

554
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,065
Latin and Asian, each 1 percent.

555
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,567
Why doesn't Vought want diversity?

556
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:30,072
Wow, these are some real hardballs,
Maria Menounos. [chuckles]

557
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,198
[Maria chuckles]

558
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:35,535
But check your facts.
Let's take The Seven, for example.

559
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,496
We've got A-Train. He's a Black man.

560
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,290
We got Black Noir, he... um...

561
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:45,629
Well, he doesn't identify with any race,
really, so they're covered. [chuckles]

562
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,883
And we have a gay hero.

563
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:54,346
Really? Who in The Seven is gay?

564
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,764
Queen Maeve.

565
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,225
Mm-hm.

566
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,935
Scoop for you, Maria.

567
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:05,941
Maeve here is a strong, proud lesbian
with a beautiful girlfriend, Elena.

568
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,276
Hispanic girlfriend.

569
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,738
And I, for one, am so proud of her.

570
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,702
Where's Elena? What did you do to her?

571
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:22,207
She's fine. What did I do to her?
I set her free, and you.

572
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,836
You've been living in the shadows so long.
Doesn't it feel good to be out in the sun?

573
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,590
Hold on. Me and Elena are just friends.

574
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,759
- Oh, just friends?
- Yes.

575
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,720
Because I heard you two
talking on the phone,

576
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,888
and it sounded a little more than friends.

577
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:42,853
So I did a little digging
and imagine my fucking surprise.

578
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:47,941
- Okay, we had a relationship. Once.
- Mm.

579
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,318
Once? A relationship. "Relationship"?

580
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,571
That's such a vague word.

581
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:56,283
What does that mean to you?
What, long walks in the park?

582
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,826
A shoulder to cry on?

583
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,120
Scissoring each other raw?

584
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,458
I ended the relationship
when I joined The Seven.

585
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,794
When I met you.

586
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,172
Stop fucking lying to me!

587
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,219
I'm at my wit's fucking end with the lies.

588
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,182
We're together.

589
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:22,434
And you love her?

590
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:27,606
Mm.

591
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,191
I see.

592
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,278
Well, best of luck to you both.

593
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:39,201
Oh, is it so hard to believe
that I want you two to be happy...

594
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:41,453
and in love?

595
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:48,001
Honestly, Maeve,
I am really, really happy for you.

596
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,136
[crowd cheering, clapping]

597
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,768
<i>And have you seen Vought's
"Saving America" ads?</i>

598
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:09,481
<i>Don't they make you feel
all warm and squishy and patriotic?</i>

599
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,779
Vought wants you to feel calm and safe.

600
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,865
So that you continue
to buy their shitty toys

601
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:23,537
and drinking their shitty energy drinks
and going to see their shitty movies.

602
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,624
- [man 1] Assholes!
- But maybe we shouldn't feel so calm.

603
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,084
- Or safe.
- [man 2] Yeah!

604
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,293
[woman 1] Take them down!

605
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:33,129
[Stormfront] One Super Terrorist
has already gotten through,

606
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,090
more will come.

607
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:39,302
And for all we know, these maniacs
could already have flown over our borders

608
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,221
and be standing next to you,

609
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,849
just waiting for their chance
to kill us all!

610
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,433
So, what are we gonna do?

611
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,477
We're gonna sit around
and cross our fingers

612
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:51,731
that Homelander's gonna save us
when he's not on Maria Menounos?

613
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:56,236
Or will we demand that Vought do better?

614
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,071
[all] Yeah!

615
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,991
That our government do better!

616
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,659
What do you say?

617
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,295
- [all] <i>Stormfront! Stormfront! Stormfront!</i>
- [Frenchie] No.

618
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:16,464
<i>Mon coeur,</i> please. You would not survive.

619
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:20,427
<i>Stormfront! Stormfront! Stormfront!</i>

620
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,890
[man 3] Marry me, Stormfront!

621
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,933
[woman 2] We love you, Stormfront!

622
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,185
Let's go home.

623
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,815
[crowd cheering, clapping]

624
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:44,826
[clears throat]

625
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:56,963
- Hello?
- Hello. I'm Hughie.

626
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,466
Is there, by any chance,
a woman living here

627
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:02,135
who used to go by the name of Liberty?

628
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:05,805
No.

629
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:08,558
Okay.

630
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,644
We have the right address, right?
Is that...?

631
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,697
Please leave.

632
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:26,368
Miss, I'm sorry if my friend offended you.

633
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,411
But we just want to ask
a couple questions.

634
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:30,246
Just leave me alone.

635
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,083
I took your damn money,
I signed your damn papers,

636
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,334
and I kept my mouth shut.

637
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:37,879
You think we're with... We're not
with Vought, okay? We... [chuckles]

638
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:41,466
We want to learn what we can
about Liberty, that's it.

639
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,135
Then y'all are just some damn fools.

640
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:47,681
It sounds like you know her. Or knew her.

641
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:52,602
- You're wasting your time. Okay?
- Miss, miss, miss. Hear us out.

642
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,772
After that, you want us to leave, we go.

643
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:58,608
[sighs] Go ahead.

644
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:04,322
My father was a lawyer.

645
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:07,575
Small-time, very smart and aggressive.

646
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,412
When I was a kid, something happened
between my family and Vought,

647
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,497
which I'd rather not talk about,
but it was bad.

648
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,834
See, my dad, he believed in the law,

649
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:18,795
and that nobody was above it.
Not even Vought.

650
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:23,383
So he went to work.
He got after their asses.

651
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,137
He had one of those... You remember
those little black typewriters?

652
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,513
The manual ones with the keys?

653
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,432
I'd go to sleep at night
to all that noise,

654
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,142
my father banging away at that thing.

655
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,602
Wake up the next morning,
he'd still be hammering away.

656
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:36,813
All night.

657
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,275
But, see, Vought wasn't about
to let this one Black man

658
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,694
put his foot on their necks, mm-mm.

659
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,031
So they hired teams of lawyers.

660
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:49,701
Paid off judges.
But my father never gave up.

661
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,454
Until one morning, I woke up, and...

662
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,583
I didn't hear those keys anymore.

663
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:01,171
Just found him hunched over
that typewriter, dead at 55.

664
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,133
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- [Milk] I'm not here for your sympathy.

665
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:10,138
But I am going to tell you
that his fight got passed down to me.

666
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,017
I'm going to make Vought pay
for what they did to him.

667
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,978
And, ma'am, from what I gather,
what they've done to you as well.

668
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,816
I mean, it's been 48 years.

669
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,195
What good is dredging
all this stuff up now gonna do?

670
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:28,823
Honestly, we don't know,
but we still need to hear it.

671
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:30,325
[sighs]

672
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,456
I tried to get people to listen.

673
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,376
[scoffs]
Lord knows, so many times, I tried.

674
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:45,757
But a little Black girl accusing
a white superhero of murder...

675
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,718
- in these parts?
- Yeah.

676
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,386
[Valerie sighs]

677
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,932
It was during one of those summer rains...

678
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,852
that you just knew was coming
by the smell in the air.

679
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,193
I was 11 years old.

680
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,613
<i>Asleep in the back seat of my folks' Ford.</i>

681
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,117
<i>My brother, Myron, he was driving.</i>

682
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,661
[tyres squeal]

683
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,955
[Myron] What's the trouble, ma'am?

684
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,706
- [Liberty] Get out now.
- [Myron] Hey.

685
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,876
Your car was involved
in a robbery tonight.

686
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,963
No, it wasn't. I had it.
I don't know nothing about any robbery.

687
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,298
[Liberty] Just confess.

688
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,303
Why are you doing this to me, lady?
Ain't you supposed to be a hero?

689
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,888
I am a hero,

690
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,516
for killing a Black piece of shit
like you.

691
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,158
I wanted to go to the police.

692
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,163
But my folks,
they thought it was pointless.

693
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,415
So when that man from Vought,

694
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,293
when he showed up
and he offered us that money,

695
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,210
we just took it.

696
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,589
Two thousand dollars.

697
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,721
That is what my brother's life was worth,
just $2,000.

698
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,266
But y'all have got to promise me
that you won't tell anybody

699
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,976
that I sat here and I talked to you.

700
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,938
Because if that woman finds out that
I opened my mouth, she's gonna kill me.

701
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,985
Miss Hunter, that woman. Liberty...

702
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,697
Nobody's seen her since 1979.

703
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,407
She's probably dead by now.

704
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:39,621
Oh, no. No. I... Hold on one second.

705
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:49,297
Right here. That's her. Right there.

706
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:51,799
That's Liberty.

707
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:01,351
Valerie was a little girl, she said
it was raining, so she could be wrong.

708
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,061
She seemed pretty certain.

709
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,480
Yeah, but if Liberty and Stormfront
are the same person,

710
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,273
then that makes Stormfront like, what,

711
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,524
- 70 years old? More?
- Yeah,

712
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,193
but who knows what Compound V can do?

713
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,488
I mean, maybe she doesn't age
like a regular person, okay?

714
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,741
It's the same Stormfront that became
America's favourite two-fisted Supe.

715
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,659
Mm-hm.

716
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,078
And might've popped Raynor's head
for getting too close.

717
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,205
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is going on?

718
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,965
I didn't know that about your dad.

719
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,677
Sounds like he was a real hero.

720
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,221
I thought so, but...

721
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,726
Nah. He was just a man with a disease.

722
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:46,020
Passed it down to me,

723
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:49,357
and, if I'm not too careful,
I might end up passing it down to my...

724
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,157
[sighs]

725
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:31,482
[Homelander]
Who the fuck do you think you are?

726
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,526
What, you think I don't see it?

727
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:37,989
- Trying to undermine me, steal my team.
- Hold on a minute...

728
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,034
Let me tell you right now. It won't work.

729
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,912
I'm the face of The Seven! Not you!

730
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,957
Me! I still score higher
in every demo that counts.

731
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:54,464
Eighteen to 34, 18 to 49, 25 to 54,
they all love me.

732
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,383
Well, congratulations.

733
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:03,514
I mean, this constant need to be loved
by everyone is kind of pathetic,

734
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:06,476
but... Yay.

735
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,066
Okay.

736
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,778
Okay. Calm down.

737
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,324
I clearly pushed you a little far,
I'm sorry.

738
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,869
Look, I'm... I'm just trying to help.

739
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,413
Really? How?

740
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,624
By taking what's mine?

741
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,001
Let me tell you something right now.

742
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:33,836
I built this team from the ground up,

743
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,673
and there is no fucking way
that anyone is gonna take it away from me.

744
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:42,261
You spent $273 million
on that "Saving America" bullshit,

745
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,055
and I'm running circles around you

746
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,558
with five guys on laptops,
churning out memes.

747
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:51,437
I practically pay them
with Arby's gift cards.

748
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:56,901
You can't win the whole country anymore,
no one can.

749
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,362
So why are you even trying?

750
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,490
You don't need 50 million people
to love you.

751
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,993
You need five million people
fucking pissed.

752
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:10,331
Emotion sells, anger sells.

753
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:14,377
You have fans. I have soldiers.

754
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:22,093
Look, I know
that you probably won't believe this...

755
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:27,723
I think that you are the best of us.

756
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:34,355
I think that you
are everything we should be.

757
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:39,902
You just need a little help
connecting with your audience.

758
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:45,783
You know, change with the times.
God knows I did.

759
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,378
I don't need help
connecting with my audience.

760
00:54:59,088 --> 00:54:59,922
Thank you.

761
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,800
Okay. Well, just know I'm always here.

762
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:06,137
Door is always open. For anything.

763
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:21,777
You're late. Where's the kid?

764
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,284
Hey, we got to get in the truck.
We'll miss our chance.

765
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,245
I'm not leaving.

766
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,915
What are you talking about? You are.
Grab the kid, let's go.

767
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,541
You don't want Ryan to come with us.

768
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,668
Of course, I do.
I said I'd take him, didn't I?

769
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,420
And I wanted to believe you.

770
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,007
Believe me.

771
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,843
Come on, we've got to get a shift on.

772
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:51,015
Listen, if the three of us leave,
you're gonna find a way to get rid of him.

773
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,476
I know it.
It won't be in an obvious way,

774
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,978
- it won't be right away, but you will.
- No, Becca.

775
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,396
Billy, I know you.

776
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,316
I know you better than anybody,
and I saw it in your face.

777
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,859
I see it now.

778
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:10,076
He's a billion dollar piece
of Vought property.

779
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,913
They are not gonna let him go.

780
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,210
You and me...
Becca, you and me, we've got a chance.

781
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,921
Babe, it's Ryan they care about, not us.

782
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,047
Yeah, and then what?

783
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,883
And then Vought raises him
without a mother, right?

784
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:28,928
Then we have Homelander again
and there's two assholes in this world.

785
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,514
We could disappear, all right.
Just start again.

786
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,099
- Start a new family.
- I have a son.

787
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:34,850
He's a fucking Supe freak.

788
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:42,316
Fuck. Listen, I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

789
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:48,239
Becca. Becca, please. Come with me.

790
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,283
You were wrong about me, do you know that?

791
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,287
You put me on this pedestal,

792
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,957
and the truth is
I never knew how to save you.

793
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,209
You were always one bad day away

794
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,670
from pounding someone to death
in a parking lot.

795
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,799
- That's not true.
- Billy.

796
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,385
He raped me.

797
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:13,139
And when I found out I was pregnant,
I went to Vought.

798
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,517
I didn't come to you.

799
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:21,188
I didn't come to you
because I was scared.

800
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,691
I knew that you'd chase after him,

801
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,444
and you would seek revenge,
and it wouldn't be good for anybody.

802
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:29,780
- I love you.
- I love you. [sobs]

803
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:36,912
But the hate that you carry
and the warpath that you're on...

804
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:41,208
it started so long before me.

805
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,295
I can't...

806
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:00,686
- Becs. No, I'm not leaving without you.
- You have to go. Please.

807
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:06,192
Every guard in this goddamn place
is gonna be here in 60 seconds.

808
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:08,903
You have to go.

809
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:15,409
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

810
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:35,137
Oh, shit.

811
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,819
- Small token of the trip.
- Mm.

812
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,987
John Wayne Gacy
used to give those out to kids

813
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:54,573
- when he was a birthday clown.
- Whatever, I still love them.

814
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,910
Thanks for letting me come.

815
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:02,540
It was fun until it got so horrible.

816
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:04,709
Yeah. What can I say? It's my speciality.

817
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,668
[chuckles]

818
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:13,300
Well, listen, if you're ever in the mood
for another Almond Joy,

819
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:17,138
just shoot me a text.
That came out so gross, I'm sorry.

820
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,389
Hughie...

821
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,560
We can't do that again.

822
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,479
No. No, no, no. No, we can't.

823
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,858
Why, though? I mean, the...

824
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,360
This is good.

825
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:33,279
But that's just it.

826
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:40,077
I mean, we can't afford to feel good,
or to feel safe, or to let our guard down.

827
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,121
But you can't go through this on your own.

828
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:48,586
We're all alone. That's the truth.

829
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:52,256
It doesn't have to be like that.

830
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:01,682
Goodbye, Hughie.

831
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:25,539
I believe the secret
to a great relationship

832
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:30,419
is to be willing
to do anything for your man.

833
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:32,630
Anything.

834
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:38,344
I'm a feminist, but I'm also very sexual.

835
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,264
And I don't see that as contradictory.

836
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:48,979
What's wrong with giving pleasure?
And receiving it?

837
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:54,151
Thank you for coming in, Gianna.
Yeah, we appreciate your candour.

838
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:56,987
[Deep] Thank you so much.

839
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,616
Anytime. It was really great meeting you.
Really great.

840
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,201
So great.

841
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:08,582
Bye.

842
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,504
[chuckles] Her. Gianna. I choose her.

843
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,881
I mean, she's the one. No question.

844
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:19,134
- [Carol] No, she isn't.
- Wait, what?

845
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:22,930
She was, like, hands down the winner.
It was not even a contest.

846
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:24,849
It's Cassandra.

847
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,851
Cassandra? The one...?

848
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:30,563
The one with the hair and the creepy
skeletons hugging each other story?

849
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:32,523
Yes. That's your wife.

850
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:34,066
[groans]

851
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:38,070
But I thought I got to choose.

852
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:43,158
You do. And you're choosing Cassandra.
Congratulations.

853
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,620
Yeah, but... I mean, Gianna...

854
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:50,708
Is lovely. She's lovely.
She's a valued member of The Collective.

855
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,962
But this marriage
isn't about satisfying your base desires.

856
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:59,633
It's about rehabilitating your image
and getting you back in The Seven.

857
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,303
That is what you want, isn't it?

858
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,282
There you are.

859
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,499
I was beginning to worry.

860
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,677
Oh, I missed you.

861
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:54,396
Are you thirsty? Want some?

862
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,194
Oh, I want you so bad.

863
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:08,786
Are you okay?

864
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:12,289
Would you like me to be someone else?

865
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,167
I can be whoever you want.

866
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:23,550
No.

867
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:28,389
I don't need anyone...

868
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,601
but myself.

869
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:50,369
Like what you see?

870
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:54,289
See how hot you are?

871
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:56,875
Hmm?

872
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,213
Come on.

873
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,801
How much do you want this?

874
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,722
How much?

875
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,233
I'm gonna suck your cock so fucking hard.

876
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:23,193
So good.

877
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:27,448
You're gonna look in your own eyes
when you come.

878
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:34,121
And it's not even gay
if it's with yourself, right?

879
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,919
Oh, you're so special.

880
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:46,800
The most special man on the planet.

881
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:49,928
Everybody loves you.

882
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,890
Everybody.

883
01:04:54,475 --> 01:05:00,272
Their love is your strength.

884
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:13,368
You're pathetic.

885
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,218
I don't need everyone to love me.

886
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:32,721
I don't need anyone.

887
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:42,689
I don't need you!
