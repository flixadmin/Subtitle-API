1
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:00,516
I knew Harvey Dent.

2
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:02,851
I was his friend.

3
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:11,187
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.

4
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:15,531
I believed in Harvey Dent.

5
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:37,386
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

6
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:38,592
He wasn't alone.

7
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:42,804
- You don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

8
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,969
Don't worry, no charge for them.

9
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:48,940
And why would I want them?
They were trying to grab your prize.

10
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,774
They work for the mercenary.

11
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:52,810
The masked man.

12
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,855
- Bane?
- Aye.

13
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:58,612
Get them on board. I'll call it in.

14
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:09,543
The flight plan I just filed
with the agency...

15
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:13,923
...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

16
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,300
...but only one of you!

17
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:23,599
First one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft!

18
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:34,189
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

19
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:41,325
He didn't fly so good!

20
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,485
Who wants to try next?

21
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,072
Tell me about Bane!

22
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:47,740
Why does he wear the mask?

23
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,912
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:56,753
Well, perhaps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man...

25
00:02:56,915 --> 00:03:00,044
...before throwing him out of a plane.

26
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,724
At least you can talk.

27
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:07,009
Who are you?

28
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,645
It doesn't matter who we are.

29
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,268
What matters is our plan.

30
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:22,029
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

31
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,611
If I pull that off, will you die?

32
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:27,951
It would be extremely painful.

33
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,285
You're a big guy.

34
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,665
For you.

35
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,831
Was getting caught part of your plan?

36
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:38,499
Of course.

37
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:46,966
Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours.

38
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:50,636
- We had to find out what he told you...
- Nothing. I said nothing.

39
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:07,574
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

40
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:11,161
- Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your master plan?

41
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,750
Crashing this plane...

42
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,583
...with no survivors.

43
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:44,986
Mayday, Mayday!

44
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:34,410
What you doing to me? Let me out!

45
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:38,748
No!

46
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,046
No, no, no! No!

47
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,519
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

48
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,147
Have we started the fire?

49
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:02,893
Yes, the fire rises.

50
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,414
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

51
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,787
That comes later.

52
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:48,189
Harvey Dent Day
may not be our oldest public holiday...

53
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:51,404
...but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.

54
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:55,697
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime...

55
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:59,993
...had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

56
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,332
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

57
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:08,839
No city is without crime, but this city is
without organized crime because the Dent Act...

58
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:12,221
...gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.

59
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,054
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...

60
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:19,220
...and to them I say, "Not on my watch."

61
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,474
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

62
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,770
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
tonight. I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

63
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:30,689
And now I'm gonna give way
to an important voice...

64
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,325
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

65
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:35,201
No one has. Not in years.

66
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,240
...people put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

67
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:42,956
A thug who showed his true nature...

68
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,587
...when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...

69
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:48,256
...and murdered him in cold blood.

70
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:51,335
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

71
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,503
- Shrimp balls?
- Thank you.

72
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,140
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

73
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:58,767
Commissioner Gordon.

74
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:09,569
The truth?

75
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,784
I have...

76
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,696
...written a speech...

77
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,704
...telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

78
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,836
Maybe the time isn't right.

79
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:36,221
Maybe right now...

80
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,008
...all you need to know
is that there are...

81
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:43,976
...1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

82
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:49,064
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine.

83
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:54,148
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

84
00:08:58,443 --> 00:08:59,660
It has not been for nothing.

85
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:04,658
- You see the guy who owns the house?
- No. I heard...

86
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:07,795
- ...he never leaves the east wing.
- I heard he had an accident.

87
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:11,708
- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a...
- Mr. Till?

88
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:15,594
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

89
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,092
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

90
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,966
She's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

91
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,350
The east drawing room.

92
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:27,515
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

93
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,938
I'm sorry, Miss Tate.
I tried, but he won't see you.

94
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,110
And you mustn't take it personally.

95
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,286
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails...

96
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,117
...peeing into Mason jars.

97
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,657
It's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.

98
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,347
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...

99
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:05,227
...who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?

100
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,638
He can't get your money back. I can.

101
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,810
I could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not...

102
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,399
...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

103
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:18,736
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys...

104
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,864
...so why waste my time indeed?

105
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:23,904
Second shift reports in?

106
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,165
You should spend more time
with the mayor.

107
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:28,200
Well, that's your department.

108
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:30,999
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

109
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:34,461
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.

110
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,503
- Must be popular with his wife.
- Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.

111
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:42,889
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

112
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,595
Really?

113
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:48,638
- But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

114
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,171
Sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

115
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,304
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

116
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:34,149
Although you don't have the
long nails or the facial scars, sir.

117
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:37,144
Is that what they say about me?

118
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,398
It's just that no one ever sees you.

119
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:44,777
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.

120
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:48,038
It can't be the same one...

121
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,704
...because her pearls are in this safe...

122
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:56,042
...the manufacturer clearly explained...

123
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,550
...is uncrackable.

124
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,935
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

125
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:14,105
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

126
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:18,227
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than I would beat up a cripple.

127
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,114
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

128
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:30,451
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

129
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,006
Can I have a ride?

130
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,677
You read my mind.

131
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,013
Let's go.

132
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,808
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

133
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,597
She's very persistent.

134
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:58,108
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

135
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,439
- I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

136
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:03,902
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.

137
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:07,034
And this is your idea
of sounding the alarm, is it?

138
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,365
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

139
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:10,824
- She?
- One of the maids.

140
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:13,615
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house.

141
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:16,251
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

142
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:20,338
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

143
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,674
She was.

144
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:29,010
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.

145
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:33,052
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

146
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,391
That's a job for the police?

147
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:38,397
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.

148
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:42,356
Pretty soon we'll be chasing
down overdue library books.

149
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:48,280
And yet here you are,
like we're still at war.

150
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,488
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

151
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,452
You have something you want to ask me?

152
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,045
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

153
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,171
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

154
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,421
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

155
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:09,338
...breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

156
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:12,140
I'm not hearing a question, son.

157
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,267
Don't you want to know who he was?

158
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:17,558
I know exactly who he was.

159
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,521
He was the Batman.

160
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,480
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

161
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,790
Master Wayne?

162
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,543
Master Wayne?

163
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,777
You haven't been down here in a long time.

164
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:17,493
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

165
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,457
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

166
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:23,086
...she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

167
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:24,370
She's good.

168
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:28,087
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

169
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,877
We do. I cross-referenced the address
she went back to...

170
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:34,639
...with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and...

171
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,883
Selina Kyle.

172
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,897
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

173
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:46,060
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

174
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,979
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

175
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,364
She won't. She likes them too much.

176
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:53,321
And they weren't what she was after.

177
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,577
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

178
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:58,739
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

179
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,499
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

180
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:04,502
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

181
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,959
You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

182
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:11,593
At this point, I'd set you up with a
chimpanzee, if it brought you back to the world.

183
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,004
There's nothing out there for me.

184
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:15,756
And that's the problem.

185
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:18,471
You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.

186
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,931
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

187
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,471
Alfred...

188
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:25,269
...I did find someone.

189
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:26,854
I know, and you lost them.

190
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:28,984
But that's all part of living, sir.

191
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:33,274
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

192
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,949
Remember when you left Gotham?

193
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:38,112
Before all this, before Batman?

194
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:39,909
You were gone seven year.

195
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:44,668
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

196
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:48,456
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

197
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,874
There's this café
on the banks of the Arno.

198
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,294
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

199
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,347
I had this fantasy...

200
00:16:58,465 --> 00:17:01,139
...that I would look across the tables...

201
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:05,271
...and I'd see you there, with a wife.

202
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:07,270
Maybe a couple of kids.

203
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,230
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

204
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:18,243
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

205
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,745
That you were happy.

206
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,336
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

207
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:33,001
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

208
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,045
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

209
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,392
I still do.

210
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,482
They wash up here
a couple of times a month.

211
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,109
More when it gets colder.

212
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:53,235
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

213
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:59,026
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.

214
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,029
- What?
- Name's Jimmy.

215
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:04,618
He's from St. Swithin's.

216
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,165
It's the boys' home
where I coach some ball.

217
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,673
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.

218
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,334
- No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

219
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,347
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

220
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:22,599
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

221
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:24,851
Not for the past couple of years.

222
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,855
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

223
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:32,017
I'd like to, if that's all right.

224
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:35,236
You know what he was doing
in the tunnels?

225
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:39,241
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out.

226
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,620
Say you can live down there.

227
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,826
Say there's work down there.

228
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,491
Work?

229
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:50,456
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

230
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:53,246
More than you can find up here, I guess.

231
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:55,374
So you know about him?

232
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,792
Of course.

233
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,299
Do you think he's coming back?

234
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,802
I don't know.

235
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,193
You brought a date?

236
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,575
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

237
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,704
Right hand. No partials.

238
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,086
Very nice.

239
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,959
Not so fast, handsome.

240
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,499
You got something for me?

241
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,585
Yes.

242
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:53,265
I don't know what you're planning to do
with Mr. Wayne's prints...

243
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,230
...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

244
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:59,112
You don't count so good?

245
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,522
I count fine.

246
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:04,112
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

247
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,616
Okay.

248
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:14,415
My friend's outside. Just hit "send."

249
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,515
This place is a little dead.

250
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:30,928
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

251
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:33,638
Is everything okay?

252
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,807
Great. Catch you later.

253
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,824
It would have been a lot easier...

254
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:47,197
...to just give me what we agreed.

255
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:49,780
We can't have loose ends.

256
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,784
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

257
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,452
No.

258
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,495
But my friend over there?

259
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:00,836
Every cop in the city's missing him.

260
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,341
That's cute.

261
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,219
But they're not gonna be looking
in a place like this.

262
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:08,298
I don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.

263
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:19,893
- Go!
- Go!

264
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,873
Police! Get down now!

265
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,290
Help me! Help me!

266
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,505
Help me, please! Please help me!

267
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:57,313
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

268
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,017
Call me?

269
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,273
- You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

270
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,661
I got the congressman.

271
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,896
Clear!

272
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:50,992
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

273
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:53,490
You three, down with me.

274
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:57,078
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

275
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:15,099
What, they went down there?

276
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,713
- We're gonna go down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

277
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:53,130
- Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
- No one goes in till we know what's there.

278
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,139
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

279
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,141
Someone get this hothead out of here?

280
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,803
And where's that DWP guy?

281
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:44,396
Why are you here?

282
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:47,729
Answer him.

283
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:51,316
I was asking you.

284
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:53,234
It's the police commissioner.

285
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:59,495
And you brought him down here?

286
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,748
- We didn't know what to do.
- You panicked.

287
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:06,252
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.

288
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,536
No, he's alone.

289
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:12,962
Search him.

290
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,672
Then I will kill you.

291
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:47,122
- He's dead.
- So show me his body.

292
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:50,709
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.

293
00:25:56,752 --> 00:25:58,925
- Follow him!
- Follow him?

294
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:16,485
You okay? You okay?

295
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:18,570
Hey, hey, you awake?

296
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,824
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

297
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

298
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:31,416
Even from a police officer.

299
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:35,254
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

300
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,635
That still count as unscheduled?

301
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:43,845
What can I do for you, officer?

302
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:46,269
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

303
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:50,644
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

304
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:54,151
When I pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.

305
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,153
A masked man called Bane.

306
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,323
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

307
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:02,577
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

308
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:04,745
He needs you.

309
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,619
He needs the Batman.

310
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:13,166
- If Commissioner Gordon thinks...
- He doesn't know or care who you are.

311
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:15,922
But we've met before.

312
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:21,171
It was a long time ago. I was a kid.
St. Swithin's.

313
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:25,558
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

314
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:30,639
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

315
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:36,440
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

316
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:39,939
...and I remember that one just fine.

317
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:44,197
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

318
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:46,320
To be angry...

319
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,914
...in your bones.

320
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,623
I mean, they understand.

321
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:55,625
Foster parents.

322
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,790
Everybody understands...

323
00:27:58,082 --> 00:27:59,584
...for a while.

324
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:04,055
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

325
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,722
Move on.

326
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,266
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

327
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,302
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

328
00:28:10,678 --> 00:28:14,478
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

329
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:17,526
Practice smiling in a mirror.

330
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:20,855
It's like putting on a mask.

331
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:25,656
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

332
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:27,661
Pretty girl on your arm.

333
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:30,535
We were so excited.

334
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:33,417
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

335
00:28:33,868 --> 00:28:37,623
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

336
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:41,588
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

337
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,463
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

338
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:49,721
I'd seen that look on your face before.

339
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,887
It's the same one I taught myself.

340
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:57,726
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

341
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,649
...but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

342
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,151
...even if you're not.

343
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:10,785
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

344
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:12,698
Because the money stopped.

345
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:17,086
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

346
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:20,331
Some of those details
might need your help.

347
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:23,467
You check that name? Bane?

348
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,300
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

349
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:28,931
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

350
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:33,595
...that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

351
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:37,102
- Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

352
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:41,311
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

353
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,743
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

354
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:53,998
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

355
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:55,870
There have to be some.

356
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:59,378
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

357
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:03,541
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

358
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:05,584
Yes. One or two.

359
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:07,753
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

360
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,673
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

361
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,851
- I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

362
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,516
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

363
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:24,028
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

364
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:26,564
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

365
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,404
...the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...

366
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:32,240
...and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...

367
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:35,327
- ...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
- Right.

368
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:53,299
We were in this together...

369
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:56,973
...then you were gone.

370
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,264
The Batman wasn't needed any more.

371
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,559
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

372
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:10,071
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

373
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:14,745
The Batman has to come back.

374
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:17,372
What if he doesn't exist any more?

375
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:21,001
He must.

376
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:36,558
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

377
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:39,596
- You f... You took my wallet!
- No, I...

378
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,523
- Get out.
- She took my...!

379
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,275
- Now.
- Creep!

380
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:48,358
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

381
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,272
Probably the watch.

382
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:06,584
Who's that?

383
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:08,875
A stiff can barely
climb out of his sports car.

384
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,169
- No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

385
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:18,593
- I'm not sure if my assistant...
- Right through here.

386
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,261
Thank you so much.

387
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:29,316
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

388
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:32,231
Miss Tate, isn't it?

389
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:36,281
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

390
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,114
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

391
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,626
It's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.

392
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,542
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

393
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:54,879
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

394
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:56,672
That's very generous of you.

395
00:32:56,922 --> 00:33:00,768
You have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world.

396
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,678
Take our clean-energy project.

397
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,848
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.

398
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,315
- I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

399
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:15,608
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

400
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:19,612
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

401
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:21,655
...that he goes into hiding.

402
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:25,209
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

403
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:30,919
Mind if I cut in?

404
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:33,842
Thank you.

405
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:39,886
- You don't seem happy to see me.
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.

406
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:41,925
I felt like some fresh air.

407
00:33:42,718 --> 00:33:44,846
Why didn't you call the police?

408
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,853
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

409
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:52,316
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.

410
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:55,447
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

411
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:58,325
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

412
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:01,403
- Who's your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

413
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,370
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

414
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:07,580
It's pronounced "Ibiza."

415
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,835
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.

416
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:15,126
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

417
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,137
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

418
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:23,017
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

419
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:27,855
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.

420
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,856
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

421
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:33,315
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement...

422
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,030
...or you're in deep with the wrong people.

423
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:41,327
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

424
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:45,831
- Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

425
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,369
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

426
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:51,788
Start fresh.

427
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:55,174
There's no fresh
start in today's world.

428
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:58,381
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

429
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:02,344
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.

430
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:04,925
Is that how you justify stealing?

431
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:07,686
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

432
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,142
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

433
00:35:10,305 --> 00:35:11,352
Robin Hood?

434
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:15,645
I think I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.

435
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:18,697
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?

436
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:22,905
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's
really in your pants other than your wallet.

437
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:29,708
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

438
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:34,546
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...

439
00:35:34,705 --> 00:35:38,585
...you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...

440
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,845
...and leave so little for the rest of us.

441
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:47,635
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.

442
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:50,645
I'm adaptable.

443
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:54,058
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.

444
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:57,027
But I still can't let you keep them.

445
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:06,866
You... You scared her off!

446
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,328
Not likely.

447
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:14,829
Must have lost my ticket.

448
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:17,748
- Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?

449
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:27,219
Just you, sir?

450
00:36:30,302 --> 00:36:32,304
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

451
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:36,104
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.

452
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:41,522
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

453
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:45,693
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?

454
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:47,611
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

455
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:50,281
Even if you have lost most of my money.

456
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:51,949
Actually, you did that.

457
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:54,834
If you funnel your entire R and D budget...

458
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:57,917
...into a fusion project
that you then mothball...

459
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,424
...your company is unlikely to thrive.

460
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:01,629
What are my options?

461
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:04,170
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

462
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:06,888
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

463
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:09,011
Well, then sit tight.

464
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:10,892
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...

465
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:15,056
...while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

466
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:17,850
She has supported the project
all the way.

467
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:21,440
She's smart. And quite lovely.

468
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:25,486
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

469
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,985
Show her the machine.

470
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:30,199
I'll think it over.

471
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:31,705
Anything else?

472
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:34,116
Nope. Why?

473
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:38,332
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.

474
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,501
I retired.

475
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:44,885
Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.

476
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,507
Just for old times' sake.

477
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,018
I figured you'd have
shut this place down.

478
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,854
It was always shut down, officially.

479
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:01,108
All this new stuff.

480
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:05,899
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

481
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:08,738
For years, I've been shuttering
and consolidating...

482
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,278
...all the different prototypes
under one roof.

483
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:13,163
- My roof.
- Why?

484
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:16,121
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

485
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:21,375
Now you're just showing off.

486
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:27,170
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.

487
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:32,266
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

488
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,218
What's it called?

489
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:39,064
It has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

490
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:42,601
I just took to calling it the Bat.

491
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:46,146
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

492
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,909
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

493
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,282
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

494
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:54,822
Better mind?

495
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:58,371
Well, I was trying to be modest.

496
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,665
A less busy mind.

497
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,374
Yours.

498
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,390
- Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

499
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,266
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

500
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:19,808
Not bad.

501
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,273
Not bad at all.

502
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:32,860
If you're seriously considering
going back out there...

503
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:35,154
...you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

504
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,367
I'm all ears.

505
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:41,372
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

506
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:46,749
A pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die.

507
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:50,678
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

508
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:55,049
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

509
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:57,343
- Bane.
- Bane.

510
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:00,683
Born and raised in hell on earth.

511
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:04,771
- Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

512
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,527
But they do know that once he did...

513
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:11,862
...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

514
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:14,025
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

515
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,365
And then he was excommunicated.

516
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,543
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

517
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:25,955
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

518
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,877
That was then.

519
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:31,130
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...

520
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,887
...but that doesn't make you
what you were.

521
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:38,676
If this man is everything that you
say he is, then the city needs me.

522
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:41,812
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

523
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,101
Your resources. Your knowledge.

524
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:47,359
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

525
00:40:48,143 --> 00:40:49,315
That time's past.

526
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:52,856
You're afraid that if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

527
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:54,275
No.

528
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:58,745
I'm afraid that you want to.

529
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:16,425
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

530
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,430
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

531
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:21,889
On what basis?

532
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:23,599
I flipped a coin.

533
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:31,649
It says rye... I said no rye, man.

534
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,029
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

535
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:44,996
Come on. Let's go scalping.

536
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:01,470
Come on.

537
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:28,410
Everybody down, now!

538
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,439
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

539
00:42:49,597 --> 00:42:52,976
Really? Then why are you people here?

540
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:12,204
Everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!

541
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,338
We have an emergency situation!

542
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,218
You gotta get in there!

543
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:20,970
This is a hostage situation.

544
00:43:21,129 --> 00:43:24,554
No, this is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.

545
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:26,514
I'm not risking my men for your money.

546
00:43:30,764 --> 00:43:33,108
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.

547
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,314
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

548
00:43:35,477 --> 00:43:37,571
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

549
00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:42,235
You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in
your mattress might be worth a whole lot less.

550
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,653
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.

551
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:47,322
- Thank you.
- That'll slow them down.

552
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:49,036
Move back!

553
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,873
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

554
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,962
They cut the fiber.

555
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,214
Cell's working.

556
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:58,716
For now.

557
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,055
Get all these barriers up. All of them up. No
one gets in or out of any of these streets.

558
00:44:08,218 --> 00:44:09,845
Where am I supposed to move it?

559
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:11,308
Back it up.

560
00:44:15,892 --> 00:44:18,111
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?

561
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,074
How much longer
does the program need?

562
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:29,827
Eight minutes.

563
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,659
Time to go mobile.

564
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:34,169
Everybody, up!

565
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:39,791
You two, move!

566
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:43,924
Thank you.

567
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,347
Steady.

568
00:44:55,056 --> 00:44:56,433
Steady.

569
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:05,404
I've got something.

570
00:45:06,526 --> 00:45:09,029
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

571
00:45:09,195 --> 00:45:10,447
Hold your fire!

572
00:45:20,415 --> 00:45:21,917
Go, go!

573
00:45:31,634 --> 00:45:33,307
Please! Just let me go!

574
00:45:33,636 --> 00:45:36,264
Hey, please! Hey!

575
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:40,689
Shoot the tires.

576
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:42,320
There's no shot.

577
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,859
Now back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.

578
00:45:47,025 --> 00:45:49,778
...P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown...

579
00:45:49,944 --> 00:45:51,992
...in response to a hostage situation.

580
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:00,167
What's going on with the lights?

581
00:46:07,086 --> 00:46:08,554
It can't be.

582
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:10,097
What the hell was that?

583
00:46:10,256 --> 00:46:13,100
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

584
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:20,600
Please! Help, help, help!

585
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:39,498
Sorry.

586
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,419
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!

587
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,710
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

588
00:46:58,012 --> 00:47:01,141
Call everyone in.
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.

589
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:04,026
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

590
00:47:04,185 --> 00:47:07,405
- What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

591
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:10,612
...are confirming
four suspects are carrying two hostages...

592
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:12,823
...kidnapped from
the Gotham Stock Exchange.

593
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:16,286
- Reports from the eyewitnesses...
- Scott, dead center of your screen.

594
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:18,870
- What do you see?
- I see Batman.

595
00:47:19,033 --> 00:47:21,707
Hard to believe, but the suspects
are now being pursued...

596
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:23,837
...by what appears to be the Batman.

597
00:47:23,997 --> 00:47:25,089
Well, what do you know?

598
00:47:30,253 --> 00:47:32,221
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

599
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:37,602
Please! Just let me go! Please!

600
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,740
One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?

601
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:56,825
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

602
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:01,541
- He's getting away.
- Who do you wanna catch?

603
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:04,250
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

604
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,961
...The entire upper west hill...

605
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:13,175
Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.

606
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:16,262
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

607
00:48:16,591 --> 00:48:18,685
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

608
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:29,486
Please! Just let me go!

609
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:31,026
Please!

610
00:49:49,308 --> 00:49:50,685
We lost him.

611
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:52,608
How could you lose him?

612
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,363
He's got a lot of firepower.

613
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:55,614
What, and you don't?

614
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:02,155
He's heading back downtown.

615
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:04,369
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

616
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:06,584
Close it off, gentlemen.

617
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,403
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

618
00:50:46,574 --> 00:50:49,703
You might have
the wrong animal there, sir.

619
00:51:00,588 --> 00:51:02,261
You sure it was him?

620
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:12,521
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.

621
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:14,310
What about the men they arrested?

622
00:51:14,477 --> 00:51:18,573
He said, and I quote,
"They would die before talking."

623
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:22,072
Where does he find these guys?

624
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,405
Open the champagne.

625
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:29,951
And can we get some girls in here?

626
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:31,539
Careful what you wish for.

627
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:43,890
Cat got your tongue?

628
00:51:44,048 --> 00:51:45,265
You dumb bitch.

629
00:51:45,424 --> 00:51:47,518
Nobody ever accused me
of being dumb.

630
00:51:47,677 --> 00:51:50,601
You're dumb for coming here tonight.

631
00:51:52,014 --> 00:51:53,687
I want what you owe me.

632
00:51:55,518 --> 00:51:57,441
Want doesn't get.

633
00:51:57,937 --> 00:52:01,987
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?

634
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:03,366
I don't know.

635
00:52:03,985 --> 00:52:05,362
Do they?

636
00:52:06,696 --> 00:52:08,289
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

637
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:10,833
The program. The "clean slate."

638
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:14,295
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.

639
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:16,584
Hold it right there!

640
00:52:30,094 --> 00:52:31,141
Where is it?

641
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:33,272
The clean slate?

642
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:36,059
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

643
00:52:36,225 --> 00:52:40,401
...in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

644
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:43,737
- Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

645
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:46,493
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

646
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,620
That's why I bought them.

647
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,407
But they had nothing.

648
00:52:51,824 --> 00:52:53,542
It was a gangland myth.

649
00:53:04,879 --> 00:53:06,051
Stay back!

650
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:11,052
I'm not bluffing!

651
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,346
They know.

652
00:53:13,763 --> 00:53:15,185
They just don't care.

653
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:33,828
You've gotta be kidding me.

654
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:36,540
- No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

655
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,479
My mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men.

656
00:53:58,641 --> 00:53:59,688
This isn't a car.

657
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:51,410
See you around.

658
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:53,529
You're welcome.

659
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:55,281
I had it under control.

660
00:54:55,448 --> 00:54:56,791
Those weren't street thugs.

661
00:54:56,949 --> 00:54:59,043
They were trained killers.

662
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:00,874
I saved your life.

663
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:05,834
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

664
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,549
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.

665
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:11,589
I sold his prints to Daggett...

666
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:16,018
...for something that doesn't even exist.

667
00:55:16,302 --> 00:55:20,023
- I doubt many people get the better of you.
- Hey, when a girl's desperate...

668
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:22,525
- What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know...

669
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:26,062
...but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

670
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:32,785
Miss Kyle?

671
00:55:35,696 --> 00:55:37,915
So that's what that feels like.

672
00:55:57,218 --> 00:56:01,769
I see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back.

673
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:03,899
I retrieved this.

674
00:56:04,058 --> 00:56:06,527
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

675
00:56:06,685 --> 00:56:10,110
- They don't have the tools to analyze it.
- They would if you gave them to them.

676
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:12,775
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

677
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:16,287
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

678
00:56:16,445 --> 00:56:18,573
Alfred, enough.
The police weren't getting it done.

679
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:22,118
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

680
00:56:22,284 --> 00:56:26,084
- You thought I didn't have it in me.
- You led a bloated police force on a chase...

681
00:56:26,247 --> 00:56:28,841
...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

682
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:31,843
What about when you come up
against him? What then?

683
00:56:32,002 --> 00:56:36,803
- I'll fight harder. I always have.
- Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.

684
00:56:36,966 --> 00:56:39,640
I see the power of belief.

685
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:42,726
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

686
00:56:42,888 --> 00:56:44,356
You said he was excommunicated.

687
00:56:44,515 --> 00:56:46,392
By Ra's Al Ghul.

688
00:56:47,434 --> 00:56:48,526
Who leads them now?

689
00:56:48,686 --> 00:56:51,280
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows
and I beat him.

690
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:54,191
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

691
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:57,950
Trades of some kind. Coded.

692
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,578
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

693
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,832
Get this to Fox.

694
00:57:02,992 --> 00:57:07,338
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.

695
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,675
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

696
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:19,888
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

697
00:57:20,301 --> 00:57:23,430
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

698
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:29,569
- You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

699
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:34,616
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

700
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:38,403
You're not Batman any more.
You have to find another way.

701
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:42,540
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

702
00:57:42,698 --> 00:57:46,419
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

703
00:57:46,577 --> 00:57:50,457
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just move on.

704
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:53,759
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

705
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:55,962
What if she had?

706
00:57:56,128 --> 00:57:57,596
She... I can't change that.

707
00:57:57,755 --> 00:58:00,759
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...

708
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:04,395
...saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?

709
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:10,109
And what if...

710
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:13,028
...to spare you pain...

711
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:16,732
...I burnt that letter?

712
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:21,787
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

713
00:58:21,987 --> 00:58:25,412
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

714
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:30,956
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

715
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:34,709
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

716
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,594
You expect to destroy my world...

717
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:42,342
...and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

718
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:44,181
No, no, no.

719
00:58:45,427 --> 00:58:47,521
I know what this means.

720
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,772
What does it mean?

721
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:51,354
It means your hatred.

722
00:58:51,558 --> 00:58:55,279
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

723
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:59,863
...since I first heard his cries echo...

724
00:59:00,526 --> 00:59:02,620
...through this house.

725
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:07,200
But it might also mean saving your life.

726
00:59:08,492 --> 00:59:10,915
And that is more important.

727
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,172
Goodbye, Alfred.

728
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:38,154
Alfred?

729
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,954
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

730
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:48,661
Page three.

731
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,204
Seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange...

732
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:54,667
...verified by thumbprint.

733
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,504
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

734
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:02,718
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

735
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,305
...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

736
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:10,313
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

737
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:13,441
Applied Sciences is all looked up
and off the books.

738
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,819
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

739
01:00:16,977 --> 01:00:18,479
Miranda Tate.

740
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,780
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

741
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:26,445
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

742
01:00:26,779 --> 01:00:30,329
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

743
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:32,500
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

744
01:00:36,205 --> 01:00:39,675
Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.

745
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:47,053
This is it, isn't it?

746
01:00:47,633 --> 01:00:50,227
The reactor is beneath the river...

747
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:54,516
...so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

748
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:58,148
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

749
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,608
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

750
01:01:07,486 --> 01:01:10,410
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

751
01:01:10,572 --> 01:01:12,245
No fossil fuels.

752
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:15,001
Free clean energy for an entire city.

753
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,710
Three years ago,
a Russian scientist published a paper...

754
01:01:18,872 --> 01:01:21,170
...on weaponized fusion reactions.

755
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:26,260
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

756
01:01:27,506 --> 01:01:29,133
I think this machine works.

757
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:35,932
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

758
01:01:36,098 --> 01:01:39,193
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

759
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:42,150
...died in a plane crash six months ago?

760
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:45,816
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

761
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:52,161
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

762
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:57,870
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

763
01:01:58,328 --> 01:01:59,580
...and this reactor.

764
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,123
To do what with it?

765
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,792
Nothing.

766
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:05,503
Until we can guarantee its safety.

767
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:06,886
And if we can't?

768
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:08,718
Decommission it. Flood it.

769
01:02:08,881 --> 01:02:12,681
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

770
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:14,470
If the world's not ready, yes.

771
01:02:14,636 --> 01:02:18,937
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

772
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:20,685
I'm trusting you.

773
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:22,819
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

774
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:25,906
I could have flooded this chamber
at any time.

775
01:02:26,064 --> 01:02:28,112
I'm choosing to trust you.

776
01:02:28,984 --> 01:02:30,201
Please.

777
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:41,547
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

778
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:44,879
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here...

779
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:48,387
...which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

780
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:50,798
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

781
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:52,716
And he himself has run it.

782
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:57,639
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
Check the share price this morning.

783
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:02,059
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

784
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:04,524
...it's cost us all a lot of money.

785
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:06,529
And he has to go.

786
01:03:07,397 --> 01:03:09,399
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

787
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:19,497
Now, back to business.

788
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:23,422
Mr. Wayne, over here!
How's it feel to be one of the people?

789
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,630
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I
didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

790
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:31,096
Looks like you need a ride?

791
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:33,474
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

792
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:37,933
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

793
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,268
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?

794
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:43,400
- Not that we know of.
- You don't know much of anything, do you?

795
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:45,481
- Where's Bane?
- We told him it was urgent.

796
01:03:45,644 --> 01:03:48,272
- Where is that masked...?
- Speak of the devil...

797
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:50,691
...and he shall appear.

798
01:03:50,857 --> 01:03:53,326
What the hell is going on?

799
01:03:53,944 --> 01:03:57,323
- The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

800
01:03:57,489 --> 01:04:00,288
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

801
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:05,126
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

802
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:10,420
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

803
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:15,512
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?

804
01:04:18,093 --> 01:04:20,471
- Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

805
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:22,230
I'm in charge.

806
01:04:23,015 --> 01:04:25,393
Do you feel in charge?

807
01:04:30,439 --> 01:04:32,191
I've paid you a small fortune.

808
01:04:32,357 --> 01:04:35,327
And this gives you power over me?

809
01:04:35,902 --> 01:04:37,324
What is this?

810
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:42,459
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

811
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:43,952
...till now.

812
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:45,579
What are you?

813
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:47,589
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

814
01:04:47,748 --> 01:04:50,627
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

815
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:55,798
You're pure evil.

816
01:04:55,964 --> 01:04:58,262
I'm necessary evil.

817
01:04:58,425 --> 01:05:00,348
No. No, no, no!

818
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:07,400
When you started, why the mask?

819
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,279
- To protect the people closest to me.
- But you were a loner, right?

820
01:05:10,395 --> 01:05:13,524
- You didn't have any family?
- There are always people you care about.

821
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:17,615
You just don't realize how much
until they're gone.

822
01:05:18,028 --> 01:05:20,907
The idea was to be a symbol.

823
01:05:21,073 --> 01:05:24,202
Batman could be anybody.

824
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:26,290
That was the point.

825
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:29,881
- Well, it was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

826
01:05:30,082 --> 01:05:34,303
- They'll figure that out in the end.
- You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

827
01:05:34,836 --> 01:05:38,056
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.

828
01:05:38,215 --> 01:05:40,309
I could use some help, actually.

829
01:05:41,301 --> 01:05:43,178
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

830
01:05:46,807 --> 01:05:48,400
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

831
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:50,731
- That's the way this works!
- I don't think so!

832
01:05:50,894 --> 01:05:53,147
- That is the way...
- He's not a mark.

833
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:55,987
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

834
01:05:56,483 --> 01:06:00,784
Yeah, it's not much.
But it's more than you've got right now.

835
01:06:00,946 --> 01:06:03,369
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

836
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:06,126
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us?

837
01:06:06,284 --> 01:06:10,255
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

838
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:13,042
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

839
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,882
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

840
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,304
He wants to meet tonight.

841
01:06:18,463 --> 01:06:19,510
Why?

842
01:06:19,673 --> 01:06:22,597
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

843
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:28,148
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

844
01:06:28,306 --> 01:06:30,183
I like your place.

845
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:32,769
Mr. Wayne?

846
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:37,650
I'm sorry they took all your money.

847
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,030
No, you're not.

848
01:06:41,153 --> 01:06:43,952
- Can we help you, officer?
- Yeah.

849
01:06:44,114 --> 01:06:47,664
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

850
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:49,794
- Thought you might want to know.
- Why?

851
01:06:49,953 --> 01:06:54,083
His name's all over these permits I just
pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham.

852
01:06:54,249 --> 01:06:58,129
That's MTA maintenance,
sewer construction, couple of other things.

853
01:06:58,295 --> 01:07:01,299
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

854
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:04,344
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

855
01:07:04,509 --> 01:07:06,682
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

856
01:07:06,845 --> 01:07:10,190
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
I want him found.

857
01:07:10,348 --> 01:07:12,692
Yeah, the masked man. We're on it.

858
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:15,604
Lose the uniform,
you're working for me now.

859
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,193
We could use some hotter heads
around here.

860
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:22,486
- Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
- You're a detective now, son.

861
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:25,781
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence any more.

862
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,505
Nobody's answering.

863
01:07:38,877 --> 01:07:40,049
No.

864
01:07:40,212 --> 01:07:41,885
I'm on my own now.

865
01:07:42,714 --> 01:07:44,136
Do you have keys?

866
01:07:45,342 --> 01:07:46,514
Never needed them.

867
01:07:53,183 --> 01:07:54,935
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

868
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:58,279
Suffering builds character.

869
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,868
I'll take care of your
parents' legacy, Bruce.

870
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:10,375
Who's this?

871
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,551
Where's Alfred?

872
01:08:21,336 --> 01:08:22,713
He left...

873
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:26,349
...taking everything.

874
01:08:50,323 --> 01:08:51,700
What's that?

875
01:08:52,492 --> 01:08:54,790
My power's been shut off.

876
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,760
You're good at that.

877
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:05,801
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

878
01:09:06,256 --> 01:09:10,762
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

879
01:09:12,596 --> 01:09:15,566
I assumed your family was wealthy.

880
01:09:16,349 --> 01:09:17,851
Not always.

881
01:09:18,852 --> 01:09:20,399
Not when I was young.

882
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,905
An old mistake.

883
01:09:24,024 --> 01:09:25,901
I've made a few myself.

884
01:09:27,152 --> 01:09:28,779
More than a few.

885
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:32,533
We could leave.

886
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:34,080
Tonight.

887
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:39,001
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

888
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,588
Someday, perhaps.

889
01:09:43,543 --> 01:09:45,011
Not tonight.

890
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:15,041
Don't be shy.

891
01:10:17,202 --> 01:10:19,625
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.

892
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:22,707
- That depends.
- On what?

893
01:10:22,874 --> 01:10:24,501
On what you want it for.

894
01:10:24,668 --> 01:10:27,592
I acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands.

895
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,132
Still don't trust me?

896
01:10:31,257 --> 01:10:33,305
How can we change that?

897
01:10:33,468 --> 01:10:35,266
Start by taking me to Bane.

898
01:10:38,306 --> 01:10:39,899
You asked.

899
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:44,233
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

900
01:10:44,562 --> 01:10:47,031
And they're not your average brawlers.

901
01:10:47,524 --> 01:10:49,026
Neither am I.

902
01:10:56,825 --> 01:10:57,917
- He's behind you.
- Who?

903
01:10:58,076 --> 01:10:59,123
Me.

904
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,258
What do you think you're...?

905
01:11:18,388 --> 01:11:20,607
Just a little further.

906
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:30,363
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.

907
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:32,948
You made a serious mistake.

908
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:38,455
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

909
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,167
Bane.

910
01:11:43,329 --> 01:11:46,424
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

911
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:50,011
...Mr. Wayne.

912
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:03,395
Peace has cost you your strength.

913
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:05,401
Victory has defeated you.

914
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:12,795
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

915
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:15,760
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

916
01:13:16,673 --> 01:13:19,517
Members of the League of Shadows.

917
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:23,889
And you betrayed us.

918
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:27,646
"Us"? You were excommunicated...

919
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:30,358
...by a gang of psychopaths.

920
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:37,740
I am the League of Shadows.

921
01:13:37,902 --> 01:13:41,031
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

922
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:56,680
You fight like a younger man.

923
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:59,136
Nothing held back.

924
01:13:59,299 --> 01:14:02,519
Admirable, but mistaken.

925
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:10,527
You think darkness is your ally?

926
01:14:10,685 --> 01:14:13,404
But you merely adopted the dark.

927
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:16,111
I was born in it.

928
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,819
Molded by it.

929
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:23,081
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

930
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:26,493
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!

931
01:14:29,495 --> 01:14:33,466
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

932
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:42,058
I will show you where
I have made my home...

933
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:45,561
...whilst preparing to bring justice.

934
01:14:47,764 --> 01:14:49,983
Then I will break you.

935
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,610
Your precious armory.

936
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:04,622
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

937
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:17,131
Yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

938
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:23,679
Your spirit...

939
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:29,814
...or your body.

940
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:16,937
Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line
on the congressman's kidnapping.

941
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:31,205
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

942
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:34,541
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

943
01:16:34,704 --> 01:16:36,752
Do you mind?

944
01:16:49,552 --> 01:16:52,681
I showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.

945
01:16:52,972 --> 01:16:55,521
Don't tell me. Still in love?

946
01:16:55,683 --> 01:16:58,232
Head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

947
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:02,149
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

948
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:06,281
- Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

949
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:08,892
Why would you run?
You can't hide with a record like this.

950
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:11,078
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

951
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,117
Who then? Bane?

952
01:17:13,284 --> 01:17:14,752
What do you know about him?

953
01:17:15,787 --> 01:17:19,257
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.

954
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:21,292
We can offer you protection.

955
01:17:24,587 --> 01:17:25,634
Okay.

956
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:33,805
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

957
01:17:36,682 --> 01:17:38,184
Did they kill him?

958
01:17:39,936 --> 01:17:41,563
I'm not sure.

959
01:18:01,374 --> 01:18:03,001
Why didn't you just...

960
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:06,174
...kill me?

961
01:18:06,337 --> 01:18:09,807
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

962
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:13,094
Your punishment must be more severe.

963
01:18:13,845 --> 01:18:15,438
Torture?

964
01:18:15,763 --> 01:18:16,855
Yes.

965
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:19,684
But not of your body.

966
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:24,822
Of your soul.

967
01:18:26,274 --> 01:18:27,400
Where am I?

968
01:18:27,942 --> 01:18:28,989
Home.

969
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:32,868
Where I learned the truth about despair.

970
01:18:33,865 --> 01:18:35,208
As will you.

971
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:39,420
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:

972
01:18:40,204 --> 01:18:41,581
Hope.

973
01:18:41,747 --> 01:18:44,876
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries...

974
01:18:45,042 --> 01:18:48,467
...has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.

975
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:50,890
So easy.

976
01:18:51,799 --> 01:18:53,051
So simple.

977
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:59,608
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

978
01:19:01,684 --> 01:19:03,652
...many have died trying.

979
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,241
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

980
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:12,783
So as I terrorize Gotham...

981
01:19:12,945 --> 01:19:16,916
...I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

982
01:19:17,325 --> 01:19:19,874
I will let them believe
that they can survive...

983
01:19:20,036 --> 01:19:26,009
...so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.

984
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:31,965
You can watch me torture an entire city.

985
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:36,262
And then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...

986
01:19:36,552 --> 01:19:39,522
...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

987
01:19:43,184 --> 01:19:45,107
We will destroy Gotham.

988
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:48,864
And then, when it is done...

989
01:19:49,315 --> 01:19:50,942
...and Gotham is...

990
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:54,154
...ashes...

991
01:19:59,825 --> 01:20:02,578
...then you have my permission to die.

992
01:20:16,884 --> 01:20:18,386
You're looking her up in here?

993
01:20:18,552 --> 01:20:22,398
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

994
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:25,651
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 16.

995
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:26,982
Little closer, baby.

996
01:20:27,144 --> 01:20:29,238
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

997
01:20:30,606 --> 01:20:32,324
She's gonna be fine.

998
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:36,366
I still don't see the need of a
board meeting for the energy project.

999
01:20:36,529 --> 01:20:38,122
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1000
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:40,784
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.

1001
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:44,837
How good of you to join us.

1002
01:20:45,538 --> 01:20:48,166
Chair. President.

1003
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:52,007
All I need now is one more
ordinary board member.

1004
01:20:52,169 --> 01:20:55,594
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1005
01:20:55,756 --> 01:20:57,008
No.

1006
01:20:57,174 --> 01:20:58,676
I will volunteer.

1007
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,766
Where are you taking us?

1008
01:21:11,397 --> 01:21:14,241
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1009
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:15,614
What happened?

1010
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,904
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1011
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:20,994
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.

1012
01:21:21,157 --> 01:21:23,501
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1013
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:26,378
Get every available cop down there
and smoke him out!

1014
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:28,084
The mayor won't want panic.

1015
01:21:28,247 --> 01:21:30,420
So it's a training exercise.

1016
01:21:32,835 --> 01:21:35,258
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1017
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:37,094
Not you.

1018
01:21:37,256 --> 01:21:39,634
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

1019
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:44,522
...so you chase up the Daggett leads
any way you can.

1020
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:45,894
Yes, sir.

1021
01:21:56,317 --> 01:22:01,790
He asks how much you would pay us
to let you die.

1022
01:22:01,947 --> 01:22:03,949
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1023
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,952
Do it for the pleasure.

1024
01:22:06,452 --> 01:22:09,422
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.

1025
01:22:17,213 --> 01:22:19,056
He will try the climb.

1026
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:35,990
Has anyone ever made it?

1027
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:38,367
Of course not.

1028
01:22:48,869 --> 01:22:51,247
He says there is one who did.

1029
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:53,757
A child.

1030
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,048
A child born in this hell.

1031
01:22:57,962 --> 01:22:59,555
Bane.

1032
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:02,850
An old legend. Nothing more.

1033
01:23:06,637 --> 01:23:07,809
Don't.

1034
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:12,352
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

1035
01:23:38,002 --> 01:23:39,754
Fire in the hole!

1036
01:24:08,491 --> 01:24:09,993
Turn it on.

1037
01:24:13,704 --> 01:24:18,551
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

1038
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:20,177
I won't do it.

1039
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:21,716
All right, stop.

1040
01:24:23,255 --> 01:24:26,179
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

1041
01:24:26,342 --> 01:24:28,140
...and you'll barely slow them down.

1042
01:24:54,745 --> 01:24:56,964
Go on, then. Do your work.

1043
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:02,087
Take them up to the surface.

1044
01:25:02,253 --> 01:25:04,130
People of their status...

1045
01:25:04,296 --> 01:25:09,553
...deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.

1046
01:25:13,556 --> 01:25:17,686
I've been to half of Daggett's cement plants
and locations they poured underground.

1047
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:20,229
Anything strange about the pourings?

1048
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:24,196
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1049
01:25:24,358 --> 01:25:27,282
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking.

1050
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,826
It's done.

1051
01:25:33,993 --> 01:25:38,339
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1052
01:25:39,582 --> 01:25:42,335
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1053
01:25:43,877 --> 01:25:45,754
No, you cannot.

1054
01:25:46,088 --> 01:25:49,763
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1055
01:25:50,175 --> 01:25:54,021
If you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.

1056
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:56,352
Five, by my calculations.

1057
01:25:56,515 --> 01:25:58,188
And then it will go off!

1058
01:25:59,977 --> 01:26:03,948
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1059
01:26:04,106 --> 01:26:06,359
...indeed I hope it does.

1060
01:26:07,026 --> 01:26:09,700
Hey. Hey!

1061
01:26:11,655 --> 01:26:14,784
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1062
01:26:15,409 --> 01:26:17,082
- When?
- When?

1063
01:26:17,244 --> 01:26:21,545
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck was shutting them out.

1064
01:26:21,707 --> 01:26:25,257
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1065
01:26:25,419 --> 01:26:29,424
And as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1066
01:26:39,183 --> 01:26:42,187
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1067
01:26:49,693 --> 01:26:51,240
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1068
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:55,954
I got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...

1069
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:59,712
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1070
01:27:01,497 --> 01:27:03,750
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1071
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:07,136
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.

1072
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:17,596
- Patch me in to Foley.
- Foley's overseeing the operation.

1073
01:27:17,763 --> 01:27:19,106
They're heading into a trap!

1074
01:27:20,349 --> 01:27:22,977
We're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.

1075
01:27:23,143 --> 01:27:26,613
- Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
- It's a training exercise, that's all.

1076
01:27:26,772 --> 01:27:30,822
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1077
01:27:32,736 --> 01:27:34,738
- Foley.
- It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

1078
01:27:34,905 --> 01:27:36,452
Bane has been pouring concrete...

1079
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:38,583
- ...laced with explosives!
- Where?

1080
01:27:40,828 --> 01:27:48,337
Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light.

1081
01:27:49,211 --> 01:27:54,889
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's...

1082
01:27:55,217 --> 01:27:58,972
There's a ring around the tunnels! They'll
blow it and trap the cops underground!

1083
01:28:00,055 --> 01:28:02,899
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1084
01:28:03,058 --> 01:28:07,154
Through the perilous fight.

1085
01:28:07,646 --> 01:28:11,446
O'er the ramparts we watched.

1086
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:16,034
Were so gallantly streaming.

1087
01:28:16,488 --> 01:28:20,243
And the rockets' red glare.

1088
01:28:20,909 --> 01:28:24,664
The bombs bursting in air.

1089
01:28:25,205 --> 01:28:26,923
Gave proof through...

1090
01:28:27,124 --> 01:28:29,297
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1091
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:33,590
...that our flag was still there.

1092
01:28:34,381 --> 01:28:42,381
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner
Yet wave.

1093
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,652
O'er the land of the free.

1094
01:28:50,564 --> 01:28:56,662
And the home of the brave.

1095
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,881
Let the games begin.

1096
01:30:28,328 --> 01:30:30,251
Everybody okay?

1097
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:32,924
- Let's move! Move, move!
- Go, go!

1098
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,432
Gotham...

1099
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:52,398
...take control.

1100
01:30:53,145 --> 01:30:56,570
Take control of your city.

1101
01:31:01,778 --> 01:31:03,655
- Foley.
- Jesus, Blake.

1102
01:31:03,822 --> 01:31:05,745
Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.

1103
01:31:06,825 --> 01:31:08,202
Not every cop.

1104
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:25,352
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1105
01:32:16,478 --> 01:32:18,480
Clear the corners, rookie.

1106
01:32:19,606 --> 01:32:20,858
Get my coat, son.

1107
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:22,776
This...

1108
01:32:23,735 --> 01:32:26,739
This is the instrument of your liberation.

1109
01:32:29,408 --> 01:32:32,252
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1110
01:32:33,078 --> 01:32:35,376
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1111
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:43,089
Identify yourself to the world.

1112
01:32:44,423 --> 01:32:48,849
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1113
01:32:49,219 --> 01:32:51,563
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1114
01:32:51,722 --> 01:32:55,272
Plane crash on an agency pull
out of Uzbekistan, but...

1115
01:32:56,268 --> 01:32:57,394
It looks like it's him.

1116
01:32:57,686 --> 01:33:00,940
And what...? What is this?

1117
01:33:01,106 --> 01:33:04,986
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1118
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,530
...with a blast radius of six miles.

1119
01:33:08,363 --> 01:33:11,742
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1120
01:33:13,827 --> 01:33:15,124
Only me.

1121
01:33:15,871 --> 01:33:17,498
Only you.

1122
01:33:18,498 --> 01:33:20,796
Thank you, good doctor!

1123
01:33:23,378 --> 01:33:26,678
Now, this bomb is armed!

1124
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,434
And this bomb is mobile!

1125
01:33:29,593 --> 01:33:34,144
And the identity of the triggerman
is a mystery.

1126
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:39,528
For one of you holds the detonator!

1127
01:33:39,951 --> 01:33:43,330
Now, we come here
not as conquerors...

1128
01:33:43,496 --> 01:33:49,094
...but as liberators, to return control
of this city to the people.

1129
01:33:50,295 --> 01:33:55,017
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

1130
01:33:55,717 --> 01:33:59,517
...or from those people
attempting to flee...

1131
01:34:01,431 --> 01:34:04,059
...this anonymous Gothamite...

1132
01:34:04,225 --> 01:34:09,106
...this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

1133
01:34:11,524 --> 01:34:13,902
For now, martial law is in effect.

1134
01:34:14,611 --> 01:34:19,412
Return to your homes,
hold your families close...

1135
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:22,122
...and wait.

1136
01:34:23,244 --> 01:34:26,293
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1137
01:34:32,587 --> 01:34:34,214
Pull back the fighters.

1138
01:34:35,048 --> 01:34:37,642
Start high-level reconnaissance flights.

1139
01:34:38,593 --> 01:34:40,391
Get the president on the line.

1140
01:35:00,907 --> 01:35:05,538
Tanks and planes
cannot stop us from detonating our device.

1141
01:35:05,995 --> 01:35:11,297
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.

1142
01:35:16,172 --> 01:35:18,266
How many of you are there, son?

1143
01:35:19,884 --> 01:35:23,684
You don't have enough men to stop
12 million people from leaving this island.

1144
01:35:24,472 --> 01:35:26,895
No. No, we don't.

1145
01:35:27,058 --> 01:35:28,105
But you do.

1146
01:35:29,853 --> 01:35:33,107
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

1147
01:35:33,273 --> 01:35:36,277
If one person crosses this bridge...

1148
01:35:36,443 --> 01:35:38,241
...Gotham gets blown to hell.

1149
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,958
The people of our greatest
city are resilient.

1150
01:35:48,037 --> 01:35:51,587
They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.

1151
01:35:53,543 --> 01:35:56,547
We do not negotiate with terrorists...

1152
01:35:57,422 --> 01:35:59,265
...but we do recognize realities.

1153
01:36:00,341 --> 01:36:02,469
As this situation develops...

1154
01:36:02,969 --> 01:36:06,143
...one thing must be understood
above all others.

1155
01:36:08,308 --> 01:36:11,232
People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.

1156
01:36:11,394 --> 01:36:12,737
What does that mean?

1157
01:36:13,354 --> 01:36:15,652
It means we're on our own.

1158
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:17,867
I have to get in front of a camera.

1159
01:36:18,318 --> 01:36:20,571
They will kill you the second
you show your face.

1160
01:36:21,321 --> 01:36:25,201
Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the
people. They need to know I could lead.

1161
01:36:25,366 --> 01:36:26,959
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1162
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:28,665
Then he'll show his true colors.

1163
01:36:28,828 --> 01:36:30,455
And you'll be dead.

1164
01:36:49,098 --> 01:36:54,195
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1165
01:36:54,812 --> 01:36:56,280
Blackgate Prison...

1166
01:36:56,439 --> 01:37:00,034
...where a thousand men have languished...

1167
01:37:00,193 --> 01:37:03,697
...under the name of this man:

1168
01:37:03,863 --> 01:37:05,957
Harvey Dent.

1169
01:37:06,699 --> 01:37:09,293
Who has been held up to you...

1170
01:37:09,452 --> 01:37:13,958
...as the shining example of justice!

1171
01:37:14,123 --> 01:37:17,127
We're just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of the camera.

1172
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:21,264
You have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you...

1173
01:37:21,422 --> 01:37:23,845
...tearing down this corrupt city!

1174
01:37:24,008 --> 01:37:25,635
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1175
01:37:25,802 --> 01:37:29,432
Let me tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

1176
01:37:29,597 --> 01:37:34,444
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

1177
01:37:34,602 --> 01:37:36,980
...James Gordon:

1178
01:37:37,564 --> 01:37:40,909
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent.

1179
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:42,990
He saved my boy...

1180
01:37:43,194 --> 01:37:47,620
...then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes...

1181
01:37:47,782 --> 01:37:50,410
...so that I could, to my shame...

1182
01:37:50,577 --> 01:37:54,207
...build a lie around this...

1183
01:37:54,372 --> 01:37:57,091
...fallen idol.

1184
01:37:59,377 --> 01:38:04,304
I praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child.

1185
01:38:04,507 --> 01:38:08,262
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1186
01:38:08,428 --> 01:38:12,183
It is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth...

1187
01:38:12,348 --> 01:38:16,444
...and it is time for me to resign."

1188
01:38:17,395 --> 01:38:20,740
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1189
01:38:22,525 --> 01:38:26,746
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?

1190
01:38:26,904 --> 01:38:28,577
Of all the corrupt?

1191
01:38:32,368 --> 01:38:34,621
Those men locked up
for eight years in Blackgate...

1192
01:38:34,787 --> 01:38:39,042
...and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

1193
01:38:40,084 --> 01:38:41,711
Gotham needed a hero.

1194
01:38:41,878 --> 01:38:46,099
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.

1195
01:38:48,009 --> 01:38:53,687
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...

1196
01:38:53,848 --> 01:38:56,727
...when the rules aren't
weapons any more...

1197
01:38:57,435 --> 01:39:00,905
...they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

1198
01:39:02,565 --> 01:39:05,990
One day, you may face...

1199
01:39:06,152 --> 01:39:07,825
...such a moment of crisis.

1200
01:39:07,987 --> 01:39:11,287
And in that moment,
I hope you have a friend like I did...

1201
01:39:11,949 --> 01:39:17,126
...to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!

1202
01:39:18,665 --> 01:39:21,339
Your hands look plenty filthy to me,
commissioner.

1203
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,464
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1204
01:39:28,758 --> 01:39:29,850
The rich!

1205
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,728
The oppressors of generations...

1206
01:39:32,887 --> 01:39:37,063
...who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

1207
01:39:37,225 --> 01:39:40,274
And we give it back to you...

1208
01:39:40,895 --> 01:39:43,114
...the people.

1209
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:46,113
Gotham is yours!

1210
01:39:46,567 --> 01:39:49,912
None shall interfere. Do as you please.

1211
01:39:52,156 --> 01:39:55,660
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1212
01:39:55,827 --> 01:39:57,545
Open it!

1213
01:40:05,461 --> 01:40:08,510
Step forward, those who would serve...

1214
01:40:10,091 --> 01:40:11,843
...for an army will be raised.

1215
01:40:16,097 --> 01:40:20,694
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

1216
01:40:25,398 --> 01:40:30,905
...and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure!

1217
01:40:35,491 --> 01:40:37,585
Courts will be convened.

1218
01:40:45,251 --> 01:40:47,549
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1219
01:40:52,341 --> 01:40:53,968
Blood will be shed!

1220
01:40:57,305 --> 01:40:59,979
The police will survive...

1221
01:41:00,141 --> 01:41:04,567
...as they learn to serve true justice.

1222
01:41:05,688 --> 01:41:08,191
This great city...

1223
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:11,861
...it will endure.

1224
01:41:14,572 --> 01:41:18,327
Gotham will survive!

1225
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:42,562
He says you must first fix your back.

1226
01:41:42,809 --> 01:41:43,935
How does he know?

1227
01:41:44,101 --> 01:41:45,523
He was the prison doctor.

1228
01:41:45,686 --> 01:41:49,566
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure...

1229
01:41:49,732 --> 01:41:53,657
...of powerful people,
including your masked friend.

1230
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:56,072
How?

1231
01:41:57,323 --> 01:42:01,624
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1232
01:42:03,204 --> 01:42:06,299
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1233
01:42:08,334 --> 01:42:12,009
The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...

1234
01:42:12,797 --> 01:42:14,424
...left him in perpetual agony.

1235
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:17,764
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1236
01:42:17,927 --> 01:42:21,272
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1237
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:22,727
He was born here?

1238
01:42:23,683 --> 01:42:28,154
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1239
01:42:28,896 --> 01:42:31,240
He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.

1240
01:42:31,732 --> 01:42:33,325
They were married in secret.

1241
01:42:33,484 --> 01:42:35,486
When the warlord found out...

1242
01:42:35,987 --> 01:42:39,833
...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1243
01:42:40,408 --> 01:42:42,661
But then he exiled him instead.

1244
01:42:42,827 --> 01:42:46,877
The mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release.

1245
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:51,920
But what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom.

1246
01:42:52,962 --> 01:42:54,760
She took his place in the pit.

1247
01:42:57,884 --> 01:42:59,431
And she was with child...

1248
01:42:59,594 --> 01:43:01,517
...the mercenary's child.

1249
01:43:04,098 --> 01:43:07,318
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1250
01:43:09,937 --> 01:43:15,910
One day, the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.

1251
01:43:22,658 --> 01:43:25,002
But the child had a friend...

1252
01:43:25,453 --> 01:43:30,926
...a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.

1253
01:43:31,083 --> 01:43:32,801
It was to be prized.

1254
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,712
The mother was not so lucky.

1255
01:43:37,882 --> 01:43:41,557
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

1256
01:43:52,939 --> 01:43:56,660
There's a vertebra protruding
from your back.

1257
01:43:57,026 --> 01:43:59,120
It has to be put back.

1258
01:44:04,116 --> 01:44:06,915
Stay like this until you stand.

1259
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:19,842
Did you not think I would return, Bruce?

1260
01:44:25,513 --> 01:44:27,140
I told you I was immortal.

1261
01:44:29,684 --> 01:44:31,812
I watched... I watched you die.

1262
01:44:31,978 --> 01:44:34,948
There are many forms of immortality.

1263
01:44:36,857 --> 01:44:38,325
Once, I had a wife...

1264
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,578
...my great love.

1265
01:44:42,947 --> 01:44:46,326
- She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

1266
01:44:50,371 --> 01:44:52,339
Bane is your child.

1267
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:55,005
Your heir.

1268
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:57,920
An heir to ensure
the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...

1269
01:44:58,087 --> 01:45:00,715
...to restore balance to civilization.

1270
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:01,928
No.

1271
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:05,516
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...

1272
01:45:05,678 --> 01:45:07,601
...with all your strength...

1273
01:45:07,972 --> 01:45:12,193
...all your resources,
all your moral authority.

1274
01:45:12,935 --> 01:45:15,939
And the only victory you could
achieve was a lie.

1275
01:45:16,564 --> 01:45:19,443
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1276
01:45:19,608 --> 01:45:20,734
No.

1277
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:23,029
- And must be allowed to die.
- No!

1278
01:45:29,952 --> 01:45:31,954
Yeah, just lift your head.

1279
01:45:32,371 --> 01:45:33,793
That's good.

1280
01:45:39,628 --> 01:45:40,675
No, no!

1281
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,384
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1282
01:46:18,542 --> 01:46:20,465
And now it's everyone's home.

1283
01:46:22,254 --> 01:46:25,303
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1284
01:46:54,411 --> 01:46:57,210
It's for the bus,
in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1285
01:46:57,373 --> 01:46:58,920
Any news? Is the commissioner...?

1286
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:02,428
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

1287
01:47:02,586 --> 01:47:05,385
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

1288
01:47:05,548 --> 01:47:06,891
It's good to see you.

1289
01:47:07,591 --> 01:47:11,641
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1290
01:47:17,351 --> 01:47:18,648
Why build yourself?

1291
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:25,952
- I'm not meant to die in here.
- Here, there. What's the difference?

1292
01:48:27,671 --> 01:48:31,016
I told you it could not be done.

1293
01:48:31,175 --> 01:48:32,802
You told me a child did it.

1294
01:48:34,178 --> 01:48:36,476
But no ordinary child.

1295
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,438
A child born in hell.

1296
01:48:43,771 --> 01:48:45,239
Forged from suffering.

1297
01:48:47,358 --> 01:48:49,656
Hardened by pain.

1298
01:48:51,195 --> 01:48:53,823
Not a man from privilege.

1299
01:49:12,883 --> 01:49:14,851
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1300
01:49:15,636 --> 01:49:16,728
Just waiting on Intel.

1301
01:49:22,434 --> 01:49:23,481
You have ID?

1302
01:49:24,186 --> 01:49:25,233
Of course not.

1303
01:49:25,396 --> 01:49:27,945
- Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1304
01:49:28,816 --> 01:49:31,160
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1305
01:49:31,318 --> 01:49:32,865
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1306
01:49:33,028 --> 01:49:35,702
It's our job, sir.
Now how many of you are there?

1307
01:49:35,864 --> 01:49:38,788
Well, there's dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

1308
01:49:38,951 --> 01:49:42,205
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

1309
01:49:42,371 --> 01:49:44,294
- Condition?
- Getting food and water.

1310
01:49:44,456 --> 01:49:46,754
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1311
01:49:46,917 --> 01:49:49,261
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

1312
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:52,139
Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.

1313
01:49:52,298 --> 01:49:55,518
I'm in contact with my partner
who's down there. They're just waiting.

1314
01:49:55,676 --> 01:49:59,931
- Men who haven't seen daylight in months?
- Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.

1315
01:50:00,097 --> 01:50:02,771
What about the bomb? Satellite
can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1316
01:50:03,309 --> 01:50:06,688
They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.

1317
01:50:06,854 --> 01:50:09,528
- They move it constantly.
- Good. So you know the truck?

1318
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:13,035
Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.

1319
01:50:13,402 --> 01:50:14,449
Decoy.

1320
01:50:15,988 --> 01:50:19,413
- You don't really think he's coming back?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

1321
01:50:19,575 --> 01:50:23,455
Actually, it does. You should put your
faith in something a little more real.

1322
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:26,840
- The routes don't vary much.
- Okay. What about the triggerman?

1323
01:50:26,999 --> 01:50:31,049
No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give
control of that bomb to someone else.

1324
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:35,432
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.

1325
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:39,516
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under
a warlord, like some failed state?

1326
01:50:39,678 --> 01:50:42,557
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1327
01:50:42,723 --> 01:50:47,980
- We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
- You gonna tell him what's really going on?

1328
01:50:48,145 --> 01:50:51,240
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1329
01:50:51,398 --> 01:50:53,617
There's someone you need to meet.

1330
01:50:53,942 --> 01:50:57,822
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.

1331
01:50:57,988 --> 01:50:59,160
What corporation?

1332
01:50:59,323 --> 01:51:01,701
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1333
01:51:10,751 --> 01:51:12,924
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1334
01:51:13,128 --> 01:51:15,722
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1335
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:20,352
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1336
01:51:20,511 --> 01:51:22,513
- Why?
- We built it.

1337
01:51:22,679 --> 01:51:24,181
You built the bomb?

1338
01:51:24,348 --> 01:51:28,524
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1339
01:51:28,685 --> 01:51:32,064
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1340
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:35,610
- Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1341
01:51:35,776 --> 01:51:37,699
...it becomes increasingly unstable...

1342
01:51:37,861 --> 01:51:39,408
...to the point of detonation.

1343
01:51:39,571 --> 01:51:41,323
This bomb is a time bomb.

1344
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:45,495
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

1345
01:51:45,661 --> 01:51:48,380
...or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1346
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:51,133
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1347
01:51:51,667 --> 01:51:56,138
- Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1348
01:51:56,296 --> 01:51:59,425
- Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

1349
01:51:59,591 --> 01:52:02,811
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1350
01:52:10,144 --> 01:52:11,396
Someone sold us out.

1351
01:52:13,021 --> 01:52:14,489
Go, go, go!

1352
01:52:35,794 --> 01:52:37,888
I'll die before I talk.

1353
01:52:38,589 --> 01:52:40,842
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1354
01:52:47,306 --> 01:52:49,650
There were people living upstairs.

1355
01:52:50,142 --> 01:52:52,270
Round them up for judgment...

1356
01:52:56,106 --> 01:53:00,987
...and hang them where the world can see.

1357
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:07,831
Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...

1358
01:53:07,993 --> 01:53:12,089
...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt...

1359
01:53:15,709 --> 01:53:19,759
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1360
01:53:20,214 --> 01:53:22,182
My body makes the jump.

1361
01:53:22,674 --> 01:53:26,554
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1362
01:53:29,473 --> 01:53:32,443
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1363
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:35,605
Fear is why you fail.

1364
01:53:35,896 --> 01:53:37,443
No, I'm not afraid.

1365
01:53:39,107 --> 01:53:40,609
I'm angry.

1366
01:54:09,846 --> 01:54:11,314
Bruce.

1367
01:54:12,516 --> 01:54:13,608
Why do we fall?

1368
01:54:19,648 --> 01:54:21,525
You do not fear death.

1369
01:54:22,568 --> 01:54:27,119
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

1370
01:54:27,656 --> 01:54:28,703
Why?

1371
01:54:28,865 --> 01:54:31,118
How can you move faster than possible...

1372
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:33,879
...fight longer than possible...

1373
01:54:34,162 --> 01:54:37,757
...without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?

1374
01:54:39,001 --> 01:54:40,628
The fear of death.

1375
01:54:41,336 --> 01:54:43,213
I do fear death.

1376
01:54:45,007 --> 01:54:46,975
I fear dying in here...

1377
01:54:47,759 --> 01:54:49,682
...while my city burns.

1378
01:54:50,721 --> 01:54:52,644
There's no one there to save it.

1379
01:54:54,016 --> 01:54:55,518
Then make the climb.

1380
01:55:00,564 --> 01:55:01,907
How?

1381
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,198
As the child did...

1382
01:55:09,906 --> 01:55:11,579
...without the rope.

1383
01:55:14,244 --> 01:55:16,542
Then fear will find you again.

1384
01:55:23,545 --> 01:55:25,798
Supplies for your journey?

1385
01:55:25,964 --> 01:55:28,058
That's wonderful. That's...

1386
01:55:32,596 --> 01:55:34,223
What does that mean?

1387
01:55:34,765 --> 01:55:36,017
Rise.

1388
01:55:37,351 --> 01:55:38,398
No.

1389
01:57:08,358 --> 01:57:10,281
No, there's been a mistake!

1390
01:57:10,444 --> 01:57:12,446
Take me to Bane!

1391
01:57:15,031 --> 01:57:16,704
I want to see Bane!

1392
01:57:19,953 --> 01:57:21,045
Order!

1393
01:57:21,204 --> 01:57:23,957
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1394
01:57:24,124 --> 01:57:26,252
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1395
01:57:26,626 --> 01:57:29,049
You are Philip Stryver...

1396
01:57:29,212 --> 01:57:32,716
...executive vice president
of Daggett Industries...

1397
01:57:32,883 --> 01:57:36,513
...who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat...

1398
01:57:36,678 --> 01:57:38,897
...of people less powerful than him.

1399
01:57:39,055 --> 01:57:42,150
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1400
01:57:42,392 --> 01:57:45,942
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1401
01:57:46,104 --> 01:57:48,232
Now, the choice is yours.

1402
01:57:48,398 --> 01:57:50,821
Exile or death!

1403
01:57:55,447 --> 01:57:56,869
Order!

1404
01:57:57,449 --> 01:57:58,746
Exi... Exile.

1405
01:57:59,493 --> 01:58:00,915
Sold.

1406
01:58:01,077 --> 01:58:02,829
To the man in the cold sweat.

1407
01:58:10,212 --> 01:58:11,634
You follow the thick ice.

1408
01:58:11,797 --> 01:58:13,925
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1409
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:15,683
Has anyone made it?

1410
01:58:29,105 --> 01:58:31,528
Where are they?
It's not like we have a lot of time.

1411
01:58:31,983 --> 01:58:33,109
How long?

1412
01:58:33,276 --> 01:58:35,119
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1413
01:58:35,529 --> 01:58:38,533
- We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

1414
01:58:38,698 --> 01:58:42,703
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we can
start to figure out how to bring it down.

1415
01:58:49,417 --> 01:58:50,669
That's it?

1416
01:58:53,171 --> 01:58:54,263
Foley.

1417
01:58:55,799 --> 01:58:59,724
- Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1418
01:59:04,432 --> 01:59:07,356
- Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

1419
01:59:07,519 --> 01:59:10,568
- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1420
01:59:10,730 --> 01:59:13,358
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1421
01:59:13,525 --> 01:59:15,653
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1422
01:59:15,819 --> 01:59:18,163
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1423
01:59:18,321 --> 01:59:21,450
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1424
01:59:21,616 --> 01:59:25,746
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.

1425
01:59:25,912 --> 01:59:28,461
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1426
01:59:28,623 --> 01:59:31,923
You move on Bane,
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1427
01:59:32,085 --> 01:59:36,056
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1428
01:59:36,214 --> 01:59:38,216
You think this is part of some revolution?

1429
01:59:38,383 --> 01:59:41,227
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1430
01:59:41,386 --> 01:59:44,481
Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.

1431
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:48,269
- If you still had a family here...
- This only gets fixed from inside...

1432
01:59:48,435 --> 01:59:50,028
...the city!

1433
01:59:50,353 --> 01:59:52,026
Look, Peter.

1434
01:59:52,981 --> 01:59:57,578
I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your
dress blues, but something has to be done.

1435
01:59:57,736 --> 01:59:59,784
- Sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down?

1436
01:59:59,946 --> 02:00:02,119
What goods that gonna do
when that thing blows?

1437
02:00:02,282 --> 02:00:04,751
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1438
02:00:08,914 --> 02:00:11,212
I hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.

1439
02:00:11,374 --> 02:00:12,626
How about me instead?

1440
02:00:12,792 --> 02:00:15,386
Miss Tate, I can't ask you to do that.

1441
02:00:16,338 --> 02:00:17,385
Please.

1442
02:00:18,965 --> 02:00:21,138
You little punk! What'd you take?

1443
02:00:21,301 --> 02:00:23,599
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

1444
02:00:23,762 --> 02:00:27,062
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1445
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:31,646
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

1446
02:00:37,567 --> 02:00:40,821
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.

1447
02:00:47,494 --> 02:00:49,542
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1448
02:00:58,213 --> 02:01:00,966
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1449
02:01:01,299 --> 02:01:04,473
- If you're expecting an apology, I...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1450
02:01:05,887 --> 02:01:06,934
I need your help.

1451
02:01:07,472 --> 02:01:08,940
And why would I help you?

1452
02:01:09,099 --> 02:01:11,101
For this. Clean slate.

1453
02:01:11,267 --> 02:01:13,269
You'd trust me with that?

1454
02:01:13,853 --> 02:01:15,480
After what I did to you?

1455
02:01:15,647 --> 02:01:18,571
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1456
02:01:20,193 --> 02:01:23,322
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

1457
02:01:23,738 --> 02:01:25,081
...this isn't just a tool.

1458
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:28,460
It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1459
02:01:29,369 --> 02:01:32,339
- I can't even get off this island.
- I can give you a way off...

1460
02:01:32,497 --> 02:01:34,044
...once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1461
02:01:34,207 --> 02:01:37,006
Find out where they're holding him
and take me in.

1462
02:01:40,755 --> 02:01:41,847
Why do you need Fox?

1463
02:01:42,007 --> 02:01:44,510
- To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

1464
02:01:44,676 --> 02:01:46,269
Maybe I like it this way.

1465
02:01:46,428 --> 02:01:48,055
Maybe you do...

1466
02:01:49,431 --> 02:01:51,775
...but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1467
02:01:54,352 --> 02:01:56,070
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1468
02:01:56,229 --> 02:01:57,572
I'm trying...

1469
02:01:58,398 --> 02:02:00,025
...but I need Fox.

1470
02:02:00,191 --> 02:02:01,943
As it approaches...

1471
02:02:02,736 --> 02:02:03,908
...flip the switch.

1472
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:07,620
The needle hits 200, you give me the
signal, I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1473
02:02:08,992 --> 02:02:10,619
Heads up, heads up.

1474
02:02:26,718 --> 02:02:29,016
- I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

1475
02:02:29,179 --> 02:02:32,308
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1476
02:02:34,517 --> 02:02:36,565
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1477
02:02:36,728 --> 02:02:38,446
On whose authority?

1478
02:02:38,605 --> 02:02:39,822
The people of Gotham.

1479
02:02:40,815 --> 02:02:45,742
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?

1480
02:02:45,904 --> 02:02:49,124
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1481
02:02:49,532 --> 02:02:51,125
Now, what will it be?

1482
02:02:52,327 --> 02:02:55,046
Death or exile?

1483
02:02:55,205 --> 02:02:59,961
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...

1484
02:03:00,126 --> 02:03:01,719
...you have another thing coming.

1485
02:03:04,214 --> 02:03:05,557
Death, then.

1486
02:03:05,715 --> 02:03:07,934
- Looks that way.
- Very well.

1487
02:03:08,093 --> 02:03:09,595
Death...

1488
02:03:10,929 --> 02:03:12,647
...by exile.

1489
02:03:15,225 --> 02:03:16,693
Bring her to me.

1490
02:03:23,191 --> 02:03:27,412
Hey, we're going now.
Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!

1491
02:03:27,570 --> 02:03:30,619
Hey, you hear me?
We're going now. Let's do it.

1492
02:03:34,744 --> 02:03:36,997
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

1493
02:03:37,163 --> 02:03:40,337
We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1494
02:03:42,585 --> 02:03:43,962
- Bruce.
- You okay?

1495
02:03:44,129 --> 02:03:46,507
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation,
Mr. Wayne.

1496
02:03:46,673 --> 02:03:48,346
How long until that core ignites?

1497
02:03:48,508 --> 02:03:52,354
- That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
- Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1498
02:03:53,096 --> 02:03:56,225
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1499
02:03:57,016 --> 02:03:59,269
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1500
02:03:59,435 --> 02:04:01,858
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1501
02:04:02,021 --> 02:04:06,197
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1502
02:04:08,528 --> 02:04:11,623
- I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

1503
02:04:20,915 --> 02:04:22,713
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1504
02:04:22,876 --> 02:04:24,719
He should be so lucky.

1505
02:04:30,466 --> 02:04:33,219
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1506
02:04:33,386 --> 02:04:35,263
...the triggerman sets it off.

1507
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:38,229
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

1508
02:04:38,391 --> 02:04:40,064
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1509
02:04:40,226 --> 02:04:42,979
It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.

1510
02:04:43,146 --> 02:04:44,944
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1511
02:04:45,106 --> 02:04:48,736
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

1512
02:04:49,903 --> 02:04:51,530
Remember where you parked?

1513
02:05:05,919 --> 02:05:07,387
She fly okay?

1514
02:05:08,421 --> 02:05:11,140
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

1515
02:05:11,299 --> 02:05:14,269
- Thanks.
- Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1516
02:05:54,008 --> 02:05:56,807
Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.

1517
02:06:00,723 --> 02:06:02,066
Wait, wait!

1518
02:06:03,393 --> 02:06:04,861
Ross!

1519
02:06:05,019 --> 02:06:06,396
Ross?

1520
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:09,115
- Lock it up.
- No, keep down.

1521
02:06:09,774 --> 02:06:11,367
Get down!

1522
02:06:12,986 --> 02:06:14,238
Who are you?

1523
02:06:43,641 --> 02:06:44,938
Light it up.

1524
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:06,084
- Dad, check it out.
- Honey, come take a look.

1525
02:07:16,466 --> 02:07:18,184
Impossible.

1526
02:07:18,968 --> 02:07:20,720
Keep her close.

1527
02:07:21,387 --> 02:07:23,060
He'll come for her.

1528
02:07:23,389 --> 02:07:25,141
Where's Miranda Tate?

1529
02:07:25,808 --> 02:07:27,276
Bane took her.

1530
02:07:27,477 --> 02:07:30,777
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1531
02:07:31,064 --> 02:07:33,567
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.

1532
02:07:33,733 --> 02:07:37,408
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

1533
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:39,493
When what starts?

1534
02:07:39,989 --> 02:07:41,206
War.

1535
02:08:17,068 --> 02:08:18,194
You missed a spot.

1536
02:08:21,781 --> 02:08:26,662
- If you're working alone, wear a mask.
- I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.

1537
02:08:26,828 --> 02:08:30,048
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

1538
02:08:31,749 --> 02:08:33,717
Count to five, then throw.

1539
02:08:44,095 --> 02:08:46,769
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1540
02:08:57,191 --> 02:09:00,320
- What now?
- All-out assault on Bane.

1541
02:09:00,486 --> 02:09:02,739
But you need to get people
across the bridge.

1542
02:09:02,905 --> 02:09:05,158
- Why?
- In case we fail.

1543
02:09:05,324 --> 02:09:08,043
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1544
02:09:08,202 --> 02:09:09,499
You don't need me here?

1545
02:09:09,662 --> 02:09:11,209
You've given me an army.

1546
02:09:11,372 --> 02:09:12,544
Now go.

1547
02:09:13,291 --> 02:09:14,383
Hey, thanks.

1548
02:09:14,542 --> 02:09:15,885
Don't thank me yet.

1549
02:09:16,043 --> 02:09:18,091
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1550
02:09:31,934 --> 02:09:33,652
You shouldn't have.

1551
02:09:34,604 --> 02:09:36,777
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...

1552
02:09:36,939 --> 02:09:40,318
...but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1553
02:09:40,485 --> 02:09:42,328
Wait until the fighting begins.

1554
02:09:42,487 --> 02:09:45,206
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1555
02:09:45,364 --> 02:09:46,411
To start it, throttle...

1556
02:09:48,201 --> 02:09:51,375
- I got it.
- We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1557
02:09:51,537 --> 02:09:54,290
No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear
of the blast radius.

1558
02:09:54,457 --> 02:09:57,757
- You don't stand a chance against these guys.
- With your help, I might.

1559
02:09:57,919 --> 02:10:00,297
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1560
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,973
There's more to you than that.

1561
02:10:06,636 --> 02:10:08,730
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1562
02:10:12,391 --> 02:10:13,938
Come with me.

1563
02:10:15,228 --> 02:10:16,821
Save yourself.

1564
02:10:19,065 --> 02:10:21,784
You don't owe these people any more.

1565
02:10:21,943 --> 02:10:24,071
You've given them everything.

1566
02:10:24,237 --> 02:10:25,705
Not everything.

1567
02:10:26,113 --> 02:10:27,365
Not yet.

1568
02:11:07,405 --> 02:11:09,078
Disperse!

1569
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:11,459
Disperse or be fired upon!

1570
02:11:12,868 --> 02:11:15,246
There's only one police in this town.

1571
02:11:54,243 --> 02:11:55,916
Open fire.

1572
02:12:47,129 --> 02:12:48,847
- Here it comes!
- Get ready!

1573
02:13:18,703 --> 02:13:22,799
So you came back to die with your city.

1574
02:13:23,124 --> 02:13:26,924
No. I came back to stop you.

1575
02:13:37,972 --> 02:13:39,019
Now!

1576
02:13:51,944 --> 02:13:53,571
That's impossible.

1577
02:13:55,448 --> 02:13:57,075
Cut over to Fifth!

1578
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:13,132
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1579
02:14:13,299 --> 02:14:15,893
You, come with me. You too.

1580
02:14:16,093 --> 02:14:19,142
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

1581
02:14:19,305 --> 02:14:21,148
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1582
02:14:21,307 --> 02:14:23,981
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

1583
02:14:24,143 --> 02:14:28,023
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1584
02:14:28,189 --> 02:14:30,908
You do two blocks and you get back
to the bus, all right?

1585
02:14:31,066 --> 02:14:32,943
Go, go, go!

1586
02:14:33,110 --> 02:14:34,487
Is he back?

1587
02:14:35,863 --> 02:14:37,206
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1588
02:15:59,822 --> 02:16:01,369
Cover the doors!

1589
02:16:04,535 --> 02:16:06,082
Where's your trigger?!

1590
02:16:06,412 --> 02:16:08,039
Where is it?!

1591
02:16:08,956 --> 02:16:11,800
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1592
02:16:11,959 --> 02:16:14,587
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1593
02:16:15,963 --> 02:16:18,682
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1594
02:16:26,473 --> 02:16:28,601
Tell me where the trigger is.

1595
02:16:29,101 --> 02:16:32,696
Then you have my permission to die.

1596
02:16:44,825 --> 02:16:46,543
I broke you.

1597
02:16:47,828 --> 02:16:49,705
How have you come back?

1598
02:16:49,872 --> 02:16:54,378
You think you're the only one who could
learn the strength to escape?

1599
02:16:54,543 --> 02:16:55,840
Where's the trigger?

1600
02:16:56,503 --> 02:16:58,847
But I never escaped.

1601
02:16:59,715 --> 02:17:01,262
But the child.

1602
02:17:03,052 --> 02:17:05,100
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1603
02:17:05,262 --> 02:17:07,640
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1604
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,903
I am.

1605
02:17:13,354 --> 02:17:15,777
And though I'm not ordinary...

1606
02:17:17,107 --> 02:17:18,825
...I am a citizen.

1607
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:39,592
Miranda?

1608
02:17:42,466 --> 02:17:43,513
Why?

1609
02:17:44,259 --> 02:17:45,602
Talia.

1610
02:17:46,428 --> 02:17:49,477
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

1611
02:17:50,307 --> 02:17:53,732
...the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

1612
02:17:54,186 --> 02:17:55,233
...Bane.

1613
02:18:03,195 --> 02:18:04,367
Goodbye.

1614
02:18:06,615 --> 02:18:08,743
I climbed out of the pit.

1615
02:18:14,707 --> 02:18:16,505
I found my father...

1616
02:18:19,461 --> 02:18:22,590
...and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1617
02:18:23,465 --> 02:18:25,217
But by that time...

1618
02:18:26,343 --> 02:18:30,098
...the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.

1619
02:18:30,264 --> 02:18:31,481
My protector.

1620
02:18:35,477 --> 02:18:36,979
The League took us in.

1621
02:18:37,354 --> 02:18:38,901
Trained us.

1622
02:18:39,273 --> 02:18:42,072
But my father could not accept Bane.

1623
02:18:42,609 --> 02:18:44,361
He saw only a monster.

1624
02:18:44,528 --> 02:18:50,410
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1625
02:18:50,826 --> 02:18:53,955
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1626
02:18:54,121 --> 02:18:58,672
His only crime was that he loved me.

1627
02:19:00,461 --> 02:19:03,385
I could not forgive my father.

1628
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:09,683
Until you murdered him.

1629
02:19:27,529 --> 02:19:33,002
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

1630
02:19:33,285 --> 02:19:36,915
Innocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1631
02:19:39,541 --> 02:19:42,590
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1632
02:19:54,765 --> 02:19:59,646
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.

1633
02:20:01,146 --> 02:20:02,238
You see...

1634
02:20:03,774 --> 02:20:05,117
...it's the slow knife...

1635
02:20:05,275 --> 02:20:07,903
...the knife that takes its time.

1636
02:20:11,698 --> 02:20:12,915
The knife...

1637
02:20:13,742 --> 02:20:17,337
...that waits years without forgetting...

1638
02:20:17,621 --> 02:20:20,921
...then slips quietly between the bones.

1639
02:20:21,959 --> 02:20:23,256
That's the knife...

1640
02:20:24,586 --> 02:20:25,929
...that cuts deepest.

1641
02:20:26,088 --> 02:20:27,214
Please.

1642
02:20:34,930 --> 02:20:36,932
Maybe your knife...

1643
02:20:37,933 --> 02:20:39,355
...was too slow.

1644
02:20:39,518 --> 02:20:40,940
The truck is under attack.

1645
02:20:41,103 --> 02:20:44,858
Gordon.
You gave him a way to block my signal.

1646
02:20:45,023 --> 02:20:46,070
No matter.

1647
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:50,704
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1648
02:20:55,075 --> 02:20:56,577
Come on!

1649
02:20:57,202 --> 02:20:58,624
This way!

1650
02:21:04,209 --> 02:21:06,632
Stay there! What are you doing?

1651
02:21:07,087 --> 02:21:10,432
Blake, MCU!
I'm getting these boys to safety!

1652
02:21:10,591 --> 02:21:11,934
You'll get us all killed!

1653
02:21:12,092 --> 02:21:15,096
If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!

1654
02:21:15,262 --> 02:21:18,641
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

1655
02:21:18,807 --> 02:21:21,981
Detective, if you take one step forward
we will shoot you!

1656
02:21:22,144 --> 02:21:25,739
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1657
02:21:27,816 --> 02:21:31,116
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.

1658
02:21:34,364 --> 02:21:38,335
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

1659
02:21:39,661 --> 02:21:43,382
Don't kill him,
I want him to feel the heat.

1660
02:21:44,124 --> 02:21:49,005
Feel the fire of 12
million souls you failed.

1661
02:21:54,927 --> 02:21:56,474
Goodbye, my friend.

1662
02:22:04,561 --> 02:22:05,938
Goodbye.

1663
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:09,984
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1664
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:19,952
Shoot them.

1665
02:22:20,619 --> 02:22:22,087
Shoot them all.

1666
02:22:31,296 --> 02:22:34,926
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1667
02:22:37,844 --> 02:22:40,063
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1668
02:22:47,896 --> 02:22:49,944
About the whole no-guns thing...

1669
02:22:50,899 --> 02:22:53,948
...I'm not sure I feel as strongly
about it as you do.

1670
02:23:07,332 --> 02:23:08,959
Pull up.

1671
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:13,092
Stay level.

1672
02:23:25,475 --> 02:23:28,775
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1673
02:23:30,605 --> 02:23:33,609
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

1674
02:23:33,859 --> 02:23:37,113
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

1675
02:23:37,821 --> 02:23:41,291
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walking out there.

1676
02:23:42,117 --> 02:23:44,211
Please do not shoot me!

1677
02:23:46,163 --> 02:23:47,289
Shoot at his feet.

1678
02:23:57,299 --> 02:23:59,643
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1679
02:23:59,801 --> 02:24:01,895
Detective! Please stop!

1680
02:24:02,471 --> 02:24:05,566
Please, detective! Stop!

1681
02:24:05,724 --> 02:24:07,567
Stop walking!

1682
02:24:08,435 --> 02:24:11,154
Blow it! Do it!

1683
02:24:22,449 --> 02:24:24,827
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 10 minutes.

1684
02:24:35,796 --> 02:24:38,094
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1685
02:24:38,256 --> 02:24:40,725
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1686
02:24:42,010 --> 02:24:43,557
You idiots!

1687
02:24:43,845 --> 02:24:45,643
You sons of bitches!

1688
02:24:45,806 --> 02:24:47,558
You're killing us!

1689
02:24:47,724 --> 02:24:49,351
Yeah, follow your orders!

1690
02:24:49,726 --> 02:24:52,024
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.

1691
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:56,738
It's on my side.

1692
02:25:44,698 --> 02:25:47,827
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back
on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!

1693
02:25:47,993 --> 02:25:51,167
- Back on the bus!
- There's nowhere to go.

1694
02:25:51,705 --> 02:25:52,752
On the bus!

1695
02:26:49,638 --> 02:26:51,766
You've got to turn the truck east!

1696
02:26:56,686 --> 02:26:58,438
Stay straight!

1697
02:27:30,178 --> 02:27:33,557
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1698
02:27:40,313 --> 02:27:43,157
Fox showed me how to override
the reactor.

1699
02:27:46,903 --> 02:27:48,155
Oh, dear.

1700
02:27:51,866 --> 02:27:55,211
Including the emergency flood.

1701
02:28:11,595 --> 02:28:13,518
There's no way...

1702
02:28:14,431 --> 02:28:15,683
...this bomb...

1703
02:28:16,558 --> 02:28:18,105
...will be stopped.

1704
02:28:19,311 --> 02:28:20,437
What are you doing?

1705
02:28:20,604 --> 02:28:22,982
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!

1706
02:28:23,148 --> 02:28:24,445
It's an atom bomb!

1707
02:28:24,608 --> 02:28:27,282
Think they need to hear that?
Let them die without hope? Come on!

1708
02:28:28,194 --> 02:28:29,867
Prepare yourselves.

1709
02:28:31,573 --> 02:28:33,621
My father's work...

1710
02:28:34,868 --> 02:28:36,541
...is done.

1711
02:28:42,334 --> 02:28:45,258
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay!

1712
02:28:45,712 --> 02:28:47,931
Set it to fly out
over the water, then eject?

1713
02:28:48,089 --> 02:28:49,716
No autopilot.

1714
02:28:51,343 --> 02:28:54,722
You could've gone anywhere, been anything.
But you came back here.

1715
02:28:54,888 --> 02:28:56,014
So did you.

1716
02:28:56,473 --> 02:28:58,521
I guess we're both suckers.

1717
02:29:06,191 --> 02:29:09,035
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1718
02:29:09,194 --> 02:29:11,788
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1719
02:29:11,946 --> 02:29:13,118
A hero can be anyone.

1720
02:29:13,281 --> 02:29:16,205
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring...

1721
02:29:16,368 --> 02:29:20,248
...as putting a coat around a young boy's
shoulders to let him know...

1722
02:29:20,413 --> 02:29:22,211
...the world hadn't ended.

1723
02:29:39,933 --> 02:29:41,401
Bruce Wayne?

1724
02:29:54,489 --> 02:29:57,618
Come on! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, Father.

1725
02:30:16,886 --> 02:30:18,763
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1726
02:30:19,097 --> 02:30:22,021
- No.
- No, that's Batman!

1727
02:31:10,231 --> 02:31:11,528
That's detonation!

1728
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:20,913
It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!

1729
02:31:40,762 --> 02:31:43,606
"I see a beautiful city...

1730
02:31:43,765 --> 02:31:45,893
...and a brilliant people...

1731
02:31:46,142 --> 02:31:48,144
...rising from this abyss.

1732
02:31:49,354 --> 02:31:53,359
I see the lives for which
I lay down my life...

1733
02:31:53,775 --> 02:31:54,992
...peaceful...

1734
02:31:55,735 --> 02:31:58,989
...useful, prosperous and happy.

1735
02:32:01,449 --> 02:32:05,079
I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...

1736
02:32:06,913 --> 02:32:10,087
...and in the hearts
of their descendants...

1737
02:32:10,917 --> 02:32:12,635
...generations hence.

1738
02:32:15,338 --> 02:32:19,559
It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1739
02:32:20,426 --> 02:32:22,394
...than I have ever done.

1740
02:32:23,429 --> 02:32:27,935
It is a far, far better
rest that I go to...

1741
02:32:30,854 --> 02:32:32,572
...than I have ever known."

1742
02:32:50,915 --> 02:32:52,337
I'm so sorry.

1743
02:32:52,709 --> 02:32:54,427
I failed you.

1744
02:32:56,462 --> 02:32:58,089
You trusted me...

1745
02:32:59,674 --> 02:33:00,800
...and I failed you.

1746
02:33:04,929 --> 02:33:06,727
Can I change your mind...

1747
02:33:09,058 --> 02:33:10,981
...about quitting the force?

1748
02:33:11,895 --> 02:33:15,741
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1749
02:33:16,107 --> 02:33:19,657
You were right, and I can't take it.
The injustice.

1750
02:33:19,861 --> 02:33:24,162
I mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1751
02:33:24,365 --> 02:33:25,457
They know.

1752
02:33:27,368 --> 02:33:29,086
It was the Batman.

1753
02:33:47,138 --> 02:33:50,733
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.

1754
02:33:50,892 --> 02:33:54,738
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.

1755
02:33:54,896 --> 02:33:58,366
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...

1756
02:33:58,524 --> 02:34:02,870
...and the remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1757
02:34:04,322 --> 02:34:09,203
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...

1758
02:34:09,369 --> 02:34:13,090
...they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1759
02:34:13,247 --> 02:34:17,047
...and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1760
02:34:18,711 --> 02:34:22,966
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1761
02:34:23,549 --> 02:34:28,020
My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.

1762
02:34:28,179 --> 02:34:29,601
Blake, John.

1763
02:34:29,889 --> 02:34:33,143
- Nothing here.
- Try my legal name.

1764
02:34:36,562 --> 02:34:39,361
You should use your full name.
I like that name.

1765
02:34:39,524 --> 02:34:41,401
- Robin.
- Thanks.

1766
02:34:41,567 --> 02:34:43,740
Why worry about
the stabilization software?

1767
02:34:43,903 --> 02:34:45,905
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1768
02:34:46,072 --> 02:34:49,872
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1769
02:34:50,034 --> 02:34:54,164
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1770
02:34:54,330 --> 02:34:55,923
Check the ID on the patch.

1771
02:34:59,002 --> 02:35:00,595
Bruce Wayne.

1772
02:35:01,462 --> 02:35:03,760
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1773
02:35:03,923 --> 02:35:05,363
They better leave no stone unturned.

1774
02:35:05,508 --> 02:35:08,933
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.
