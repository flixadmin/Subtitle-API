1
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,118
Where did it all begin?

2
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:12,785
Where did this begin?

3
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:17,312
In the past?

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,710
In the future?

5
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,383
Who can say where anything begins?

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,210
Welcome to the future.

7
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:35,357
I want all this sick shit
to stop happening!

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,420
Will we ever be able to know
the origin of it all?

9
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,985
Or will there always be something...

10
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:47,053
something that came before?

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,210
And before that,

12
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:50,887
and before that.

13
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:55,335
Is there a beginning and an end?

14
00:00:56,088 --> 00:01:00,508
Or is everything connected
in one endless loop?

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,050
Do the words "beginning" and "end"

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,760
describe the same exact moment?

17
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,048
Mikkel?

18
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:10,957
Mikkel!

25
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,962
Good morning.

26
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,480
Good morning, sleepyhead.

27
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,758
So?

28
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:39,458
- What are your plans today?
- Uh, I'm going to the lake.

29
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,405
You know there's
going to be a storm, right?

30
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,205
- Morning.
- Morning.

31
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:53,092
Today's Katharina and Ulrich's party.

32
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:56,222
- Don't get back too late again, okay?
- Sure.

33
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:00,423
Are you sure you don't
want to come with?

34
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,705
Anyone want coffee?

35
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:13,838
Fuck.

36
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,420
All right, got to go.

37
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:38,255
Are you okay, Papa?

38
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:41,113
Yes, I'm good.

39
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,650
Everything's all right.

40
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,010
I just had déjà vu.

41
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,882
Okay. See you later.

42
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:29,122
Don't you think it'd be good
if you got out once in a while?

43
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:35,428
Couldn't you give it a try at least?

44
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,030
Hm?

45
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,092
For me.

46
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,652
I still have to finish my painting.

47
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,590
20 June 2019

48
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:22,092
The day before Michael commits suicide

49
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,207
Mm.

50
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,103
Uh-huh.

51
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,705
What is it?

52
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:21,957
Hm?

53
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:23,207
Hm.

54
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,875
I've got so much to do today.

55
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,547
My period is starting
and I haven't shaved in ages.

56
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,420
- I'm sorry.
- You know I don't care.

57
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,460
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Yeah.

58
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,087
Ulrich, I can't.

59
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,432
Couldn't you just knock for once?

60
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,690
I'm sick, I think.

61
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,362
I've got red spots all over.

62
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,303
Maybe it's dengue fever?

63
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,010
Come here.

64
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,545
Shit!

65
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,263
You've got rubella.

66
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:04,302
Of all the days for this,
you had to choose this one?

67
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
Grr!

68
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,847
Come on, let's go to the doctor.

69
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,255
<i>Murder in Marburg

<i>Search for 2 fugitive perps still on</i>

71
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,980
Are you coming later?

72
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,016
Are you coming to the hotel for lunch?

73
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,127
Yes, of course. Yeah. Mm.

74
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,370
Is everything all right?

75
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:46,297
Yes.

76
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,980
Are you sure?

77
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:50,383
Mm.

78
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,020
See you later.

79
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,457
Hey.

80
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,042
Where are the kids?

81
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,960
I was at the nursing home.

82
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,747
Are we going to keep doing this?

83
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:42,948
Are you going to continue
to not believe a word I say?

84
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,505
Say something.

85
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:59,668
Maybe that's the reason
all this has happened.

86
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:05,512
I get nothing from you. Nothing.

87
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:09,997
It's like you're dead in there.

88
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:15,468
I think I might...

89
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:20,455
I think it's best if I go alone
to the Nielsens' tonight.

90
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,923
Know about the woman
who drowned here?

91
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,835
Knock it off!

92
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:48,632
When the water is clear,
you can still see her dress down there.

93
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:50,888
And sometimes,

94
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,572
you can feel her hands on
your feet when you swim by.

95
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:56,047
Oh, but that's not all there is.

96
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,590
When she's hungry, she'll even...

97
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,877
pull people down with her.

98
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,263
Ah!

99
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:11,105
You're an arsehole!

100
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,165
Ha-ha, very funny.

101
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,955
Are you coming tonight?

102
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,627
I think so.

103
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:59,172
Sometimes I wonder if my parents
are actually happy together.

104
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:04,483
Or if parents just learn
to put up with each other.

105
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,625
Are yours happy?

106
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,150
I don't know.

107
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:40,338
What's that?

108
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:43,667
Looks pretty old.

109
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,257
That's Saint Christopher.

110
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:53,713
The patron saint of travellers.

111
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,385
Don't ask.

112
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,513
Hey, Jonas. Weren't you
going to the lake?

113
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:40,788
Martha and Magnus left a while ago.

114
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,772
Ultimate fist bump?

115
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:49,757
Don't touch that little pest.
He's got rubella.

116
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,752
Where's your bike?

117
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:55,125
Do you want a ride?

118
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:59,007
- See you tonight, then.
- Someone will be happy to see you.

119
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,358
And, I mean, it's not Magnus.

120
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,920
- Ulrich.
- Why?

121
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,625
Everyone knows that Martha
has a huge crush on Jonas.

122
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:09,763
Stop it. Come on, we'll
give you a ride to the lake.

123
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:12,755
- No, that's all right. Really.
- All right.

124
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:15,078
- Okay.
- Get back to it, Romeo.

125
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,513
Good Lord.

126
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:02,343
- Magnus.
- You... you weren't moving.

127
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:04,531
I... I thought you weren't breathing.

128
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:06,736
And he said he saw a dead body, and I...

129
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,250
Well, still breathing.

130
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,507
Cool.

131

133
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:46,755
I...

134
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:49,772
I was just thinking...

135
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:55,418
wouldn't you love to know
what was coming next?

136
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,468
You mean the future?

137
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:08,658
Yeah, or...

138
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:13,045
maybe just in the next 5 minutes.

139
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:15,673
I...

140
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,927
sometimes get this feeling...

141
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,750
like something's happening.

142
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,710
You know?

143
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:31,013
Attack!

144
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:41,672
Fuck.

145
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:44,915

146
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,207
I have to go.

147
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:50,882
Where to?

148
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:54,923
We gave Grandma Ines
a tablet for her birthday.

149
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,758
- I'm supposed to teach her how to use it.
- Okay.

150
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:01,883
So...

151
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,593
I'll be there later.

152
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,028
Jonas.

153
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,088
Why do you have a raincoat with you?

154
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:15,353
Because it's supposed to rain later.

155
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,500
See you.

156
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,002
Weren't you leaving?

157
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,313
Are you okay?

158
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:32,958
I thought I had more time.

159
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,347
Why does everyone say that?

160
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,705
To "have time".

161
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,405
How can we say that
when it's time that has us?

162
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,658
Did something happen?

163
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,250
You seem different.

164
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:15,912
I want to tell you something.

165
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:20,375
I've wanted to for a while.

166
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,960
You and I are perfect for each other.

167
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,202
Never believe anything else.

168
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:33,148
I have to go now.

169
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,803

- Hello.

170
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,810
Did the long ride strain you?

171
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:22,133
I hope you guys have
a fantastic anniversary.

172
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:25,053
Crazy, isn't it?
It's already been 25 years.

173
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,940
Thank you for the glasses,
Hannah.

174
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,047
Well, no problem at all.

175
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,838
Yeah, who would've thought?

176
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:38,147
25 years.

177
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,380
- I have to pee.
- Go against that tree over there.

178
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:56,122
Could he use your bathroom?

179
00:21:57,422 --> 00:21:58,692
Hannah?

180
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:01,492
Hello?

181
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,382
- Go into the woods, then.
- No, sure. Sorry.

182
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:09,343
It's... it's right next to the entrance.

183
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:14,272
I think I just had déjà vu or something.

184
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:18,165
- Mikkel has grown so much.
- He eats like an ogre.

185
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:21,455
- Takes after his mother.
- Really?

186
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:19,763
- Another hit?
- Uh-uh.

187
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:22,975
- Later, then.
- See you. Martha.

188
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,918
Um...

189
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,915
I'm sorry I can't come over later,
but we're doing dinner.

190
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:34,045
My mother and the hotel...
I couldn't find a way to get out of it.

191
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,160
I just wanted to let you know.

192
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:38,838
It's okay.

193
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:40,462
And... I...

194
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,757
I really like...

195
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:45,585
your hair that way.

196
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:48,012
I mean, you look good.

197
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,375
With your hair.

198
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:54,093
Oh, shit. You know what I mean.

199
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:56,955
Well, um...

200
00:24:58,088 --> 00:24:59,688
see you tomorrow.

201
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:02,407
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

Wöller, it's me.

204
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:34,087
I want you to look into
something if you can.

Hello, Martha.

210
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,050
- Hey.
- Hi.

211
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:05,267
Glad you could be here.

212
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,435
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, thanks.

213
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:12,672
- Hey! Well?
- Hey.

214
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,958
It was going to be a garden party
but this seemed much cosier.

215
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:18,917
I have tiramisu for later.

216
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:21,755
Oh, this is my favourite song.
I have to dance.

217
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:24,108
Oh!

218
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:26,418
- The champagne?
- Under the table.

219
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:29,585
- Oh, that's great.
- Magnus, we're so proud of you.

220
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:33,962
I think a driver's license
is the only logical next step.

221
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,297
- No.
- Yeah.

222
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,420
- Really?
- Of course.

223
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:39,415
- Charlotte!
- Awesome!

224
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,415
- Here. But you have to dance.
- No.

225
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,835
- Yes! Come on.
- No, Katharina, please!

226
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,548
- Hey.
- Hey.

227
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:47,842
So...

228
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,418
you know where this goes?

229
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,955
There. Over there.

230
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,343
Where's Peter?

231
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:59,052
He's under the weather.

232
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:02,008
And Michael?

233
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,478
Something like that.

234
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,170
- I'll take this over.
- Okay.

235
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:09,295
Champagne!

236
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,960

239
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:16,877
Come on, live a little.

240
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:20,172
Glad you made it.

241
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:22,955

00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,483
I thought I heard you come in.

249
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Aren't you supposed to be
at the Nielsens'?

250
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:20,962
Did anything happen?

251
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:31,423
Hey.

252
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,478

253
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,990

00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,093
I know, Dad.

255
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:09,995
What do you know?

256
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,840
I know everything.

257
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:15,963

00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,668

00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:38,587
- What made you just say that here?
- Because I know.

261
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,012
I know it all.

262
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:49,607
I know that your real name
is Mikkel Nielsen, Dad.

263
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:56,835

00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:45,375
- By the North Sea.
- Okay, I'll take you up. Come on.

276
00:31:45,463 --> 00:31:47,059
I used to love that dress.

277

Oh, '80s fashion. My God!

278

And...

279
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,960
- Sleep tight. Good night.
- Until I'm asleep, could you stay here?

280
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:17,362
Scoot over.

281
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,558
So you're from the future, then?

282
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,000
And why are you here now?

283
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:41,287
I need to ask you for something.

284
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,005
What?

285
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:48,563
Don't do it.

286
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:51,117
Don't do what?

287
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:55,148
It's Ulrich's and Katharina's
anniversary.

288
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:58,913
Of course you didn't go.
I mean, you chose to stay home.

289
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,488
Something was different, though.

290
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,627
I should've known
something was wrong.

291
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:08,213
Jonas, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

292
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,207
Don't lie to me, okay?

293
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:12,457
I saw it. God damn it!

294
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:17,088
I know you're going to hang
yourself in your studio.

295
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:22,787
Have you written the letter yet?

296
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:24,835
What letter?

297
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,612
The letter you wrote to me.

298
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,615
Not to me, my younger self.

299
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:40,165
The one marked "Do not open
before 4 November 10:13 p.m."

300
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,190
<i>Do not open before
4 November, 10:13 P.M.</i>

301
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,455
Exactly to the minute
when you disappear.

302
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,550
I'm here so that you don't do it.

303
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:05,612
It's intertwined.

304
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,265
Like an endless loop.

305
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,955
But when you...
when you kill yourself...

306
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:14,515
that's where it begins.

307
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,900
Promise me you won't do it.

308
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,785
Papa, you have to promise that.

309
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,380
Please!

310
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:47,255
Promise!

311
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:12,235
You forgot this at the lake.

312
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:15,763
I put it on a string.

313
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,085
Thank you.

314
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,915
I thought about what you
said at the lake today.

315
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:41,895
About Grandma's and the Internet?

316
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:01,845
Well, I think you're right.

317
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,090
Okay.

318
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,510
The night that you disappeared...

319
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,605
you were here and then
you were just gone.

320
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,410
Did you return to the cave?

321
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,100
And was the passage still there?

322
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,750
I didn't find it.

323
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:09,555
Someone took me there.

324
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:12,297
Who?

325
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,590
You.

326
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,288
What do you mean?

327
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:29,314
- We were at the caves.
- What'll you give me for it?

328
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:30,503
An arse-kicking.

329
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,378
What's in here is worth 500.

330
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,053
But I'll let you have it for 200.
Your dad's loaded anyway.

331
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,380
Cut the bullshit! Yeah.

332
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:41,655
Now it's mine. Jackpot!

333
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,892
Then there was a strange sound.

334
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,283
What was that?

335
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:51,383
We were sure someone was there.

336
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:53,383
Someone over there?

337
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:54,633
Shit.

338
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:58,092
What's this?

339
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,732
Shit. What's going on?

340
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,510
What's wrong with the lights?

341
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,460
Come on, run!

342
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,547
Now!

343
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:11,382
Let's go!

344
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,340
We ran. Then I lost you.

345
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:28,018
I turned around and you were gone.

346
00:38:31,463 --> 00:38:33,833
But suddenly, you were back again.

347
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:35,763
Quick.

348
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:38,835
Let's go.

349
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:43,512
You said there was
something out there, far off.

350
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,418
Something evil.

351
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:48,705
You said we had to go into the cave.

352
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:51,587
You took me all the way back to the door

353
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,562
and through the tunnel.

354
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:55,672
I was so scared.

355
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:57,875
But you held my hand.

356
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:01,127
And you said we had to
stay there all night.

357
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:05,492
But everything would be
all right in the morning.

358
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:09,165
And when I woke up you were gone.

359
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:16,212
All these years I've tried to understand

360
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:18,187
why you would do that.

361
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:23,005
But then, after a while,
it all started to fade away.

362
00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:26,092
It became unreal, like a dream.

363
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:32,272
But that can't be right.

364
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,665
I never did that.

365
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,010
I saw myself today.

366
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,628
Mikkel.

367
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,550
It's coming back now, this jacket, you.

368
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:50,407
Like it's all fixed.

369
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:55,415
Maybe you're not here to stop me.

370
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,918
But rather to show me
what it is I have to do.

371
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,210
Maybe you only show me the letter
so I'm aware what's in it.

372
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,605
That I can go and you live on.

373
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:10,545
No, that's not it. That's not it!

374
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,460
Adam said I could
prevent it all from starting.

375
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:16,547
If you don't kill yourself
none of this will happen.

376
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:21,295
But if none of this happens,
you won't be born.

377
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,710
And maybe your role in all this
is much greater than you think.

378
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,802
And perhaps...

379
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,460
I'm just a tiny section of a huge
tumour that is much bigger

380
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:36,628
than any of us can imagine.

381
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,708
- Someone said that to me already.
- Who?

382
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:46,412
I did.

383
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:52,657
God doesn't err.

384
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:54,798
He has a plan.

385
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:57,383
For all of us.

386
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,420
I have waited for this moment
for a very long time.

387
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,732
Who are you?

388
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:17,875
Are you with Adam?

389
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:20,123
There are two sides out there.

390
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:24,162
He is the darkness.
I don't follow him, I follow the light.

391
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,160
He lied to you.

392
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,795
He led you back here

393
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,654
to ensure it all happens
exactly as it always has.

394
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:32,523
No, that's not right.

395
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,700
Adam wants this too!

396
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,042
No, he does not.

397
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:42,551
He doesn't want to fix things,
he wants to destroy them forever.

398
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:47,103
Your role in all this
is much greater than you think.

399
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,672
You alone can finally stop all this.

400
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:52,127
What are you saying?

401
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:55,762
You have to fight yourself.

402
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,587
Fight Adam.

403
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:02,362
But if I don't exist,
if I'm never born, then...

404
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,290
then how could Adam ever come?

405
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:08,307
I've seen the world without you.

406
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,030
Trust me...

407
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,080
it's not what you're expecting.

408
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,420
There are moments
when we must understand

409
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:21,505
that the decisions we make influence
more than just our own fates.

410
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:24,048
It's not just about you and Mikkel.

411
00:42:25,255 --> 00:42:27,005
It's about everyone.

412
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:28,418
Your mother,

413
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,455
your friends,

414
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,630
Martha.

415
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,460
You alone can save them.

416
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:38,792
What are you saying?

417
00:42:43,672 --> 00:42:45,932
We all have to make sacrifices.

418
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:48,692
Your father has to make sacrifices too.

419
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:58,763
It's okay.

420
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:18,642
This the apocalypse, then?

421
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,210
It's a bit disappointing.

422
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:30,923
I thought it would be louder than this.

423
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,488
Gaudier.

424
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:46,048
If the world ended tomorrow
and everything started over...

425
00:44:48,713 --> 00:44:50,523
what would you wish for?

426
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:55,042
A world without Winden.

427
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:02,662
And you?

428
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:19,543
<i>"Dear Jonas,</i>

429
00:49:19,805 --> 00:49:21,674
<i>by the time you read this,</i>

430
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:24,523
<i>everything will have already
happened, irrevocably.</i>

431
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,797
<i>It can't be changed anymore.</i>

432
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,907
<i>I would have liked to
explain things to you sooner,</i>

433
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:35,548
<i>but I hope once you understand
how everything is connected,</i>

434
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:38,287
<i>you will understand my decision.</i>

435
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:41,555
<i>The truth is a strange thing.</i>

436
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,457
<i>You can try to suppress it,
but it will always find its way</i>

437
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:47,667
<i>to the surface.</i>

438
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,548
<i>We make a lie into our truth
in order to survive.</i>

439
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:56,595
<i>We try to forget,</i>

440
00:49:57,005 --> 00:49:59,085
<i>until we can't anymore.</i>

441
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:03,092
<i>We don't even know half
the mysteries of this world.</i>

442
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,908
<i>We're wanderers in the darkness."</i>

443
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:18,888
You could've told him.

444
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:22,513
Adam, you could've told him
what his function is in all this.

445
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:25,188
What journey you've
really sent him on.

446
00:50:27,463 --> 00:50:30,883
It's not long before the last cycle.

447
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,210
Magnus, we all have to make sacrifices.
