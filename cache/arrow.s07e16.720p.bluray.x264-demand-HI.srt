Damn it, Zoe.

324
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,555
I knew you were involved
with the canaries, but...

325
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,791
I didn't think you were
one of them.

326
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,997
Not only did you not
stay away from my daughter,

327
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,833
but you brought Roy
into this.

328
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,394
I didn't think you
were alive.

329
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,950
Nice to see you, too.

330
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,635
What are you doing slumming
it in Star City anyway?

331
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,838
Rene: I still know you're
looking for the bombs.

332
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,036
And you need to stop.

333
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,800
You already know that galaxy's
behind all this, don't you?

334
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,150
This is the part where you're
supposed to tell me I'm wrong,

335
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,960
that my father,
a former vigilante,

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,032
is not working with
the bad guys.

337
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,440
The bomb plans you saw...

338
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,477
they're phase one of
what we're calling

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,791
the Star City
reformation project.

340
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,917
- Oh, my god.
- You're part of this.

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
It's not what you think it is.

342
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Roy: Really?

343
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,936
Because wiping out
an entire city sounds

344
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,996
a lot like genocide.

345
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,471
Rene: Look, this isn't about
destroying Star City.

346
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,678
It's about expanding what
we've done in The Glades.

347
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,352
And with galaxy's help,
I'll be able to do that

348
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
within a fraction
of the time.

349
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,832
Everyone will be
safely evacuated

350
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,240
before anything happens.

351
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,834
How is it you
got all the age

352
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,673
and none of
the wisdom?

353
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,911
They're playing
you, Rene.

354
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,475
Galaxy is just a
front for Eden Corps.

355
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,153
Eden Corps doesn't
exist anymore.

356
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,720
And even if it did,

357
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,360
if galaxy was run by
a terrorist organization,

358
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
I would know.

359
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,159
Just like you knew
galaxy was paying cops

360
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,550
to fake
Felicity's death?

361
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,235
Yeah. Yeah, she's
still alive, Rene.

362
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,437
Galaxy's not the enemy.

363
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,831
They've been nothing
but supportive,

364
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,434
altruistic.

365
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,920
SweeTheart,

366
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
you've seen it.

367
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,597
Yeah, but I wouldn't
allow myself

368
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,353
to be blinded by it.

369
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
You always told me to
rely on my instincts.

370
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,350
What happened to yours?

371
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,193
You need to open
your eyes, Rene.

372
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,999
I did...

373
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,438
And I used to believe
being a vigilante

374
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,273
helped solve problems.

375
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,838
You and I both know
it's not that simple.

376
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Please just let this go.

377
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,394
The father I knew,
the hero...

378
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,476
Would not
have let this go.

379
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,156
You may have
forgotten that hero,

380
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,594
but I haven't.

381
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,856
William:
Thank you for seeing us

382
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,314
on such short notice,
Mr. Dale.

383
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,517
Dale: When the ceo of
Harris Consolidated

384
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,353
comes calling,
you answer.

385
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,557
And please
call me Keven.

386
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,877
Can I get you or your
assistant anything?

387
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,957
Actually,
I'm his associate.

388
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,434
My associate, Ms. Margo,
and I would love

389
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,636
some coffee.

390
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,240
3 cups of
the house favorite.

391
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,515
So how can I be of service?

392
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,936
I've heard through
the grapevine that

393
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,031
you've been working with
halcyon pharmaceuticals.

394
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,679
That's supposed
to be hush-hush.

395
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,798
I'm evaluating their firm
for a potential acquisition,

396
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,792
and I was hoping
for some intel.

397
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,031
Before I share my
secrets,

398
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,316
how about you share
one of yours?

399
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,120
How were you able to
get Harris Consolidated

400
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,072
off the ground
so quickly?

401
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,880
Oh, I wish I could say it
was some genius plan,

402
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,350
but, really, it was luck.

403
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,955
An angel investor backed me.

404
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,072
You have to tell
me who.

405
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,197
City of emeralds capital.

406
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,239
But whoever they are,
they've stayed anonymous.

407
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,230
So now that I've
told you my secret,

408
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
tell me about halcyon.

409
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,600
We've ended our arrangement.

410
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,952
They didn't align with
our philosophy.

411
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,474
William: Which is what?

412
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,398
We want to change
the world.

413
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,392
You can't do that mired
in short-term thinking.

414
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,509
William: You know what they say
about fidgeters, don't you?

415
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,479
Dreamers
with idle hands.

416
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,554
Dale: I assure you,
Mr. Harris,

417
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,109
no one has ever accused
me of being idle.

418
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,554
Huh.

419
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,875
Mr. Harris,
we have an issue

420
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,559
back at
the office now.

421
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,874
I am so sorry, Keven.
The life of a ceo.

422
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,235
I get it.

423
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,359
Keep
in touch.

424
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,399
Oh, he definitely wants
to be in touch.

425
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,638
Dinah: How goes the search?

426
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,155
Well, knowing galaxy's
behind everything

427
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,550
really nArrows it down.

428
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,632
If the bombs are being
stored in The Glades,

429
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,632
it'll be at headquarters.

430
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,875
Your dad being involved
in all this, uh,

431
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
it can't be easy.

432
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,474
I'm fine.

433
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,237
Let me know when you're
ready to go, OK?

434
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,914
All right.
This is the access point to the sublevels.

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,040
It's the only unlisted
elevator bay in the building.

436
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,839
Their Random full-body
DNA scanner

437
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,513
wasn't a dead giveaway?

438
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,632
But how's this swab gonna
trick a full scan?

439
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,439
Watch.

All right. Be ready.

There's no telling
what we're facing.

448
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,476
Stay back and in
the elevator. Understood?

449
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,616
You know, I'm really
enjoying

all these heartfelt
brother-sister moments.

451

You're just more useful
to me not dead.

452
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,151
I'm sorry. Do you
care about me?

453
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,711
Yeah. Maybe. I'm also
not the only one.

454

Well, emerald for

to come.

Was my message not clear?

471

I wanted you both out
of Star City,

not to come to
The Glades.

Wow. Really? No "hey, kids,
thanks for the rescue."

Felicity: Those coordinates were
not supposed to lead you to me.

475
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,758
They are the coordinates of a stockpile
of bombs hidden in this building.

476
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,816
That's why I told you to
give them to Roy and Dinah.

Well, since we're here,

I'm so sorry,

OK, hey, not
to interrupt,

489

but we've really got
to get out of here

realizes

what we did to
those guards.

492

I can't leave until
I disable the bombs.

493

You just got
out of danger,

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,998
and you want to go
running back into it?

495
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,480
Typical.

496
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,560
You would rather
go play hero

497
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,279
than do what's best
for your daughter.

498
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,589
Mia.

499
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
- Mia, come on.
- Stay out of it.

500
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,276
For once in your
life, mom,

501
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,314

first.

502
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,553
Being a hero, Mia,

503
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,835
means choosing
other people's safety

504
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,470
above your own,
including your family.

505
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,672
That's why I hid
my work from you

506
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,576
so that I could protect you
from having to make

507
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,920
difficult decisions
like these.

508
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,856
You should've just been honest
with me from the beginning.

509
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,155
You were right.

510

I am so sorry.

511

Being a hero is my purpose.

You OK?

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,113
Yes, I am used to being
a disappointment to her.

523
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,296
The explosives are
being stored

Are there any guards
in our way?

The coast looks clear,

527

except for 3 heat signatures
headed straight towards us.

right on top of us.

You found her.

It is so good
to see you alive.

You could've told us we
were on the same side.

533

To infiltrate Eden Corps,
I had to be the calculator.

It was the only way.

Looks like your plan worked
out a little too well.

Well, I'm glad my old team
came to the rescue.

helping William.

us and the bombs.

with them?

Hey. I am only here
to back you up.

547
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,839
Right. 'Cause you
promised your daddy.

You know, I am really not
sure what's worse.

549
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,319
The, um, the lying

550
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,790
or the fact that you actually
thought I needed protection.

551
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,435
Mia,
I know that you can take care of yourself.

552
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,136
Then why the hell
do you keep hanging around?

553
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,311
Because I care
about you.

554
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,869
OK. I wanted to tell
you the truth,

555
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,391
but I knew that you
would hate me

556
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,755
the minute I did.

557
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,152
And every day, it just
got harder and harder.

558
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,197
So your big idea

559
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,033
is that I would just
never find out.

560
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,877
Do you have any
idea what it's like

561
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
to find out

562
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,656
that your entire
relationship with someone

563
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,909
is based on a lie?

564
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,560
No, OK? But I know
what it's like to have

565
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,154
heroes for parents.

566
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,154
It sucks.

567
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,994
Man, I used to ask
my dad all the time

568
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,914
why he even adopted me

569
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,435
if he and my mom were
never gonna be around.

570

But you know what?

571
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,274
When I got older,
I realized...

572
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,160
I was proud of them.

573
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,311
You were proud that
they prioritized

574
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,119
the rest of
the world above you?

575
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,113
OK, no, not
that part. But...

576
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,320
With great power comes
great responsibility, right?

577
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,113
Oh, come on! Spider-man?

578
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm not really
into comic books.

579
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,390
OK, my point is
that the same applies

580
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,709
to us superhero kids.

581
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,793
And we have to learn
to share our parents

582
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,113
and be a little selfless.

583
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,873
Of course you would
say that.

584
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,120
You've been
a hero in training

were a kid.

I got to choose,

to break into some server room

so you guys
can hack into it?

When the fabrics touch,

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,355
No. I wish I could take
you away from all this.

802
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,270
I wish that you didn't have
to think about any of this.

803
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
But I know that that is
not my decision to make.

804
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,392
You know, when I
first left home,

805
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,553
I was so mad at you.

806
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,954
I learned everything I
could about vigilantes.

807
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,759
I dug up
old news stories

808
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,719
about how they
destroyed Star City.

809
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,957
I was convinced...

810
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,319
I was convinced
it was true

811
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,553
that you had lied to
me my entire childhood

812
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,872
with your...
your stories

813
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,953
of the heroism
of Team Arrow.

814
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,870
Because you didn't
want me

815
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,280
to think badly
about you.

816
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,679
Or about dad.

817
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,830
I spent these past years
hating vigilantes...

818
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,479
Because I hated you.

819
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,119
Well, I don't blame you.

820
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,999
I understand why you
wanted to lie to me...

821
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,356
to protect me.

822
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,599
I can't even imagine
what it was like

823
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,559
having the entire
city turn on you

824
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,315
and turn on dad.

825
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,839
Mia, you are
so much like your father.

826
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,232
Out on that field,

827
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,791
so badass.

828
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,393
I'm so proud of you.

829
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,593
Mom, there's, um...

830
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,040
It seemed like there is
something really personal

831
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,950
about you stopping
galaxy.

832
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
Is that about dad?

833
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,593
No, it's not.

834
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,433
That one is on me.

835
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,037
Holy crap. Did that work?

836
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,715
Here goes nothing.

837
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,238
Archer, are you online?

838
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,677
Computer:
<i>Yes, Ms. Smoak.</i>

839
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,797
<i>Archer is active.</i>

840
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,789
<i>Holy...</i>

841
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,874
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
