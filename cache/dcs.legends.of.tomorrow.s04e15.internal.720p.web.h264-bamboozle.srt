1
00:00:00,816 --> 00:00:03,493
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,953
<i>- It's a dragon egg.
- You're possessed.</i>

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,371
- Ray's gone.
- I've taken over his body.

4
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,873
<i>If Neron wanted John dead,</i>

5
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:09,499
<i>he would have killed him
on the spot.</i>

6
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,293
<i>I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.</i>

7
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,128
<i>It's to bring someone here
from the other side.</i>

8
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,713
<i>Tabitha.</i>

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,266
- I'm sorry. It wasn't me.
- It was my nipple.

10
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:19,676
- Save me!
- As you wish.

11
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:23,313
I'm not leaving Mona behind.

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,474
Do you really think
that everyone in hell

13
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,017
deserves to be there?

14
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,643
This is your opportunity
to make things right.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,738
I'm gonna save Ray.

16
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,741
<i>Honey, time to go.</i>

17
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:38,153
Come on, honey, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,031
Zari? You better not
be eating the Halva.

19
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,909
No, Mommy.

20
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,912
Zari Jaan.

21
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:49,590
Dessert's not for
after breakfast.

22
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,752
What?

23
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,047
It's only a kick.

24
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,602
Behrad must be anxious
to meet you.

25
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:04,271
Now go put your shoes on
so I can take you to school.

26
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,270
<i>You might just want
to soak it all in.</i>

27
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,107
<i>Violent people are pouring
into our country...</i>

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,693
<i>illegal immigrants,
terrorists, meta-humans.</i>

29
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,403
<i>Politicians promise
to keep you safe</i>

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,447
<i>but they've been
hiding the truth.</i>

31
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:26,284
<i>There's a dangerous new threat
already within our borders.</i>

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,537
<i>Hi, I'm Ray Palmer.</i>

33
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:31,957
<i>Yes, that Ray Palmer...
former CEO of PalmerTech.</i>

34
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,458
<i>And I am here to warn you</i>

35
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,043
<i>that creatures once thought only</i>

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,796
<i>in legends and fairy tales
are real.</i>

37
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:43,343
<i>Yes, folks, monsters are real,</i>

38
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,719
<i>and they walk amongst us.</i>

39
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:46,471
<i>And they will stop at nothing</i>

40
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,765
<i>until they destroy humankind.</i>

41
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,225
<i>Interested in learning more?</i>

42
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:53,487
<i>Then join me at PalmerX 2019,</i>

43
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:57,774
<i>where the power is in
the Palmer of your hands.</i>

44
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,405
I don't care if Neron's
wearing my best friend's face.

45
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,490
- I want to punch him.
- Get in line.

46
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,993
Ogres are big softies... that
one wouldn't even hurt a fly.

47
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,078
Neron's been a step
ahead of us for too long.

48
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,339
- We need to play offense.
- Agreed.

49
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,999
Sorry, what are we agreeing to?

50
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,252
Look, it's time for us
to fight back.

51
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,296
We're retaking the Bureau.

52
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,511
Gideon, pull up the blueprints
at the Bureau

53
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,188
and start fabricating
and arsenal.

54
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:29,982
<i>- Right away, Captain.</i>
- Look, Gary has bonded

55
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:32,350
with the Fairy Godmother,
and while he might be an idiot,

56
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,436
she is not to be underestimated.

57
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,271
Mick, Nate, you think
you can handle Tabitha?

58
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:38,231
- Granny's dead.
- Good.

59
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,441
Ava and I will handle Neron.

60
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:41,076
Yeah, I want a crack at him.

61
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:42,870
It's my bureau he's running
his operation from.

62
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,488
Not to be a buzzkill,
but even John and Nora

63
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,040
couldn't out-magic Neron.

64
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:49,710
- I just felt a kick.
- Oh, I want to feel!

65
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,879
Right now the smart play would
be just to bide our time.

66
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,496
Wait for John-o to return
with Ray's soul.

67
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,040
Shockingly,
I agree with Charlie.

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,625
- I love you, little Wicksty...
- Oh, I felt it!

69
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,460
I told you, it's kicking.

70
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,879
Okay, can you guys stop being
dragon-baby crazy right now?

71
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,006
Look, this commercial is proof
that Neron

72
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,507
is up to something big,
and we need

73
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,843
to stop him
before it's too late.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,138
<i>Captain, I have an incoming
communication from Nora Darhk.</i>

75
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,141
- Put her on.
<i>- Sara?</i>

76
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,893
<i>- Talk to me.
- What's your status?</i>

77
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,230
I'm tired of skulking
around air ducts.

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,981
I'm going after Mona.

79
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,483
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We're gearing up

80
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,235
for an assault.
Hold your position.

81
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,071
- Hey!
- Too late.

82
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:28,865
- Wait, where's Gary?
- In Ava's office...

83
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,660
getting real comfortable.

84
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,037
Mmm.

85
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,498
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

86
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:41,169
Yes, my pet?

87
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,380
I want to dig deeper
on my next wish.

88
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,924
- Excellent idea.
- What do you have in mind?

89
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,677
Well...

90
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,012
we've already redecorated
my office.

91
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:52,389
I now have three nipples

92
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,274
because a spare never hurts,
and...

93
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:58,061
Perhaps you could make
a wish regarding the Legends?

94
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,938
You want me to wish something
for them?

95
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,741
I'm talking about revenge.

96
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,734
- Oh.
- They lied to you, Gary.

97
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,737
Promised you could be
an interim Legend.

98
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,739
One wish, and you can send them

99
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,877
all to hell
with John Constantine.

100
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,796
Speaking of John,
you think he's all right?

101
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:20,208
That warlock sent thousands
of demons to rot in the pits.

102
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:25,130
I think he's well
and truly screwed, dearie.

103
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:46,901
Does this mean we're straight?

104
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,903
I got a more important
collection to make.

105
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,450
Who is that guy?

106
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,286
That, my friend,
is John Constantine...

107
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,838
in the flesh.

108
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,129
Congratulations, Mona.

109
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,849
I have selected you
for a very special assignment.

110
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,467
That's okay, Ne-Ray.

111
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,178
Can I call you that?
I'm okay here.

112
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,598
You see, before Nate's father
decided he wanted to be

113
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,641
P.T. Barnum,
we were working together.

114
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,194
Training monsters
to do our bidding.

115
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,814
Actually, I worked extensively

116
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,608
with your dear friend Konane...

117
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:30,195
I mean...
Your dead friend Konane.

118
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,954
- I found Mona.
- Hurry.

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,291
Copy that.

120
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,930
This seems like overkill.

121
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:54,177
The Legends never included me
in their pizza parties...

122
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,639
or asked me to play
Dungeons & Dragons.

123
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:00,183
Make them suffer, Gary.

124
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,560
I can make them do
whatever you want.

125
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,146
I just wanted to be
part of the team.

126
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:07,524
As soon as Ava opens the portal,

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,242
we go in firing.

128
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,036
Time to burn some freaks.

129
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,696
I wish...

130
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,908
Opening a portal
in three, two, one.

131
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,997
No.

132
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,090
Welcome to book club.

133
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,148
Why, you little...

134
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,109
I'd be careful how you speak
to my charge.

135
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:43,944
Gary, why are you doing this?

136
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,021
Because I would like
to discuss...

137
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,281
"The Collector."

138
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,191
Forget the book, Gary.

139
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,609
You helped a demon
take control of the Bureau.

140
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,953
What happened to
the Bureau creed?

141
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,071
Oh, I could ask
the same about you.

142
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,407
Article 27?
Hmm?

143
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,701
A supervisor must never show
favoritism?

144
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,786
You started a book club
with another employee.

145
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,790
Gary, Mona is being tortured
right now.

146
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,417
Neron said he's trying
to protect

147
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,969
humans from monsters.

148
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,753
You saw Mona gnaw off my nip.

149
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,423
- She did you a favor.
- Okay, um...

150
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,050
maybe we should just reschedule

151
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,645
until after we've read the book?

152
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,149
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

153
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,642
- Oh, no.
- Wait.

154
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,693
- Ow.
- Book was terrible.

155
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,487
Oh, my head.

156
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,164
That's the spirit.

157
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,491
<i>- Sara, Ava, come in.
- Where are you guys?</i>

158
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,910
- Hey, Nate.
- Can't talk right now.

159
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:43,661
Are you talking to Nate
on comms?

160
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,414
Tell him I say hi.

161
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,082
Gary says hi.

162
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,627
And we are at book club.

163
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,795
Move on to plan B.

164
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,640
- What's plan B?
- I only listen for my name.

165
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,133
I assume it's like plan A,

166
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,260
but, you know, with less people.

167
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:01,137
Well, without the Captain
and the clone,

168
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,764
the Bureau's a suicide mission.

169
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,274
Mick's right.

170
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,527
We need to sneak into PalmerX,

171
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,104
do some recon,
find out what Neron is up to.

172
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:13,024
Now that sounds like a plan Z.

173
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,500
- Mmm.
- Hey, baby.

174
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,711
Hey, you looking
for a good time, handsome?

175
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,388
I'm always looking
for a good time, love,

176
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:38,466
but, uh, regrettably,
my time here is limited.

177
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:40,393
Maybe you can help me.

178
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,387
I'm looking for broker
in the soul trade.

179
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,806
He goes by the name of Masher.

180
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,517
I might know something.

181
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,061
Well, this here is holy water.

182
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,021
Now, you can use this
to burn the skin

183
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,074
off any demon tosser
who messes with you.

184
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,617
Uh-uh-uh.

185
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,195
Masher likes to hang out
at the strip club

186
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,414
after trading is done...

187
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:03,333
John.

188
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,411
How do you know my name?

189
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,621
Oh, I know who you are.

190
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:12,592
Half of demonkind is searching
for John Constantine.

191
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,712
The holy water?

192
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,598
- Oh, this?
- Nah, this is just whisky, love.

193
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,513
Sure, our protagonist

194
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,099
was keeping people
hostage, but...

195
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,768
that's only because he never
received love as a child.

196
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,737
Aah!

197
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,525
They don't want you
in their book club, Gary.

198
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:39,527
Doesn't that make you angry?

199
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:42,572
Make a wish, and they will pay.

200
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,294
- You're right.
- They don't want to spend time

201
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,131
with Gary Green,
lowly Time Bureau agent.

202
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,207
But they would love
to spend time

203
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:56,085
with Gary Green...

204
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,421
Captain of the Waverider!

205
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,641
<i>Welcome aboard, Captain Green.</i>

206
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,656
Thanks.

207
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,067
I have no quarrel
with you, dear.

208
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,827
You didn't send me to hell

209
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,571
like John Constantine
and the Legends.

210
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:24,831
Yes...

211
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:29,243
I was in hell for 327 years.

212
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,828
And what was my crime?

213
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,956
I sprinkled a little magic
over Salem,

214
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,792
trying to help a girl
who's mother

215
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,510
was accused of witchcraft.

216
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:40,046
Okay, well, you're out now.

217
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,640
Why help Neron?

218
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:46,061
Neron rescued me in hell.

219
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,764
What can I say?

220
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,016
True love bloomed.

221
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:56,363
I know what you're thinking...
he's so much older than me.

222
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:02,318
Sometimes you
have to look past age.

223
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,196
You know, in another life,

224
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,667
I think you and I could have
been friends.

225
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:12,120
- Toodles.
- Wait, what?

226
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,626
Ray?

227
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:21,012
Without all
of the idiotic tendencies.

228
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,435
Make a move on me,
and Mona dies.

229
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,556
Ray is good and strong.

230
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,349
He can fight his way
back from hell.

231
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,236
Who do you think
is having a worse time in hell?

232
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,279
Ray, or your father?

233
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,075
Turns out Daddy dearest
isn't so tough.

234
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:45,245
I hear Damien Darhk is going
stark raving mad in the pits.

235
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,821
Why am I here?

236
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,366
Well, you and John
tried to kill me... nearly did.

237
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,702
If the doofus
in the skin suit I'm wearing

238
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,037
hadn't have interrupted,
I'd have been obliterated.

239
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,090
I spent many nights
just dreaming

240
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,583
about how I was going
to get my revenge.

241
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,668
And then it came to me...
what better punishment

242
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:03,212
than making you sit front row

243
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,881
to all of the fear and rage

244
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,382
I'm about to unleash
on the Earth,

245
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,435
all while in the body
of the man you love.

246
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,180
Now...

247
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,609
Smile for the cameras.

248
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,811
- Mr. Palmer!
- Are monsters real?

249
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,521
What's tonight all about?

250
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:23,900
Now, all of your questions
will be answered soon.

251
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,458
- Oh. Excuse me.
- What's wrong with you?

252
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,700
Well, you know,
a room full of people

253
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,294
fearful of magical creatures

254
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,120
just makes me a little bit
fearful, all right?

255
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:40,249
The worst part is,
Ray loves tech events.

256
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,721
Good evening, D.C.,
and welcome

257
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,048
to PalmerX 2019.

258
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,095
Now, you're all
probably wondering,

259
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,140
what in the heck is Ray Palmer
doing back in the public eye?

260
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,560
Well, folks, for the past
two years I have been hunting

261
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:00,937
magical creatures.

262
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,816
Hang with me here.

263
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:07,902
I have created an exosuit
capable of combating

264
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,446
the most ferocious
of their kind.

265
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,948
What a douche.

266
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,575
- But I can't do it alone.
- I need your help.

267
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,994
I need you to help me
find these creatures...

268
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,507
creatures that may be hiding
right here amongst us.

269
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,252
Now, everyone take out
your smartphones.

270
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:25,920
Better be PalmerTech.

271
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:29,257
I have created a small,
simple app,

272
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,017
that will change the world.

273
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:33,594
And I want you all
to download it right now.

274
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:35,429
The app is called Eyes.

275
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:39,100
Now, on Eyes, you will be able
to share real-time,

276
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:41,143
life-saving monster sightings.

277
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,981
Share them, and I will be there
to save you.

278
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,483
Remember, the power

279
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,036
is in the Palmer of your hands.

280
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:53,614
You really expect us
to believe monsters exist?

281
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:56,042
I thought you were going
to offer us proof.

282
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,327
- Thank you, Cindy.
- You are absolutely right.

283
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,454
Here is your proof.

284
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,383
Now, this may look like
a helpless hipster

285
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,042
who should be working
at a bookstore,

286
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,503
but believe me, she is something

287
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,964
altogether more dangerous.

288
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,155
- Masher.
- John?

289
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,531
Yeah, yeah, all right,
keep your hair on.

290
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,250
No need to tell the whole
bloody club.

291
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,085
Oh, buddy, now I know you're
out of your mind.

292
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:41,746
- What are you doing in hell?
- I'm here to save a friend.

293
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,090
His soul belongs to Neron.

294
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,208
Cheers, love.
He's paying.

295
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,095
Nobody gets into Neron's
soul vault without his say-so.

296
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,097
Except the Triumvirate,
and I have a plan

297
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,548
to deal with them,
but first, there's a hunch

298
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,758
I need to confirm.

299
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,093
What's Neron trading at?

300
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,679
He's steady, but I'll let you
in on a little secret.

301
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,848
His stock is about to rise.

302
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,517
I'm talking a massive
soul collection on Earth.

303
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,727
You know what that means?

304
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,354
Neron is finally making his play

305
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,939
for the throne of hell.

306
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,857
Oh, cheers, Masher.
I can use that.

307
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,275
Be careful, John.

308
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,235
Not every demon
you've sent to hell

309
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,029
is as forgiving as I am.

310
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,989
Yeah, don't I know it.

311
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,219
You're dead, demon hunter.

312
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,714
I was going to be
a demon proctologist,

313
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,383
but the pay wasn't as good.

314
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,316
- Hold him.
- Oh!

315
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:46,268
Oh, Calibraxis.
Hey, looking good, mate.

316
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,063
- You grow your beard?
- John Constantine.

317
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,108
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you breathe your last.

318
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,068
I invoke a parlay.

319
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:56,278
I demand to speak
to the Triumvirate.

320
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,447
I'm a demon, not a pirate, John.

321
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,991
I thought you understood
the rules.

322
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,284
Well, you little maggot,

323
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,744
as long as I'm alive,

324
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:05,705
then the Triumvirate
can pass me around

325
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,790
like a little sparrow
amongst the cats.

326
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:11,127
But as soon as I die,
you dim-witted dick,

327
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,179
then my soul belongs to Neron,

328
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:14,681
and then the Triumvirate
lose out

329
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,265
on all the tasty little bits
of torture

330
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,508
that they've got planned for me.

331
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,176
So you've got two choices:

332
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,886
You can either kill me

333
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,305
and royally piss off the old
bags that run this place,

334
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,600
or take me to speak
with the Triumvirate.

335
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,483
<i>I'm detecting
a fugitive alert... stop it...</i>

336
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,318
<i>at the Inquisition,
Captain Green.</i>

337
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,529
Oh, I don't do torture.

338
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,207
- Could've fooled me.
- Hey. Play nice.

339
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,700
We have to distract Gary

340
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,327
while the B team
is plan B... ing.

341
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,496
<i>Would a fairy at the
Great British Bakeoff</i>

342
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,622
<i>suit your fancy?</i>

343
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,708
Shall we, uh...

344
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,002
keep calm and pastry on?

345
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,255
<i>I'll plot a course, Captain.</i>

346
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,340
Get it?

347
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,717
"Keep calm and pastry on"?

348
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,145
Good one, Cap.

349
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,388
- Hilarious.
- Thanks, guys.

350
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:05,890
Thanks.
Yeah.

351
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,894
Take a good,
long look at her... Mona Wu.

352
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,739
You saw her on the street,
you wouldn't think twice.

353
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:14,482
- Come on, Mona.
- Don't give him what he wants.

354
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,027
But she has a strange
and violent condition...

355
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,862
brought about
when she fell in love

356
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,989
with a repulsive creature.

357
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,991
I feel like a bridge scene
should have more people.

358
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:27,920
Oh, no, we love
three-people bridge scenes.

359
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,830
Yeah, otherwise we just
end up standing around all day.

360
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,041
Oh, that's why
Mick's always grumpy.

361
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,584
Come on, Mona.

362
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,878
I promised
these fine people a show.

363
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,505
Let's not keep them waiting.

364
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,895
Shift now or end up
dead like Konane.

365
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,448
Folks, proof

366
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:07,618
of the world's
very first werewolf.

367
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,381
That's what we're missing...
the boys!

368
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,100
- No.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,725
Fairy Godmother?

370
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:37,148
- Z.
- B.

371
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,485
- She made him disappear!
- Well, well, well...

372
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,037
what do we have here?

373
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:44,864
More magic in the audience?

374
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,908
She's one of them!

375
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:50,711
- He's right.
- I am.

376
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,542
- She's a witch.
- Witch. Witch.

377
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,345
Witch, witch, witch!

378
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:00,921
Witch, witch...

379
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:02,590
- Don't worry, folks.
- The witch won't get far.

380
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,342
Not as long as everyone
downloads the Eyes app.

381
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,262
Share your sightings.
We'll find the witch.

382
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,930
It's only a matter of time.

383
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,818
Sara, you guys okay?

384
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,322
Yeah, we're fine, as long
as we keep placating Gary.

385
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,074
I guess Charlie and Z
are our last hope.

386
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,036
- Great, we're toast.
- Welcome to hell.

387
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:35,039
Good evening,
this is your captain speaking.

388
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,876
Just...

389
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,336
What?

390
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,338
We'll be cruising at
a high altitude

391
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,891
on our way
to save a bakeoff in Britain.

392
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,884
- Whoo, yeah.
- Yeah.

393
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,469
Gary, is that
the Kid Steel costume?

394
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:50,346
Uh-huh.

395
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,805
You like-y?

396
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:54,650
Why would anyone wish
to be a sidekick?

397
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,186
- Close your legs.
- Oh, he's such an idiot.

398
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,396
What?

399
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,690
Nothing,
they're just teasing you.

400
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,777
- Oh.
- You're my Gar-bear.

401
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,746
We're gonna have so much fun.

402
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Okay?

403
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,085
#EyesApp is trending on Twitter

404
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:16,497
below Kanye's surprise album
and a cat getting a bath.

405
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,758
- Mm.
- How many downloads?

406
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:22,002
Only 2,000, Mr. Palmer.

407
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,587
News cycle is so fast
these days,

408
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,506
it's hard to
cut through all the noise.

409
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:27,383
But a monster attack
on the capital

410
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,760
will dominate
the headlines for weeks.

411
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,145
And then what?

412
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:33,597
More people will download
some app?

413
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,359
That's your big plan?

414
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,686
Why, yes, it is.

415
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,271
Ah! My love.

416
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,940
Would you please
escort our guest

417
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,275
to a cell?

418
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,110
Let's go, dearie.

419
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,536
Neron didn't say which
containment cell to put you in.

420
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,246
Why are you helping me?

421
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,581
Because you're a fellow witch,

422
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,801
and I think
we can help each other.

423
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:08,549
Mona?

424
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,925
How do you feel?

425
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,978
I've been better.

426
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:16,098
Remember, I'm just
a "Fairy Godmother" away.

427
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,399
Trust me, we'll be safe here.

428
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:30,988
Where are we?

429
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,656
My childhood home.

430
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,242
I thought you grew up
in a dystopian city, Z.

431
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,036
You had a pool?

432
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,079
In a couple years,
A.R.G.U.S. will use people's

433
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:42,416
growing fear of meta-humans
to seize control.

434
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:45,336
Of course, it didn't help
that we were Muslim.

435
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,505
We were forced to move
to a ghetto district in 2021.

436
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,349
Humans are so easy
to manipulate.

437
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:52,351
I mean, you just show them
a scary ogre

438
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:55,688
or a dangerous meta,
they just go barmy.

439
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:58,682
Haven't even been able
to get into the Eyes app yet

440
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,309
because the terms
of service are so long.

441
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,019
No one bothers reading those.

442
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,979
- It's a demon app.
- I'm gonna read the fine print.

443
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,522
I can't believe
it's just us left.

444
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,857
I mean, you and I both knew
from the start

445
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,993
that it was madness
to storm the Bureau.

446
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,987
- Oh, my God.
- What?

447
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,113
Z?

448
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,749
In New Orleans,

449
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:17,951
John said Neron needed more
souls to take over hell.

450
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:19,536
Here it says in exchange
for the service,

451
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,455
the user agrees to forfeit
their eternal soul

452
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:22,664
to the demon Neron.

453
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,999
What, you're saying that anyone

454
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,959
who downloads the app
is going to hell?

455
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:26,960
Yeah.

456
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,221
Oh, that is mental.

457
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:33,384
This little fairy was causing
quite the fray

458
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,394
around the soufflé.

459
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,096
I think I know

460
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:39,306
just the place for you, madame.

461
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,233
I can't take it anymore.

462
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,570
I'm gonna kill him.

463
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,314
Hey, Z, Charlie, please tell
me you have something.

464
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:50,776
Well, we figured out Neron's
app is a way to collect souls.

465
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,153
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, it gets crazier.

466
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,247
To drum up fear and increase
downloads of his app,

467
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,658
we think he may be planning
a monster attack.

468
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,752
Okay, well, we'll stall Gary,

469
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,870
but you got to get every single
one of those monsters

470
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,247
out of the Time Bureau.

471
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,833
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

472
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:08,627
- Who are you talking to, Sara?
- What?

473
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:11,755
Gary! Baby, bubby, bubelah.

474
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:15,217
There's a whole big
world of problems.

475
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,344
You know, Neron
and your Fairy Godmother,

476
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:19,346
they're not really
your friends, but...

477
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:21,390
Do you know
who your friends are?

478
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,851
These guys.

479
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,352
Huh?

480
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,770
Are you trying to schmooze me?

481
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,105
Feels good, right?

482
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,274
Uh, actually,
it feels a little false.

483
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,027
- Gary!
- You are our friend.

484
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:36,697
I mean, would we lie
to an interim Legend?

485
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:38,124
Ah, you see, that's just it,

486
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,292
because I'm not
an interim Legend.

487
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,002
You just promised me that
to use me as bait.

488
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,537
- Pfft.
- You know what, Gary?

489
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:44,913
It's a little hard to feel
sorry for you

490
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,540
when you're holding us
all hostage.

491
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:48,000
You're not getting it.

492
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,877
This whole time,
Tabitha has been trying

493
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:52,388
to use me to hurt you.

494
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:55,632
All I wished
was for us to hang out.

495
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,310
I was trying to protect you.

496
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:01,054
I get it.
I'm not cool.

497
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,724
But I don't deserve
to be treated like a joke.

498
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,934
So, now...

499
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,395
now the joke's on you.

500
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:11,157
- What's he talking about?
- Oh, Fairy Godmother!

501
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:14,994
Yes, my pet?

502
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,945
Mick thinks he's a tough guy,

503
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,790
but I think he's a big baby.

504
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:30,417
And Nate, who's never been
bullied a day in his life,

505
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:33,086
welcome to my high-school years.

506
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:40,594
And, Sara and Ava,

507
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,846
the cool girl
and the class president,

508
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,516
you know what I want you
to do for me?

509
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,359
Dance!

510
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,864
Five, six, seven, eight.

511
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,154
Faster!

512
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,373
Gary, stop it!

513
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,327
Faster!

514
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,335
Charlie,
I get that you're scared,

515
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,962
but the team is counting on us.

516
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,547
I'm not scared. It's just,
breaking the monsters

517
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,465
out of the prison
is a multiple-person job.

518
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:21,009
- You can be multiple people.
- Look, Z, yeah, I can,

519
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,177
for a second, and you know what?

520
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,470
It takes its toll.

521
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:24,846
Now, I could end up
back in prison

522
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,015
or even worse, dead.

523
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,734
- When A.R.G.U.S.
- came for my family,

524
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,686
my brother,
Behrad, told me to run.

525
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,980
And I did.

526
00:25:33,056 --> 00:25:35,983
I've never forgiven myself.

527
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,609
You won't either.

528
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,653
We can't change
my family's future,

529
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,081
but we can save their present.

530
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:43,740
Zari Jaan, make sure

531
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,409
you take your shoes off
before you go in.

532
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,828
- I know.
- Charlie?

533
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:50,497
If I die, I'm gonna come back
and haunt you.

534
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:54,001
I would love a ghost friend.

535
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:55,419
Come on.

536
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,518
Cool.

537
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:27,293
Greetings, Satan,
first of the fallen.

538
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,786
It's been a long time, John.

539
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,246
Belial.

540
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,581
We've been looking forward

541
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:35,542
to hearing the bunk
you're pedaling.

542
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:37,803
And Beelzebub.

543
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,131
Not as popular, but you were
always my personal favorite.

544
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,258
This is a waste of our time.

545
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,353
I take it you've noticed
a certain demon's stock

546
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,929
has been on the rise.

547
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,816
Neron's been doing
very well for himself.

548
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:53,268
Neron is trying to take
control of hell.

549
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,770
And let me assure you,

550
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,989
his method for collecting souls,

551
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:59,983
it won't be to sign
on the dotted line in blood.

552
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,444
He's, uh, young,

553
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,496
by your standards at least.

554
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:08,325
And let's just say,
he means to disrupt the system.

555
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,003
If we interfere with Neron,
we'll look weak.

556
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,081
Well, that's precisely
where I come in, Bubby.

557
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:17,959
And what do you want
in exchange?

558
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,763
Not your own soul, I hope.

559
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,675
I'm here for the soul
of Raymond Palmer.

560
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:27,260
You let us two leave hell,
and I pledge to you

561
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:30,305
that I will dedicate all
of my crafty, wicked ways

562
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,433
to thwarting Neron
and securing your reign.

563
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,602
Are you really here

564
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,979
for Raymond Palmer?

565
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:48,040
We thought there was another...

566
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,162
A young girl whose life
you destroyed.

567
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,714
Astra.

568
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:04,381
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to be too greedy.

569
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,550
But, yeah, I'll take them both.

570
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,218
Both of them?

571
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:11,054
That is greedy.

572
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,473
But if you were to choose,

573
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,110
well, then
that's a different matter.

574
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:21,240
John, help me.

575
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:26,236
John, you're here. You got
to get me back to Earth.

576
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:31,742
- Please, John.
- They're hurting me.

577
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,420
Make up your mind, John.

578
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:36,747
This offer won't last.

579
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,759
John?

580
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,803
- Astra?
- It's following me!

581
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,837
Make it go away!

582
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,634
Come here, I've got you.

583
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:50,853
You can't have her!

584
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,439
You can't save her.

585
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:55,682
- You can't have her!
- You can't have her!

586
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,651
John, get me out of here!

587
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,028
I'm sorry.

588
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:11,239
I choose...

589
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,250
Astra Logue.

590
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,751
Stick to the plan, Charlie.

591
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,628
You mean the plan
where I need to rely

592
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,713
on my shoddy shape-shifting
to portal creatures one by one

593
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,465
out of their cells
and on to the Waverider,

594
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,510
where Gary may or may not
wish them to Kingdom Come?

595
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,970
Yep, that plan.

596
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,985
This isn't you, Gary.

597
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,696
Why are you being so cruel?

598
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:44,439
Please!

599
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,492
Stop! You're killing them!

600
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,996
I don't do mime, dearie.

601
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:53,240
- Just stop!
- Everything!

602
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:55,584
As you wish...

603
00:29:58,413 --> 00:29:59,830
- Ooh.
- Ugh.

604
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,667
Huh.

605
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:06,011
- Mona?
- Hey, wake up.

606
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:09,965
Hey, Nora.

607
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,175
Hey.

608
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,969
Oh, you're still here.

609
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,013
I'm book club forever.

610
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,765
Book club forever.

611
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,746
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

612
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:35,615
Uh, I have to pop off

613
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,159
for a second, Gary.

614
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,879
I thought we were going to
play Settlers of Catan later.

615
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,039
Don't be silly.

616
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,167
We're not friends.

617
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,428
Oh.

618
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,632
I am so sorry, Gary.

619
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,009
I took you for granted.

620
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,219
I never,
ever should have let you

621
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,180
do my dry cleaning
or work overtime without pay.

622
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,057
I mean, that's illegal anyway.

623
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,401
I'm so sorry.

624
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,144
I still want to kill you.

625
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,564
Gary, when Rip first
recruited the Legends,

626
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,317
he picked the people
that were insignificant

627
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:13,153
to history...
the original losers.

628
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:16,239
You don't have to be cool
to be a Legend.

629
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,585
And maybe we forgot that
somewhere along the way, but...

630
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,370
- you are one of us.
- Now, come on, Gary.

631
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,256
Ray and Constantine are both
stuck in hell,

632
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,832
and you can help them.

633
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:28,877
Just use your Fairy Godmother
powers for good.

634
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,966
Save her.

635
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:38,678
Sadly, my hands are tied.

636
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:42,557
But if you become Mona's
Fairy Godmother,

637
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,435
she could wish to be healed.

638
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,896
How do I do that?

639
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,774
If another witch
takes the wand...

640
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:56,029
You'll take my curse...

641
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:59,783
but with it, all of my power.

642
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:00,784
Nora.

643
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,875
Nora, no.

644
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:10,585
No...

645
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,642
Oh, it worked.

646
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:18,810
Quick, Mona.
Make a wish.

647
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:20,145
Wow.

648
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,972
Uh, Fairy God-Nora,

649
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,725
I wish to be safe
on the Waverider.

650
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,816
Oh, how I've missed me.

651
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,609
Sadly for you,

652
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,163
when you took on the wand's
power and responsibility,

653
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,782
you also took on its charge.

654
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,660
- Gary?
- I'm afraid so.

655
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:47,673
Fairy Godmothers are prisoners.

656
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:51,343
Their magic is dependent
on whiny humans

657
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,129
and their petty demands.

658
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,672
You lied.

659
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,183
Obviously.

660
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,969
Toodles.

661
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,316
Excuse me.

662
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:19,571
- Oh. Marilyn Monroe?
- Why, yes.

663
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,990
I seem to have
gotten a little lost.

664
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,117
Can you help me get back home?

665
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:26,828
Of course, ma'am.

666
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:29,622
Let me just program in a year.

667
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:38,214
- Ah. Yeah.
- Uh...

668
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:44,563
Thank you, sir.

669
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,890
- Oh, my love!
- My love.

670
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,560
Uh, still no luck with Nora?

671
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,312
- No.
- Oh.

672
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:54,397
Well, she'll take
your curse soon.

673
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,067
After all,
you are very convincing.

674
00:33:57,143 --> 00:33:58,902
Well, I better head back.

675
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,321
Evil deeds to do and all that.

676
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:08,587
No.

677
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,093
Well, that was bloody close.

678
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:19,005
<i>I'm at the first cell.
Anytime now, Z.</i>

679
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:21,349
Okay, just give me one second.

680
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:25,553
The public doesn't always
know what's best for them.

681
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,181
So tonight we will release
the Minotaur

682
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:31,226
and scare them into accepting
our protection.

683
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,112
It is done,<i> mon amour.</i>

684
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,781
How do I look?

685
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,400
But you were just...

686
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,194
Oh, the shape-shifter.

687
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:47,367
Can someone sound the alarm?

688
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,173
Charlie, Tabitha and Neron
are onto you.

689
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,707
Yeah, I figured.

690
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:56,668
You need to get out now.

691
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:59,638
Open all the doors,
turn off the force fields.

692
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:01,473
I'm not leaving.

693
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,241
Are you waiting
for an invitation?

694
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:30,168
It's a bloody jailbreak!

695
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,335
I mean, there are pros
to trusting your apologies

696
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,462
are sincere, and cons.

697
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,631
Maybe I'll make a list.

698
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,434
Gary... Gary,
just go with your heart.

699
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,856
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

700
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:54,309
- Nora.
- Oh...

701
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,395
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from hell.

702
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,864
Oh, fiddlesticks.

703
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,699
- Wait, wait!
- Gary!

704
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:02,367
Gary, you dick!

705
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:05,945
Oh.

706
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:08,990
- Come on, you lot.
- Get a move on.

707
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,617
You don't have to tell me twice.

708
00:36:10,693 --> 00:36:12,619
Faster, sassy!

709
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:17,707
You're all right, little one.

710
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,834
Oi, ogre.
Catch!

711
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,216
Charlie, you're out of time.

712
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:29,385
- Z, get out of here.
- See you on the other side.

713
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,638
<i>I'm going after Mona.</i>

714
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,230
Mona.

715
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,651
Come on, my love.

716
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:47,070
Let's get you out of here.

717
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,950
- Ugh. I hate shape-shifters.
- Break her neck.

718
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,285
Patience,<i> mon amour.</i>

719
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,872
Get Mona.

720
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,999
No!

721
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,047
Looks like things ain't going
so well for you, Neron.

722
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,841
You wanted a monster
to attack D.C.

723
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:12,762
Now we have every single
monster...

724
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,439
in one.

725
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,780
You promised me
you'd take me to see Astra.

726
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:24,107
Patience, John.

727
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:26,943
I made a pledge to you,
and I expect you

728
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,903
to keep your end of the bargain.

729
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,412
What the hell
are you playing at?

730
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,205
John?

731
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:43,042
John, is it really you?

732
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,211
- Yes.
- Yes, Astra, love.

733
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:47,714
It's me.
It's me. This is Johnny.

734
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,891
Thank God...

735
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:56,389
God? You know better
than to thank Him.

736
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,102
Astra?

737
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,688
John is here to take you
back to Earth.

738
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:06,941
You're welcome to go.

739
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,278
- Yeah. It's all right, love.
- It's me.

740
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,499
No.

741
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,494
Wait.

742
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,496
Hold on.

743
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,007
What do you mean no?

744
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,959
Looks like the deal
is null and void.

745
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,921
Neron is a thorn
in our side, John,

746
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,016
but torturing you...

747
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,767
is too much fun.

748
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,637
<i>John?</i>

749
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,598
<i>It's following me.</i>

750
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,099
<i>Make it go away!</i>

751
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,809
<i>Please!</i>

752
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,187
<i>John, het me out of here!</i>

753
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,866
Astra, love.

754
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:00,703
- This isn't you.
- Oh, of course it is.

755
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,374
Or would you rather I stayed
that terrified little girl,

756
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:08,378
crying and waiting
for you to come and rescue me?

757
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,556
I would have been waiting
a long time.

758
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,717
I am so, so sorry, love, but...

759
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,178
this place, it's twisted you.

760
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,389
If anything...

761
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,733
it's made me more like you.

762
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,068
Right, John?

763
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:25,686
You're not like me.

764
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,406
You're not.

765
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:31,651
You chose wrong.

766
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:33,694
You should have saved
your friend.

767
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:57,176
- Hey, watch it!
- Back off, freak!

768
00:39:57,253 --> 00:39:59,345
It's like a demented Noah's Ark.

769
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:01,097
What about Charlie?

770
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,774
It's my fault.
I'm the one that convinced her

771
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:03,942
to risk everything.

772
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:05,601
Hey, don't go down that road.

773
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,978
We'll do what we always do.

774
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:09,781
Yeah, forming stupid Beebos.

775
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,953
Hey, where are you going?

776
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:16,955
Well, after everything,
I just figured

777
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:19,031
you wouldn't want to
have me around anymore.

778
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:20,741
It's all hands on deck, Gary.

779
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,285
Yeah.

780
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,379
We're gonna need all our
friends to defeat Neron.

781
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:28,541
Aye, aye.

782
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:30,460
You all right?

783
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,345
Not really.

784
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,141
I'm glad you
and Wicksty are okay.

785
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,970
What happened?

786
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,055
Oh, my God.

787
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,833
Hi.

788
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,461
My name is Zari.

789
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:28,151
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
