ORIGINAL STORY <i>SWEET HOME</i>
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

3
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,364
I'm really okay.

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,365
Cha Hyun-su.

5
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,493
I need to speak with you.

6
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,537
What?

7
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,083
Why are you only taking him?

8
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,085
What about me?

9
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,716
You're just being used.

10
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,894
Hey!

11
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,063
Hey!

12
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,732
Let me out, too!

13
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,239
It's vital the front gate be
properly barricaded, but it hasn't been.

14
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,492
And we only have wooden planks and chains
blocking the stairs.

15
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,161
Monsters could get through at any moment.

16
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,875
The same goes for where you were just now.

17
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,547
Why do you think I took your side?

18
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,550
I'll be straightforward.

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,969
You'll be taking on all the dangerous work
from now on.

20
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,012
If you don't want to,
then I can't help you.

21
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,682
What do you mean?

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,268
The guy in Room 1408.

23
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,854
Can you bring him here?

24
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,821
It was spring.

25
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,741
The flowers were so pretty.

26
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,078
All I wanted was to show my daughter
the pretty flowers.

27
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,498
Truly,

28
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,209
it was just for one second, but…

29
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,757
You must miss her a lot.

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,345
The day she first called me "mom,"

31
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,556
the day she first turned over by herself…

32
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,308
I was so touched

33
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,728
by such small things…

34
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,108
Seeing those chubby cheeks…

35
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,322
made me feel like I had everything.

36
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,826
You have children?

37
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,747
I used to.

38
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,878
Before this happened to my leg.

39
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,136
I want…

40
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,683
the same thing as Hyun-su.

41
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,563
If I turn, please…

42
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,149
<i>kill me.</i>

43
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,060
<i>I can't do as you asked.</i>

44
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,357
I don't think

45
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,195
I can take care of them without you.

46
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,034
Is that so?

47
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,273
Is she not in there?

48
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,862
No.

49
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,157
She's gone.

50
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,376
We should let her go now.

51
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,651
{\an8}KIM YEONG-SU, KIM SU-YEONG

52
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,116
Wait.

53
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,120
I heard you're a gangster.

54
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,539
Don't gangsters do anything for money?

55
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,374
I'll give you everything I have.

56
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,127
Just help me go outside.

57
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,339
I…

58
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,729
Move.

59
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,526
I… No, you can't…

60
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,944
Open the door.

61
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,199
Is this okay?

62
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,285
I don't think we can stop him.

63
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,039
You're not supposed to…

64
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,935
Wait.

65
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,249
Is this it?

66
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,835
Do you want me to starve?

67
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,463
You're glad I'm locked up in here,
aren't you?

68
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,715
I bet you're really enjoying this.

69
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,225
If I turn into a monster,
I'll eat you up first.

70
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,977
So do something, you stupid cow!

71
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,396
We have to save food!

72
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,314
Says who?

73
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,816
All that food is mine.

74
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,822
They said we're all going to share it.

75
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,993
Don't be ridiculous! You bitch!

76
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,377
You should hold it in.

77
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,213
I do it, too.

78
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>Rescuing Han Du-sik is the main goal.</i>

79
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,238
The kids are secondary.

80
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,907
Focus on the main goal.

81
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,951
If things go south,

82
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,121
leave the kids.

83
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,299
<i>Are you playing with people's lives?</i>

84
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,220
Then who should I have sent?

85
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,639
It was the best option.

86
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,684
We need that man in Room 1408.

87
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,812
And I've decided not to hesitate
any longer.

88
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,773
Let go of me.

89
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm sure there's another way
besides using other people.

90
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,746
What I'm using is the golden hour.

91
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,254
Cha Hyun-su was critically injured,
but he woke up in just a few hours.

92
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,134
<i>If willpower can affect the turning stage,</i>

93
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,515
and he can fight it,

94
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,357
then he will be the strongest weapon
we have.

95
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,942
This is what we call a weapon.

96
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,319
He's still human.

97
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,863
I agree.

98
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,616
For now.

99
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,619
And you sent him to die?

100
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,372
It would be best if you
become accustomed to using

101
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,332
people on the verge of turning
into monsters.

102
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,542
You really are twisted.

103
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,673
I don't think you understand

104
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,508
how dangerous our situation is.

105
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,052
What did you think

106
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,513
about the voting results?

107
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,395
They're marked with Xs.

108
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,523
I was thinking of secretly switching them.

109
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,735
-But I didn't need to.
-So you didn't switch the votes?

110
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,487
It was unexpected.

111
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,033
I didn't think people would vote
to let Hyun-su stay.

112
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,078
That's because you made them feel guilty,
talking about murder.

113
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,336
Do you really think they voted not to
kick him out because of their conscience?

114
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,089
Well, the man with the sword
and the girl with the bat

115
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,216
may have felt close to him
because they were together.

116
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,801
But the others?

117
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,388
It's not easy to accept someone
you don't know,

118
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,683
especially when your life is at risk.

119
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,187
So what's your point?

120
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,397
You still don't get it?

121
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,858
Cha Hyun-su and Kim Seok-hyeon.

122
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,153
Do you think
they're the only ones turning?

123
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,449
<i>No. Everyone's scared.</i>

124
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>Because they don't know when they'll turn.</i>

125
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,790
There was someone who knew about this
before the government announcement.

126
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,126
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

127
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,920
It was a blog I found by accident
on the internet.

128
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,422
What did it say?

129
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,549
-Despair.
-What?

130
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,801
It said it's a curse.

131
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,512
And that humans will never overcome it.

132
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,390
You believe a stupid blog post
when you don't even know who wrote it?

133
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,730
Under the circumstances, we shouldn't
ignore even the smallest clues.

134
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,440
CRUCRU
THIS ISN'T A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.

135
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
{\an8}CRUCRU

136
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,611
{\an8}What's "Crucru"?

137
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,739
{\an8}-Is it your blog?
-Hey, Yi-kyung.

138
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,948
Well…

139
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,950
When is it?

140
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,077
Our wedding photoshoot?

141
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:07,995
What?

142
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,080
Did you write you don't want
to get married?

143
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,417
No, it's nothing like that.

144
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,512
-Where are you going?
-There will be more infected people soon.

145
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,806
-So?
-So it's not going to be safe here either.

146
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,349
It's still safer than the outside.

147
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,559
-Do you want to come?
-To where?

148
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,853
A way to survival.

149
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,315
Ji-su.

150
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,494
I think

151
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,038
there's a monster here.

152
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,790
Let's kill it.

153
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,333
We can kill it.

154
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,799
You're scared, aren't you?

155
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,528
Sir!

156
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,449
Don't come!

157
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,576
Don't come near!

158
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,537
Don't come, Sang-wook!

159
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,152
Move.

160
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,198
Are you trying to burn
the whole building down, sir?

161
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,286
We can put out the fire later.
You're so harsh.

162
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,121
It will take ages to get
to the first floor.

163
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:18,375
My goodness. I'm not sure anyone
will still be alive by then.

164
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,340
Be careful.

165
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,345
Who's there?

166
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,405
He's alive.

167
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,284
The monster left him alive?

168
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,506
What are you doing?

169
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,688
<i>I couldn't reach my son's hand.</i>

170
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,607
<i>I couldn't do anything</i>

171
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,317
<i>when the monster took my son.</i>

172
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,028
<i>It was too fast.</i>

173
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,366
<i>If I had caught my son's hand…</i>

174
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,494
<i>If I'd been able to reach that far,</i>

175
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,082
<i>would my son be still alive?</i>

176
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,667
<i>I can't forgive myself.</i>

177
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,002
<i>I'm having nightmares every day.</i>

178
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,504
<i>The monster in my head is telling me</i>
<i>that it's all my fault.</i>

179
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,174
<i>Maybe it will be better</i>
<i>to just become a monster.</i>

180
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,471
<i>No! It's my fault. I should've</i>
<i>held onto him!</i>

181
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>I should've kept my son next to me!</i>

182
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,935
<i>No! There was nothing I could do.</i>

183
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,147
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

184
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,695
GREEN HOME BARBER SHOP

185
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,031
Shouldn't we do something about her?

186
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,782
Just leave her be.

187
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,701
She never associated
with people like us anyway.

188
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,871
She even sent her daughter
to a school in Gangnam.

189
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,625
She should've sent her
to a school close by.

190
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,808
-Are you awake now?
-I don't need any of that.

191
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,063
Yes, you do.

192
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,190
Your bleeding has stopped,
but you're still injured.

193
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,200
Is it okay to let him go like that?

194
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,243
There's no need to worry about him.

195
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,995
I bet he could take on a tiger by himself.

196
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,125
You look pretty hurt, too.

197
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,128
No, I'm fine.

198
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,631
Move that hand.
It'll get infected if you don't treat it.

199
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,133
I'll do it myself. Give me a bandage.

200
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,428
Move that hand, kid.

201
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,099
You're turning, aren't you?

202
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,436
Yu-ri, get away from him.

203
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,606
Put that hand away!

204
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,860
Or else I'll make sure your heart
never beats again.

205
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,040
Get out.

206
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,292
I wouldn't have helped you
if I knew you were a monster.

207
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,961
Get out!

208
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,522
You have such a bad hobby.

209
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,905
I was just kidding.

210
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,490
You don't have to leave.

211
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,078
Why would I be scared of that
when I'm going to die soon, anyway?

212
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,455
-Pardon?
-Yu-ri.

213
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,790
You stay here.

214
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,836
You're going to the 14th floor, right?
And you said there are little kids there.

215
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,046
Yes, that's right.

216
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,592
Don't you need someone
who's not afraid of death?

217
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,094
-Sir!
-You're fired.

218
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,264
You've done well nursing an old man

219
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,724
with a bad temper.

220
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,936
I want to play superhero before I die.

221
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,689
Can you let me join you?

222
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,317
You're just acting tough.

223
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,443
What?

224
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,612
Don't fool yourself.

225
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,322
No one really wants to die.

226
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,662
Is becoming rude one of the symptoms
of turning into a monster?

227
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,415
Let me give you some advice, kid.

228
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,543
Not being afraid of death

229
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,754
and wanting to die are different things.

230
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,592
I'm planning on living longer than anyone.

231
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,237
What are you doing?

232
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,492
What are you hiding back there?

233
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,833
Hey. Are you crazy?

234
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,421
You really…

235
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,466
don't care about me.

236
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,469
What?

237
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,599
If I become a monster,

238
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,436
I'm sure I'll kill you.

239
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,938
You stupid bitch!

240
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,731
But…

241
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,989
I don't want to kill you
when I'm a monster.

242
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,785
That won't make me happy at all.

243
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,873
Jeez. You're talking nonsense.

244
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,166
My gosh.

245
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,636
Ma'am.

246
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,850
Is that man outside the door?

247
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,353
No, he went upstairs.

248
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,939
So don't worry.

249
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,410
He went upstairs?

250
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,171
Shit!

251
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,219
Son of a bitch…

252
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,266
{\an8}I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, ASSHOLE

253
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,882
Son of a bitch…

254
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,287
Have you been well?

255
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,543
What about the lady?

256
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,087
{\an8}SURVIVORS, TURNING, DEAD

257
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,298
{\an8}TURNING: CHA HYUN-SU,
KIM SEOK-HYEON, CHOI YUN-JAE

258
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,690
{\an8}SURVIVORS: LEE EUN-HYEOK,
LEE EUN-YU, YOON JI-SU

259
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,239
Is anyone hearing this?

260
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,411
<i>We're in despair right now.</i>

261
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,581
<i>We don't know</i>

262
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,251
<i>what to do, what's happening,</i>

263
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,004
<i>or how long we can survive this.</i>

264
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,511
<i>But we are still alive.</i>

265
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,055
PREGNANT

266
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,974
<i>We can't overcome this despair.</i>

267
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,351
<i>But…</i>

268
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,105
<i>I'm sure there is an end.</i>

269
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,652
<i>And we will hold out and fight</i>

270
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,696
<i>until that end.</i>

271
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,990
<i>Rest in peace.</i>

272
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,660
<i>I'm going to fight a little longer.</i>

273
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,162
<i>We</i>

274
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,415
<i>will survive.</i>

275
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,311
Hey!

276
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,482
Over here! I don't think I'm turning!

277
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,694
Come and look at this!

278
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,155
Please help me!

279
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,240
Look!

280
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,495
Help me!

281
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,001
My goodness. You must've been scared.

282
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,419
Take care of him.

283
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,379
Why were you in there?

284
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,715
-Just in case.
-I would've lost my mind.

285
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,258
-I'm out now, so it's fine.
-Right…

286
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,594
Are you really cool
or just pretending to be?

287
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,263
Hey, Yun-jae is kind and patient.

288
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,349
-Are you a fan of Hanwha Eagles?
-Yes.

289
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,350
How did you know?

290
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,101
I can tell he's from Chungcheong Province.

291
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,228
But you're not using
any Chungcheong dialect.

292
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,897
I lived in Seoul for a long time.

293
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,485
What is he so nervous about?

294
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,322
-I guess it was really tough for him.
-Maybe.

295
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,033
Amazing. You guys are such hypocrites.

296
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,495
You pretended not to notice
when he was obviously

297
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,205
beaten up by someone,

298
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,790
but now you're acting all nice.

299
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,713
She hit way too close to home.

300
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,465
I feel like shit now. Damn it.

301
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,532
Hey.

302
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,077
That stupid gangster!

303
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,079
He's going to hear you.

304
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,570
He's a murderer.

305
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,406
That man's a murderer!

306
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,128
You fucking murderer.

307
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,964
<i>He has no criminal record</i>

308
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,674
<i>and has no motive.</i>

309
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,801
There isn't any evidence
to prove it was intentional.

310
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,721
And as his future shows great promise,

311
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,265
<i>the court has decided</i>
<i>on the following sentence.</i>

312
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,229
<i>The accused, Hwang Seung-jae,</i>

313
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,441
is sentenced to 11 months in prison
and 2 years of supervised probation.

314
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,237
You shouldn't die like that.

315
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,033
You shouldn't die peacefully.

316
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,662
No…

317
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,791
You don't deserve a humane death.

318
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,383
You…

319
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,223
You fucking murderer…

320
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,766
You don't deserve to live.

321
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,671
Why…

322
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,757
{\an8}I LOVE YOU
DAD, MOM, KAPO

323
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,677
{\an8}Su-yeong, why aren't they
bringing back our dad?

324
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,347
They can't

325
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,016
bring Dad here.

326
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,478
They said it will be too sad
for us if they bring him here.

327
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,566
That doesn't make sense!

328

Grandpa…

330
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,822

331
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,199
We were born human,

332
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,702
so we should die as humans.

333
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,598
Are you okay?

334
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,644
I should be strong

335
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,855
since I'm a mother.

336
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,203
What are you going to do now?

337
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,248
What do you mean?

338
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,125
It's not something
you can deal with alone.

339
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,626
It's not something to brag about.

340
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,548
I'll deal with this on my own.

341
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,635
Yi-kyung…

342
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,727
I still want to congratulate you.

<i>Dinosaurs used to rule the earth,</i>

344
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,068
<i>but they went extinct</i>
<i>about 66 million years ago.</i>

345
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,239
<i>But this also proves that there is</i>
<i>a possibility humans</i>

346
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,617
<i>could also go extinct at any moment.</i>

347
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,879
<i>However, our ancestors</i>
<i>changed in order to survive,</i>

348
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,300
<i>and called it "evolution."</i>

349
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,519
<i>But if we humans are forced</i>
<i>to face an apocalypse,</i>

350
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,145
<i>will we…</i>

351
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,566
<i>choose another form of evolution?</i>

352
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,905
<i>Or will we choose to remain human?</i>

353
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,835
