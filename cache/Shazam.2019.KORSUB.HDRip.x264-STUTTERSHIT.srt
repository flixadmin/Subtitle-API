For years have passed

26

27
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:45,716
That is why I seek a
champion to inherit my magic.

28
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,870
You want me
to do magic?

you're pure of heart

33
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:08,016
and strong in spirit.

00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,217
She's still out there.

171
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,005
I-I know it.

172
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:16,215
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

173
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,930
They run a group home.

174
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,881
I can take care of myself.

175
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:22,259
When you're 18.

176
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:23,728
Until then,

177
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,187
I won't have you
living on the streets

178
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:27,925
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

179
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,566
Give these people a chance.

180
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,621
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

181
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:35,032
You're out of options.

182
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,445
All right, let's get the spiel.

183
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,432
Just know that me and Rosa,
we get it.

184
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:51,049
We were foster kids
back in the day.

185
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:52,447
Ooh, back in the dark ages.

186
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:53,710
Girl!

187
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:55,058
I'm young at heart.

188
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,696
Got my finger on the pulse.

189
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,684
Yeah, that's a reference to his
blood pressure because he's old.

190
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,158
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

191
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:02,892
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cookin'.

192
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,571
- Oy, guerito!
- What?

193
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,995
We know how overwhelming
it can all be.

194
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,607
New house, new faces.

195
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,337
All up in your face.

196
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:14,795
Just...
take it at your own speed.

197
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,066
Hello?

198
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,660
We're home!

199
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,772
That's what happens
when you suck!

200
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:36,785
So much for the welcome party.

201
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,955
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

202
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,743
Is that him?

203
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,442
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

204
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:44,982
Whoa, slow down, slow down!

205
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,420
Welcome home!

206
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,149
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

207
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:49,188
Big hugger.

208
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:50,313
I noticed.

209
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,436
Die! Die! Die!

210
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,828
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

211
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,292
Hey.

212
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,291
No sodas after dark, remember?

213
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,694
Whoa. When did it get dark?

214
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:05,316
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

215
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:07,947
Oh, no!

216
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,436
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

217
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,352
He was supposed
to be at school.

218
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:15,448
Oh.

219
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:16,596
Here.

220
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:18,915
Yes.

221
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,079
Exactly why your Math Department
is so uniquely suited for me.

222
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,202
I can't, I can't even...
with Eugene right now.

223
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,019
Sorry. Mary. Hi.

224
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,226
College interview.

225
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,610
- I'm Billy.
- What am I most excited about?

226
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:31,991
Oh.

227
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,920
What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

228
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:39,580
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

229
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:42,052
What I'm most excited about

230
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,530
is the campus experience.

231
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:45,199
As a foster child,
I'm a big believer

232
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,704
in finding family and
friends in the most

233
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,350
unlikely of places.

234
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,395
Oh, I'm gonna miss
that girl so much!

235
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,278
It's Caltech,
it's a very prestigious school.

236
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,263
And also all the way
in California.

237
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:00,575
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

238
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,251
It's a tough subject for me.

239
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,509
Do you like vegan food?

240
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,414
- Mm-mm.
- 'Cause, see, I love animals.

241
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,142
Oh, no! The tofurkey!

242
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,196
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

243
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:13,941
- Is that?
- It's okay. Come, I'll show you your room.

244
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,973
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but,

245
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:18,121
it's fun!

246
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,271
Watch the bumps there.

247
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,755
Pedro, mi amor, hola.

248
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:24,971
Say hi to Billy.

249
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:29,323
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

250
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,350
Freddy.

251
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,079
This is Billy Batson.

252
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,806
Make sure you make him
feel at home, okay?

253
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,863
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

254
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:43,156
Oh, one weird thing is

255
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,775
you know the Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

256
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,409
Apparently, it-it works.

257
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,466
Yup, um...

258
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,324
Oh, it's, uh...
it's a long way down.

259
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,082
Trust me, I speak from experience.

260
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:10,350
Victor pushed me.

261
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,258
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

262
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,644
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

263
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:19,298
What?

264
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:23,038
Dude, I'm... just messin' around.

265
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,703
It's um, it's terminal cancer, I...

266
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,687
I have three months.

267
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,265
Kidding, again!

268
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,609
You look at me and you're, like,
"Why so dark?"

269
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:34,086
"You're a disabled foster kid,
you've got it all." Right?

270
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,073
Oh, yeah, that's the, uh,
the old batarang.

271
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,863
I mean, it's a replica, but...

272
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,410
Feel how sharp.

273
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,374
Could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

274
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,987
You ever a Supes guy?

275
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:48,790
Yeah, me too.

276
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,304
Behold, the holy grail.

277
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:53,886
One nine millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

278
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,194
It's legit.

279
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:57,991
Probably worth, I dunno,
$5-600, maybe more.

280
00:18:58,816 --> 00:18:59,872
What's in the bag?

281
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,095
Hey.

282
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,414
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

283
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:06,809
You don't gotta
talk so much, you know.

284
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:10,504
I mean, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

285
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:36,402
Dinner!

286
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,357
All hands on deck!

287
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:48,679
Sweet.

288
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,275
Thank you for this family.

289
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:51,880
Thank you for this day.

290
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,592
Thank you for this food.

291
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,567
Even if it's not steak fillet.

292
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,555
Big school. 2,000 students,
you might think,

293
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,393
"Wow, so many strangers."

294
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,039
But not if you think of them as

295
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,595
possible for each friend then,

296
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:08,133
"Oh, so many friends."

297
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,432
The principal, her name's
Shirley. She's the best.

298
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,791
Next.

299
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,469
This is our security scanner.

300
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,636
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

301
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,312
I know what it is.

302
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,148
Does she always do this?

303
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,160
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

304
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,569
She's almost never uncomfortable.

305
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,777
Have a good first day,
big brother.

306
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,785
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

307
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,230
We're not actually
brother and sister, so.

308
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,336
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,855
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,760
I-I didn't mean to make her...

311
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,119
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

312
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,728
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.</i>

313
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,587
<i>He called himself a wizard.</i>

314
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,322
<i>Just like a...</i>

315
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,116
<i>a wizard from Harry Potter, some...</i>

316
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,241
<i>But y-you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

317
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,776
In a sense, yes.

318
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,522
Do you remember
what he said to you?

319
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,736
<i>He tested me.</i>

320
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,034
<i>There were these statues.</i>

321
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,196
<i>Their eyes, it's like
they were looking at me,</i>

322
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,025
<i>making me think things.</i>

323
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:22,685
<i>Like, horrible things.</i>

324
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,457
And do these approximate
what you saw?

325
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:30,119
<i>Yes. That's exactly
how I remember it.</i>

326
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,503
<i>I-I don't understand.
How do you know...?</i>

327
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,506
Recurring imagery has
proven very common

328
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:36,503
in cases of mass hysteria.

329
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:37,979
<i>"Mass hysteria"?</i>

330
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,089
I know.

331
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,932
The term's a bit theatrical.

332
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,316
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

333
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,789
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

334
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:49,202
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

335
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,516
Symbols.

336
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,030
Ask her about the symbols.

337
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,786
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.

338
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:01,580
But as an example of
recurring imagery,

339
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:03,593
maybe you recall seeing

340
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,356
these symbols before
the alleged abduction?

341
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:09,576
<i>Don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

342
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:13,602
<i>I think I caught it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

343
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,294
<i>I remember the numbers on
my alarm clock, they kept</i>

344
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:17,622
<i>shifting.</i>

345
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,835
Video?

346
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,141
Show me the video.

347
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:24,982
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

348
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:27,827
<i>Um, one moment,
I can send it.</i>

349
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:30,557
<i>Hello?</i>

350
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:33,263
<i>Oh, my God!
Who's there?</i>

351
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:35,508
<i>Hello?</i>

352
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,319
<i>What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

353
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,949
<i>I'm-I'm going
to call the police.</i>

354
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:45,091
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me.</i>

355
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:47,467
<i>And I felt like I was
getting pulled down...</i>

356
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:50,432
<i>Like a temple
carved inside a mountain...</i>

357
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:53,655
<i>Exactly what you'd expect from
a guy who call himself a wizard.</i>

358
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,242
<i>...brought there
to save the world.</i>

359
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,122
Dr. Sivana!

360
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:03,361
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

361
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,671
but you're funding my project.

362
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,702
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

363
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,046
56 reported abductions.

364
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,929
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

365
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,648
Doctor, what is all this?

366
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:32,975
All these years...

367
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:36,677
I was convinced

368
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:39,360
I had the incorrect sequence.

369
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,972
Or perhaps...

370
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:44,709
the wrong symbols
to open the door.

371
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:48,107
But on that woman's alarm clock,

372
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:50,975
the seven symbols.

373
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:53,534
The sequence

374
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:55,581
repeating itself

375
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:58,102
seven times.

376
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:01,069
That's the difference.

377
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,927
Is this some sort of joke?

378
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:04,903
It may seem that way to you.

379
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,424
Because we're not, in actuality,

380
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:09,393
studying mass hysteria.

381
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:11,536
What all these people have seen,

382
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,294
every single one of them,

383
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,136
is absolutely real.

384
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:19,086
An alarm clock malfunctions,

385
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,206
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

386
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,449
Come on, Dr. Sivana.

387
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:26,757
You can't believe
any of this is real.

388
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,179
Why, yes.

389
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,388
Yes, I do.

390
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,796
I've been waiting
for this moment

391
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:31,318
for so long.

392
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,355
And now, here we are.

393
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,864
You don't remember me, do you?

394
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,775
I remember you.

395
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:48,878
You were a boy.

396
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,007
Now, you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

397
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:53,029
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told,

398
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,927
"You'll never be good enough"?

399
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:56,410
No, you don't.

400
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:59,211
What you said to me
all those years ago

401
00:25:59,404 --> 00:26:01,833
made me realize
who I really was.

402
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,345
And you know something?

403
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:07,918
I am not pure of heart.

404
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:13,314
The wizard is too weak
to stop us.

405
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:16,794
No.

406
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:18,293
No!

407
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:30,374
You never found your champion.

408
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,651
But we found ours.

409
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:53,197
You are the true champion.

410
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,243
They're using you.

411
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:28,760
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

412
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,936
Through you, they'll spread the
poison to everything they touch!

413
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:41,852
Make mankind
turn on each other.

414
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,441
You seek a pure soul, old man.

415
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:47,413
But no one's worthy.

416
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,293
Flight or invisibility?

417
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,005
If you could have
one superpower,

418
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,759
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

419
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:06,969
Everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

420
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:08,788
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

421
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,106
No, no,  'cause heroes fly.

422
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,109
Who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

423
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:15,636
But-But invisibility, no way,
I mean, that's perfect.

424
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,661
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

425
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,837
Sneaking around everywhere.

426
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,539
It's a total villain power, right?

427
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:29,682
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

428
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,836
They asked people
the same question,

429
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,392
You know, what power
do you want? But this time,

430
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:33,980
they made it so the
answers were anonymous.

431
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:36,091
And-And most people, since
they knew that it was secret,

432
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,282
said invisibility.

433
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:38,480
And I think that's
'cause most people

434
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:41,029
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

435
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,593
You're gonna run away.

436
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,703
I mean, you stole my
Superman bullet.

437
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,682
But dude, I get it, I get it.

438
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:49,411
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

439
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:50,899
You don't trust anyone.

440
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:53,248
But that's the thing
about invisibility.

441
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:55,256
You handle it by yourself.

442
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:58,761
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

443
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:06,212
Hey, how was it today?

444
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,551
That good, huh?

445
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:12,636
Whoa!

446
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,571
Oh, my God! Freddy!

447
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:16,984
You okay?

448
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:20,908
What the hell?

449
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,585
What is wrong with you two?

450
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,488
No way that's gonna buff out.

451
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,043
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

452
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,024
Uh, for the dent you made
almost hitting me?

453
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,394
Yeah, sure, um,
do you guys take these?

454
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,556
Brett, stop!

455
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:38,384
Don't touch my brother!

456
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,749
What, you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

457
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:42,436
- Stand up for yourself, man.
- Yeah, huh?

458
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,047
Here, stand up.
Stand up for yourself.

459
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,918
What are you gonna do?
Go home and cry to mommy?

460
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:49,062
Oh, yeah, you don't
have a mommy.

461
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,171
Stop hurting him!

462
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:52,267
Hey!

463
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,738
Man, sorry about that.

464
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:57,896
That wasn't fair, but,

465
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,661
then again,
you don't fight fair, so.

466
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:07,492
Back off, assbags, I know
how to use these things!

467
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:10,738
Oh!

468
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,640
Hey! He's gettin' away!

469
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:17,291
Freddy, you okay?

470
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,253
Nowhere to run!

471
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,457
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him!

472
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:35,078
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

473
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:37,654
Whoa!

474
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:39,992
No, no, no, no!

475
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,268
You're dead, kid!

476
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,039
Yeah, you think you're funny?

477
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:45,457
I know where you
go to school, buddy!

478
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,787
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.</i>

479
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,415
<i>Change for the Regional Rail Line.</i>

480
00:31:12,426 --> 00:31:13,815
Hello?

481
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:15,656
What's going on?

482
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:31,277
Help!

483
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,057
Holy moley.

484
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:21,573
Hello?

485
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:37,884
What the hell?

486
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,109
Who-Who's doing this?!

487
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,389
Hi, um...

488
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,627
I was supposed
to get off at 30th.

489
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,080
Billy Batson.

490
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,188
How'd you know my name?

491
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:23,863
I am the last of the
consul of wizards.

492
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:27,013
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

493
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:28,809
Oh.

494
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:30,938
You're

495
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,374
that guy.

496
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,158
Listen, I don't have any money.

497
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,646
Do not patronize me, boy!

498
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:42,280
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

499
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:44,502
The Rock of Eternity.

500
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:47,495
Seven foes, seven wizards.

501
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:51,052
But long ago,
we chose a champion.

502
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,415
And we chose recklessly.

503
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,272
He used his power for revenge.

504
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:03,843
Releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into the world.

505
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,012
Millions of lives were lost.

506
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:15,156
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

507
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:22,166
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

508
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,943
until I find one
truly good person.

509
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:29,045
Strong in spirit.

510
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:30,982
Pure in heart.

511
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:35,930
Look, man, maybe this is magic.

512
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,095
And I don't know, but,

513
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,456
the people you're looking for,
good, pure people...

514
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:43,255
I'm not one of them.

515
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,338
I-I don't know if anyone is, really.

516
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,598
You, Billy Batson, are all I have.

517
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,283
All the world has.

518
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:58,314
Lay your hands on this staff.

519
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,472
Gross.

520
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:02,687
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

521
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,373
I open my heart to
you, Billy Batson.

522
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:10,614
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

523
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:13,340
Thanks. Don't scream
at me, mister, but

524
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,848
I really gotta get going.

525
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:18,574
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the sins.

526
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:21,763
Their thrones lie empty!

527
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,526
My magic must be passed on.

528
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:25,872
Now...

529
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,959
Speak my name!

530
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:29,901
I-I don't know your name, sir.

531
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:31,108
We just met.

532
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:34,091
My name is...

533
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,821
Shazam.

534
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,303
Wait, for real?

535
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:41,056
- Say it!
- Okay.

536
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,582
Jeez.

537
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,025
Should I say it?

538
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,493
Like,

539
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:58,001
Shazam?

540
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:00,081
Yes!

541
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:01,402
Carry my name

542
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,517
and with it, you
carry all of my powers.

543
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,946
The wisdom of Solomon!

544
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,346
The strength of Hercules!

545
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:07,950
The stamina of Atlas!

546
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,681
The power of Zeus!

547
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,353
The courage of Achilles!

548
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,467
And speed of Mercury!

549
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,807
What happened to me?
Why am I...?

550
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:27,975
W-W-What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

551
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:32,083
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

552
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,726
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

553
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:39,898
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await!

554
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,085
Huh! Oh!

555
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,461
Get me outta here!

556
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,839
Dope!

557
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:02,080
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

558
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,497
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape!

559
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,046
It shouldn't work,
but, hot damn, it does!

560
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,146
Hey!

561
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:22,905
Hey, babe!

562
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:32,547
Yes, officer, I'm aware
he's run away in the past, I...

563
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,534
23 times?

564
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:37,287
He's got no social
media presence

565
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:38,604
at all.

566
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:40,772
The guy's a ghost.

567
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,207
You know guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

568
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:06,636
More than happy.

569
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:09,165
Then you gotta wash the dishes,
that's what's more important.

570
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:11,681
What are you gonna do, Freddy?
Run after him? Ha-ha-ha!

571
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,066
Very funny!

572
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,108
No, wait, don't scream.

573
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,969
Uh, Victor! Victor! Victor!

574
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:19,776
It's me! It's Billy!
It's Billy!

575
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:22,185
You asked me,
"Flight or invisibility?"

576
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,999
I thought that was stupid,
but now I look like this

577
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,475
and I need your help!

578
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,602
Meet me back here
after lights out?

579
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,676
What's up, bud? You all right?

580
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,535
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,038
I'm just...

582
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,276
I'm really... sad.

583
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:37,776
Because Billy's gone.

584
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:38,969
And you know,

585
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,119
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

586
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,851
Uh, you know, maybe I-I snore.

587
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:46,000
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

588
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:48,037
We'll find him, 'kay?

589
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,374
You don't snore that bad.

590
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:53,056
But you kinda smell.

591
00:39:03,078 --> 00:39:04,819
Oh, oh, oh, thank God!

592
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:06,887
Hey, stop right there.

593
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:09,673
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

594
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,567
to make me believe
that you're Billy, huh?

595
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,031
All I have to do is
press dial on this thing.

596
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:16,645
No, no, I have proof,
I have proof, here.

597
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:19,199
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

598
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:21,856
- Oop! No, no, no! No!
- No! No!

599
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:24,547
Stupid adult hands!

600
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:26,427
But you saw it.
You saw it, right?

601
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,065
Look, Freddy,
I swear it's me, okay?

602
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:30,973
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

603
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,204
but you're the only
person that I know

604
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:34,275
that knows anything about
this Caped Crusader stuff.

605
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,413
- That's Batman.
- What?

606
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:38,156
Forget it.

607
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:40,740
Can I...?

608
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,726
Oh, yeah, yeah.

609
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,957
Oh!

610
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:54,775
Oh, my God!

611
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:56,857
It's crazy, right?

612
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:59,024
What are your superpowers?

613
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:01,995
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing!

614
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:03,853
Okay, c-can you fly?

615
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:07,731
Okay, let's do this.

616
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,956
How do we do this?

617
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,533
Just, um, just like Superman it.

618
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:13,826
Pkkwwff.

619
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:16,346
Pkkwf.

620
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:18,150
Obviously, you have to jump.

621
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:19,429
Come on.

622
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,088
How is that even obvious?

623
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,407
Okay.

624
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,717
Try, uh, t-to believe
that you can fly.

625
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,690
Okay, I read this deep dive in the
pyramid studies of superpowers

626
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:31,215
and in 6 out of 10,
belief is the key.

627
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,577
Belief, belief, belief.
Okay, okay.

628
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,602
I believe I can fly.
I believe I...

629
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,648
I believe I can fly.

630
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:39,074
I...

631
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,670
Did you believe?

632
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:53,223
Yeah.

633
00:40:53,477 --> 00:40:54,802
You wanna try invisibility?

634
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,521
How do I do...?

635
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:00,410
You... Forget it. You know.
Okay, okay, okay.

636
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:06,090
Oh, my God! It worked!

637
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:07,661
Where'd you go?

638
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,429
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

639
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:11,802
Where?

640
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:13,829
I'm invisible!

641
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,543
I'm right here.
I'm over here.

642
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:18,496
I'm invisible!

643
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,641
I'm invisible!

644
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,079
Hey! Nice outfit, dipshit!

645
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:24,956
I-I might have

646
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:28,093
been testing invisibility and super
intelligence at the same time.

647
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,540
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

648
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:39,894
Oh, my God!

649
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:42,989
The lightning, it was staring us
right in the face the whole time!

650
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:45,288
Literally!

651
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:54,690
Okay, okay.

652
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,713
Clearly, we gotta give you a
lightning-themed superhero name.

653
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:57,786
Yeah.

654
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:09,995
Oh, right.

655
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:11,566
Hey, you, back...

656
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,497
off.

657
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,455
Hyperspeed, check!

658
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:19,938
I... I'm sorry-I'm so sorry.

659
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:21,556
I thought you were the
one who was screaming.

660
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:23,374
I doused him with pepper spray.

661
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:25,252
Smart move.

662
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:26,764
Yeah, hey, get up,
mister mugger guy!

663
00:42:26,826 --> 00:42:28,166
Give the old lady
her purse back.

664
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:29,707
Um, I'm your age.

665
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:32,636
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

666
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:35,668
Good, yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

667
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:37,393
And that should teach
you that old ladies,

668
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:39,581
regular-aged ladies
like yourself

669
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:41,298
don't need your protecting.

670
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:42,847
Right? So get off, bro.

671
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,572
I'm sorry, who are you?

672
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:47,362
His name is Thundercrack!

673
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:48,892
Hero to the people.

674
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:51,045
With the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

675
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,839
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

676
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:57,167
- Mr. Philadelphia!
- That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

677
00:42:57,222 --> 00:42:58,861
Powerboy,
'cause he's got all the powers.

678
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,745
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

679
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:04,208
Powerboy, do you know this child?

680
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,722
Like, like a teeny little bit.

681
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:08,751
I don't really know...

682
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:11,042
Yeah, he's, like, my manager.
He's like a miniature manager.

683
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,878
- I'm his manager.
- And uh, you know.

684
00:43:12,987 --> 00:43:15,345
Powerboy's not gonna work either,
okay? So work on something else...

685
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,847
Hey, hey, hey...

686
00:43:22,115 --> 00:43:25,385
Electricity manipulation,
hyperspeed, super strength!

687
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,503
Dude, you're stacked!

688
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:28,898
You're as cool as Superman!
Almost.

689
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:30,875
I didn't see you. I don't know
what just happened here.

690
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,462
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

691
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,211
- Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

692
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,625
No, no, no, but if you
need any more help,

693
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,471
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

694
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,651
Forget flying, man,
we just made 73 bucks!

695
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,096
73 bucks?

696
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,973
Come on!

697
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,018
Hey, wait a minute.

698
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,379
I just got an idea.

699
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,794
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

700
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:14,877
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID.

701
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,750
Freddy, would you relax?

702
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,611
Look at me, I am the fake ID.

703
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,304
Everything from the register!
Go! Go!

704
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:23,010
Now! Come on!

705
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:25,188
I don't have much time!
Let's go! Move!

706
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:26,702
I want it all! Hurry!

707
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:27,870
This is your chance.

708
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:29,572
Oh! I... okay.

709
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,099
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

710
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:38,175
Gentlemen!

711
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,991
Why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

712
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,489
Billy, look out!

713
00:44:57,252 --> 00:45:00,096
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

714
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,440
I'm bulletproof.

715
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:05,276
Today is December 8th,

716
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:07,946
and this is video proof
of authenticity.

717
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:09,870
Shoot him again.

718
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,491
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here.

719
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:13,524
Go, both of you, come on.
Go to town.

720
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:21,787
W-W-W-Wait!

721
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:25,151
We still don't know if the suit
is bulletproof or if you are.

722
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:27,870
Shoot him in the face.

723
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,542
Shoot me in the...
in the face?

724
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:38,853
It kinda tickles.

725
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:41,228
You're dead.

726
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:48,635
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night.

727
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,539
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

728
00:45:50,888 --> 00:45:51,928
Come on!

729
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:53,222
Let's get outta here!

730
00:45:53,899 --> 00:45:54,962
Hey.

731
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:56,994
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

732
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,945
That tastes like actual vomit.

733
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:06,949
You know,

734
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,947
habanero jerky,
if you eat enough of it,

735
00:46:08,972 --> 00:46:10,731
it could burn a hole
in your stomach.

736
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,399
- Worth it.
- Yeah.

737
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:14,751
Probably not you though.
Probably got stomach superpowers.

738
00:46:14,776 --> 00:46:15,782
Probably.

739
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,821
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm a superhero.

740
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:19,370
Yeah, his name is, uh,

741
00:46:19,538 --> 00:46:21,046
Captain Sparkle Fingers.

742
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:23,283
No it's not. No it's not!
It's not my name!

743
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,240
Hey, we should hang out.
We're like, the same age.

744
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:26,941
Ho! po-po. I'm out.

745
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,616
Hey, wait up!

746
00:46:35,146 --> 00:46:37,098
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

747
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:40,643
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

748
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,613
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

749
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:48,422
I mean, no offense, but like,

750
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:51,432
like, at first, you were kinda
like the opposite of how

751
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:52,899
of how Darla is.

752
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:55,870
A dick?

753
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,735
Your words, not mine.

754
00:46:58,261 --> 00:46:59,405
But yeah.

755
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:02,540
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

756
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:04,470
was either on drugs
or asleep by now.

757
00:47:05,175 --> 00:47:06,370
Wanna head home?

758
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:08,673
Looking like this?

759
00:47:08,698 --> 00:47:10,648
Yeah. I mean,

760
00:47:10,673 --> 00:47:13,464
usually we'd have
a lair to go back to, but

761
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,887
that's long term.

762
00:47:15,258 --> 00:47:16,892
Right now you have a bunk bed.

763
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:24,620
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

764
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,636
This is what he does, Rosa.

765
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:30,175
Difference is when
they find him,

766
00:47:30,268 --> 00:47:32,495
we'll be the first
to take him back

767
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,132
with open arms.

768
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:39,266
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

769
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:41,855
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back then.

770
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,539
At least, I did.

771
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:47,388
Even Mary did it, twice.

772
00:47:49,775 --> 00:47:51,608
That second time she ran off,

773
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:53,744
you said something
to me I'll never forget.

774
00:47:54,448 --> 00:47:55,749
You said,

775
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,870
"It's not a home till
you call it a home.

776
00:47:58,097 --> 00:47:59,798
"It's something you choose."

777
00:48:02,554 --> 00:48:05,570
All we can do is
give him a place full of love.

778
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:08,462
Whether he chooses
to call it a home,

779
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:09,891
that's up to him.

780
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,748
Gonna help me with this tree?

781
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:19,849
This tree's so sad.

782
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:23,003
H-Hello?

783
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,952
Got lost finding the bathroom.

784
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:27,185
Oh, okay, Freddy,
sweetie, goodnight.

785
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,670
- Night.
- Night.

786
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:31,847
Freddy, who was that?

787
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:35,298
It's Billy, he's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

788
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:37,215
- What? Laryngitis?
- I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

789
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,016
He's really, really tired and he
wants to go beddy bye.

790
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,038
- Beddy bye? What's beddy bye?
- Just hide, hide.

791
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:42,840
Billy, you're back!
Let us see you!

792
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,236
We're so worried about you.

793
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:48,307
I told you this was a bad idea!

794
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:49,500
Freddy?

795
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,255
Hey, what happened
to the stairs?

796
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,443
Hey, covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

797
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:57,459
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

798
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,377
Darla, it's me, it's Billy.

799
00:49:01,402 --> 00:49:03,377
I know I don't look like me.
A wizard made me look like this.

800
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,496
Maybe don't start with wizard,

801
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:05,788
it's just gonna make
her more confused.

802
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,501
Some old guy brought
me to a temple

803
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:08,984
and he made me say "Shazam"...

804
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:11,712
Rosa!

805
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:14,677
Verbally-triggered body
manipulation properties!

806
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,542
You can switch
by saying "Shazam!"

807
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:20,877
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

808
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,027
Um...

809
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:24,533
I-I was screwing in a bulb.

810
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:28,058
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

811
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,937
But it's Billy, he's a hero.

812
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:31,440
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

813
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:33,005
that endangers us, okay?

814
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,777
A hero's loved ones are, like,
a perfect bad guy target.

815
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,907
I-Is she good
at keeping secrets?

816
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:39,109
Moderate.

817
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:40,458
- No.
- Oh, God.

818
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:41,863
Okay, listen, D,

819
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:44,793
you cannot tell a single soul
about this all right? Please.

820
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,202
Why? What if it's
people we trust?

821
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:52,410
'Cause good sisters
don't tell secrets.

822
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:54,873
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

823
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:56,502
You know what would make
you an even better sister?

824
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,737
Is when you fix the-
the doorknob for us.

825
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,769
Sweet dreams.

826
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:00,824
Sweet dreams, all right.

827
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:02,246
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

828
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:09,689
Hello, sir, how may I help you?

829
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,134
Hi, sir.

830
00:50:11,997 --> 00:50:13,283
Sir, you can't go in there.

831
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:15,317
Excuse me!
You cannot go in there!

832
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:22,078
Sorry I'm late.

833
00:50:22,203 --> 00:50:24,756
Thad, this is for
board members only.

834
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:26,282
I'm aware of that, Father.

835
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:30,717
Now...

836
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:34,492
That night, in the car...

837
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:36,720
I swore to you
I saw something

838
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,507
but you never believed me.

839
00:50:38,851 --> 00:50:41,891
So much easier to blame
me, wasn't it?

840
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:45,667
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

841
00:50:45,773 --> 00:50:47,292
you'd still have your legs.

842
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,368
Well, now, I have proof.

843
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:54,958
That's enough, Thad.

844
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:56,341
Dear Sid.

845
00:50:56,785 --> 00:50:57,991
You think?

846
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,903
You know,
even before the accident,

847
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:03,235
you belittled me.

848
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,754
Don't make me throw you
out of here, Thad.

849
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:08,338
You don't need to make a scene.

850
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:09,953
Oh, brother...

851
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:11,511
The scene

852
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,233
has only just begun.

853
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,554
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

854
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:20,028
What?

855
00:51:20,053 --> 00:51:22,607
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

856
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:28,547
Let me spoil it for you.

857
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:38,313
Outlook...

858
00:51:38,947 --> 00:51:40,439
not so good.

859
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:45,353
I've come here during
the season of giving

860
00:51:45,617 --> 00:51:47,133
to give you...

861
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:52,333
what you deserve.

862
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,757
Oh, my God!

863
00:52:51,056 --> 00:52:53,207
No! No!

864
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,399
No!

865
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:09,114
Oh!

866
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,401
Help!

867
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:12,422
Somebody!

868
00:53:12,632 --> 00:53:15,140
Help me!

869
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:17,810
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

870
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:23,047
What sin best befits
you, Father? Hmm?

871
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:24,882
I'll give you anything.

872
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:26,485
Money...

873
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:28,851
The company?
You want the company?

874
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,799
There it is.

875
00:53:32,348 --> 00:53:33,538
Greed.

876
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,822
Do you honestly think

877
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,404
all this

878
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:40,544
material you've accumulated

879
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:44,457
amounts to actual power?

880
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:49,884
This... is power.

881
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:53,224
More than you ever had.

882
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,716
More than anyone has.

883
00:53:56,864 --> 00:53:59,872
There is one more powerful.

884
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,565
The wizard found his champion.

885
00:54:04,684 --> 00:54:06,668
Kill the champion

886
00:54:06,724 --> 00:54:10,406
before he learns
his true potential.

887
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,268
Or he will defeat you.

888
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:15,368
Show me where to find him.

889
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:32,657
Oh, Greed...

890
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:35,170
you can have him.

891
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:37,522
No.

892
00:54:39,673 --> 00:54:40,681
No!

893
00:54:41,897 --> 00:54:43,040
No!

894
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:45,078
No!

895
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:06,427
<i>Family is more
than just a word.</i>

896
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:09,073
<i>At Sivana Industries,</i>

897
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:11,393
<i>our focus is family.</i>

898
00:55:35,394 --> 00:55:37,339
Uh, Burke?

899
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:40,998
Where's the truck?

900
00:55:50,372 --> 00:55:51,674
I can hear it.

901
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:04,310
- Oh, my God!
- My truck!

902
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,876
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

903
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:08,821
You know, guys...

904
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,279
I don't think that's
gonna buff out.

905
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,721
Making the cripple kid
do the dirty work, wow.

906
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:26,008
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

907
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,366
And I can't?

908
00:56:28,215 --> 00:56:29,899
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

909
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:31,715
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

910
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,403
- M-My face? This face?
- Yeah.

911
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:35,852
Okay.

912
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:43,127
You boys got a hall pass?

913
00:56:43,581 --> 00:56:45,843
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

914
00:56:46,658 --> 00:56:47,785
You.

915
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,234
You look like
you're up to somethin'.

916
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:54,734
Me? Up to something?
No. Never.

917
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:56,021
I'm not up to something.

918
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,625
Our dad's picking us up.

919
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,227
He, uh, he got held up at the...
the business

920
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:01,261
office.

921
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:03,062
The business office, huh?

922
00:57:03,116 --> 00:57:04,203
Sure, kid.

923
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:05,307
Look.

924
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:08,942
Parents or guardians
must appear physically

925
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,633
to check out students.

926
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:11,967
Gotcha.

927
00:57:12,165 --> 00:57:14,078
Okay, well, uh,
you hear that, Dad?

928
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:15,403
- Hey.
- Shazam!

929
00:57:16,278 --> 00:57:17,534
Oh, hey, there, son!

930
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,622
Oh, hey, there,
other son that I also have

931
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:21,792
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

932
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:24,331
I'm so sorry I'm late,
I got held up

933
00:57:24,356 --> 00:57:26,567
at the business office.

934
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:28,128
Doing all the work stuff.

935
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,190
This is the-the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

936
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,220
Oh.

937
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:34,997
That's the other one.
This one sucks.

938
00:57:35,074 --> 00:57:37,145
This is... that's not funny.

939
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:40,396
I gotta talk to him about that.
I apologize.

940
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,992
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

941
00:57:42,017 --> 00:57:43,825
to check my sons out of school.

942
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,769
So, thank you so much
for keeping them safe,

943
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,653

seas below it.

- Like waterfall, so you can, like...

1055
01:01:51,654 --> 01:01:52,780
Why don't you just

1056
01:01:52,805 --> 01:01:54,742
start with how many
bedrooms you're looking for?

1057
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:55,838
- One.
- Seven.

1058
01:01:55,863 --> 01:01:56,902
- One?
- Seven?

1059
01:01:56,927 --> 01:01:59,154
What? Am I runnin'
a foster home now?

1060
01:02:10,242 --> 01:02:12,503
See the one where he throws
the football into space?

1061
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:13,562
So dope.

1062

wonder who's filming those, right?

1063
01:02:15,563 --> 01:02:17,309
I mean, that's bravery
in and of itself.

1064
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,247
I mean, is it though?

1065
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:21,575
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

1066
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:23,040
Holding a camera?

1067
01:02:23,629 --> 01:02:25,646
Staring in the face of danger.

1068
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:27,570

1070
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:31,683

if I were you.

1071
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:34,608

us with a wheelchair this time?

1072
01:02:34,643 --> 01:02:36,667
No, maybe not him but
I have another best friend.

1073
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,949
Who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

1074
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:41,268
- Okay, Freddy.
- You may have heard of him.

1075
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:43,619
Uh, uh, the Human Powerstorm.

1076

Sir-Zaps-A-Lot.

1078
01:02:47,817 --> 01:02:49,896
You know the Red Cyclone?
You?

1079
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:51,869
Huh. My ass, you do.

1080
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,722
Oh, we're a lot
closer than you think.

1081
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,716
Maybe even at this very moment.

1082
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,922
Prove it.

1083
01:02:56,947 --> 01:03:00,048
I will tomorrow. Tomorrow
he's gonna come to lunch and...

1084
01:03:00,112 --> 01:03:01,288
R-Right, Billy?

1085
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,458
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's

1086
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:04,561
gonna be bringing us
dessert, right?

1087
01:03:07,186 --> 01:03:09,102
Tomorrow, at lunch.
You'll see.

1088
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:11,242
And when he doesn't show, then

1089
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:12,655
we'll kick your ass.

1090
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:16,891
So wait, my identity's a secret

1091
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,724
so no one I know can get hurt.

1092
01:03:19,148 --> 01:03:20,765
Except when it makes
you look cool, then

1093
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,188
then it's all good.

1094
01:03:22,213 --> 01:03:23,730
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains

1095
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:25,048
they're just super douchebags.

1096
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:27,773
So you're breaking your own rule?

1097
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,229
Got it.

1098
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:32,390
This thing is as much as
mine as it is yours.

1099
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,664
I'm starting to think you
think it's all your thing.

1100
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:38,108
Billy, you're still gonna
do it, though, right?

1101
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,492
I mean, what would
a good brother do?

1102
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,948
All hands on deck!

1103
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:50,171
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

1104
01:03:50,229 --> 01:03:51,801
Thank you for this food.

1105
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:53,952
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

1106
01:03:57,819 --> 01:04:00,533
Big news in Philly.
They found a costumed hero.

1107
01:04:01,098 --> 01:04:02,336
He's doing good.

1108
01:04:02,603 --> 01:04:04,230
Yeah, but is he, though?

1109
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:06,384
Oooh, controversy.

1110
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,418
Into it.

1111
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,265
Share with us your
perspective, Eugene.

1112
01:04:10,658 --> 01:04:13,627
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

1113
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:16,780
So what? I can charge a phone...
with a plug.

1114
01:04:16,814 --> 01:04:18,060
Preach.

1115
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,532
Pedro, any thoughts?

1116
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,636
Costume's stupid?

1117
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,696
Big white cape like, he's
getting married or something.

1118
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,984
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1119
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:30,889
Ever think about that?

1120
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:33,260
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1121
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:34,935
Yeah, Freddy, let's

1122
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,930
manage to see the positive.

1123
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,067
Okay, well, I think
it looks like

1124
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,533
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1125
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:44,028
Very specific. All right.

1126
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,238
Maybe to this superhero,

1127
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:47,364
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1128
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,917
"Clingy", wow, interesting take.

1129
01:04:48,942 --> 01:04:51,166
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just

1130
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:52,739
wants a little me time.

1131
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,862
You know, me time can
also be construed as

1132
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:56,108
pushing away his family.

1133
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,246
Family. Is that
what they are now?

1134
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,097
It's a classic symptom of
superhero syndrome

1135
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:02,373
coined by German psychologist

1136
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,334
Heinrich de Von...
German something, where

1137
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:06,980
superpowers become an
all-consuming narcotic.

1138
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,483
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1139
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:12,268
What he needs is a sidekick.

1140
01:05:12,293 --> 01:05:14,216
Name one cool sidekick.

1141
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:17,577
Darla, why are you so
quiet over there, baby?

1142
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:19,427
You're never
at a loss for words.

1143
01:05:19,784 --> 01:05:21,292
I'm eating.

1144
01:05:32,205 --> 01:05:33,784
Why am I still doing this?

1145
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:36,310
Billy, you can't skip every day.

1146
01:05:36,423 --> 01:05:37,629
Not at your age.

1147
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:39,933
I'm not your age anymore.

1148
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:42,857
But I can go with you,
we just gotta

1149
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:44,740
trick the guard out,
you know, and then...

1150
01:05:44,803 --> 01:05:46,629
Billy, where are you going?

1151
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,411
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1152
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,709
Billy?

1153
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:52,836
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1154
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:00,370
<i>♪ Here we go now ♪</i>

1155
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:01,751
<i>♪ Holla if ya hear me though ♪</i>

1156
01:06:01,776 --> 01:06:02,894
<i>♪ Come and feel me flow ♪</i>

1157
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:04,379
All right!

1158
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:05,944
Did you check it?

1159
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:09,992
People typically, like, give me
a little money, you know, to...

1160
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,410
You're a sweet couple,
you guys have a good day.

1161
01:06:24,665 --> 01:06:25,687
Oh, my God.

1162
01:06:25,712 --> 01:06:27,489
Mary, Mary, are you okay?
Are you...

1163
01:06:27,528 --> 01:06:28,714
How do you know my name?

1164
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:31,270
Uh, how do I know
your name? Uh...

1165
01:06:31,302 --> 01:06:33,866
Uh, one of my superpowers
is name-guessing.

1166
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:35,976
Which is really weird, I bet.

1167
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:38,303
Uh, it's not as cool as super
strength or super speed

1168
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,868
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1169
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:43,171
Are you hurt?

1170
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,688
No, I'm... I'm okay.

1171
01:06:45,774 --> 01:06:47,322
Thank you, um...

1172
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:50,731
I just need a second to think.

1173
01:06:51,116 --> 01:06:52,912
This has been such
a weird day.

1174
01:06:52,993 --> 01:06:57,480
Um, using my powers
of super observation,

1175
01:06:57,511 --> 01:06:59,992
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1176
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:03,433
in your hand. Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1177
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,444
I got in.

1178
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,894
Uh... well, now my
superpowers are failing me

1179
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:14,715
and I'm very confused.

1180
01:07:15,848 --> 01:07:17,594
Yeah, me too.

1181
01:07:18,395 --> 01:07:20,903
I don't know. I know I should be
excited 'cause this is my dream

1182
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:23,518
and I worked really,
really hard for this.

1183
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,406
But it's like...

1184
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:30,619
I don't know, leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1185
01:07:30,709 --> 01:07:33,375
Can I-Can I-Can I give you
a little piece of advice?

1186
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,481
Don't be worried about
everybody else.

1187
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:37,307
Always look out for number one.

1188
01:07:37,397 --> 01:07:39,717
- Gandhi said that.
- I don't think he said that.

1189
01:07:39,742 --> 01:07:41,584
- Yeah, he did.
- Gandhi did not say that.

1190
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:43,318
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.
- Take care of number one?

1191
01:07:43,343 --> 01:07:45,634
It was a really wi...
It might have been Yoda.

1192
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:46,905
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1193
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,818
Agree to disagree.
The point is...

1194
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:51,169
You do you, you know?
You gotta look out for you.

1195
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:53,765
And get as far away from
this place as you can.

1196
01:07:55,699 --> 01:07:57,176
I don't know if I want to.

1197
01:07:57,234 --> 01:07:58,631
Of course you do.
What are you gonna do?

1198
01:07:58,656 --> 01:08:00,804
You're gonna live in a group
home for the rest of your life?

1199
01:08:02,597 --> 01:08:05,138
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves.

1200
01:08:05,163 --> 01:08:06,976
Okay? So.

1201
01:08:07,678 --> 01:08:09,758
And you know, y-you can take
care of yourself, you know.

1202
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:11,928
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1203
01:08:17,068 --> 01:08:18,560
I'll just call him.

1204
01:08:22,447 --> 01:08:23,622
It's ringing.

1205
01:08:25,984 --> 01:08:27,976
Red Cyclone! Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?

1206
01:08:28,968 --> 01:08:30,730
Oh, that's crazy.
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1207
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:32,087
Yeah, it's crazy.
That is...

1208
01:08:32,182 --> 01:08:33,395
Great story.

1209
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:35,535
He's not talking.

1210
01:08:37,224 --> 01:08:38,914
I was! I was!

1211
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:40,511
We're friends.
I know him. I do.

1212
01:08:40,606 --> 01:08:41,852
I know... I know...

1213
01:08:46,635 --> 01:08:47,667
Shit.

1214
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:53,256
Come on, now.

1215
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,392
♪ Hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1216
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:58,220
♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪

1217
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,888
♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪

1218
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:02,478
Hey! Hey!

1219
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,820
Hey, young man.

1220
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1221
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:06,766
I'm in the middle
of a show right now.

1222
01:09:06,844 --> 01:09:08,046
How can I help you?

1223
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:10,800
I just wanna say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1224
01:09:11,163 --> 01:09:14,225
Yeah, I got a little something
called a suitcase wedgie, right?

1225
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,988
I don't know if you've ever
heard of it, but it's when

1226
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:17,960
someone grabs your
underwear like that

1227
01:09:17,985 --> 01:09:19,386
and hold you like a suitcase,

1228
01:09:19,411 --> 01:09:21,084
walks you down the hallway.

1229
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,511
And this was my underwear.

1230
01:09:26,244 --> 01:09:27,402
Gross.

1231
01:09:27,707 --> 01:09:28,916
You said you'd come.

1232
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:30,977
You said I will come,
I never said I was...

1233
01:09:31,531 --> 01:09:33,071
I'm a superhero, dude.

1234
01:09:33,096 --> 01:09:34,564
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1235
01:09:34,756 --> 01:09:36,327
How much are people
paying you today?

1236
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:39,779
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1237
01:09:39,828 --> 01:09:42,090
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

1238
01:09:42,115 --> 01:09:44,737
♪ hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1239
01:10:10,928 --> 01:10:12,206
Holy moley.

1240
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:16,175
Don't move!

1241
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,689
Nobody move!

1242
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:26,953
Oh, no.

1243
01:10:27,191 --> 01:10:28,787
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay, stay.

1244
01:10:28,843 --> 01:10:30,670
Stay. Stay. Stay.

1245
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:40,164
Oh.

1246
01:10:40,499 --> 01:10:42,022
Oh, that looked like it hurts.

1247
01:10:42,356 --> 01:10:43,610
It's him!

1248
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:45,325
It's the superhero guy!

1249
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:47,603
Save us!

1250
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,204
Come on.

1251
01:10:51,233 --> 01:10:52,375
Come...

1252
01:10:54,237 --> 01:10:56,483
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1253
01:11:05,357 --> 01:11:06,365
What?

1254
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,115
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1255
01:11:16,704 --> 01:11:18,402
That is the worst idea ever!

1256
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:30,550
Oho! Oh, I did it!

1257
01:11:30,575 --> 01:11:31,734
I did it!

1258
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,886
I got the bus!
I got the bus.

1259
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,302
Nobody move in there!

1260
01:11:35,831 --> 01:11:37,760
I gotta put this thing down,
I gotta put this thing down.

1261
01:11:43,543 --> 01:11:46,251
No, no, no, doggie, doggie,
you have to move. Move!

1262
01:11:46,276 --> 01:11:47,426
Shoo! Shoo!

1263
01:11:47,546 --> 01:11:49,378
Please be a good dog.
Good dog!

1264
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:50,960
Ooh, you're being a bad dog.

1265
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:52,687
Go! Go!

1266
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,751
Please go. Please move.

1267
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,519
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1268
01:11:58,199 --> 01:11:59,318
Thank you.

1269
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:16,398
Yeah.

1270
01:12:16,423 --> 01:12:18,368
Yeah, no, no, no, my f...

1271
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,764
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1272
01:12:20,789 --> 01:12:21,868
Thank you, thank you.

1273
01:12:21,893 --> 01:12:23,963
You know, it's kinda
my fault, anyway.

1274
01:12:26,912 --> 01:12:30,234
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1275
01:12:30,259 --> 01:12:34,103
in the form of
its very own superhero.

1276
01:12:34,178 --> 01:12:35,654
And we're out.

1277
01:12:35,995 --> 01:12:37,868
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1278
01:12:37,893 --> 01:12:40,235
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1279
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:43,737
Yeah, you electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1280
01:12:43,762 --> 01:12:45,547
And then I caught it!

1281
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:49,137
Freddy! I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1282
01:12:49,185 --> 01:12:51,513
I caught a bus like people
catch fly balls, like...

1283
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:52,804
Who does that? I do that.

1284
01:12:52,853 --> 01:12:54,680
Billy, you do nothing, you...

1285
01:12:54,705 --> 01:12:57,340
you take selfies and
make people pay you.

1286
01:12:57,597 --> 01:12:58,620
You know what, forget it.

1287
01:12:58,645 --> 01:13:00,797
I can't really talk to you
when you look like this.

1288
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:02,406
You just wish it was you.

1289
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:04,359
No shit.

1290
01:13:04,972 --> 01:13:06,019
You think?

1291
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:08,107
I would kill to have
what you have.

1292
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:10,325
'Cause everything I do

1293
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:12,033
is like, some-some
desperate attempt

1294
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:13,819
to get people to notice me.

1295
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,583
To not feel sorry for me.

1296
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:17,385
I mean, look at me.
Look at me.

1297
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,841
Do you even see me?

1298
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:20,789
'Cause most people don't.

1299
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:23,036
'Cause they don't want to.

1300
01:13:23,841 --> 01:13:25,318
And now you don't either.

1301
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:27,982
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1302
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:29,947
I mean, Billy, you're 14.

1303
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,758
And now you're no
better than the Breyers.

1304
01:13:32,348 --> 01:13:34,025
All this power,

1305
01:13:34,072 --> 01:13:37,040
and all you did was turn
into a showoff and a bully.

1306
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:40,766
Whatever, kid.

1307
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,211
I do what I want!

1308
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:46,629
And I'm like mid-20s, probably.

1309
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:49,100
Maybe even, like, 30.

1310
01:13:52,822 --> 01:13:54,187
Chosen one.

1311
01:13:57,654 --> 01:13:59,741
The so-called perfect man.

1312
01:14:01,206 --> 01:14:02,507
Pure of heart.

1313
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:05,563
Flawless in every way.

1314
01:14:08,116 --> 01:14:09,759
What made you so worthy?

1315
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:11,822
I'm sorry, can I help...
can I help...?

1316
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,414
D'you want a autograph
or somethin'?

1317
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:14,773
Give me your power.

1318
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:18,729
Or die.

1319
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,262
Oh, snap.

1320
01:14:20,941 --> 01:14:22,338
You're like a bad guy, right?

1321
01:14:22,363 --> 01:14:23,377
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1322
01:14:23,402 --> 01:14:25,418
Look, before this gets
really stupid for you,

1323
01:14:25,546 --> 01:14:27,522
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1324
01:14:36,385 --> 01:14:39,181
The weapons of man draw
no blood from our kind.

1325
01:14:39,366 --> 01:14:40,406
This is the...

1326
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:44,749
The only thing that
extinguishes magic

1327
01:14:44,774 --> 01:14:46,165
is magic.

1328
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,645
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1329
01:14:52,276 --> 01:14:55,768
Oho, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1330
01:14:55,793 --> 01:14:57,585
Them's street rules!

1331
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,652
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1332
01:15:08,677 --> 01:15:10,643
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1333
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,380
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1334
01:15:12,405 --> 01:15:13,628
That was totally my bad.

1335
01:15:13,692 --> 01:15:15,001
We can talk about this.

1336
01:15:15,129 --> 01:15:16,502
You grovel like a child.

1337
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:18,798
That's because I am one.
I-I'm a kid.

1338
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:20,267
You don't want to
hurt a kid, do you?

1339
01:15:23,276 --> 01:15:24,395
I believe I can fly!

1340
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,041
I believe I can fly!
I can fly!

1341
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,475
Freddy said if I believe,
I can fly!

1342
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,055
Then I can fly, so I believe!

1343
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,350
I believe, oh, please!

1344
01:15:30,424 --> 01:15:31,956
Okay! Superman!

1345
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:34,384
Superman!
What arm is it?!

1346
01:15:34,454 --> 01:15:35,946
Why am I not flying?!

1347
01:15:35,971 --> 01:15:37,834
Please, I don't wanna die!

1348
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:51,559
Oh.

1349
01:15:53,795 --> 01:15:54,819
Oh.

1350
01:15:57,022 --> 01:15:58,069
Whoa.

1351
01:15:58,365 --> 01:15:59,444
Whoa.

1352
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:01,698
I'm floating!

1353
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:10,043
What the hell was that?

1354
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,389
I can fly!

1355
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:23,494
Billy?

1356
01:16:24,926 --> 01:16:26,711
Freddy! I need your help!

1357
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:28,164
You can fly?

1358
01:16:36,284 --> 01:16:37,682
Who's the other guy?

1359
01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:39,406
Santa!

1360
01:16:42,093 --> 01:16:45,881
So, like, what you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1361
01:16:46,147 --> 01:16:48,608
Well, in some ways,

1362
01:16:48,744 --> 01:16:50,617
Santa's always here for you.

1363
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:56,674
Oh, help!

1364
01:16:57,865 --> 01:16:59,238
Help Santa!

1365
01:16:59,567 --> 01:17:01,464
Santa needs help!

1366
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:03,604
Give us a shout if you need us.

1367
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,342
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1368
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:17,856
This is crazy!

1369
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,723
This is crazy. You don't
have to fight this guy.

1370
01:17:19,748 --> 01:17:21,794
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1371
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,354
Yes! You can run. Awesome.

1372
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:30,879
<i>♪ Round and round ♪</i>

1373
01:17:31,222 --> 01:17:32,629
<i>♪ Round and round ♪</i>

1374
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:33,935
Get back!

1375
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:35,689
Just get... Get away!

1376
01:17:35,747 --> 01:17:37,692
<i>♪ Wheels on the bus
go round and round ♪</i>

1377
01:17:37,763 --> 01:17:39,842
<i>I'm Batman.</i>
Get him, Batman!

1378
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:10,948
Come on!

1379
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:38,418
Sh... Shazam!

1380
01:19:08,612 --> 01:19:09,803
Billy!

1381
01:19:10,869 --> 01:19:12,123
Billy!

1382
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:14,823
Billy, where are you?

1383
01:19:17,897 --> 01:19:18,952
Billy!

1384
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,468
Where are you, Billy?

1385
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:27,331
Billy, come on!

1386
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:31,431
Billy.

1387
01:19:32,096 --> 01:19:34,326
- Where is he?
- Um, supervillain.

1388
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,066
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1389
01:19:38,176 --> 01:19:39,350
Worse.

1390
01:19:39,763 --> 01:19:40,993
Much worse.

1391
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,608
Radioactive anthromorph.

1392
01:19:42,648 --> 01:19:44,457
Psychic energy manipulator.

1393
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:46,006
I won't let you read my mind.

1394
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,158
My mind is blank.
You can't get in.

1395
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,812
I don't need to read your mind.

1396
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,362
Because you are going to tell me.

1397
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:54,356
Where is he?

1398
01:20:06,805 --> 01:20:08,388
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1399
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,935
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1400
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,360
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1401
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:13,584
Come inside.

1402
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:15,005
We need to have a talk.

1403
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,943
Just don't be so
hard on him, okay?

1404
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:26,754
Running out on us.
Lying.

1405
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,731
Huh? Then I get
a call from the school

1406
01:20:28,756 --> 01:20:30,467
telling me you've
been cutting class.

1407
01:20:30,524 --> 01:20:32,069
Getting in fights.

1408
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,280
Whoa, is that...?

1409
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:44,611
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1410
01:20:47,562 --> 01:20:51,445
What's a superhero
doing with Freddy?

1411
01:20:54,635 --> 01:20:56,040
You remember dinner?

1412
01:20:56,065 --> 01:20:58,096
When Billy and
Freddy were arguing

1413
01:20:58,163 --> 01:21:00,267
like an old married
couple like this?

1414
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,904
When he rescued me, he
knew I lived in a group home.

1415
01:21:03,936 --> 01:21:05,992
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1416
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:15,560
Wait.

1417
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:18,084
Are you saying Billy's
the Human Powerstorm?

1418
01:21:18,109 --> 01:21:20,086
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1419
01:21:20,111 --> 01:21:21,617
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1420
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:22,920
I didn't break any promises.

1421
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,181
You knew?

1422
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:25,931
I'm a good sister!

1423
01:21:30,044 --> 01:21:31,441
I mean, what were you thinking?

1424
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:34,313
Then you bring Freddy into it.

1425
01:21:40,324 --> 01:21:43,237
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset. Okay?

1426
01:21:53,263 --> 01:21:54,342
Billy?

1427
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:00,999
You're him.

1428
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,460
You're the hero.

1429
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:06,792
Yeah, well, not anymore, so.

1430
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:12,945
Why do you have my notebook?

1431
01:22:15,682 --> 01:22:17,616
Eugene finished your search.

1432
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,693
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1433
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:23,162
But I have played
Watchdogs and Uplink.

1434
01:22:23,187 --> 01:22:25,091
And maybe I did
pick up a few skills

1435
01:22:25,124 --> 01:22:27,204
which maybe did get me
into federal databases

1436
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:28,521
most people can't get into, but...

1437
01:22:28,546 --> 01:22:30,723
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1438
01:22:30,835 --> 01:22:34,017
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1439
01:22:39,516 --> 01:22:40,603
What?

1440
01:22:40,893 --> 01:22:42,838
You were born in
Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1441
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:44,710
They divorced when
you were three.

1442
01:22:44,854 --> 01:22:46,398
Your mom moved here that year.

1443
01:22:46,476 --> 01:22:48,679
20 months later, you got lost.

1444
01:22:49,085 --> 01:22:51,537
You never found them 'cause
your dad's been in prison

1445
01:22:51,562 --> 01:22:53,085
in Florida for 10 years.

1446
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:54,596
And your mom's...

1447
01:22:56,314 --> 01:22:57,345
What?

1448
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:00,044
Is she dead?

1449
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:02,809
She's two subway stops away.

1450
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:04,865
What?

1451
01:23:05,876 --> 01:23:06,883
You know, you didn't find her

1452
01:23:06,908 --> 01:23:09,179
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1453
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:15,836
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1454
01:23:19,048 --> 01:23:20,484
Victor, get the keys.

1455
01:23:20,509 --> 01:23:22,683
Kids, stay here,
in case Billy comes back.

1456
01:23:30,945 --> 01:23:32,611
Get inside. Let's go.

1457
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,942
Wait. I thought we were
running after Billy?

1458
01:23:44,121 --> 01:23:46,724
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1459
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,349
Billy?

1460
01:23:54,242 --> 01:23:55,306
Freddy?

1461
01:23:59,604 --> 01:24:01,437
Oh, how quaint.

1462
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:06,776
Actually, I take that back.

1463
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:10,268
What a shithole.

1464
01:24:53,749 --> 01:24:55,019
Just a second.

1465
01:24:59,658 --> 01:25:01,142
Hey, look, I'm late for
work already, all right?

1466
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:03,325
We don't need any
magazines or whatever.

1467
01:25:03,373 --> 01:25:04,928
Oh, I'm not.

1468
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:07,790
You probably don't
recognize me, but

1469
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:11,372
I found my way home.

1470
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:13,836
Mom.

1471
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:16,902
It's me.

1472
01:25:18,277 --> 01:25:19,316
Oh, God.

1473
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:21,941
Is it?

1474
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,377
Um, hang on.

1475
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:29,424
Who's at the door?

1476
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:31,846
It's um...

1477
01:25:32,512 --> 01:25:34,282
It's no one, Travis.

1478
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,667
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1479
01:25:41,734 --> 01:25:42,948
No, I...

1480
01:25:43,762 --> 01:25:46,492
Listen, it's um...

1481
01:25:48,473 --> 01:25:49,821
It's really you, huh?

1482
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:53,797
I didn't mean to run away.

1483
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:55,841
You know that, right?

1484
01:25:56,545 --> 01:25:59,219
I let go but it was by
accident, I...

1485
01:25:59,331 --> 01:26:01,021
Yeah, I know, I know.

1486
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,594
I saw you.

1487
01:26:04,441 --> 01:26:05,578
What?

1488
01:26:08,826 --> 01:26:10,501
I saw you after.

1489
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,776
So, it was never your fault.

1490
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,225
I was 17.

1491
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:21,489
And my dad, he kicked me out.

1492
01:26:21,864 --> 01:26:23,840
And your dad just...

1493
01:26:23,976 --> 01:26:26,348
decided not to be
a part of anything.

1494
01:26:26,893 --> 01:26:29,853
And I was hurting
and I was screwed up.

1495
01:26:32,339 --> 01:26:33,355
I want the tiger.

1496
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,649
I know, I know, honey, but

1497
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:38,063
Mom's not exactly going pro
here, okay?

1498
01:26:41,088 --> 01:26:42,208
Billy?

1499
01:26:42,853 --> 01:26:43,972
Billy!

1500
01:26:44,857 --> 01:26:46,032
Billy!

1501
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:48,950
Jesus Christ, Billy,
this isn't funny!

1502
01:26:49,534 --> 01:26:50,534
Here you go, buddy.

1503
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:59,407
But it's just once
I saw you with the police,

1504
01:26:59,812 --> 01:27:01,427
I realized that

1505
01:27:01,538 --> 01:27:04,966
they could do a better job taking
care of you than I ever will.

1506
01:27:10,135 --> 01:27:11,627
But you're good, right?

1507
01:27:13,303 --> 01:27:15,210
I mean you landed on your feet.

1508
01:27:16,486 --> 01:27:17,962
'Cause, I mean, you look real good.

1509
01:27:20,566 --> 01:27:22,018
It's just...

1510
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:26,917
Now is not a really
good time for me, Billy.

1511
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,537
All I wanted to do was

1512
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:36,764
let you know
I'm doing good, but...

1513
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:40,924
I have to get back
to my real family, so.

1514
01:27:43,068 --> 01:27:44,258
Here.

1515
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:49,216
What's this?

1516
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:52,425
Marilyn! What's
going on out there?

1517
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:54,694
You might need it
more than me.

1518
01:28:12,515 --> 01:28:15,418
Freddy, you were right.
Sorry I yelled at you.

1519
01:28:15,469 --> 01:28:16,952
<i>Come home, Billy.</i>

1520
01:28:17,678 --> 01:28:19,123
<i>Come home.</i>

1521
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:22,214
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!</i>

1522
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:40,097
Shazam!

1523
01:28:53,756 --> 01:28:56,081
Who are you?
What do you want?

1524
01:28:56,366 --> 01:28:57,763
What do I want?

1525
01:28:58,587 --> 01:28:59,995
I want...

1526
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,089
That.

1527
01:29:07,099 --> 01:29:08,393
Whoa.

1528
01:29:12,023 --> 01:29:13,333
Kick his ass, Billy!

1529
01:29:16,121 --> 01:29:17,129
Oh, God.

1530
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:18,297
Yes, Billy.

1531
01:29:18,543 --> 01:29:20,020
Try it, by all means.

1532
01:29:20,703 --> 01:29:22,346
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1533
01:29:22,606 --> 01:29:24,725
Oh, first you come inside,

1534
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,678
then maybe I'll let them go.

1535
01:29:43,414 --> 01:29:44,890
Good boy.

1536
01:29:47,446 --> 01:29:49,446
'Cause that's all you are, isn't it?

1537
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:51,564
How old are you?

1538
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:54,271
- Basically, 15.
- Hmm.

1539
01:29:56,133 --> 01:29:57,752
When I was a child,

1540
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:59,951
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1541
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,443
And here you are,

1542
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,316
a coward.

1543
01:30:04,077 --> 01:30:05,478
Run from me?

1544
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:08,147
And that wizard chooses you.
You're not a hero.

1545
01:30:08,657 --> 01:30:11,491
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1546
01:30:12,127 --> 01:30:13,936
Give me the power
of a champion.

1547
01:30:14,074 --> 01:30:15,637
No, don't do it, Billy!

1548
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:33,633
Give me the power

1549
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:35,174
and I'll let them go.

1550
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:36,428
Darla, no.

1551
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:38,200
Don't, don't go, Billy!

1552
01:30:38,361 --> 01:30:40,472
Don't go! Don't go, Billy!

1553
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,622
No, no, I-I have to,
I have to, it's...

1554
01:30:42,953 --> 01:30:45,969
It's what a good brother
would do, right?

1555
01:30:50,604 --> 01:30:51,794
Billy.

1556
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,799
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

1557
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:23,480
I scoured the earth.

1558
01:31:24,027 --> 01:31:25,385
No one believed me.

1559
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:27,541
No one helped.

1560
01:31:28,435 --> 01:31:29,526
Not the wizard.

1561
01:31:30,955 --> 01:31:32,193
Not my family.

1562
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,730
I only had myself.

1563
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:37,606
I get it.

1564
01:31:39,043 --> 01:31:40,392
I get what that's like.

1565
01:31:42,478 --> 01:31:44,161
Feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

1566
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,399
Stand.

1567
01:31:46,035 --> 01:31:48,797
Feeling like there's that one
thing, if you could just find it,

1568
01:31:48,928 --> 01:31:50,672
then you'd finally
be good enough.

1569
01:31:50,769 --> 01:31:51,912
Stand.

1570
01:31:54,132 --> 01:31:55,902
The champion's name.

1571
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:58,646
Say it.

1572
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:27,068
Look, no offense, mister,

1573
01:32:27,093 --> 01:32:30,132
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1574
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:33,496
Don't listen to this child.

1575
01:32:33,746 --> 01:32:35,817
Take the staff.

1576
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:41,304
Hold it and say
the champion's name.

1577
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:42,857
They're using you.

1578
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,023
You have to see that.
That they are using you.

1579
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:47,482
Say your name.

1580
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,185
His name...

1581
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:54,924
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1582
01:32:54,983 --> 01:32:56,593
And we're gonna
keep throwing things

1583
01:32:56,627 --> 01:32:58,746
at your big, fat, ugly ass head

1584
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:00,769
until you let our brother go.

1585
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,892
Boy, am I glad I didn't
sell that batarang.

1586
01:33:28,077 --> 01:33:29,331
Pedro, is that a lamp?

1587
01:33:29,412 --> 01:33:31,595
- It's an ugly one.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1588
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,846
Guys, I appreciate the
thought, I really do.

1589
01:33:33,885 --> 01:33:35,504
But I don't think your
weapons are gonna help.

1590
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:37,052
You can put 'em down now.

1591
01:33:38,438 --> 01:33:39,875
The door was right here.

1592
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:41,180
Billy, how do we
get out of here?

1593
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,245
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1594
01:33:44,009 --> 01:33:45,040
This way!

1595
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,231
Go, go, go, go, go with Darla.
Good job, Darla!

1596
01:33:47,297 --> 01:33:48,512
Go, go, go, go!

1597
01:33:48,575 --> 01:33:49,599
Kids?

1598
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:52,099
Why is this open?

1599
01:33:52,433 --> 01:33:53,719
Freddy?

1600
01:33:53,914 --> 01:33:54,929
Mary?

1601
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:00,054
Pedro, Pedro, come on!

1602
01:34:00,312 --> 01:34:01,907
Freddy, Freddy, keep up.

1603
01:34:02,014 --> 01:34:03,295
Darla, stay in front.

1604
01:34:04,407 --> 01:34:05,510
We gotta hurry.

1605
01:34:28,894 --> 01:34:30,362
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1606
01:34:31,158 --> 01:34:32,873
So many doors.

1607
01:34:33,613 --> 01:34:36,098
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1608
01:34:36,275 --> 01:34:37,703
Yeah, I would hope so.

1609
01:34:54,965 --> 01:34:56,155
Not this one.

1610
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,927
Okay, no more doors.

1611
01:35:10,952 --> 01:35:12,247
Nobody open any more doors.

1612
01:35:12,272 --> 01:35:13,863
Come on, Billy,
what are we gonna do?

1613
01:35:13,888 --> 01:35:15,030
Darla, I don't know.

1614
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:16,587
Billy, yes, you do,
just-just think.

1615
01:35:16,612 --> 01:35:17,834
How'd you get out last time?

1616
01:35:17,859 --> 01:35:19,041
Well, uh, l-last time I
thought about the subway

1617
01:35:19,066 --> 01:35:20,226
and I was on the subway.

1618
01:35:20,344 --> 01:35:22,273
Okay, then Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1619
01:35:22,298 --> 01:35:24,556
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1620
01:35:47,243 --> 01:35:48,337
Come on, come on, come on.

1621
01:35:48,362 --> 01:35:49,814
Why are you covering my eyes?

1622
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:52,709
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1623
01:35:52,742 --> 01:35:53,853
You're welcome.

1624
01:35:53,878 --> 01:35:55,478
Why can't I see what's inside?

1625
01:35:55,503 --> 01:35:56,963
You are not old enough.

1626
01:35:57,045 --> 01:35:59,347
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1627
01:35:59,735 --> 01:36:00,821
Not my thing.

1628
01:36:00,846 --> 01:36:02,014
W-Where's Freddy?

1629
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:03,365
Yeah, you too, Sriracha, hey,

1630
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:05,001
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

1631
01:36:05,026 --> 01:36:06,344
Freddy, what are you doing?

1632
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:07,975
Ah, it's nice people.

1633
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:09,435
- Nice pe...? Come on.
- Is that glitter?

1634
01:36:09,546 --> 01:36:11,101
They have glitter.
Can I get glitter?

1635
01:36:11,142 --> 01:36:12,967
- No, not from them.
- Please?

1636
01:36:22,509 --> 01:36:23,993
Go, go, go, go!
Everybody go!

1637
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:25,729
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

1638
01:36:25,754 --> 01:36:27,421
One, two, three,
hold onto me.

1639
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:37,269
Carnival. Go, go, go.
Mary, go.

1640
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:38,468
Go. Come on, Pedro.

1641
01:36:38,493 --> 01:36:39,683
Come on.

1642
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:53,269
Walk, just be cool,
act naturally,

1643
01:36:53,294 --> 01:36:55,476
like kids naturally act
in a carnival.

1644
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:56,985
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

1645
01:36:57,082 --> 01:36:58,407
Oh, my God, guys.

1646
01:36:58,892 --> 01:36:59,923
Hey, Powerboy.

1647
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:00,969
He's an impersonator, okay?

1648
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:02,617
I'm an impersonator.
I'm a fake version of myself.

1649
01:37:02,642 --> 01:37:03,848
Don't take pictures...

1650
01:37:05,748 --> 01:37:06,842
Shazam!

1651
01:37:14,556 --> 01:37:15,746
Hey, where'd he go?

1652
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,803
Oh, man, oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1653
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:29,943
Yo, what is that?

1654
01:37:35,782 --> 01:37:37,258
Champion!

1655
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:42,181
You don't deserve that name.

1656
01:37:46,156 --> 01:37:49,680
Hiding behind innocent people
who will now die.

1657
01:37:51,706 --> 01:37:56,031
Because deep down, you're
still just a scared, little boy.

1658
01:37:57,775 --> 01:37:59,442
Oh, no.

1659
01:38:00,504 --> 01:38:01,920
Run!

1660
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:03,468
Run!

1661
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:18,963
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Hold on!

1662
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:20,737
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1663
01:38:29,418 --> 01:38:31,188
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1664
01:38:31,677 --> 01:38:32,759
Are you kidding?

1665
01:38:32,847 --> 01:38:33,998
Okay, no. Old guy's up there

1666
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:35,777
harboring multiple
spiritual entities,

1667
01:38:35,935 --> 01:38:37,485
plus, I mean, he has
the same powers as you,

1668
01:38:37,525 --> 01:38:39,844
plus, you know, a-and
he knows what he's doing,

1669
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:42,145
plus, you're my best friend,
I don't want you to die.

1670
01:38:43,369 --> 01:38:45,608
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1671
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:48,506
he's not much of a hero.

1672
01:38:52,948 --> 01:38:54,487
That was a decent catchphrase.

1673
01:38:55,504 --> 01:38:56,639
Shazam!

1674
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:07,440
Now let's try this again.

1675
01:39:21,662 --> 01:39:23,345
Or try that again.

1676
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:32,739
Billy, look out!

1677
01:39:35,248 --> 01:39:36,360
Laser eyes?

1678
01:39:36,455 --> 01:39:37,788
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1679
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,981
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1680
01:39:49,746 --> 01:39:50,905
His power matrix.

1681
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:52,261
His what what?

1682
01:39:52,431 --> 01:39:54,875
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1683
01:39:55,839 --> 01:39:57,450
That's why the
batarang hurt him.

1684
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:01,106
Hey, over here!

1685
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:02,871
W-What are you doing?

1686
01:40:02,896 --> 01:40:03,942
Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1687
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:06,315
We separate the sins from the
eye, and he's just an old man.

1688
01:40:06,716 --> 01:40:08,153
Gather the mutts.

1689
01:40:45,937 --> 01:40:48,739
Here, take it.
Take it, it's for you.

1690
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,019
Hold it tight.

1691
01:40:51,574 --> 01:40:52,828
Close your eyes.

1692
01:40:53,619 --> 01:40:55,793
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?

1693
01:40:56,972 --> 01:40:58,044
Okay.

1694
01:41:21,588 --> 01:41:22,628
Get up.

1695
01:41:38,507 --> 01:41:39,539
Shazam!

1696
01:42:08,325 --> 01:42:09,921
Playtime's over, boy.

1697
01:42:11,146 --> 01:42:12,868
Your friends can't
help you anymore.

1698
01:42:18,621 --> 01:42:19,652
Hey!

1699
01:42:46,361 --> 01:42:47,567
Shazam!

1700
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:13,548
Nice trick.

1701
01:43:13,904 --> 01:43:15,047
Catchy.

1702
01:43:15,555 --> 01:43:17,166
One simple word.

1703
01:43:17,977 --> 01:43:19,366
I have a better trick.

1704
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,503
Four words.

1705
01:43:22,915 --> 01:43:24,335
Kill the little girl.

1706
01:43:25,474 --> 01:43:26,911
- No, please!
- No!

1707
01:43:30,527 --> 01:43:31,892
Stop!

1708
01:43:47,489 --> 01:43:50,436
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1709
01:43:50,494 --> 01:43:52,160
You gotta just
rip it out of his face...

1710
01:43:52,481 --> 01:43:53,973
It's where he gets his power.

1711
01:43:58,177 --> 01:43:59,375
Reach for it.

1712
01:44:01,161 --> 01:44:02,454
I dare you.

1713
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:12,437
Wise decision.

1714
01:44:14,966 --> 01:44:16,442
Hands on the staff.

1715
01:44:17,697 --> 01:44:19,189
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1716
01:44:19,326 --> 01:44:21,239
- Billy!
- Don't do it, Billy!

1717
01:44:41,059 --> 01:44:42,329
Say my name

1718
01:44:42,354 --> 01:44:44,893
so my power may
flow through you.

1719
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,977
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1720
01:44:48,129 --> 01:44:49,716
And in so doing,

1721
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:52,383
choose you as champion.

1722
01:44:52,723 --> 01:44:56,453
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1723
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,351
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await!

1724
01:45:07,569 --> 01:45:09,037
All hands on deck.

1725
01:45:14,354 --> 01:45:15,426
Say my name.

1726
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:18,239
Billy!

1727
01:45:18,356 --> 01:45:19,575
No, not my name. No.

1728
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,837
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1729
01:45:22,513 --> 01:45:23,932
Shazam!

1730
01:46:02,497 --> 01:46:03,815
Guys.

1731
01:46:05,232 --> 01:46:06,613
What's happening?

1732
01:46:10,879 --> 01:46:12,355
I can fly!

1733
01:46:16,976 --> 01:46:18,135
Guys.

1734
01:46:18,413 --> 01:46:19,953
Check out these guns.

1735
01:46:21,268 --> 01:46:22,498
No.

1736
01:46:23,459 --> 01:46:25,039
It's not possible!

1737
01:46:27,123 --> 01:46:29,560
Gee whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your game.

1738
01:46:29,585 --> 01:46:31,112
You want it back?

1739
01:46:33,408 --> 01:46:35,340
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1740
01:46:35,381 --> 01:46:38,722
but I think we should kick this
guy's butt, like, really hard.

1741
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,742
Guys, I think
I can move really

1742
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:54,034
fast.

1743
01:46:54,451 --> 01:46:55,688
Hyperspeed!

1744
01:46:55,782 --> 01:46:56,966
Check!

1745
01:47:05,574 --> 01:47:06,765
Billy!

1746
01:47:06,947 --> 01:47:08,114
The eye.

1747
01:47:15,642 --> 01:47:16,777
Look out!

1748
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:19,990
Whoa!

1749
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:22,541
What?

1750
01:47:26,498 --> 01:47:27,903
You almost exploded me!

1751
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,114
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1752
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:17,675
of every single superhero.

1753
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:20,344
What do you got?

1754
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:25,486
Well, that's terrifying.

1755
01:48:59,474 --> 01:49:01,680
Enough games, boy.

1756
01:49:02,659 --> 01:49:04,421
You think a pack of children can...

1757
01:49:07,488 --> 01:49:08,528
Wait, what?!

1758
01:49:08,647 --> 01:49:11,079
You will beg for mercy

1759
01:49:11,167 --> 01:49:13,104
as I feast on your heart.

1760
01:49:13,997 --> 01:49:15,069
Slow...

1761
01:49:16,586 --> 01:49:18,681
Are you making
some big, evil guy

1762
01:49:18,706 --> 01:49:20,268
speech right now or something?

1763
01:49:20,293 --> 01:49:22,590
You're like, a mile
away from me right now.

1764
01:49:22,615 --> 01:49:23,927
There's cars and trucks...

1765
01:49:23,952 --> 01:49:26,721
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1766
01:49:26,809 --> 01:49:29,412
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1767
01:49:29,445 --> 01:49:31,192
Only I

1768
01:49:31,263 --> 01:49:33,315
have the power to unleash...

1769
01:49:34,669 --> 01:49:35,844
Oh, whatever, screw it.

1770
01:50:06,995 --> 01:50:08,320
Oh, my gosh, those people!

1771
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,448
Hi!

1772
01:50:18,186 --> 01:50:19,409
I caught you!

1773
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,536
I got it!

1774
01:50:32,211 --> 01:50:33,227
I got it!

1775
01:50:39,093 --> 01:50:40,617
Oh, my God, I do got it.

1776
01:50:57,107 --> 01:50:58,503
You're not gonna believe this,

1777
01:50:58,528 --> 01:51:00,338
but you're actually the
first villain I've ever fought.

1778
01:51:00,425 --> 01:51:02,497
It's, like, kind of

Oh, crap.

So this is about your
Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1791
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:02,836
I mean, I've never been
great at math, but uh...

1792
01:53:03,328 --> 01:53:05,715
The big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1793

And then Gluttony, obvi.

I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

Where's lucky number seven?

Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1799
01:53:22,009 --> 01:53:24,857
Is he just scared of me and my
family 'cause we're so awesome?

1800
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,292
'Cause I get that.

1801
01:53:26,635 --> 01:53:28,786
Like, the other sins, they
get to come out and fight

1802
01:53:28,907 --> 01:53:30,558
'cause they're big

1804

he's just a runt.

1805

never invite him
out to play, man.

No!

I can have anything

Yeah, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger.

1843

01:57:47,081 --> 01:57:48,981
You guys know
what this place is, right?

1846
01:57:49,128 --> 01:57:51,731
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1847
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:54,641
Well, yes, but also...

1848
01:57:57,514 --> 01:57:58,625
Lair!

1849
01:57:58,658 --> 01:58:00,118

1850
01:58:00,407 --> 01:58:01,598
Lair.

- We got a lair.
