1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,587
With great power
comes the absolute cen'ainty

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,130
that you'll turn into a right cunt.

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,494
We got everything under control.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,885
An explosion
rocked midtown Manhattan.

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,094
Soldier boy.

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,263
And what you gonna do
when you find him?

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,347
You need us.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,560
You shot up
an untested drug from vought.

9
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,062
Nina.

10
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,813
A classified lab destroyed.

11
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,691
Three of my contacts disappeared,

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,132
so you're the one who pays the debt.

13
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,487
Black lives matter!

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,614
Supe lives matter, fucking ingrates!

15
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,697
Stop!

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,176
Nathan will never walk away.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,410
- What the fuck?
- Crimson countess.

18
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,246
Your lover boy's on his way here.

19
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,248
How much did the Russians pay you?

20
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,375
- They didn't.
- I loved you.

21
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,919
I hated you. We all did.

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,673
You're teaming up with a murderer.

23
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,341
Please don't go.

24
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,682
Past few days
have got me feeling a little, um...

25
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,142
Well, philosophical.

26
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,730
Uh, these supervillain attacks,
they've affected everyone.

27
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,024
Doesn't matter who you are,
where you're from.

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,111
We 're all in this together.

29
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,698
And together, we can imagine
a better world.

30
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,537
J" imagine there's no heaven j”

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,040
j" it's easy if you try j”

32
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,252
j” no hell below us j”

33
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,380
j” above us, only sky j”

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:33,552
J” imagine all the people j”

35
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:38,599
j” living for today j”

36
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,642
j” ah, ah, ah-ah—ah j”

37
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,187
j” you may say I'm a dreamer j”

38
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,065
j” but I'm not the only one j”

39
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,485
j” I hope someday you will join us j”

40
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,077
Stop.

41
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,621
Deep.

42
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,850
Is there anyone else
that can operate this thing? Seriously.

43
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,393
Ashley thought we should
get rid of most of them.

44
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,128
- What? You fired them.
- Here, I found it. I found it.

45
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,546
Okay.

46
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,673
Stop.

47
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
Zoom in.

48
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,681
Soldier boy.

49
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,559
No, that's impossible.
He died, like, 40 years ago.

50
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,894
Someone's cosplaying?

51
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,104
Look at his face. It's him.

52
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,191
- Or maybe cgi.
- It is not cgi.

53
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,026
You don't even know what cgi stands for.

54
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,402
It stands for "blow me."

55
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,172
I don't understand.
Where has he been?

56
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,739
Why did he kill crimson countess?

57
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,675
I mean, the two were, like,
fucking Kurt and Goldie.

58
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,093
All right, you know what?
This is fine. This is fine.

59
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,244
We dominate the news cycle.
I will call haberman.

60
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,222
We'll message that we got
soldier boy totally under control.

61
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,790
Shut up.

62
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,670
You want to tell the world
that soldier boy, hero of heroes,

63
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,964
is back from the fucking dead
and blowing up midtown?

64
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,341
Before me, he was vought.

65
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,968
His statue's in front
of the fucking building, Ashley.

66
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,887
Oh, my god, if this gets out...

67
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,807
Company's fucked. I'm fucked.

68
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,558
Oh, god. If the company falls, I fall.

69
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,976
Oh, fuck.

70
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,831
Oh, god. Why is this happening to me?

71
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,067
This isn't fair.

72
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,319
This is so fucking unfair.

73
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,368
Okay. I'll handle this.

74
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,245
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

75
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,665
You Bury it. All of it.
The footage, no one sees it.

76
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,208
He fucks it up, it's your head.

77
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,668
Noir.

78
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,882
Why would he kill crimson countess?

79
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,760
He was your team leader,
you have any idea?

80
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,895
I'm really glad to have you
with me on this one, pal.

81
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,442
Seriously.
You're the only one I can count on.

82
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,181
Uh... thank you.

83
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,661
What the hell?

84
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,290
Where's the chop socky oriental sauce?

85
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,709
They don't have that anymore.

86
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,294
Why the fuck not?

87
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,380
Uh, many... many good reasons.

88
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,216
Did you get the other shit?

89
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,592
Here you go, guv.

90
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,139
Man, I missed bennies.

91
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,058
It's how we won d-day, you know.

92
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,935
We were wired to the fucking gills.

93
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,108
Listen, let's have a little chat
about this team-up, yeah?

94
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,832
Yeah, what the hell do I need a team for?

95
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,403
The last one handed me to the reds.

96
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,156
And we got you out of that little pickle.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,825
We wrapped up crimson countess

98
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,993
and delivered her
like a fucking Christmas Turkey,

99
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,996
and I even sorted gunpowder for you.

100
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,642
Why am I supposed
to be impressed with that?

101
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,918
That's like killing
Emmanuel Lewis.

102
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,339
Yeah, well, he grew up a bit
since you last saw him.

103
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,858
Hands off the fucking shield.

104
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,133
- Mmm.
- Anyway,

105
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,761
you want payback on payback, don't you?

106
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,013
Well, it just so happens that we...

107
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,685
Are experts at exterminating
shitbag supes.

108
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,187
You see, it's a whole different world
out there now, son.

109
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,939
We're here to help you find your way.

110
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,566
Well, I can find them on my own.

111
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,025
Uh, are you sure?

112
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,862
I mean, do you know what a GPS is?

113
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,407
Or-or Bluetooth? Or, I mean...
The Internet?

114
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,494
You made those words up.

115
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,872
No. No. No, those are real words, um,

116
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,540
and-and you need those to find them.

117
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,749
All right? You need us.

118
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,128
Kid's right.

119
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,797
And all we ask in return

120
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,427
is that you add one more name to the list.

121
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,433
Who?

122
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,270
A right cunt named homelander.

123
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,898
I've seen pictures.

124
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,650
Who is he?

125
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,111
He's the new you.

126
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,071
No one's the new me, pal.

127
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,367
But why him?

128
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,871
Let's just say you're not
the only one wants payback.

129
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,416
Mmm. Mmm.

130
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,793
All right.

131
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,922
You help me find the rest of my team,

132
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,007
and I'll help you with this homelander.

133
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,232
So, you think that soldier boy
is going after the rest of payback?

134
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,596
Countess wasn't strong enough
to fuck him over on her own.

135
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,986
She had help.

136
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,155
Soldier boy's just getting started.

137
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,800
Do you know
where any of them are?

138
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,077
Those shady-ass tnt twins
got an address in Vermont.

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,578
Okay. Does butcher have it?

140
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,580
No, but he'll get it.

141
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,668
I think soldier boy is bulletproof.

142
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,962
This ain't for soldier boy.

143
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,554
Look, I'm pissed at those guys, too,
but we have to keep our heads on.

144
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,016
Why? Why do I always
have to take the high road?

145
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,602
You know, when white folks get mad,
y'all motherfuckers go berserk,

146
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,312
but I got to turn the other cheek?

147
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,608
Fuck the high road,
fuck butcher, and fuck hughie.

148
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,277
Hughie is not himself right now.

149
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,571
Hughie is a grown-ass man
that's made his own choices.

150
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
Mm! Please!

151
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,035
Soldier boy is gonna kill more people.
I mean, fuck!

152
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,536
Kimiko is in the hospital.

153
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,204
She lost her powers.

154
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,499
Frenchie isn't answering, Alex is dead,

155
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,792
and Maeve...

156
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,341
We're all we've got.

157
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,304
It's up to us.

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,522
Shit.

159
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,815
This is starlight.

160
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,943
Yeah, of course, Ashley.
I'll be right there.

161
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,172
I got to go up
to the tower for a little bit.

162
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,197
Now?

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,175
If I don't go,
they're gonna know something's up.

164
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,825
I'll be one hour.

165
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,287
Do I need to worry about you?

166
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,295
Okay.

167
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,925
Even the greatest trees

168
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,552
must grow from a single seed.

169
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,807
Follow one proud black man's journey
to the root of his roots,

170
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,185
as he takes the a-train to Africa.

171
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,231
Jesus fucking Christ.

172
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,026
Hey. It looks great.

173
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,403
Man, there's so much strength in dignity.

174
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,864
What are you doing about blue hawk?

175
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,158
Okay, first of all, everyone at vought

176
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,744
is just heartbroken
over your brother's tragic accident.

177
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,831
It wasn't an accident.
Blue hawk went apeshit for no reason.

178
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,016
Well, he said he felt threatened.

179
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,291
- Threatened?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,211
By what, a room full of black people
with no superpowers?

181
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,089
Look, I've scheduled him for 12 weeks
of sensitivity training.

182
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,133
Fuck that. I want charges brought.

183
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:37,011
Okay, a-train, persecuting blue hawk
will only make things worse.

184
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,221
This is a time for healing.

185
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,514
I don't give a shit.

186
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,058
I thought we got rid
of the Nazis around here.

187
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,144
Vought rejects racism

188
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,187
- and nazism unequivocally. Okay?
- Hmm.

189
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,939
Now, uh, can we talk about this later?

190
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,191
I have a lot going on today. Thank you.

191
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,819
You know, whatever. I don't need you.

192
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,280
I'll just ping his chip,
go get his ass myself.

193
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,200
No. Homelander wants everyone to present
a united front right now.

194
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,578
My brother is paralyzed.

195
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,288
I want some fucking justice.

196
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,707
Seriously? Justice?

197
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,000
- Yeah.
- You want justice?

198
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,293
Yeah.

199
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,171
Oh, fuck.

200
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:15,049
I have spent over 100 hours
in crisis management meetings

201
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,970
specifically figuring out
how to cover up your bullshit,

202
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,181
including all three
of your straight-up murders,

203
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,391
while you were out
in the club with your crew,

204
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,310
or getting your toe sucked by popclaw,

205
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,021
who, let's not forget, you also murdered.

206
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,815
Yeah, that's right. I know about that.

207
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,902
You did not give a shit
about all the collateral you caused then.

208
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,906
Now, all of a sudden, you care
because it happened to you?

209
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,242
Go fuck yourself.

210
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,912
Yeah, that's right.

211
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,080
I said that.

212
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,001
Out loud.

213
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,823
Homelander.

214
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,474
- What?
- Couple things. Uh...

215
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,936
Noir, he's, uh, he's gone.

216
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,813
What do you mean, he's gone?

217
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,232
He cut out his tracking chip.

218
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,908
No, he-he-he...

219
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,497
He-he wouldn't. Not noir. He wouldn't run.

220
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,625
Well...

221
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,377
He wouldn't do that to me.

222
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,504
He wo... he wouldn't run.

223
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,300
Tell him... what we figured out.

224
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,593
Right.

225
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,595
We think crimson countess
was just the start.

226
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,723
We think... he's going after
his whole team, including noir.

227
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,643
The good news is, that means we know
where he's probably headed next.

228
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,187
The twins. Tnt.

229
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,481
They're the closest. Vermont.

230
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,278
Okay.

231
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,614
Okay? Really?
Homelander, thank you so much.

232
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,116
Shh, shh, shh.

233
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,581
You go there, and you check it out.

234
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,252
- Yeah.
- And if soldier boy does show up,

235
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,129
then, uh...

236
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,923
- You call me.
- Yeah.

237
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,344
- Uh... what should I tell the twins?
- I don't give a fuck.

238
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,429
Got it.

239
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,390
Babe, that was amazing.

240
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,243
Yeah, but I didn't need you
to jump in there like that.

241
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,685
- I had the whole thing.
- Hey, hey.

242
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,938
I'm just trying to help. Okay?

243
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,149
We're in this together, right?

244
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,192
Okay. Right.

245
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,236
Right.

246
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,174
Why the long face, tiger?

247
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,511
What if I can't handle him?

248
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,849
I mean, if noir ran...

249
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,934
Oh, you can handle him.

250
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,437
You're the top of the food chain.

251
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,023
Hey, hey.

252
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,569
When we were kids, alone in the bad room,

253
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,113
I got us through it, right?

254
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,449
Don't I always?

255
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,535
- Always.
- No matter what.

256
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,620
No matter what.

257
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,498
And now, I'll get us through this.

258
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,793
Just as long as you and me stick together.

259
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,712
But... what if Edgar's right?

260
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,383
What if it was a mistake
to take over vought?

261
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,634
And-and...

262
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,179
And I am just talent,
and they all know I'm a fraud.

263
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,848
What do you care
what a bunch of mud people think?

264
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,226
Come on.

265
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,437
Tell me the real reason.
I want to hear you say it.

266
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,566
- Say it!
- I want them to love me.

267
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,859
Yahtzee!

268
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,780
Only it never seems to work out, does it?

269
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,908
Madelyn, Maeve, stormfront,

270
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,201
even your own son.

271
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,998
So why do you keep running headfirst
into the same brick wall?

272
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:22,964
I don't know.

273
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,716
Pants on fire. You know.

274
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,345
It's because, deep down,
there's a part of you that is still...

275
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,431
Human.

276
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,641
- No.
- Mm-hmm. Part of you is.

277
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,018
- Mm-mmm.
- A dirty, shriveled,

278
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,437
anemic little part of you

279
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,481
that still mewls for approval, and love,

280
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,985
and a mommy, and a daddy,
and a boo-hoo-hoo.

281
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,070
Look at me, tiger.

282
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,573
Look at me.

283
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,827
We got to cut that part
of you out like a cancer.

284
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,416
And then, well,
then, my boy, you can finally be

285
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,334
who you were always meant to be.

286
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,547
Pure. Clean.

287
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,674
Like marble.

288
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,432
These people would rather die
than be Soviet slaves.

289
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,142
It's too late.

290
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,020
Afghanistan is ours.

291
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,647
Wrong. It's free.

292
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,151
And I'll stand by our mujahideen brothers
until the end.

293
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,862
You know what else I'll do?

294
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,031
What?

295
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,575
I'll distract you.

296
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,663
Tnt detonate!

297
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,253
These fucking twins.

298
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,177
You know they couldn't hit
their fucking marks?

299
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,133
Fucking unprofessionals is what they are.

300
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,969
Hey, uh, yeah, butcher's gonna find them.

301
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,822
Why don't you, uh,
why don't you get some sleep?

302
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,432
Mmm, no. I've slept enough.

303
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,161
Dads.

304
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,954
We know you love taking
your babies everywhere.

305
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,189
No matter where you go,
starlight diapers...

306
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,941
Do men really walk around like that?

307
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,652
Yeah. I mean, dads do.

308
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,237
Okay, well...

309
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,781
Bill cosby is america's dad, and,

310
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,951
tell you one thing, he wouldn't
be caught dead in that pussy gear.

311
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,661
Lot to unpack there. Uh...

312
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,579
The cos. That's a real man.

313
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,124
Holy shit,
did he make some strong drinks.

314
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,668
Holy fucking shit.

315
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,003
But, seriously,
what passes as a man today?

316
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,422
Christ on a cross.

317
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,636
I read that we were ass up in Afghanistan.

318
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,266
The fuck is up with that?
Those were the good guys.

319
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,160
- I mean, when I left, it was, uh...
- Yeah, you know...

320
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,688
I mean, goddamn it.
We-we were ten and one, you know?

321
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,982
I lead the 116th onto Omaha beach.

322
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,359
I was in the fucking eagle's nest.

323
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,944
I fought for this country.

324
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,782
I fought for this country.

325
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,785
And what did I get for it?

326
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,788
Forgotten.

327
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,961
Left to rot by my own team.

328
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,223
You know, I wanted
some rug rats of my own,

329
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,476
with countess. Yeah.

330
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,769
Ain't that a bitch.

331
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,607
You know, couple of little boys.
Raise them up to be men.

332
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,901
Now...

333
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,404
Now I got nothing.

334
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,075
Hey, um, can I ask you something?

335
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,663
What happened in midtown?

336
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,543
I don't know.

337
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,687
I mean, your team wasn't there,

338
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,314
so did someone do anything,
or say something...

339
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,840
- I said, I don't know.
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

340
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,849
I blacked out.

341
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,271
About ten minutes.

342
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,442
When I came to, the damage was done.

343
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,031
I didn't mean to hurt those people.

344
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,410
I'm not a bad guy.

345
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,122
But that won't happen again...

346
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,000
Right?

347
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,379
Only if they got it coming.

348
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,925
Oi, oi.

349
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,096
You're bleeding.

350
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,180
Not mine.

351
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,057
Got an address.

352
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,017
We're off to Vermont.

353
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,621
Lord of the seven seas. Wow.

354
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,540
My man, I'm such an incredible fan.

355
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,210
Jesus, Tommy. Slather his balls
in peanut butter, why don't you?

356
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,587
Sorry. My sister's a goddamn bitch.

357
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,506
And, uh, tnt.

358
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,842
Right. I'm a big fan of yours, too.

359
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,385
Cool outfits.

360
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,680
Always felt you got railroaded
with that starlight thing, by the way.

361
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,181
You know, like, what,

362
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,392
nowadays, you can't even
pay a lady a compliment.

363
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,728
- I know, right?
- You're disgusting.

364
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,856
Anyway, we are just so pleased, you know,

365
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,524
have a big star such as yourself

366
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,818
grace our humble soiree.

367
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,319
You guys having a party?

368
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,244
Wait, is this...

369
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,749
This is herogasm.

370
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,852
I'm really glad you're here.

371
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,563
I missed you.

372
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,157
- Who's joining us?
- They didn't tell you?

373
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,450
Hey, there.

374
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,538
Hey, lady.

375
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,311
The mayor can say anything she wants,

376
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,920
but homelander is the one working

377
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,171
- to catch the guy.
- Mmm.

378
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,173
We're about to turn a corner here.

379
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,800
Absolutely, we are.

380
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,486
- Thank you, honey.
- Of course, sweetheart.

381
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,678
That's reassuring.

382
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,140
But there are 19 dead
and dozens wounded.

383
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,850
Congresswoman neuman,

384
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,728
what do you say to the Americans
who are watching right now

385
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,081
- and feeling scared?
- Yeah, look, it's understandable...

386
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,066
What kind of a-a nasty question is that?

387
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,296
- Oh, no, it's fine. I'm happy to answer...
- Starlightjust said, and I keep saying,

388
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,030
this is not a problem.

389
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,406
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean...

390
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,784
I don't have time
for your mediocre ambush.

391
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
Your job is to report facts,

392
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,455
not attack us when we sit here
and tell you the truth.

393
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,250
The American people, they know.

394
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,478
They know when someone's
telling them facts,

395
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,963
and they know when the media
is lying to them.

396
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,090
There is no problem.

397
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,717
It is safe to go out. Period.

398
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,803
You know what? We're done here.

399
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,099
Stupid fucking hack.

400
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,311
Up next, Chuck makes empanadas
with Rachael ray.

401
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,855
We'll be right back.

402
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,290
And we're clear.

403
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,691
You fucking amateur.

404
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,086
The next report you're gonna be doing
is inside my fucking asshole,

405
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,194
you piece of shit.

406
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,113
Hey, uh, you free for a little catch-up?

407
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,074
You know what?
I'm-I'm a little slammed right now.

408
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,785
Oh, come on. Ten minutes won't kill you.

409
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,004
Hey, so, uh, where's hughie?

410
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,132
Oh, he's just camping with his dad
for a couple of days.

411
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,635
Okay. Okay, good.

412
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,471
Oh, great. I thought he was avoiding me
or something, you know

413
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,432
'cause he was scared
I was gonna pop his head.

414
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,518
Hmm?

415
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,186
Come on, Annie.

416
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,981
Put them away.

417
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm not gonna hurt you
or hughie or your families.

418
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,154
Besides, you'd lose.

419
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,115
Then why are you here?

420
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,783
Because I want to help you.

421
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,161
Huh. Help.

422
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,623
From the psycho who blew up congress.

423
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,125
Look, most of those guys
passed around deepfakes of me

424
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,044
on the house floor blowing bin laden,

425
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,087
so I'm not exactly overwhelmed
with sympathy.

426
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,716
Annie, you need me.

427
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,384
You're all alone.

428
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,386
I mean, come on, that #homelight shit?

429
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,305
That looks like you're in a hostage video.

430
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,640
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

431
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,475
And, what, you got to play nice
with the guy

432
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,478
that throat-fucked you
on your first day of work.

433
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,480
And Maeve, they say Maeve is in rehab,

434
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,191
but you and I both know
she's probably dead.

435
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,568
I'm all you got.

436
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,780
Come on, Annie, you and I were friends.

437
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,448
None of that has changed for me.

438
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,075
Are you ever gonna get to the point?

439
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,704
You have 193 million Instagram followers.

440
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,128
Lend me your influence,
and I'll lend you mine.

441
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,000
I can protect you from homelander.

442
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,419
You'll finally be team captain for real.

443
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,797
And in return, you help me
goose my numbers.

444
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,925
I can finally get
my education reform bill passed.

445
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,843
We can make things better, Annie.

446
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,847
For my daughter, for a lot of daughters.

447
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,101
Come on, what do you say?

448
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,608
You're right.

449
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,782
This whole place.

450
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,077
I'm so fucking tired...

451
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,332
Of listening to people tell me

452
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,210
I need to be shitty in order to win.

453
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,922
Fuck you.

454
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,384
And fuck homelander, and fuck vought

455
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,721
and this "whatever it takes" crap.

456
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:18,017
You're just gonna end up sitting on top
of the steaming pile of shit

457
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,393
that you built.

458
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,812
I'm done.

459
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,524
I'm fucking done.
I'm not doing it anymore.

460
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,277
You're not gonna be doing anything
if homelander kills you.

461
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,820
Yeah, maybe.

462
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,073
But then I'll know I'm not
working with a fucking nutjob.

463
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,745
So, either pop my head
or get the hell out.

464
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,014
Hey, keep this between us?

465
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,642
It'd be really tough to take out
america's sweetheart,

466
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,561
but not impossible.

467
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,429
I'm so sorry.

468
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,103
No.

469
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,823
No. S'il vous plait, no.

470
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,699
Don't do this.

471
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,910
His body is a masterpiece, no?

472
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,669
Do you know the story
behind this one?

473
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,922
Oh, years ago, my cousin kolya
went state's witness,

474
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,549
so I send my serge.

475
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,969
Not even three bullets
could stop my attack dog.

476
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,557
Bar fight on the basque coast.

477
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,101
He started it.

478
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,980
Oh, my beast. This is my favorite.

479
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,026
When serge was 14 years old,
he dropped a glass.

480
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:38,282
His father told him to knee! In the shards
and not move until he said so.

481
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,369
Little serge did not shift an inch,

482
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,122
not even after his father left
to get drunk

483
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,999
and pass out in the whorehouse.

484
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,961
Oh, please, don't cry for serge.

485
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,088
He likes to be told what to do.

486
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,550
And he loves to be punished when he's bad.

487
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,844
Makes him hard.

488
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,182
So... cherie...

489
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,975
- No.
- Or kimiko?

490
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,185
No, don't do it.

491
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,437
Don't do this! Nina!

492
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,732
You must choose, serge.
If not, I will kill both of them,

493
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,194
and when you've finished
screaming, crying, I will kill you, too.

494
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,493
- Choose.
- No.

495
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,417
Fuck.

496
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,078
Kimiko, run!

497
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,586
Kimiko!

498
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,071
Oh, fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

499
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,006
Mon coeur.

500
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,173
Mon coeur.

501
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,467
She's gone.

502
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,345
Nina's gone.

503
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,724
It's over.

504
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,310
It's over.

505
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,113
Have you always had that?

506
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

507
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,374
I grew up in Harlem,

508
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,169
brownstone filled with family.

509
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,213
Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins.

510
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,384
One night, there was a ruckus outside.

511
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,637
I looked out the window,
and it was soldier boy.

512
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,891
He had pulled up on some kids
that were trying to boost a benz,

513
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,685
and so I run and wake up my grandad.

514
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,105
"Grandpa, grandpa.
It's soldier boy. Come look."

515
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,733
Soldier boy takes the benz,

516
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,570
and he hurls it through our house,
like a fucking freight train.

517
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,365
It missed me by about six inches.

518
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,283
And my grandpa...

519
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,911
One minute he was there...

520
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,457
And then he wasn't.

521
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,585
And I woke him up.

522
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,879
I put him in that spot.

523
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,591
That is not your fault.

524
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,928
That's when this whole ocd shit started.
I mean, I don't understand it.

525
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,348
All I know is that if I didn't
check the burners three times a night,

526
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,683
soldier boy would come back
and kill the rest of us.

527
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,480
And I'm still that kid.

528
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,736
Still getting up in the middle
of the night, checking the burners.

529
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,656
'Cause if I don't,

530
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,659
soldier boy's gonna come back,

531
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,621
and he's gonna kill my family.

532
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,503
I got to get this motherfucker
out of my head,

533
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,798
and end this.

534
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,051
Or it'll end me.

535
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,942
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
- Oh, hell nah.

536
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,069
- Oh, my god.
- Invitation?

537
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,529
I got your invitation right here.

538
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,030
Hey.

539
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,200
Starlight. I did not even recognize you.

540
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,911
Come in. You are
more than welcome to party.

541
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,246
- Party?
- Yeah.

542
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,707
The 70th anniversary of herogasm.

543
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,500
- Fuck me.
- Oh.

544
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,086
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

545
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,254
You seem familiar.

546
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,518
You about to get familiar with these hands

547
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,508
if you don't get this
motherfucking love sausage

548
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,052
- away from my goddamn face.
- Okay, okay, okay.

549
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,846
You are not supe.

550
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,892
I'm with her. For the fuck party.

551
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,687
Yeah. Um, mm-hmm.
No, he's very good at cunnilingus.

552
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,898
- Yeah, his tongue is just... yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

553
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,192
He just gobbles that vagina right up.

554
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,919
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom.

555
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,321
- Mm-hmm.
- Love sausage, huh?

556
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,947
This is good name for me.

557
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,657
I like it. Come on in.

558
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,877
Oh, my god.

559
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,592
Oh!

560
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,262
All right, so once a year,
a bunch of c-iisters

561
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,098
get together at one of their places
to get they wicks wet.

562
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,808
Stop.

563
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,268
- Herogasm.
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,063
- I get it.
- Holy ass-ramming.

565
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,232
Aw, stop!

566
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,443
Holy ass-ramming. Holy ass-ramming.

567
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,407
Come on. Come on my hump.

568
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,035
That's it.

569
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,372
Poor frenchie.

570
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,000
He's always wanted to see this.
He's gonna be heartbroken.

571
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,757
- You know what's fucked up?
- Hmm?

572
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,842
It's that it's real
fucking sex workers here

573
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,470
getting banged up,
and not in the good way.

574
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,390
Not that these supes give a shit.

575
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,851
When soldier boy gets here,
it's gonna be a slaughter.

576
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,095
We have to get these people out.

577
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,983
What up, bro?

578
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,944
What the fuck did this motherfucker
put on my jacket?

579
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,381
- Oh, my god. Okay. Um...
- It's my favorite fucking jacket.

580
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,091
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- Some nasty-ass shit.

581
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,801
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- This shit is sticky.

582
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,969
Let's go clean it up. Let's go.

583
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,679
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Yellowtail sashimi?

584
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,705
No. No, not in the mood for that. Thanks.

585
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,474
- Goddamn it.
- Throwing ropes.

586
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,003
Oh, shit.

587
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,422
Lick it up, you yummy brown bear.

588
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:55,927
I can't.

589
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,388
I need a bathroom.

590
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,640
Right now.

591
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,394
Oh, okay.
So, this-this is an actual orgy.

592
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,687
That's what this is.

593
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,272
Fucking herogasm.

594
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,317
Still a thing, eh?

595
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,570
It's my thing. I founded it in '52.

596
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,947
Me and this other supe, Liberty.

597
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,949
Man, was she a firecracker.

598
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,203
Frenchie's gonna be heartbroken
he missed this.

599
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,957
There are a lot of people in there.

600
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,504
Well, as long as they stay out
of my way, they'll be fine.

601
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,884
Okay, all right.
Just, uh, give me three minutes.

602
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,153
I'll jump in, I'll jump back out.

603
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,279
I'll tell you exactly
where to find the twins.

604
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,721
Nobody else in your way.

605
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,223
Three minutes.

606
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,688
Soldier boy?
Nah, he's dead as dog shit.

607
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,814
No, he's not.

608
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,525
I swear, this is really happening.

609
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,112
Please, you need to help me
get people out of here, now.

610
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,156
Starlight, come on.

611
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,533
Do not let them do this to you.

612
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,744
This... this fear.

613
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,079
You heard what homelander said.

614
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,123
Lamestream media's making
a fucking mountain out of a molehill.

615
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,417
- Do the research.
- Oh, my god.

616
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,710
This is real.

617
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,004
These attacks are real.

618
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,298
Soldier boy is real.

619
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,510
Well, I just think you could stand to be
a little better informed.

620
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,930
Homelander's gonna take care of it, okay?

621
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,225
I'm gonna go find a salad to toss.

622
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,060
Excuse me.

623
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,026
You melted my cock ring.

624
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,826
Oh, Jesus,
your stretching powers!

625
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,706
Oh, my god, your mouth is amazing.

626
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,333
It's like a velvet vacuum
draining my balls.

627
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,752
Oh, yeah. You are so fucking hot.

628
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,881
God, your legs go on for days.

629
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,264
Ooh. Ooh. Oh, my god.

630
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,974
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

631
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,684
It's not what it looks like.

632
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,977
What are you doing here?

633
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,830
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
Why would you even...

634
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,689
This octopus was sick.
Why would you ask that?

635
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,958
Homelander is gonna love this.

636
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,584
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. Stop.

637
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,026
Stop, stop, stop. No.

638
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,945
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look.

639
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,781
That's why I'm here. It's his idea.

640
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,952
What's his idea?

641
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,082
I said no cameras in the toilets, Tommy.

642
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,418
- Give it back.
- You're pathetic.

643
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,753
You know what?

644
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,589
Let's see how everyone feels

645
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,092
about close-ups of their assholes
without consent!

646
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,385
Fuck you. I'm done.

647
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,971
I never want to see you again.

648
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,393
Oh. That's so sweet.

649
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,438
Uh, just... I got to give
my asshole a breather.

650
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,731
You know?

651
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,941
Then say goodbye
to that westfield mall

652
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,943
opening next week in poughkeepsie,

653
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,363
'cause nobody is coming
to see you without me.

654
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,241
I fucking hate you.
I hate your mouth.

655
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,076
I hate the way your jaw pops
when you chew.

656
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,872
And I hated every second I spent
holding that clammy hand.

657
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,707
I should've killed you in the womb.

658
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,792
Ah, fuck you!

659
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,959
Fuck you!

660
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,544
Fuck you, Tommy!

661
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,713
Sorry.

662
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,969
Hey, I know you like fucking supes,
but I'm off the table.

663
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,513
That's not why I'm here, okay?

664
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,473
You're here, too, you know.

665
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,766
Whatever, pornhub.

666
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,851
I don't have time for you right now.

667
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,110
Hey.

668
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,029
You never said you were sorry.

669
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,113
What?

670
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,406
For Robin.

671
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,410
You never apologized for Robin.

672
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,455
- Jesus, you want to do this right now?
- Yeah, I do.

673
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,332
You just get away
with everything, don't you?

674
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,168
Just running past all the broken people
you leave behind.

675
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,131
All right, you know what?

676
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,424
What?

677
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,179
I'm sorry.

678
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,474
Is that what you want to hear?

679
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,811
'Cause I am.

680
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,523
Okay?

681
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,941
It's fucked up,

682
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,444
seeing somebody that you love
get hurt like that.

683
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,656
I'm sorry.

684
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,494
I'm fucking sorry, hughie.

685
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,169
- Hughie. Hughie.
- How did you do that?

686
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,630
- Stop, stop!
- No, no, no. How the fuck did you do that?

687
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,882
- I'll show you again!
- No.

688
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,800
That is not going to happen.

689
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,844
A-train, get out of here.

690
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,471
Not that you deserve the warning.

691
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,391
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

692
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,897
Is he here?

693
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,649
He's only here for the twins, all right?

694
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,318
Nobody else has to get hurt.

695
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,362
You don't get to decide who to serve up
on a platter here, okay?

696
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,823
These are real people.
We need to clear the house now.

697
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,617
This is about to be a fucking bloodbath.

698
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,369
No, it won't. I made soldier boy
promise not to do anything...

699
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,288
Hughie, stop it. Listen to me.

700
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,583
Homelander is coming.

701
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,377
The deep told me.

702
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,087
When those two start fighting...

703
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,467
Please. Help me.

704
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,645
- You have to go.
- No. I need to stop him.

705
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,021
Annie. No, Annie.

706
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,106
Annie!

707
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,278
Oh, my god... you teleported me?

708
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,404
What the fuck?

709
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,824
I saved you, Annie.

710
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,495
Jesus Christ. All I want is to save you.

711
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,623
You keep saying that,
but I don't need you to save me.

712
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,960
Right, god forbid I help you,
because I always have to be the weak one,

713
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,419
- the one you have to rescue.
- No.

714
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,983
You always have to be the strong one.

715
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,382
You always have to be
so much stronger than me.

716
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,521
I thought that you didn't care about that.

717
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,054
I mean, on our first date,

718
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,139
you said that it didn't bother you.

719
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,307
I know.

720
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,772
But it does.

721
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,693
Sometimes.

722
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,779
A little.

723
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,578
I thought the drugs
had fucked you up, hughie, but...

724
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,457
This is you.

725
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,295
This is all you.

726
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,706
Halothane.

727
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,845
What'd you think
you were gonna do with that?

728
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,430
You killed my family.

729
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,891
Which one?

730
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,690
Oi.

731
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,277
Not him.

732
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,449
Twins are out there.

733
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,922
So you get homelander,
but I can't get soldier boy?

734
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,258
You're a fucking hypocrite, butcher.
Now move.

735
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,843
I can't let you do it, m.

736
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,637
It'd be suicide.

737
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,486
Oh, come off it.
What you gonna do with it?

738
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,570
Move!

739
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,075
You're such a fucking idiot.

740
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,660
Can't even work the TiVo without me.

741
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,414
And there it is, sick fuck.

742
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,041
Hiya, kids.

743
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,877
That poop chute's had a workout, huh?

744
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,712
Looks like the Lincoln tunnel.

745
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,423
Ben.

746
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,928
You fucked me, you selfish piece of shit!

747
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,682
That's enough.

748
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,065
- Nicaragua wasn't our fault.
- Yeah, swear to god.

749
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,067
Then whose fault was it?

750
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,446
If you tell me, maybe I'll let you go.

751
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,658
I-It was noir. It was noir's idea,
top to bottom.

752
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,411
He gave you to the Russians. Please.

753
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,955
- Noir?
- Uh-huh.

754
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:26,914
Yeah.

755
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:31,294
Noir wouldn't take a shit
without vought's say-so.

756
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,672
Please? It's the truth.

757
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,901
- Give me your hand.
- It's been years.

758
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:55,984
Do you want to die?

759
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,281
Tnt detonate!

760
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,960
- I got to go.
- Annie, wait.

761
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,545
Annie, Annie, Annie, just...

762
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,589
You can't go.

763
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,049
Icant?

764
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,384
I'm not gonna let you.

765
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,528
Oh, shit.

766
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,697
No. No.

767
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,407
I don't want to hear it right now.

768
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,833
Blue hawk!

769
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,794
- What?
- We got to talk.

770
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,089
Jesus Christ, not right now.
There's a psycho back there.

771
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,469
The fuck? Get your fucking hands off me.

772
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,472
You hurt a lot of people.
You hurt my brother.

773
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,725
You're not gonna get away with it.
Not this time.

774
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,687
Fuck!

775
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,924
God.

776
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,278
Help me.

777
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,530
S-Someone please help...

778
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,357
Huh.

779
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,077
Soned?

780
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:54,705
What happened?

781
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,927
William butcher and soldier boy.

782
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,303
Of course.

783
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,639
You are behind this.

784
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,058
This whole thing.

785
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,354
It really is all about me.

786
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,649
William, we made a deal

787
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:26,028
to fight to the death, you and me.

788
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,197
This is cheating.

789
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,282
Deal's off.

790
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,418
You were my hero growing up.

791
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,754
I watched all your movies,
hundreds of times.

792
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,883
You were the only one
that was nearly as strong as me.

793
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,762
Buddy, you think you look strong?

794
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,597
You're wearing a cape.

795
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,976
You're just a cheap fucking knockoff.

796
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,520
Oh, no, no, no.

797
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,899
I'm the upgrade.

798
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,166
Mm! Mm!

799
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,835
Mm, mm, please, I need you.
People are hurt.

800
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,880
Mm! Mm! Please.

801
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,382
He doesn't control you.

802
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,717
We have to help these people.

803
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,511
It's up to us.

804
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,784
You really had me
going for a minute there.

805
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,215
What the fuck?

806
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,474
What have you done?

807
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,227
Scorched earth.

808
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,453
Do it!

809
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,875
Hughie!

810
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,085
Get out of here!

811
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,295
No fucking way.

812
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,327
Let's see?

813
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,736
Hey.

814
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,615
I'm sorry.

815
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,333
Hey, please, no. Easy.

816
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,210
We need a doctor to resew these stitches.

817
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:02,513
What do you mean?

818
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,614
You are not a monster.

819
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,206
It seems no matter how much we try to run,

820
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,418
we cannot escape our old lives, huh?

821
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,339
I suppose no one can run that fast.

822
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,862
Yeah.

823
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,038
This is a bad idea.

824
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,084
Homelander helped make me
america's sweetheart.

825
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,714
He's gonna regret that.

826
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,891
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

827
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,020
I'm in Montpelier, Vermont.

828
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,023
Twelve heroes and civilians are dead,

829
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,650
a lot more are wounded.

830
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,820
Now, homelander and vought
are going to tell you

831
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:26,323
that it was the supervillain
and that they have it handled.

832
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,158
They don't.

833
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,037
It was soldier boy.

834
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,373
I know I sound insane, but...

835
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:40,212
Soldier boy doesn't care
about protecting Americans,

836
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,297
and he probably never has.

837
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,634
Most heroes don't care about you.

838
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,429
They only care about their image, and...

839
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,642
Homelander is the worst of them.

840
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,229
He's hurt people.

841
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,566
He's done something to Maeve.

842
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,365
I don't know what they're gonna
do to me for telling the truth,

843
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:13,871
but I'm going to keep doing it,
and I should've done it sooner.

844
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,163
I'm sorry.

845
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,541
And one more thing.

846
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,211
I'm not starlight anymore.

847
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,298
My name is Annie January...

848
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,010
And I fucking quit.
