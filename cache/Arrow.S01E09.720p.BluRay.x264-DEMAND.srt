1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,083
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,411
For five years, I was stranded on an island
with only one goal...

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,005
...survive.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,446
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,003
Now I will fulfill my father's dying
wish, to use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,771
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,647
To do this, I must become someone else.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,963
I must become something else.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,644
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,922
Stop looking into this. It's not safe.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,687
Accidents tend to befall people
who are too curious.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,083
Felicity, I want you to find out all you can
about that notebook.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,040
I got these from Applied Sciences.
Look at the book again.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,130
Where can I find the man in this picture?

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,410
Island dangerous,
but you not tell them where to find me.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,846
I'm coming with you.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,882
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,921
Look, all I'm doing is looking
to get something going again.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,128
Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,725
I know, but this time--

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,407
I'm gonna have to call you back.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,605
What?

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,650
What, you come back
for another pound of flesh?

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,485
You're gonna be disappointed, pal.
Thanks to you, I'm--

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,803
- Nice. Picking up the pace.
- Could say the same thing about you.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,441
You crossed three names
off your father's list.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,321
Some of these guys are just giving it up.
All I gotta do is pay them a visit.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,006
Seems the vigilante's reputation
is beginning to precede him.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,366
Ah! Ugh.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,003
Another round?

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,763
No.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,850
Gotta take my nephew to the mall
so he can let Santa know...

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,446
- ...what he wants for Christmas.
- Christmas.

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,121
I didn't even realize.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,524
Because you've been logging so many hood
hours ever since that thing with Helena.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,450
I meant...

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,242
...there were no holidays on the island.
There just-- Every day was:

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,004
"How do I stay alive?"

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,084
And to do that, you had to forget things.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,727
Like Christmas.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,051
My dad threw a party every year, heh...

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,525
...and he would put a Christmas tree
in every room.

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,570
The whole mansion smelled like...

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,762
It smelled like Christmas.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,242
Maybe give the list a rest
and enjoy the holidays with your family.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,324
Besides, I hear St. Nick
has a list of his own.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,006
I'd wager you're in the "nice" column.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,402
Go home, Oliver.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,008
You not dead.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,525
Good.

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,048
Where the hell have you been?

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,570
I ran out of food and water days ago.

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,009
Hey. Hey. Where you going?

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,480
You.

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,401
Stop.

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,085
Stop.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,407
He's the one who tied me up and had me
tortured all because he was looking for you.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,961
He would've killed me
if you didn't show up.

59
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,326
Then you kill him.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,211
Or he can take you home.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,447
What?

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,490
He has a plane.

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,167
A way for you off this island.

64
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,491
Hey-

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,610
You look very pretty.
What's the occasion?

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,531
Mom and Walter are having a dinner party
with some big muckety-mucks.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,007
- Phew.
- Best night of my life.

68
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,531
Thea, why aren't there any decorations up
in the house?

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,011
What do you mean?

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,685
No wreaths. No trees.

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,083
Everyone's just been really busy lately.
I'm sure they haven't gotten around to it yet.

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,045
Does Morn at least have
some of those boxes of candy canes?

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,846
Remember we used to race
to see who would finish first?

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,243
- Yeah, I always won.
- No, you cheated.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,122
Well, she went sugar-free last year.

76
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,001
So I doubt you'll be seeing
any of those around.

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,563
The thing that people forget
is that Robin Hood was a criminal.

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,287
And stealing from the rich to give to
the poor is really the job of the Democrats.

79
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,208
All joking aside,
crime is down for the first time in five years.

80
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,001
That's because of the changes
my department has implemented.

81
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,802
Or because the vigilante's activities have
had a chilling effect on the city's criminals.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,124
What are your thoughts, Oliver?

83
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,524
I think the vigilante needs a better code
name than "the Hood" or "the hood guy."

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,120
I agree. How about "Green Arrow"?

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,801
Lame.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,843
Forgive me.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,490
It's the office.

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,721
Excuse me.

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,287
I'm in the middle of a dinner party,
so I hope this is of some importance.

90
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,442
That depends
how you define "important."

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,610
See, most people would consider
finding a list of names...

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,003
...written in subsonic, ultraviolet,
invisible ink important.

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,049
But I already know about that, don't I?

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,441
Did you know seven of the names
on the list...

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,604
...are guys the vigilante has had
in his crosshairs?

96
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,731
That is if bows had crosshairs,
which they don't.

97
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,011
But it is a rather long list, Felicity,
so I would expect there to be some overlap.

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,571
Like Doug Miller.

99
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,485
Head of Applied Sciences
at Queen Consolidated. What of him?

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,247
Miller may end up getting an arrow
in his stocking, because he's on the list.

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,449
So important or not?

102
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,366
I'm sorry. Something's come up.

103
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,927
Is everything okay?

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,162
The vigilante has struck again.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,727
I really do need to take this call.
It's my contractor. Excuse me.

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,570
Well, the daughter came over,
used her key, found Dad.

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,007
Hat trick to the chest.

108
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,207
The hood guy.

109
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,570
That's what I thought at first, but these
black arrows aren't consistent with his M.O.

110
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,123
Neither is the fact that the Hood took Hunt
for $40 million a few months ago.

111
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,608
Doesn't make sense to kill him now.
Something doesn't add up.

112
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,650
We're dealing with a copycat.

113
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,241
Who would kill Adam Hunt
with an arrow?

114
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,482
I mean, other than you.

115
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,926
A setup, maybe.

116
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,211
Someone looking to cover up killing Hunt
by making it look like the work of the Hood?

117
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,285
Whoever he was, he's good.
The grouping on Hunt's chest was tight.

118
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,484
It's a compound bow, most likely.
The guy is a...

119
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,045
The guy's a legitimate archer.

120
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,446
So someone who would be particular
about his arrows.

121
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,525
We get an arrow, we get a bead
on where he purchased them.

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,082
So, what are you gonna do?

123
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,370
What anyone does when they need help.

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,765
Call a cop.

125
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,443
- Quentin Lance?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,647
Sign here, please.

127
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,642
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

128
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,200
- Lance.
- I didn't kill Adam Hunt.

129
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,681
- You.
ARROW'. You call me "the Hood."

130
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,564
It's not a great nickname.

131
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,082
You told Commissioner Nudocerdo
you might be dealing with a copycat...

132
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,449
...another archer, which makes me
your best bet to take him down.

133
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,290
But I need your help.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
I need one of the arrows from his murder.

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,322
We're good at pulling down leads
off evidence.

136
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,601
Not like I am.

137
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,331
I can do things the police can't.

138
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,925
Go places they won't.

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,686
Like I said, I don't even know who--

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,846
If this archer doesn't stop with Adam Hunt,
we both have a problem. Think about it...

141
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,850
...then call me.

142
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,451
Number's programmed in.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,082
Doug. Thanks for coming.

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,526
Of course.

145
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,445
How's construction coming
on the Applied Sciences Center?

146
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,968
Over budget and behind schedule.
Exactly as expected.

147
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Is that what you wanted to see me about?

148
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,290
Adam Hunt...

149
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,721
...he was murdered last night
by the vigilante.

150
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,964
- I read about that.
- I've been concerned by the idea...

151
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,409
...that the vigilante might target
an employee or officer of this company.

152
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,489
Security red-flagged you.

153
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,411
Me?

154
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,164
Why would this guy go after me?

155
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,800
That's a point I was hoping
you could shed light on.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,721
From what I've read, this vigilante
only goes after white-collar criminals.

157
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,844
Well, let's just hope he doesn't decide
to branch out.

158
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,284
I think there should be a national holiday
for the guy who invented french fries.

159
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,171
Or at least a statue or something.

160
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,887
There is no Christmas party...

161
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,970
...is there?

162
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,210
Thea, Dad threw one of these every year.

163
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,165
Did people think
I just wasn't gonna notice?

164
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,011
- Hey, Thea.
- Hi, Shane.

165
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,249
- Uh, this is my brother, Oliver.
- Nice to meet you, Thea's brother.

166
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,251
Bet the food on that island's better
than the stuff here.

167
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,641
You'd lose that bet.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,367
We're heading down to the bay,
if you wanna come.

169
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,241
Thanks, but, uh, I'm spending the afternoon
with my brother.

170
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,883
Another time.

171
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,724
See you.

172
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,001
- How do you know that Shane guy?
- We rob banks and smoke crack together.

173
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,004
Heh, that's funny.
I have a feeling I'm not gonna be a fan.

174
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,208
You don't even know him.

175
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,802
Let's change the subject.

176
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,965
Fine. You were gonna tell me why we're not
having the annual Christmas party.

177
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,160
When you and Dad disappeared...

178
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,162
...by the time Christmas rolled around...

179
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,368
...none of us felt much like celebrating...

180
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,731
...so we kind of skipped Christmas that year.

181
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,368
Every year.

182
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,281
And it's really fine, so...

183
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,166
No.

184
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,564
No, it's really not.

185
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,123
We're celebrating Christmas.
I went five years without it...

186
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,325
...then Thea tells me you didn't have it
either and I'm the reason. So maybe now...

187
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,881
...I can be the reason
we have Christmas again.

188
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,370
I thought I would throw
the Queen Christmas party.

189
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,125
You?

190
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,411
I know that I haven't been the son
or the stepson...

191
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,804
...or the brother that all of you deserve,
especially lately...

192
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,002
...but this feels like the right moment
to start making up for lost time.

193
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,888
What do you say?

194
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,289
- I say yes.
- Yes. Okay.

195
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,484
I will take care of everything,
you don't have to do anything.

196
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,406
Just show up, look fantastic,
and bring some Christmas cheer, okay?

197
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,005
Okay.

198
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,371
Fine.

199
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,044
You're a good man, Oliver.

200
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,203
You're a good man.

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,408
I can see it.

202
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,447
Well, beneath the privileged upbringing
and the wealthy veneer.

203
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,246
I saw it when my man tortured you.
You wouldn't give up your friend.

204
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,723
Not even a friend, really.
Someone you just met.

205
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,927
Shut up.

206
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,287
What do you know about him, hmm?

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
Nothing, I suspect.

208
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,403
Do you even know
what this island really is?

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,763
It's a prison.

210
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,570
I mean this literally.

211
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,367
Until eight years ago,
the Chinese military...

212
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,206
...operated this island as a penitentiary...

213
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,204
...for criminals deemed so dangerous...

214
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,330
...they couldn't be safely incarcerated
on the mainland.

215
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,006
When the military
shut the program down...

216
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,881
...my unit came in
and disposed of all the inmates.

217
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,727
With the exception of two.

218
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,289
Your friend was one of them.

219
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,441
- Who was the other?
- You met him.

220
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,364
He presided over your interrogation.

221
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,165
He tortured me.

222
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,930
You had information I needed.

223
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,526
What would you do in my position?

224
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,527
What would you do to capture the man
who'd slaughtered dozens of people?

225
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,761
Douglas Miller came to see me today
quite concerned.

226
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,928
He said your husband interrogated him.

227
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,846
That his questions suggested a knowledge
he shouldn't have...

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,047
...of the list.

229
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,207
Let me talk to him.

230
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,842
I think we're past the point of conversation,
Moira.

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,927
A month ago you came to me and told me
to stay away from your family, and I did.

232
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,363
But your family
isn't staying away from me...

233
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,921
...which means
something must be done about it.

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,128
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, I do.

235
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,884
And I'll handle it.

236
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,130
I guess what I'm wondering is whether
it's time for our associate to handle it.

237
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,091
Hell yeah, I returned the money.

238
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,404
Seventy-million dollars isn't worth
getting an arrow through the chest.

239
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,564
And you can tell him,
if he's got a problem with that, he can--

240
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,884
Commissioner, this is Nelson Ravich.

241
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,724
The Hood hit him earlier this week.

242
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,566
Ravich wired back the money he embezzled
less than five minutes later.

243
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,570
All right.

244
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,967
We tell the press the Hood did this.

245
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,170
Hunt's murder is a Page-10 story, at best...

246
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,881
...but Ravich makes this
a serial-murder case.

247
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,921
We can't let the public get wind of the idea
that there are two of these nutjobs around.

248
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,003
You want me to ignore a serial killer?

249
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,925
Just catch one of these psychos.
I don't care which one.

250
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,686
That is a direct order
from your commanding officer.

251
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,881
Well, you can forget it, then.

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,641
Fine. It's forgotten.

253
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,408
And you're off this case, sergeant.
Effective immediately.

254
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,526
Don't bother trying to trace this.
You'll never make it through the encryption.

255
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,446
There's a heating vent on the corner
of O'Neil and Adams.

256
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,489
You'll find what you're after there.

257
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,450
It'd be a mistake to set a trap for me,
detective.

258
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,446
I'm trading away everything I believe in.
It's the only way to get this bastard.

259
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,283
You've got till Christmas,
and then, copycat or not...

260
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,361
...I'm coming after you.

261
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,646
So your friend Lance
gave you a Christmas present after all.

262
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,165
Mm-hm.

263
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,607
Teflon-coated titanium blades.
Serrated to split the bone.

264
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,684
Shaft is some type
of specialized polymer...

265
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,731
...which is stronger
than your typical carbon fiber. This...

266
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,207
This is a custom job.

267
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,091
Lance gave in after the other archer
dropped another body.

268
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,287
Nelson Ravich.

269
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,649
Which is another name
you crossed off your dad's list.

270
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,531
So is this guy trying to frame you
or call you out?

271
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,604
Either way, I need to find him.

272
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,564
Hey-

273
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,761
- Don't you knock?
- Felicity, this is the I.T. Department.

274
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,049
- It's not the ladies' room.
- Heh. Right.

275
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,006
- What can I do for you?
- My buddy Steve is really into archery.

276
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,925
Apparently, it's all the rage now.

277
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,925
I don't know why.
Looks utterly ridiculous to me.

278
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,445
Mm-hm.

279
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,925
Anyway, it's Steve's birthday next weekend
and I wanted to buy him some arrows.

280
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,849
Thing is, he gets these special,
custom-made arrows...

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,721
...and I have no idea where he gets them.

282
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,451
I was hoping you could find out
where this came from.

283
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,290
- Careful.
- Yeah.

284
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,287
The shaft's composite is patented.

285
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,482
And that patent is registered
to a company called Sagittarius.

286
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,122
- That's Latin for "the archer."
- Really?

287
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,329
Could you find out where and when
this was purchased?

288
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,247
According to Sagittarius
company records...

289
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,848
...that particular arrow
was part of a bundle shipment.

290
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,406
Two hundred units...

291
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,881
...sent to this address.

292
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,530
Felicity...

293
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,568
...you're remarkable.

294
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,210
Thank you for remarking on it.

295
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,045
And Merry Christmas.

296
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,607
I'm Jewish.

297
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,370
Happy Hanukkah.

298
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,888
--significant resources
of the Starling City Police Department...

299
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,762
...it is clear that this vigilante 's
cycle of violence has escalated.

300
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,370
I'm asking our citizens to keep a close
eye out and to report anything suspicious.

301
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,361
A tip line has been set up
and a reward will be offered...

302
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,084
...to anyone who aids the authorities
in the capture of this madman.

303
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,287
It isn't him, is it?

304
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,442
NUDOCERDQ".
We are all frustrated with the crime...

305
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,967
The man in the hood,
he didn't kill those people.

306
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,125
- This violence has gone on...
- You're the one that said he was a monster.

307
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,489
Yeah, but he was protecting me,
it's different.

308
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,522
--The apprehension of this so-called Hood
that has been terrorizing our city.

309
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,929
- As police commissioner...
- It's probably Joanna.

310
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,890
She said she was gonna come by
with some files.

311
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,491
Merry Christmas, sir. How are you?

312
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,324
Proficient with firearms.

313
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,091
- Dad?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,325
I told you I wanted to spend the holidays
with my dad.

315
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,280
Right, because of Sara.
Because it makes the holidays a tough time.

316
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,768
But when you are with someone,
as I wanna be with you...

317
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,083
...then there aren't tough times,
there's just times.

318
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,085
Something is holding you back.

319
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,645
The Queens are having
a last-minute Christmas party...

320
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,326
...and I would like for you
to be my plus-one.

321
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,685
I, um, was looking through
some old photographs...

322
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,208
...and I found this.

323
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,762
Merry Christmas.

324
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,285
Bad enough you're friends with this guy, D,
now he's your what?

325
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,966
I don't know what he is,
but he's not wrong.

326
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Something is holding me back.

327
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,282
Right. Keep listening to that something.

328
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,371
I try to stay out of your personal life,
but Merlyn, Queen, they're selfish.

329
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,486
They think they can treat people
any way they please.

330
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,241
- It's you, me and Sara.
- What?

331
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,364
- I see the halls are decked.
- You okay?

332
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,285
I'll manage. Ahem.
Is everyone having a good time?

333
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,010
You sure you wanna do this, man?

334
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,925
Maybe now is not the best time
to be Martha Stewart's elf.

335
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,527
My family needs this party, Diggle,
which means that I need it.

336
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,963
Hey, dude.
Uh, Thea invited me, I hope that's cool.

337
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,048
These are for your mom.

338
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,765
Smooth.

339
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,167
Good luck, kid.

340
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,405
- Thank you for coming.
- Oliver.

341
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,041
You guys look great. Merry Christmas.

342
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,044
- Merry Christmas.
- Let's get a holiday photo.

343
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,965
I've already sent out
our Christmas cards, Oliver.

344
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,886
- Let's get a picture just for the four of us.
- Of course.

345
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,689
Excuse me, Mrs. Queen?

346
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,081
- These are for you.
- Well, thank you.

347
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,642
Uh, I'll go put those in water.

348
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,003
- Is everything all right?
- You and I should talk. Alone.

349
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,171
I'm really surprised.

350
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,325
- Everything okay between the two of you?
- Yeah. I'm sure it'll work itself out.

351
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,325
So glad that both of you could make it.

352
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,730
- Merry Christmas, pal.
- Merry Christmas.

353
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,090
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi.

354
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,570
So how long do you think it'll be
till this isn't so weird?

355
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,644
- You know, the three of us.
- It's not weird at all.

356
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,646
You lied to me.

357
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,529
An odd accusation coming from you.

358
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,810
When you came home, you said you were
through investigating Robert's death.

359
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,611
Robert was my oldest friend.

360
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,211
Do you take me for a man who wouldn't
avenge his best friend's murder?

361
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,725
I thought I could forget about it,
go back to the way things were...

362
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,690
...but you told me too many lies, Moira.

363
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,726
You embezzled money
from the company.

364
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,527
Salvaged the Queen's Gambit.
Why, Moira?

365
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,842
What was it all for?

366
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,411
- For leverage.
- Against whom?

367
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,530
- Against whom?
- People you've made very angry.

368
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,684
- Well, then let me help you fight them.
- I can't fight them.

369
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,171
I am them.

370
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,123
I have tried so hard
to convince myself that I'm not.

371
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,721
And loving you...

372
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,880
You were my salvation.

373
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,765
Moira.

374
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,001
Moira...

375
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,084
...whatever you've done,
and whoever these people are...

376
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,531
...the time for lies is over.

377
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,962
You need to tell me what's going on.

378
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,010
Let's just get through the party...

379
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,685
...and I promise I will tell you everything.

380
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,526
Tommy, do you mind
if I talk to Oliver for a minute?

381
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,763
Yeah, I'll go grab us a couple of drinks
and drink them both.

382
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,169
I know it's probably not easy for you
to see Tommy and I together.

383
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,722
The invitation said "plus one,"
not "minus Laurel."

384
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,565
I've been wanting to move forward with him,
but something's been holding me back.

385
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,247
I keep making these excuses
that it's my dad, it's my work...

386
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,209
...when really...

387
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,447
...it's you.

388
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,801
But for five years, I was emotionally off...

389
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,930
...because you had died.

390
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,490
And the truth is...

391
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,289
...the last person that I expected
to make me feel again, has.

392
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,210
I'm happy...

393
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,487
...for both of you.

394
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,125
Thank you.

395
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,086
Thea, I have something to tell you.

396
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,448
Oliver.

397
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,767
Hit the road.

398
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,007
What are you doing?

399
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,723
Funny, I was gonna ask you
the same thing...

400
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,566
...because there's a party going on
downstairs that I threw for you.

401
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,441
I told you I didn't want a party,
but you didn't care.

402
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,365
Because you came down
with the holiday blues.

403
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,320
I've been trying to get you
to open up for months.

404
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,246
All this party is doing is bringing back
memories I've been trying to forget.

405
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,004
Thea.

406
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,969
Why would you wanna forget?

407
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,964
No matter how fancy
the party is you throw...

408
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,480
...things will never be the way
they used to be in our family, ever again.

409
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,243
Oliver?

410
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,007
What is it now?

411
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,242
That other archer moved to the next level.
He's taken hostages.

412
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,890
This just hit the news.

413
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,362
"Happy holidays, Starling City.

414
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,370
For the past three months,
this city has been laid siege by a vigilante.

415
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,330
But the police have been unable
to bring him to justice...

416
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,643
...because they lack the will
to do what justice demands.

417
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,526
I will kill one hostage every hour
in the name of this vigilante...

418
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,923
...until he surrenders himself
to my authority."

419
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,288
Police are on the scene.
Let them handle this.

420
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,761
Those people are there because of me.
I have to end this.

421
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,481
Oliver, this guy...
This guy, he's very dangerous.

422
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,361
There wasn't anything on the island
that wasn't twice as dangerous as this...

423
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,126
...and I survived there for five years.

424
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,162
Call your people.
Tell them to bring the plane.

425
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,725
There's no need, Yao Fei.
My people will be here shortly.

426
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,364
Do you not think it convenient
you captured me so easily?

427
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,606
- Go.
- What?

428
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,285
Run!

429
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,449
Starling City holds its breath
as the hostage crisis unfolds.

430
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,570
Police have attempted
to enter the structure in the Glades...

431
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,530
...but found explosives
preventing them from doing so.

432
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,651
At the moment,
there has been no sign of the vigilante...

433
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,888
...as his one-hour deadline nears.

434
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:25,130
I count three thresholds, each
wired via mercury switches to Semtex charges.

435
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,886
Can you defuse one for HRT
to use as a breach point?

436
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,646
That's gonna take a while. He's gonna
know which way we're coming.

437
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,167
You got a better idea?
Now would be a lovely time.

438
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,129
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

439
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,284
It's gonna be okay. Follow me.

440
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,728
Get up on the roof.

441
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,485
- What about--?
- I'll handle him. Move.

442
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,322
Hostages.
You got five hostages on the roof.

443
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,801
Repeat, five hostages on the roof.

444
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,721
Thank you for coming.

445
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,530
After the warehouse, I knew I'd have to do
something dramatic to get your attention.

446
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,082
- What do you want with me?
- What any archer wants...

447
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,651
...to see who's better.

448
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,963
First Hunt, then Ravich, and now you.

449
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,527
I know about the list.
The man who authored it wants you dead.

450
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,722
They call you the Hood,
let's see what you look like without it.

451
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,970
Dig...

452
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,925
...help. Help.

453
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,766
- Hey, relax.
- Ugh.

454
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,129
Relax, relax, relax, you're safe.
You're in the hospital.

455
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,047
What happened?

456
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,010
I back-traced your signal,
cleaned you up and got you out.

457
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,845
You have a pneumothorax,
broken ribs and a concussion...

458
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,971
...but the doctors say you're gonna be fine.
Some people are here to see you.

459
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,966
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God, you look terrible.

460
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,449
Thank God
you were wearing your helmet.

461
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,002
I told them how you were on a bike
and the semi pulled in front of you.

462
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,409
- What were you even doing out?
- You bailed on your party.

463
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,287
It seemed like the right move.

464
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,683
I mean, like you said,
it wasn't the best timing.

465
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,608
Okay, but when I was saying that,
that was me being a bitch.

466
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,401
No. The truth is,
I don't think any of us were at our best.

467
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,248
The real truth is, you wanted to have a party
to bring us closer together.

468
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,480
Well, here we are.

469
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,521
We're gonna let you get some rest.

470
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,769
So we never got
to the exchanging-presents part.

471
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,289
I don't think I deserve a present.

472
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,124
Look, I know that I've been hard on you...

473
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,682
...about being different
from the way you were.

474
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,205
But the truth is, Ollie...

475
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,769
...I'm not the same person
I was five years ago either.

476
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,287
So maybe we can just accept each other...

477
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,923
...not for who we were...

478
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,369
...but for the people we are now.

479
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,805
Yeah.

480
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,405
Oh.

481
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,081
No cheating.

482
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,124
- You're on.
- Come here.

483
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,966
Thank you, Felicity.

484
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,885
It was good of you to call,
but Oliver's gonna be fine.

485
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,089
- He's already on the mend.
- Good. I'm glad to hear it, sir.

486
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,483
I'm stepping into an elevator,
so I'll probably lose you.

487
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,530
I'll call you straight back. Hi.

488
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,609
- It's done.
- And he won't be harmed.

489
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,525
Nor will he discover your involvement.
You have my word.

490
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,890
- Forgive me if I don't find that comforting.
- You were warned, Moira.

491
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,329
I told you to get Walter under control
and you couldn't. Steps had to be taken.

492
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,802
That's what you said
to justify Robert's murder.

493
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,726
- And you wonder why I don't trust you.
- Quite a bit of judgment coming from...

494
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,247
...a woman who had her son kidnapped
and tortured.

495
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,284
To prove to you
that Oliver didn't know anything.

496
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,687
And what does it matter now?

497
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,047
- What's done is done.
- No, Moira.

498
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,363
It's just beginning.

499
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,367
In six months, the organization's vision
of what this city should be will be complete.

500
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,890
And you won't feel a thing, will you?

501
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,931
Thousands of innocent people will be dead
and you'll feel nothing.

502
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,249
That's not true.

503
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,244
I'll feel a sense of accomplishment.

504
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,371
And you'll have Walter back.

505
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,847
You know, Dig...

506
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,763
...when I confront somebody on the list...

507
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,287
...I tell them that they failed the city.

508
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,446
But tonight, it was me who failed.

509
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,162
Oliver, five hostages are home tonight
with their families enjoying the holidays...

510
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,047
...because of you.

511
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,167
This guy, the other archer...

512
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,484
...he'll get his.

513
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,326
And you'll give it to him.

514
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,570
We might have a bigger problem.

515
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,889
The other archer told me
that somebody compiled the list.

516
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,168
I always assumed it was my father...

517
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,208
...but what if it wasn't?

518
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,566
What do you mean?

519
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,369
I think there's someone else out there.

520
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,809
Someone who's more of a danger
than the archer.

521
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,045
And I am gonna take him down.
