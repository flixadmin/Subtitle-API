1
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,407
Thirteen meters.
You should see it.

2
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,045
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,300
<i>Okay, Mir Two,</i>

4
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,284
<i>we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.</i>

5
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,547
<i>Okay, quiet.
We're rolling.</i>

6
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,398
<i>Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship...</i>

7
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,553
<i>still gets me every time.</i>

8
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,683
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here...

9
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,894
where she landed at
2:30 in the morning

10
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,105
of April 15, 1912

11
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,566
after her long fall...

12
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,943
from the world above.

13
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,446
You are so full of shit, boss.

14
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,769
<i>Dive six.
Here we are again</i>

15
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,813
<i>on the deck of</i> Titanic.

16
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:55,277
Two and a half miles down.
3,821 meters.

17
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,490
The pressure outside is three and
a half tons per square inch.

18
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,867
These windows are nine inches thick,

19
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,329
and if they go, it's <i>sayonara</i>
in two microseconds.

20
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,833
All right, enough of that bullshit.

21
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,431
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters

22
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,058
- like yesterday.
- Sure.

23
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,477
<i>Okay, Mir Two,</i>

24
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,562
<i>we're landing right over
the Grand Staircase.</i>

25

<i>You guys set to launch?</i>

26
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,817
Yeah, Brock.
Launching Dunkin now.

27
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:35,901
Go, Charlie.

28
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,118
- Running tether out.
- Tether out.

29
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,203
Tether out.

30
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,537
<i>Okay, Brock,</i>

31
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,540
<i>we're dropping down along the hull.</i>

32
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,169
Yeah, roger that.
Okay, drop down and go

33
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,005
into the first-class gangway door.

34
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,173
I want you guys working the D deck,

35
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,718
<i>reception area and the dining saloon.</i>

36
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,511
<i>Copy that.</i>

00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,893

<i>Now left.
Now left. Left. Left.</i>

39
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,770
Okay.
Coming left. Coming left.

40
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,656
<i>Snoop Dog is on the move.</i>

41
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,742
<i>We're headed down the stairwell.</i>

42
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,413
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.

43
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,872
Okay, A deck?

44
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,915
Give me some rope, Captain.

45
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,999
B deck. Get in there.
Get in there.

46
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,084
Okay.

47
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,708
Watch the door frame.
Watch the door frame.

48
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,192
- Watch it, watch it.
- Yeah, I see it. I got it.

49
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:22,924
- We're good.
- Bring her down.

50
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,458
We're good. Just chill, boss.

51
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,484
Okay.
Okay, make your turn.

52
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,110
- Come around.
- Cable out, Captain.

53
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,445
Make your turn.
Watch the wall.

54
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,948
Yeah, Brock,
we're at the piano. You copy?

55
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,992
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

56
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,876
Okay, right there.
Right there. Right there.

57
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,503
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

58
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,088
I see it. I see it.

59
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:11,223
We're in!

60
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,808
We're in, baby. We're there.

61
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,645
That's Hockley's bed.

62
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,315
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

63
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,531
Oops.
Somebody left the water running.

64
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,782
Wait, hold it. Hold it. Just a second.

65
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,242
Go back to the right.

66
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,167
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

67
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,835
You smelling something, boss?

68
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,546
I want to see what's under it.

69
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,298
Give me my hands, man.

70
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,347
All right.

71
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,890
Take it easy.

72
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,424
- It might come apart.
- Okay.

73
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,480
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

74
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,398
Turn her over.
Keep going.

75
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,983
Go, go, go.

76
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,276
Okay, drop it.

77
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,622
Oh, baby, baby.
Are you seeing this, boss?

78
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,001
It's payday, boys.

79
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,977
Cha-ching!

80
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,938
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back, baby.

81
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,025
Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
Who's the best, baby?

82
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,361
Say it. Say it. Say it.

83
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,571
You are, Lewis.

84
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,707
- Bobby, my cigar.
- It's right here.

85
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,918
Okay, crack her open.

86
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,048
Get around. Hang on.
You getting it?

87
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,133
Got it.

88
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,991
Shit.

89
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,494
No diamond.

90
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,081
You know, boss, this same
thing happened to Geraldo

91
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,208
and his career never recovered.

92
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,922
<i>Turn the camera off.</i>

93
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,925
Brock, the partners
would like to know how it's going.

94
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,303
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi.

95
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,763
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

96
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,431
But, hey, hey... Don't worry about it.

97
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,558
There's still plenty of places
it could be.

98
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,518
Hell, yes.

99
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,770
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room,

100
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,188
the purser's safe on C deck.

101
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,356
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

102
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,482
A dozen other places.

103
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,943
Guys, look, just got
to trust my instincts.

104
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,611
I know we're close.

105
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,695
We've just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

106
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,117
Hang on a second.

107
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,995
Let me see that.

108
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,029
Ah, we might have something here, guys.

109
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,293
Where's the photograph of the necklace?

110
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,503
We'll call you right back.

111
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,964
Holy...

112
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,684

Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

- And you gotta speak up.
- Yeah, standby.

the "Heart of the Ocean" yet,
Mr. Lovett?

157
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,298
Told you you wanted to take the call.

158

All right, you have my attention, Rose.

159

Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,785
She's a goddamn liar!

162
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,372
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

163
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,123
God only knows what.

164
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,459
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

165
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,211
They're inbound!

166
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,926
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the <i>Titanic</i>

167
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,761
when she was 17, right?

168
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,888
That's right.

169
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,390
If she had lived,
she'd be over 100 by now.

170
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,351
101 next month.

171
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,104
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

172
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,565
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman

173
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,525
all the way back to the 20s,

174
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,486
when she was working as an actress.

175
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
An actress.

176
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,656
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

177
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,199
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

178
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,285
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

179
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,745
They move to Cedar Rapids

180
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,831
and she punches out a couple of kids.

181
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,332
Now Calvert's dead

182
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,334
and, from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

183
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,919
And everybody who knows about the diamond

184
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,128
is supposed to be dead

185
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,214
or on this boat, but she knows.

186
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:07,764
Copy that.

187
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,146
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

188
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,148
Hurry up, give him a hand.

189
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,359
Mrs. Calvert,
I'm Brock Lovett.

190
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,944
Welcome to the <i>Keldysh.</i>

191
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,032
Okay, let's get her inside there.

192
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,533
Hi, Miss Calvert.

193
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,869
- Hi.
- Welcome to the <i>Keldysh.</i>

194
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,871
Thanks.

195
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,331
Hey. Hey!

196
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,381
Yes?

197
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,174
Are your staterooms all right?

198
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,177
Oh, yes. Very nice.

199
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,637
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

200
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,514
She takes care of me.

201
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,475
We met just a few minutes ago.

202
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,643
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

203
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,062
Oh, yes.

204
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,731
There. That's nice.

205
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,525
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

206
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,776
Can I get you anything?

207
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,310
Is there anything you'd like?

208
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,864
Yes.

209
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,076
I would like to see my drawing.

210
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,466
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone that was

211
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,218
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown

212
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,721
which disappeared in 1792...

213
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:34,225
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

214
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,230
The theory goes that the crown diamond
was chopped, too.

215
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,940
Recut into a heart-like shape
that became known as

216
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,943
the Heart of the Ocean.

217
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,737
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

218
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,197
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

219
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,575
I only wore it this once.

220
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,161
You actually think this is you, Nana?

221
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,288
It is me, dear.

222
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,290
Wasn't I a dish?

223
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,003
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

224
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,924
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

225
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,761
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

226
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,680
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

227
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,099
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

228
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,185
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

229
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,985
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son Caledon bought his fiancée.

230
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,357
You.

231
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,402
A week before he sailed on <i>Titanic.</i>

232
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,780
And it was filed right after the sinking.

233
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,701
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

234
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,287
You see the date?

235
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,790
April 14, 1912.

236
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,085
Which means if your grandmother is
who she says she is,

237
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,754
she was wearing the diamond
the day the <i>Titanic</i> sank.

238
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,341
And that makes you my new best friend.

239
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,184
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

240
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,433
This was mine.

241
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,561
How extraordinary.

242
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,149
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

243
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,320
Hmm.

244
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,324
The reflection has changed a bit.

245
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,932
Are you ready to go back to <i>Titanic?</i>

246
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,264
Okay, here we go.

247
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,517
She hits the 'berg on
the starboard side, right?

248
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,451
She kind of bumps along,
punching holes like Morse code...

249
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,314
Along the side, below the water line.

250
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,692
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

251
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,736
Now, as the water level rises,

252
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,737
it spills over the watertight bulkheads

253
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,532
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than E deck.

254
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,367
So now as the bow goes down,

255
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,203
the stern rises up, slow at first,

256
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,997
then faster and faster

257
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,083
until finally, she's got her whole ass
sticking up in the air.

258
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,293
And that's a big ass.

259
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,421
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

260
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,715
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

261
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,133
So, what happens?

262
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,677
She splits, right down to the keel.

263
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,763
And the stern falls back level.

264
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,390
Then as the bow sinks,

265
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,267
it pulls the stern vertical

266
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,978
and then finally detaches.

267
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,855
Now the stern section
just kind of bobs there

268
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,839
like a cork for a couple of minutes...

269
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,152
floods, and finally goes
under about 2:20 a.m.

270
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,571
Two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

271
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,365
The bow section planes away,

272
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,577
landing about a half a mile away

273
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,011
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

274
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,376
Pretty cool, huh?

275
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,923
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

276
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,094
Of course, the experience of it was...

277
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,763
somewhat different.

278
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,349
Will you share it with us?

279
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,652
Oh.

280
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,071
I'm taking her to rest.

281
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,155
No.

282
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,490
Come on, Nana.

283
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,909
No!

284
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,664
Give me the tape recorder.

285
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,794
Tell us, Rose.

286
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,215
It's been 84 years...

287
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,091
It's okay. Just try
to remember anything,

288
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,760
anything at all.

289
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,639
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

290
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,687
It's been 84 years...

291
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,526
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

292
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,155
The china had never been used.

293
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,534
The sheets had never been slept in.

294
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:48,123
<i>Titanic</i> was called the ship of dreams.

295
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,792
And it was.

296
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,753
It really was.

297
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,567
All third-class passengers...

298
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:30,123
with a forward berth,
this way, please! This queue!

299
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,167
It's a big boat, huh?

300
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,293
Daddy, it's a ship.

301
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,503
You're right.

302
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,494
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

303
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,037
It doesn't look any bigger
than the <i>Mauretania.</i>

304
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,123
You can be blasé about some things, Rose,

305
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,958
but not about <i>Titanic.</i>

306
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,876
It's over 100 feet longer
than <i>Mauretania,</i>

307
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,545
and far more luxurious.

308
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,132
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

309
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,093
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

310
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,219
- It is unsinkable.
- Sir, sir.

311
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,720
God Himself could not sink this ship...

312
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,847
- Sir!
- What?

313
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,432
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

314
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,766
It's round that way, sir.

315
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,560
I put my faith in you, good sir.

316
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,770
Now kindly see my man.

317
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,104
Oh, yes sir.
It's my pleasure, sir.

318
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,230
If I can do anything at all...

319
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,690
Yes, right.

320
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,900
All the trunks from that car there.

321
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,028
Twelve from here.

322
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,697
And the safe to the parlor suite,

323
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,950
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

324
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,328
Ladies,

325
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,371
we better hurry.

326
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,498
Come along.

327
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,361
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

328
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,258
All third-class passengers

329
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,636
queue here for health inspection.

330
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,311
Welcome aboard, ma'am.
Welcome to <i>Titanic.</i>

331
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,606
<i>It was the ship of dreams</i>

332
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,066
<i>to everyone else.</i>

333
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,361
<i>To me, it was a slave ship...</i>

334
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:29,700
<i>taking me back to America
in chains. Outwardly, I was everything</i>

335
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,869
<i>a well brought up girl should be.</i>

336
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,789
<i>Inside, I was screaming.</i>

337
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,473
Jack, you are <i>pazzo.</i>

338
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,017
You bet everything we have.

339
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,726
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

340
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,820
Sven?

341
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,239
Bet.

342
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,261
All right, moment of truth.

343
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,764
Someone's life is about to change.

344
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,182
Fabrizio?

345
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,772
Olaf?

346
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:42,940
Nothing.

347
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,442
Sven?

348
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,947
Uh-oh. Two pair.

349
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,200
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

350
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,411
I'm sorry,

351
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,079
you're not gonna see your mom again

352
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,622
for a long time,

353
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,416
'cause we're going to America.

354
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,168
Full house, boys!

355
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,213
Yeah.

356
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,472
Oh!

357
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,975
Come on.

358
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,769
I'm going home!

359
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,232
I'm going home.

360
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,692
I go to America!

361
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,276
No, mate.

362
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,363
<i>Titanic</i> go to America, in 5 minutes.

363
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,698
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

364
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,825
Come on, here. Here.

365
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,037
We're riding in high style now!

366
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,581
We're a couple of regular swells.

367
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,291
We're practically goddamn royalty,

368
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,209
<i>ragazzo mio.</i>

369
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,670
You see?
Is my <i>destino.</i>

370
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,087
Like I told you,

371
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,964
I go to America to be millionaire.

372
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,299
Whoa! Whoa!

373
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,134
<i>- Bastardo.</i>
- Whoo!

374
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,428
You are <i>pazzo.</i>

375
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,263
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

376
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,933
Come on, I thought you were fast.

377
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,685
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

378
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,187
Hey, wait!

379
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,971
We're passengers!
We're passengers!

380
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,776
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

381
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,902
Of course.

382
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,153
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

383
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,113
We're Americans.
Both of us.

384
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,198
Right.

385
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,324
Come aboard.

386
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,163
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

387
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,457
You know that?

388
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,467
Good-bye!

389
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,596
You know somebody?

390
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,306
Of course not.
That's not the point.

391
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,725
Good-bye!
I'll miss you!

392
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,185
Good-bye!

393
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,353
I will never forget you!

394
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,570
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

395
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,449
G-60.

396
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,118
G-60. G-60.

397
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,537
Excuse me, ma'am.

398
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,789
G-60.

399
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,792
Oh, right here.

400
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,377
Hey, how you doing?

401
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,504
Jack. Nice
to meet you.

402
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,297
Jack Dawson.
Nice to meet you.

403
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,757
How you doing?

404
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,051
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

405
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,976
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

406
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,519
Would you be requiring anything?

407
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,646
- Mmm.
- Excuse me.

408
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,566
- This one?
- No.

409
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,693
It had a lot of faces on it.

410
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,987
This is the one.

411
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,531
Would you like all of them out, miss?

412
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,535
Yes. We need a little
color in this room.

413
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,272
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

414
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,210
God, not those finger paintings again.

415
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,086
They certainly were a waste of money.

416
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,963
The difference between Cal's taste in art

417
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,673
and mine is that I have some.

418
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,842
They're fascinating.

419
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,220
Like being inside a dream or something.

420
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,847
There's truth but no logic.

421
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,933
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

422
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,392
Something Picasso.

423
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,228
He won't amount to a thing.

424
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,521
He won't, trust me.

425
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,855
Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.

426
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,189
At least they were cheap.

427
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,443
Put it in the wardrobe.

428
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,738
Passengers to the upper deck,

429
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:00,906
we're boarding please.

430
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,492
<i>At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard</i>

431
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,536
<i>named Margaret Brown.</i>

432
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,455
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

433
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:11,124
<i>History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.</i>

434
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,544
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

435
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,128
Here, you think you can manage?

436
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,213
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,798
<i>Her husband had struck gold</i>

438
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,175
<i>someplace out west.</i>

439
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,345
<i>And she was what Mother
called "new money."</i>

440
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,013
<i>By the next afternoon,</i>

441
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,725
<i>we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland...</i>

442
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,188
<i>with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.</i>

443
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,571
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

444
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,698
Let's stretch her legs.

445
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,492
Yes, sir.

446
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,870
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

447
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,121
Very good, sir.

448
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,711
All ahead full.

449
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:57,963
All ahead full!

450
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,007
Come on, lads.
Step lively!

451
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,528
All right! Let's stoke
her right up!

452
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,071
We go full ahead!

453
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,948
Come on, put your backs into it!

454
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,581
Mummy!

455
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,713
21 knots, sir.

456
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,030
Hey, look, look, look!

457
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,519
See it?

458
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,900
There's another one! See him?

459
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,943
Look at that one!
Look at him jump!

460
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,395
Whoo!

461
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,899
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

462
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,651
Very small, of course.

463
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:30,074
I'm the king of the world!

464
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,206
Yee-hah!

465
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,621
<i>She is the largest moving object</i>

466
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,206
<i>ever made by the hand of man</i>

467
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,833
in all history.

468
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,835
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here

469
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,796
designed her from the keel plates up.

470
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,964
I may have knocked her together,

471
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,550
but the idea was
Mr. Ismay's.

472
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,095
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale

473
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,347
and so luxurious in its appointments

474
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,631
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

475
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,142
And here she is.

476
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:42,771
- Willed into solid reality.
- Hear, hear.

477
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,566
I'll have the salmon.

478
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,988
You know I don't like that, Rose.

479
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,826
She knows.

480
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,830
Hm. We'll both have
the lamb.

481
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,374
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

482
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,002
Hm. You like lamb,
right, sweet pea?

483
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:10,005
You gonna cut her meat for her
too there, Cal?

484
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,346
Hey, who thought of the name <i>Titanic?</i>

485
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,055
Was it you, Bruce?

486
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,682
Yes, actually.

487
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,645
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability,

488
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,191
luxury, and above all, strength.

489
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,527
Do you know of
Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

490
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,071
His ideas about the male
preoccupation with size

491
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,105
might be of particular interest to you.

492
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,784
What's gotten into you?

493
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,453
Excuse me.

494
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,292
I do apologize.

495
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,628
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

496
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,005
Well, I may have to start minding

497
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,215
what she reads from
now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

498
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,010
Freud? Who is he?
Is he a passenger?

499
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,554
It's a great big shaft,

500
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,431
goes right through
the middle of the boat.

501
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,765
It's known as a propeller.

502
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,549
And it goes right along there
and it makes these waves.

503
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,895
Makes them spin.

504
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,941
The ship is nice, huh?

505
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,693
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

506
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,778
- Is English, no?
- No, it was built in Ireland.

507
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,072
Fifteen thousand Irish men
built this ship.

508
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,284
Solid as a rock.
Big Irish hands.

509
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,160
That's typical.

510
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:23,372
First-class dogs come down
here to take a shite.

511
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,249
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

512
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,876
Like we could forget?

513
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,004
I'm Tommy Ryan.

514
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,380
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

515
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,258
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

516
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,351
Do you make any money with your drawings?

517
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,481
Ah, forget it, boyo.

518
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,025
You'd as like have
angels fly out of your arse

519
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,819
as get next to the likes of her.

520
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,752
Do you mind?

521
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,518
I hope you're proud of yourself.

522
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:21,180
<i>I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.</i>

523
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:24,850
<i>An endless parade
of parties and cotillions...</i>

524
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,311
<i>yachts and polo matches.</i>

525
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,358
<i>Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.</i>

526
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,987
<i>I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice...</i>

527
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:41,700
<i>with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared...</i>

528
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,536
<i>or even noticed.</i>

529
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,125
Really, miss.

530
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,522
Don't do it.

531
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,108
Stay back.

532
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,611
Don't come any closer.

533
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:42,695
Come on.

534
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,489
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

535
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,325
No! Stay where you are.

536
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,118
I mean it.

537
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,454
I'll let go.

538
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,966
No, you won't.

539
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,303
What do you mean, no I won't?

540
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,347
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

541
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,682
You don't know me.

542
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,934
Well, you would have done it already.

543
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,646
You're distracting me.
Go away.

544
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,230
I can't.

545
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,690
I'm involved now.

546
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:20,733
You let go,

547
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,217
and I'm going to have to
jump in there after you.

548
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,364
Don't be absurd.

549
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,867
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

550
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,827
The fall alone will kill you.

551
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:34,331
It would hurt.
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

552
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,082
Tell you the truth,

553
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,419
I'm a lot more concerned about
that water being so cold.

554
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,635
How cold?

555
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,181
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

556
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:56,936
You ever, uh,

557
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,772
ever been to Wisconsin?

558
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,234
What?

559
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,778
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

560
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:09,032
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

561
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,992
I remember when I was a kid,

562
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,077
me and my father, we went ice fishing

563
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,121
out on Lake Wissota.

564
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,165
Ice fishing is, you know, where you...

565
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,792
I know what ice fishing is!

566
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,211
Sorry.

567
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:26,049
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

568
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,386
Anyway, I...

569
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,389
I fell through some thin ice.

570
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,224
And I'm telling you...

571
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,227
water that cold,

572
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,229
like right down there...

573
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:41,898
it hits you like 1,000 knives

574
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,582
stabbing you all over your body.

575
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,194
You can't breathe.

576
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,572
You can't think.

577
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,992
Least not about anything but the pain.

578
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,162
Which is why I'm not looking forward

579
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,998
to jumping in there after you.

580
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,167
Like I said...

581
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,587
I don't have a choice.

582
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,008
I guess I'm kind of hoping

583
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,593
you'll come back over the rail

584
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,127
and get me off the hook here.

585
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,264
You're crazy.

586
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,768
That's what everybody says...

587
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,937
but with all due respect, miss,

588
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,107
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

589
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,942
Come on.

590
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,278
Come on, give me your hand.

591
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,537
You don't want to do this.

592
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,420
Phew.

593
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,382
I'm Jack Dawson.

594
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,134
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

595
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,576
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

596
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,973
Come on.

597
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,938
I got you.

598
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,939
Come on.

599
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,316
Come on.

600
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,113
Help, please!

601
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,990
Help!

602
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,493
Please, help me!

603
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,244
Listen. Listen to me.

604
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,038
I've got you.
I won't let go.

605
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,416
Now pull yourself up.
Come on!

606
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,044
Come on.

607
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:27,629
That's right.

608
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,256
You can do it.

609
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,512
I got you.

610
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,686
What's all this?

611
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,942
You stand back

612
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,176
and don't move an inch!

613
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,073
Fetch the Master at Arms.

614
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,366
Care for a brandy?

615
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,118
This is completely unacceptable!

616
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,536
What made you think

617
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,770
that you could put your hands
on my fiancée?

618
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,958
- Look at me, you filth!
- Cal.

619
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,585
What do you think you were doing?

620
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,588
Cal, stop.
It was an accident.

621
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,632
An accident?

622
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,217
It was.

623
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,470
Stupid, really.

624
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,765
I was leaning over and I slipped.

625
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,436
I was leaning far over to see the, uh,

626
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,565
uh, uh, the uh...

627
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,734
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

628
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,111
And I would have gone overboard

629
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:35,988
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

630
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,074
And almost went over himself.

631
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,159
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

632
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,622
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

633
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:45,999
Was that the way of it?

634
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:51,003
Yeah. Yeah, that
was pretty much it.

635
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,797
Well, the boy's a hero then.

636
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,841
Good for you, son.
Well done.

637
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:58,011
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

638
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,264
Look at you.
You must be freezing.

639
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:02,474
Let's get you inside.

640
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,019
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

641
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,564
Of course.

642
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:12,692
Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

643
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,696
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

644
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,116
Rose is displeased.

645
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,326
What to do?

646
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,662
I know.

647
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:29,876
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening

648
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,502
to regale our group

649
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,839
with your heroic tale.

650
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,551
Sure. Count me in.

651
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,137
Good. It's settled then.

652
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,473
This should be interesting.

653
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,485
Can I bum a smoke?

654
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,577
You'll want to tie those.

655
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,749
It's interesting...

656
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,459
The young lady slipped so suddenly

657
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,711
and you still had time
to remove your jacket

658
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,171
and your shoes.

659
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,356
I know you've been melancholy.

660
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,359
I don't pretend to know why.

661
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,572
I intended to save this

662
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:46,369
until the engagement gala next week...

663
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,289
but, I thought

664
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,708
tonight.

665
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,377
Good gracious.

666
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:58,048
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

667
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,175
- Is it a...
- Diamond. Yes.

668
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,555
56 carats to be exact.

669
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,226
It was worn by Louis XVI.

670
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,396
And they called it,
<i>"Le Coeur de la Mer."</i>

671
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,189
- "The Heart of the Ocean."
- "The Heart of the Ocean."

672
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,274
Yes.

673
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,907
It's overwhelming.

674
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,034
Well, it's for royalty.

675
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,412
We are royalty, Rose.

676
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,752
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't give you.

677
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,588
There's nothing I'd deny you...

678
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,424
if you would not deny me.

679
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,973
Open your heart to me, Rose.

680
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,655
Well, I've been on my own

681
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,325
since I was 15, since my folks died.

682
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,245
And I had no brothers
or sisters or close kin

683
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,729
in that part of the country,

684
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,833
so I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

685
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:18,667
You could just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

686
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:25,509
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck

687
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,470
and chewed over
how great the weather's been

688
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,513
and how I grew up,

689
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,475
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

690
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,479
- Mr. Dawson, I...
- Jack.

691
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,523
Jack.

692
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,568
I want to thank you for what you did.

693
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:47,323
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

694
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,158
You're welcome.

695
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,493
Look.

696
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:54,247
I know what you must be thinking.

697
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,124
Poor little rich girl.

698
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,418
What does she know about misery?

699
00:47:58,668 --> 00:47:59,669
No.

700
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,839
No, that's not what I was thinking.

701
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:04,424
What I was thinking was

702
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:08,291
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

703
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,931
Well I...

704
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,852
It was everything.
It was my whole world...

705
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:17,937
and all the people in it.

706
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:21,608
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead, and me,

707
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,651
powerless to stop it.

708
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,028
God, look at that thing.

709
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,323
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

710
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,535
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

711
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,538
All of Philadelphia society
will be there.

712
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,832
And all the while, I feel I'm...

713
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,126
standing in the middle of a crowded room

714
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,878
screaming at the top of my lungs

715
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,379
and no one even looks up.

716
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,049
Do you love him?

717
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,384
Pardon me?

718
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,178
Do you love him?

719
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,430
You're being very rude.

720
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,806
You shouldn't be asking me this.

721
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,768
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

722
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,272
This is not a suitable conversation.

723
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:03,306
Why can't you just answer the question?

724
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,362
This is absurd.

725
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,196
You don't know me and I don't know you,

726
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,657
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

727
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,160
You are rude and uncouth and presumptuous

728
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,120
and I am leaving now,

729
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:19,082
Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

730
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:21,417
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

731
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,211
And you've insulted me.

732
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,046
Well, you deserved it.

733
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,422
- Right.
- Right.

734
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,052
I thought you were leaving.

735
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:32,595
I am.

736
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,182
You are so annoying.

737
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,977
Wait.
I don't have to leave.

738
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:43,106
This is my part of the ship.
You leave.

739
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,442
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

740
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,116
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

741
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,619
So, what are you, an artist or something?

742
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,330
Well...

743
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,625
These are rather good.

744
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:09,215
They're very good, actually.

745
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,141
Jack, this is exquisite work.

746
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,144
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paris.

747
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,645
Paris?

748
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,025
You do get around for a p...

749
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,487
Well, a person of limited means.

750
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,032
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

751
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,579
Well, well, well.

752
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,335
And these were drawn from life?

753
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:51,006
Well, that's one of the
good things about Paris.

754
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,640
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

755
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:00,808
You liked this woman.

756
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,686
You used her several times.

757
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:05,855
Well.

758
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:08,524
She had beautiful hands, you see?

759
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:13,237
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

760
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,865
No, no, no. Just with her hands.

761
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,910
She was a one-legged prostitute.

762
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:20,995
See?

763
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:24,540
Oh.

764
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,587
She had a good sense of humor, though.

765
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:33,132
Oh, and this lady...

766
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:37,386
She used to sit at this bar every night

767
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,722
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

768
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:42,350
just waiting for her long, lost love.

769
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,811
We called her Madame Bijoux.

770
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,845
See how her clothes are all moth eaten?

771
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:52,235
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

772
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,903
You do.

773
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,863
You see people.

774
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,573
I see you.

775
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:01,619
And?

776
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,497
You wouldn't have jumped.

777
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:12,380
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

778
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,257
Rose has already done that.

779
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,427
Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

780
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,430
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

781
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:24,058
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

782
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,017
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

783
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,811
The Countess and I
were just off to take the air

784
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,355
on the boat deck.

785
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:30,606
What a lovely idea.

786
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,734
I need to catch up on my gossip.

787
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:37,280
Countess.

788
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,617
So, you've not yet lit
the last four boilers?

789
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:43,911
No, I don't see the need.

790
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,621
We are making excellent time.

791
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,124
The press knows the size of <i>Titanic.</i>

792
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,294
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

793
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,796
We must give them something new to print.

794
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,886
This maiden voyage of <i>Titanic</i>
must make headlines.

795
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:04,265
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

796
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,976
until they've been properly run in.

797
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,561
Of course I'm just a passenger.

798
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,295
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

799
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,318
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing

800
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:17,027
if we were to get
into New York on Tuesday night

801
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,989
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

802
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,658
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

803
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,663
Good man.

804
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:29,498
Well, after that,

805
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,532
I worked on a squid boat in Monterey...

806
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,711
then I went down to Los Angeles

807
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,004
to the pier in Santa Monica

808
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,213
and started doing portraits there

809
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,507
for 10 cents apiece.

810
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,842
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

811
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,013
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

812
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,832
Say we'll go there sometime,
to that pier...

813
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,687
even if we only ever just talk about it.

814
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,439
No, we'll do it.

815
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:54,816
We'll drink cheap beer.

816
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,808
We'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

817
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,019
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

818
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,490
Now, but you'll have to do it
like a real cowboy.

819
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,074
None of that sidesaddle stuff.

820
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:08,204
You mean one leg on each side?

821
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,372
Yeah.

822
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,248
Can you show me?

823
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:13,334
Sure, if you like.

824
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:16,587
Teach me to ride like a man.

825
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:18,172
And chew tobacco like a man.

826
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,051
And spit like a man.

827
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:23,927
What, they didn't teach you
that in finishing school?

828
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,471
No.

829
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:27,557
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

830
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:29,725
- What?
- I'll show you how. Come on.

831
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:32,770
- Jack, no! Jack, no!
- Oh, come on! Come on.

832
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,004
- Wait, Jack!
- Come on.

833
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:34,980
- No, Jack...
- Come on!

834
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,440
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

835
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:37,525
Watch closely.

836
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,529
That's disgusting!

837
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,787
All right, your turn.

838
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,242
That was pitiful.

839
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:48,285
Come on, you really gotta hawk
it back, you know.

840
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,995
Get some leverage to it.
Use your arms.

841
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,080
Arc your neck.

842
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:53,916
Now, you see the range on that thing?

843
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,959
Mm-hmm.

844
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,711
Okay, go.

845
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:01,423
Oh, that was better.

846
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,633
- You gotta work on it.
- Really?

847
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:03,717
Really try to hawk it up

848
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,101
and get some body to it,
you know? You gotta...

849
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,395
Mother.

850
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,611
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

851
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,655
Charmed, I'm sure.

852
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,454
<i>The others were gracious and curious</i>

853
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,665
<i>about the man who'd saved my life.</i>

854
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,836
<i>But my mother looked at him
like an insect.</i>

855
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,213
<i>A dangerous insect</i>

856
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,465
<i>which must be squashed quickly.</i>

857
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:47,199
Well, Jack, sounds like you're a good
man to have around in a sticky spot.

858
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,766
Why do they always insist
on announcing dinner

859
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,200
like a damn cavalry charge?

860
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,820
Shall we go dress, Mother?

861
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,472
See you at dinner, Jack.

862
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:02,944
Uh, son?

863
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,028
Son!

864
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,488
Do you have the slightest comprehension

865
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,532
what you're doing?

866
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:09,491
Not really.

867
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,827
Well, you're about to go
into the snake pit.

868
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,374
What are you planning to wear?

869
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,003
I figured. Come on.

870
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:25,550
I was right.

871
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,719
You and my son
are just about the same size.

872
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,012
Pretty close.

873
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,018
You shine up like a new penny.

874
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:49,574
Good evening, sir.

875
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,216
Hello.

876
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,514
Do you know that there
are several thousand tons

877
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:57,348
of Hockley steel in this very ship?

878
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:58,475
Which part?

879
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,059
All the right ones, of course.

880
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,103
Then we'll know who to hold accountable

881
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,854
if there's a problem.
Where's my daughter?

882
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,398
Oh, she'll be along.

883
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,233
There is the Countess.

884
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,068
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

885
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,528
It's so good to see you.

886
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:37,472
I saw that in a nickelodeon once

887
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,183
and I always wanted to do it.

888
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:52,887
I'll see you at dinner.

889
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:56,992
Darling, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

890
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,077
Dawson.

891
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:01,997
Well, that's amazing.

892
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,981
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

893
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,335
Almost.

894
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:07,586
That's extraordinary.

895
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:21,475
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

896
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,517
Cosmo.

897
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,810
What a remarkable voyage this is.

898
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:24,895
It's mad, isn't it?

899
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,063
How lovely.

900
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,490
There's the Countess of Rothes.

901
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,613
And that's John Jacob Astor...

902
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,241
the richest man on the ship.

903
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:41,008
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

904
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:43,888
See how she's trying to hide it.

905
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,631
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm.

906
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,251
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim

907
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,935
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

908
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,879
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

909
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,883
And over here we have Sir Cosmo

910
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:56,552
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

911
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,139
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

912
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,933
Very popular with the royals.

913
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,769
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

914
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,688
Why, thank you.

915
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,856
Care to escort a lady to dinner?

916
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,692
Certainly.

917
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,278
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

918
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:17,663
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?

919
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,199
Remember, they love money

920
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,826
so just pretend like you own a gold mine,

921
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,060
and you're in the club.

922
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:25,748
Hey, Astor.

923
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,209
Well, hello, Molly.

924
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,002
Nice to see you.

925
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:32,619
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you
to meet Jack Dawson.

926
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,105
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

927
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:35,674
Hello, Jack.

928
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,800
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

929
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,388
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

930
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:42,473
Oh, yes.

931
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,437
<i>He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.</i>

932
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,732
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

933
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,069
<i>Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.</i>

934
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:57,446
<i>New money, obviously,</i>

935
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,365
<i>but still a member of the club.</i>

936
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:04,078
<i>Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.</i>

937
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,832
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

938
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,948
I hear they're quite good on this ship.

939
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,255
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

940
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:19,633
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

941
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,846
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

942
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,641
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

943
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,658
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

944
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,944
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

945
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,108
Not to impugn your work, sir.

946
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,991
She may be mine
on paper, in the eyes of God,

947
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,576
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

948
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,870
Are these all for me?

949
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,330
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

950
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:50,248
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

951
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,166
- Indeed.
- Your ship

952
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,084
is a wonder, Mr. Andrews, truly.

953
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,628
Thank you, Rose.

954
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,299
How do you take your caviar, sir?

955
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,887
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

956
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,349
And where exactly
do you live, Mr. Dawson?

957
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:10,769
Well, right now,
my address is the RMS <i>Titanic.</i>

958
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:13,063
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

959
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,681
And how is it you have means to travel?

960
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,402
I work my way from place to place.

961
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:20,946
You know, tramp steamers and such.

962
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,113
But I won my ticket on <i>Titanic</i> here
at a lucky hand at poker.

963
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,327
A very lucky hand.

964
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,204
All life is a game of luck.

965
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:33,333
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

966
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,793
Mmm.

967
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,962
And you find that sort of
rootless existence

968
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,339
appealing, do you?

969
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:43,510
Well, yes, ma'am, I do.

970
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:47,348
I mean, I've got everything
I need right here with me.

971
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,598
Got air in my lungs

972
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,309
and a few blank sheets of paper.

973
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,103
I mean, I love waking up in the morning,

974
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,887
not knowing what's gonna happen...

975
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,330
or who I'm gonna meet.

976
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,484
Where I'm gonna wind up.

977
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:00,068
Just the other night

978
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:01,486
I was sleeping under a bridge, and now

979
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,655
here I am on the grandest ship
in the world,

980
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:05,639
having champagne with you fine people.

981
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,100
I'll take some of that.

982
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:09,411
I figure life's a gift,

983
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,145
and I don't intend on wasting it.

984
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:15,265
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

985
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:16,918
You learn to take life
as it comes at you.

986
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,128
Oh, here you go, Cal.

987
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,383
To make each day count.

988
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,175
Well said, Jack.

989
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,552
Hear, hear.

990
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,097
To making it count.

991
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:30,641
To making it count.

992
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:32,810
Bravo.

993
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,484
But Mr. Brown
had no idea

994
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,268
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

995
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,032
So, he comes home
drunk as a pig celebrating

996
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:48,325
and he lights a fire.

997
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,704
Bravo.

998
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,888
Next it'll be brandies
in the smoking room.

999
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,877
Well, join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

1000
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,587
- What a good idea!
- Yes.

1001
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,505
Now they'll retreat into a cloud of smoke

1002
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:03,632
and congratulate each other

1003
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,258
on being masters of the universe.

1004
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,343
Ladies, thank you

1005
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:08,077
for the pleasure of your company.

1006
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,263
Rose, may I escort you back to the cabin?

1007
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,390
No, I'll stay here.

1008
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,142
Here you go, Molly.

1009
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,894
Joining us, Dawson?

1010
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:17,854
Well, you don't want to stay out here

1011
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,088
with the women, do you?

1012
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:20,982
No, thanks.
I've gotta be heading back.

1013
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:21,900
Ah.

1014
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,360
Probably best.

1015
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:24,569
It'll be all business and politics,

1016
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:25,737
that sort of thing.

1017
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:26,921
Wouldn't interest you.

1018
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:30,576
But, Dawson, good of you to come.

1019
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:37,499
Jack, must you go?

1020
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:40,085
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

1021
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:44,465
Good night, Rose.

1022
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,905
So, you wanna go to a real party?

1023
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,354
Is okay if put
my hand here? Okay.

1024
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:56,912
What?

1025
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,083
I can't understand you.

1026
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:29,778
Bravo!

1027
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,073
Let's go!

1028
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,074
I'm gonna dance with her now, all right?

1029
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:37,578
Come on.

1030
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,163
- What?
- Come on.

1031
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,291
- Come with me.
- What? Jack. Jack, wait.

1032
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:45,627
I can't do this.

1033
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:47,796
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer.

1034
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,881
Like this.

1035
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,234
You're still my best girl, Cora.

1036
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,681
I don't know the steps.

1037
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,265
Neither do I. Just go with it.

1038
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,019
Don't think.

1039
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,665
Wait! Jack, Jack! Wait!
Stop, Jack!

1040
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,214
Bom, bom, bom.

1041
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,885
Jack, what? Wait!

1042
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,124
Whoo-hoo!

1043
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:15,341
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1044
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,760
Yeah!

1045
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:18,637
Jack, no!

1046
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,098
Wow!

1047
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,284
Beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

1048
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,170
That's how my lawyers will argue.

1049
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:29,480
That's what Rockefeller said,

1050
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,664
but the Supreme Court
is not swallowing it.

1051
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:53,130
What?

1052
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,382
You think a first-class girl can't drink?

1053
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,092
Oh!

1054
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,226
Hey, get out of here.

1055
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,346
You all right?

1056
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,391
I'm fine.

1057
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,892
Two out of three.
Two out of three.

1058
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,435
Yeah, you the man.
You the man-beast!

1059
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:08,729
So...

1060
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,580
you think you're big, tough men?

1061
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:14,651
Let's see you do this.

1062
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:18,989
Hold this for me, Jack.
Hold it up.

1063
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:35,380
- Ow!
- Whoa!

1064
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,441
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
- You all right?

1065
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,636
I haven't done that in years.

1066
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:50,979
Go see Maggie, lads.
Give her the holley!

1067
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:52,189
Let's go.

1068
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:56,777
Oh, here. Come on.

1069
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:19,383
Coffee, sir?

1070
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,126
I had hoped you would come
to me last night.

1071
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,856
I was tired.

1072
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:40,493
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.

1073
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,491
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant

1074
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:46,725
follow me, how typical.

1075
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:49,203
You will never behave
like that again, Rose.

1076
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,288
Do you understand?

1077
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,251
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills

1078
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:56,420
that you can command.

1079
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,090
I'm your fiancée.

1080
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,302
My fiancée.
My fiancée!

1081
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,138
Yes, you are! And my wife!

1082
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,766
My wife in practice, if not yet by law,

1083
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,060
so you will honor me!

1084
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:13,227
You will honor me the way a wife

1085
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,861
is required to honor a husband.

1086
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,524
Because I will not be made out
a fool, Rose.

1087
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,750
Is this in any way unclear?

1088
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,278
No.

1089
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:23,530
Good.

1090
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,240
Excuse me.

1091
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,746
Oh, Miss Rose.

1092
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:34,749
We had a little accident.

1093
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,042
It's all right, Miss Rose.
It's all right.

1094
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,128
- I'm sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

1095
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:39,337
Let me help you.

1096
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:40,714
It's all right, Miss.

1097
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,222
It's all right, Miss.

1098
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:55,437
Tea, Trudy.

1099
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:57,772
Yes, ma'am.

1100
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,123
You're not to see that boy again.

1101
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:16,257
Do you understand me?

1102
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,504
Rose, I forbid it.

1103
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:22,839
Oh, stop it, Mother.

1104
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:24,674
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

1105
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,051
This is not a game.

1106
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,680
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

1107
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,224
Of course, I know it's gone.

1108
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,851
You remind me every day.

1109
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,146
Your father left us nothing

1110
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:41,316
but a legacy of bad debts
hidden by a good name.

1111
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:44,194
That name is the only card
we have to play.

1112
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:46,071
I don't understand you.

1113
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:48,781
It is a fine match with Hockley.

1114
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,575
It will ensure our survival.

1115
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,162
How can you put this on my shoulders?

1116
01:12:54,246 --> 01:12:55,955
Why are you being so selfish?

1117
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,624
I'm being selfish?

1118
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,170
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

1119
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:07,759
Is that what you want?

1120
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:13,306
To see our fine things sold at auction?

1121
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,477
Our memories scattered to the winds?

1122
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:29,698
It's so unfair.

1123
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,867
Of course it's unfair.

1124
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:35,829
We're women.

1125
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,250
Our choices are never easy.

1126
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:48,717
Mmm?

1127
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:01,896
<i>Wherever, Lord our brethren go</i>

1128
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:06,484
<i>Protect them by Thy guiding hand</i>

1129
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:12,699
<i>From every peril on the land</i>

1130
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:17,954
<i>Oh, spirit whom the Father sent</i>

1131
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:22,417
<i>To spread abroad the firmament</i>

1132
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:27,088
<i>Oh, wind of heaven, by Thy might</i>

1133
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:32,260
<i>Save all who dare the eagle's flight</i>

1134
01:14:32,427 --> 01:14:36,473
<i>And keep them by Thy watchful</i>

1135
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,186
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

1136
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:49,027
<i>Oh Trinity of love and power</i>

1137
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,279
Sir. Sir.

1138
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:52,446
I just need to talk
to somebody for a sec.

1139
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,364
You're not supposed to be in here.

1140
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:54,948
Just need to speak to someone.

1141
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,994
<i>Fire, and foe</i>

1142
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,495
<i>Protect them</i>

1143
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,038
I was just here last night.
You don't remember me?

1144
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:02,206
No, I'm afraid I don't.

1145
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,291
Now you're gonna have to turn around.

1146
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,459
He'll tell you.

1147
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:06,502
I just need to talk to...

1148
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,422
Mr. Hockley
and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

1149
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,390
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

1150
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:16,721
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude.

1151
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:18,472
I don't want your money,
please, I just...

1152
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,057
And also to remind you

1153
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,976
that you hold a third-class ticket

1154
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,604
and that your presence here is
no longer appropriate.

1155
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:27,273
Please, I just wanna speak to Rose
for one second, all right? Please!

1156
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:30,610
Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs

1157
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:31,894
and that he stays there?

1158
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:35,407
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

1159
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:40,912
<i>Oh hear us when we cry to Thee</i>

1160
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:46,709
<i>For those in peril on the sea</i>

1161
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:48,837
And why do you have two steering wheels?

1162
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,463
We really only use this near shore.

1163
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:52,966
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.

1164
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,508
This one's from the <i>Noordam.</i>

1165
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:55,593
Thank you, Sparks.

1166
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:01,641
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

1167
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,101
In fact, we're speeding up.

1168
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:06,135
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

1169
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,444
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

1170
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:14,578
Okay, now, let it go.

1171
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:20,183
- That's good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice.

1172
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:22,928
That's excellent, son.

1173
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,253
Mr. Andrews,
forgive me...

1174
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:32,546
I did the sum in my head.

1175
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,548
And with the number of lifeboats

1176
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,801
times the capacity you mentioned,

1177
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,636
forgive me, but it seems that

1178
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,770
there are not enough for everyone aboard.

1179
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,558
About half, actually.

1180
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:45,275
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

1181
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,187
In fact, I put in these new type davits

1182
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:51,107
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

1183
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,818
But it was thought, by some,

1184
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,852
that the deck would look too cluttered.

1185
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:58,156
So, I was overruled.

1186
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,451
Waste of deck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.

1187
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,330
Sleep soundly, young Rose.
I have built you a good ship.

1188
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:06,831
Strong and true.

1189
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:08,666
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1190
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:09,959
Just keep heading aft.

1191
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:11,943
The next stop will be the engine room.

1192
01:17:12,337 --> 01:17:13,338
Come on.

1193
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:18,218
Jack.

1194
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,886
This is impossible.

1195
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,888
- I can't see you.
- I need to talk to you.

1196
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,349
No, Jack. No.

1197
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:28,269
Jack, I'm engaged.

1198
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,105
I'm marrying Cal.

1199
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:33,316
I love Cal.

1200
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:38,905
Rose, you're no picnic.

1201
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:42,408
All right? You're a spoiled
little brat even.

1202
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,034
But under that,

1203
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:47,247
you're the most amazingly astounding,

1204
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,917
wonderful girl...
woman that I've ever known.

1205
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,418
- And...
- Jack, I...

1206
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:53,919
No, let me try and get this out.

1207
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,004
You're...

1208
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,135
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1209
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,762
I've got 10 bucks in my pocket,

1210
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:06,015
I have nothing to offer you,
and I know that.

1211
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:08,685
I understand.

1212
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:10,519
But I'm too involved now.

1213
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,730
You jump, I jump, remember?

1214
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,923
I can't turn away
without knowing you'll be all right.

1215
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,385
That's all that I want.

1216
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,490
Well, I'm fine.

1217
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:24,784
I'll be fine. Really.

1218
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,161
Really?

1219
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:30,415
I don't think so.

1220
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,252
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1221
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:35,920
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

1222
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:38,204
Maybe not right away
because you're strong...

1223
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:43,302
but sooner or later, that fire
that I love about you, Rose,

1224
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,805
that fire is gonna burn out.

1225
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,944
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1226
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,900
You're right.

1227
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:59,193
Only you can do that.

1228
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,161
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

1229
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,259
Tell Lucile about the disaster you had
with the stationers.

1230
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,554
Well, of course, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.

1231
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:27,722
Oh, my dear.

1232
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:29,515
And the dreadful bridesmaids gowns,

1233
01:19:29,599 --> 01:19:31,849
let me tell you what
an odyssey that has been.

1234
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,270
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1235
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:36,147
She knows I detest the color.

1236
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:38,315
So she did it only to spite me.

1237
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,234
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1238
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,696
Ruth saw some of my designs
in <i>La Mode Illustrée.</i>

1239
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,155
They were for the trousseau
of the Duchess

1240
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,615
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1241
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:47,949
They were quite charming.

1242
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:50,578
But I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together we've created

1243
01:19:50,662 --> 01:19:53,623
something of a phoenix from the ashes.

1244
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:09,681
Hello, Jack.

1245
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,729
I changed my mind.

1246
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,403
They said you might be up here.

1247
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:25,989
Shh.

1248
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:28,700
Give me your hand.

1249
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,542
Now close your eyes.

1250
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:40,044
Go on.

1251
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:44,716
Now, step up.

1252
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:50,220
Now, hold onto the railing.

1253
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:52,306
Keep your eyes closed, don't peek.

1254
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:53,558
I'm not.

1255
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,394
Step up onto the rail.

1256
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,025
Hold on. Hold on.

1257
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,361
Keep your eyes closed.

1258
01:21:05,445 --> 01:21:06,612
Do you trust me?

1259
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:08,573
I trust you.

1260
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:21,419
All right. Open your eyes.

1261
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,720
I'm flying! Jack!

1262
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:59,582
<i>Come, Josephine in my flying machine</i>

1263
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:02,710
<i>Going up, she goes</i>

1264
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:05,505
<i>Up, she goes</i>

1265
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:55,429
That was the last time <i>Titanic</i>
ever saw daylight.

1266
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:59,850
So we're up to dusk
the night of the sinking.

1267
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,060
Six hours to go.

1268
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:03,677
Incredible. There's Smith
and he's standing there,

1269
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:06,023
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1270
01:23:06,107 --> 01:23:08,818
Excuse me. His hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1271
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,988
26 years of experience
working against him.

1272
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:14,740
He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship,

1273
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:16,524
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1274
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:19,912
The ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1275
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,539
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1276
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,917
Everything he knows is wrong.

1277
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,932
It's quite proper, I assure you.

1278
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,266
This is the sitting room.

1279
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,646
- Will this light do?
- What?

1280
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:47,898
Don't artists need good light?

1281
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:51,151
That is true, but I'm not used to working

1282
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:52,820
in such horrible conditions.

1283
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:54,655
Monet.

1284
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:56,831
Do you know his work?

1285
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,034
Of course.

1286
01:23:58,868 --> 01:24:00,869
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1287
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,039
I know.
It's extraordinary.

1288
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:08,336
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1289
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,589
Should we be expecting him anytime soon?

1290
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,384
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1291
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,974
Whew. That's nice.
What is it, a sapphire?

1292
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,270
A diamond.
A very rare diamond.

1293
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:33,291
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1294
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:35,529
Wearing this.

1295
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:37,240
All right.

1296
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,993
Wearing only this.

1297
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:17,487
The last thing I need

1298
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,271
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1299
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,228
As a paying customer...

1300
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:29,565
I expect to get what I want.

1301
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:50,646
Over on the bed, uh, the couch.

1302
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,740
Come. Lie down.

1303
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:05,702
- Yeah, keep that...
- Tell me when it looks right.

1304
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:07,436
Put your arm back the way it was.

1305
01:26:08,998 --> 01:26:10,041
Right.

1306
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,042
Put that other arm up.

1307
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:13,926
That hand right by your face, there.

1308
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,505
Right.

1309
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,008
Now, head down.

1310
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:23,453
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1311
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,516
And try to stay still.

1312
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:47,745
So serious.

1313
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,623
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big <i>Artiste.</i>

1314
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:39,672
Can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

1315
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:43,384
He does landscapes.

1316
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,678
Just relax your face.

1317
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:47,263
- Sorry.
- No laughing.

1318
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,422
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1319
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:25,468
It was the most erotic moment of my life.

1320
01:28:30,014 --> 01:28:31,849
Up until then, at least.

1321
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,477
So what happened next?

1322
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:38,272
You mean, did we do it?

1323
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:42,902
<i>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.</i>

1324
01:28:43,611 --> 01:28:45,362
<i>Jack was very professional.</i>

1325
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:54,872
Thank you.

1326
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,298
Whatcha doin'?

1327
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,217
Will you put this
back in the safe for me?

1328
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:08,302
Mm-hmm.

1329
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:15,768
Whew.

1330
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:20,939
Gentlemen, would you excuse me?

1331
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:22,024
Of course.

1332
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:25,986
None of the stewards have seen her.

1333
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:28,739
This is absurd.

1334
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:31,575
It's a ship. There's only
so many places she could be.

1335
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:34,036
Lovejoy, find her.

1336
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,597
- Clear.
- Yes.

1337
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:57,017
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1338
01:29:58,352 --> 01:29:59,353
Like a mill pond.

1339
01:30:00,563 --> 01:30:01,689
Not a breath of wind.

1340
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:05,484
It will make the 'bergs harder to see.

1341
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,279
With no breaking water at the base.

1342
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:12,408
Hmm.

1343
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:23,377
Well, I'm off. Maintain speed
and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1344
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,255
Yes, sir.

1345
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:39,935
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

1346
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:41,270
Miss Rose?

1347
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:43,272
My drawings.

1348
01:31:09,882 --> 01:31:10,966
Come on!

1349
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,471
No, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

1350
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:16,764
Wait, wait, wait!

1351
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:18,265
Go, go!
Down, down, down!

1352
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:19,558
Take us down! Quick! Quickly!

1353
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,685
- Go, go, go!
- Quickly, quickly!

1354
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,025
Bye!

1355
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,201
Sorry.

1356
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:44,315
It's all right, sir. I've got it.

1357
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:57,012
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1358
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:58,305
Seems more like a cop.

1359
01:31:58,472 --> 01:31:59,682
I think he was.

1360
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:02,059
- Oh, shit!
- Go!

1361
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:04,603
Hold on!

1362
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:07,981
No, over here!

1363
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:09,858
Quick!

1364
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:17,658
Now what?

1365
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:19,743
What?

1366
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,084
Coal. More coal for
number one, mate.

1367
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:29,377
Hold on. What are you two
doing down here?

1368
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:32,111
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous. Oi!

1369
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:39,805
Carry on. Don't mind us.
You're doing a great job.

1370
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,181
Keep up the good work.

1371
01:32:57,948 --> 01:32:59,742
Ah. Look what
we have here, huh?

1372
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:19,344
Thank you.

1373
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,441
Where to, miss?

1374
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:35,319
To the stars.

1375
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,173
You nervous?

1376
01:33:58,967 --> 01:33:59,968
No.

1377
01:34:16,944 --> 01:34:18,294
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1378
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:44,429
Cold. It's bloody cold.

1379
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:47,891
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1380
01:34:49,935 --> 01:34:50,936
Bollocks!

1381
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:52,628
Well, I can, all right.

1382
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:55,607
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1383
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:57,491
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1384
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,863
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1385
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:33,979
You're trembling.

1386
01:35:36,607 --> 01:35:39,151
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

1387
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:01,882
They ran down there.

1388
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:03,050
Right.

1389
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:13,810
Anything missing?

1390
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:40,486
I've got a better idea.

1391
01:36:53,976 --> 01:36:55,018
Got ya!

1392
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,530
Did you see those guys' faces?

1393
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:09,199
Did you see them?

1394
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:17,124
When the ship docks...

1395
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,794
I'm getting off with you.

1396
01:37:22,004 --> 01:37:23,046
This is crazy.

1397
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:25,590
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1398
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,177
That's why I trust it.

1399
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:40,480
Oh, yes. Here, look at this.

1400
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,775
Look at that, would ya?

1401
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:45,610
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1402
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:47,779
Well, if that's what it takes
for us to get warm,

1403
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:50,563
I'd rather not, if it's all
the same to you, all right?

1404
01:38:02,753 --> 01:38:04,046
Bugger me!

1405
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:10,927
Pick up, you bastards.

1406
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:15,723
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

1407
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:16,975
Yes. What do you see?

1408
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:18,685
Iceberg right ahead.

1409
01:38:18,769 --> 01:38:19,770
Thank you.

1410
01:38:22,272 --> 01:38:23,231
Iceberg, right ahead.

1411
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:25,317
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard.

1412
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:34,659
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1413
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:38,497
Hey, I'll have some of that.

1414
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,874
- Hey.
- Full astern!

1415
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:44,127
Hard over.

1416
01:38:44,211 --> 01:38:45,629
Helm's hard over, sir.

1417
01:38:49,716 --> 01:38:51,510
- Go, lads, go.
- Faster, faster!

1418
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,431
Bring that
steam down! Bring it down!

1419
01:38:58,350 --> 01:38:59,935
Shut all the dampers!

1420
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:01,186
Shut them.

1421
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:06,733
Hold it.

1422
01:39:08,485 --> 01:39:09,653
Hold it.

1423
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:12,989
Now! Engage
the reversing engine.

1424
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:14,032
Bring them down!

1425
01:39:42,102 --> 01:39:43,478
Why ain't they turning?

1426
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:44,896
Is it hard over?

1427
01:39:45,063 --> 01:39:46,606
It is. Yes, sir. Hard over.

1428
01:39:51,278 --> 01:39:53,321
Come on, come on.

1429
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,073
Come on, turn.

1430
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:01,163
Go, lads, go!

1431
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,707
Step lively, go!

1432
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:08,044
Yes.

1433
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:14,176
It's gonna hit!

1434
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,606
Jesus Christ!

1435
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,586
Jesus.

1436
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:50,837
Hard to port!

1437
01:40:50,921 --> 01:40:52,422
Hard to port!

1438
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:03,475
Get back!

1439
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:17,906
Come on!

1440
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:20,200
Get down!

1441
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:35,215
Come on, let's go!
Get out the door!

1442
01:41:35,382 --> 01:41:36,682
They're closing the doors!

1443
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:38,176
- Get out!
- Get out!

1444
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:39,260
Get out of here!

1445
01:41:39,344 --> 01:41:41,471
Get out of here! Get out!

1446
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,393
Get out the door! Go!

1447
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:48,937
Go! Come on, lads!

1448
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:50,313
Go, lads, go!

1449
01:41:57,696 --> 01:41:58,697
Get out!

1450
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:01,032
Go, go!

1451
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,200
Go, come on.

1452
01:42:02,284 --> 01:42:03,660
Out! Out!

1453
01:42:18,508 --> 01:42:20,176
Oh, my God.

1454
01:42:21,428 --> 01:42:22,887
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1455
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:25,390
Smell ice, can you?
Bleedin' Christ.

1456
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:28,852
Is that hull leaking in?

1457
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:32,230
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1458
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,920
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1459
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:42,574
An iceberg, sir.

1460
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:44,951
I put her hard to starboard

1461
01:42:45,035 --> 01:42:47,161
and ran the engines full astern,
but it was too close.

1462
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:49,873
I tried to port around it
but she hit and...

1463
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,540
Close the watertight doors.

1464
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:52,924
The doors are closed, sir.

1465
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:57,255
All stop.

1466
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:58,673
Aye, sir.

1467
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:07,932
Find the carpenter.

1468
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:09,966
- Get him to sound the ship.
- Yes, sir.

1469
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,820
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

1470
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:24,032
Come on, hurry up.

1471
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:30,621
Excuse me, why have the engines stopped?

1472
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:31,873
I felt a shudder.

1473
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,040
I shouldn't worry, madam.

1474
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,709
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1475
01:43:34,793 --> 01:43:36,168
That's the shudder you felt.

1476
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:37,545
May I bring you anything?

1477
01:43:38,588 --> 01:43:39,589
No, thank you.

1478
01:43:44,761 --> 01:43:45,761
Say, old man, there's talk of an iceberg.

1479
01:43:45,845 --> 01:43:46,888
You see anything?

1480
01:43:47,389 --> 01:43:49,289
Well, I don't see
anything now. Do you?

1481
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:51,059
Water!

1482
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:52,560
If this is the direction
the rats are going,

1483
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:53,944
that's good enough for me.

1484
01:43:56,189 --> 01:43:57,357
Please, sir.
Please.

1485
01:43:57,524 --> 01:43:58,566
Everything's under control.

1486
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:00,550
There's nothing to worry about at all.

1487
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:03,362
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1488
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,114
Yes, there is. I have been robbed.

1489
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:06,348
Get the Master-at-Arms.

1490
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,993
- Now, you moron.
- Yes, sir.

1491
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,998
Hey! Did I miss the fun?

1492
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:17,501
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1493
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:19,085
Apparently, it hit over there.

1494
01:44:20,422 --> 01:44:21,380
Boiler room six is flooded

1495
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:23,799
eight feet above the plate
and the mail hold is worse.

1496
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:25,134
She's all buckled in in the forward hold.

1497
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:26,385
Can you shore up?

1498
01:44:26,469 --> 01:44:27,386
Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1499
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,929
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1500
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,513
No, she's already under water.

1501
01:44:31,433 --> 01:44:32,517
This is bad.

1502
01:44:35,395 --> 01:44:37,063
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1503
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:39,614
I think they're very good, sir.

1504
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,487
Don't touch anything.

1505
01:44:44,654 --> 01:44:45,946
I want the entire room photographed.

1506
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,365
Just keep holding my hand.

1507
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:49,408
Harold, do you know what's going on?

1508
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:50,942
I heard it's just the engine.

1509
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:52,811
We've been looking for you, miss.

1510
01:44:58,042 --> 01:44:59,043
Here we go.

1511
01:45:05,175 --> 01:45:06,725
Something serious has happened.

1512
01:45:07,927 --> 01:45:09,804
Yes, it has.

1513
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:14,392
Indeed. Two things dear
to me have disappeared this evening.

1514
01:45:14,476 --> 01:45:15,851
Now that one is back,

1515
01:45:15,935 --> 01:45:18,229
I have a pretty good idea
where to find the other.

1516
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:19,438
Search him.

1517
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:20,523
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1518
01:45:20,607 --> 01:45:21,691
Come on, now.

1519
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,984
Cal, what are you doing?

1520
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:24,902
We are in the middle of an emergency.

1521
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:26,237
What's going on?

1522
01:45:26,488 --> 01:45:28,448
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1523
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,825
This is horseshit!

1524
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:33,744
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1525
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,621
- He couldn't have.
- Of course, he could.

1526
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:37,039
It's easy enough for a professional.

1527
01:45:37,123 --> 01:45:38,541
- Come on.
- But I was with him

1528
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:40,084
the whole time.
This is absurd.

1529
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:43,518
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1530
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:46,048
Real slick, Cal.

1531
01:45:46,132 --> 01:45:47,091
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1532
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:48,300
Shut up.

1533
01:45:48,384 --> 01:45:50,261
It isn't even your pocket, is it, son?

1534
01:45:50,345 --> 01:45:51,930
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1535
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:57,560
That was reported stolen today.

1536
01:45:57,644 --> 01:45:58,602
No, I just borrowed it.

1537
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,479
- I was going to return it.
- Oh, an honest thief.

1538
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,356
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1539
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,692
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1540
01:46:05,568 --> 01:46:06,569
Don't you believe them, Rose.

1541
01:46:06,653 --> 01:46:07,653
You know it.
You know I didn't do it.

1542
01:46:07,737 --> 01:46:08,737
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on, let's go.

1543
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:09,905
Rose, you know I didn't do it, Rose!

1544
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:10,948
- Don't make a fuss.
- Rose!

1545
01:46:11,032 --> 01:46:12,158
Come on. There's a good lad.

1546
01:46:12,242 --> 01:46:13,451
Come on, son.
There's a good lad.

1547
01:46:13,535 --> 01:46:14,536
Come on.

1548
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:16,955
You know I didn't do it!
You know me!

1549
01:46:18,665 --> 01:46:20,416
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1550
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:28,007
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes,

1551
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:31,594
in the forepeak, in all three holds
and in boiler room six.

1552
01:46:31,678 --> 01:46:32,804
That's right, sir.

1553
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:34,388
When can we get underway, damn it?

1554
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:36,057
That's five compartments.

1555
01:46:38,685 --> 01:46:40,811
She can stay afloat with
the first four compartments

1556
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:42,045
breached, but not five.

1557
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:44,816
Not five.

1558
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:46,233
As she goes down by the head,

1559
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,820
the water will spill over
the tops of the bulkheads

1560
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:51,322
at E deck from one to the next.

1561
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:53,658
Back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1562
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:56,076
The pumps, if we opened the doors...

1563
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,310
The pumps buy you time.

1564
01:46:57,704 --> 01:46:59,247
But minutes only.

1565
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:02,166
From this moment, no matter what we do...

1566
01:47:03,251 --> 01:47:04,836
<i>Titanic</i> will founder.

1567
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:09,340
But this ship can't sink.

1568
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:11,724
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can.

1569
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,553
And she will.

1570
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:16,062
It is a mathematical certainty.

1571
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:22,103
How much time?

1572
01:47:29,694 --> 01:47:30,653
An hour.

1573
01:47:30,737 --> 01:47:32,238
Two at most.

1574
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:40,186
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1575
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:43,124
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1576
01:47:50,632 --> 01:47:53,426
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1577
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:13,061
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1578
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:16,522
You look at me when I'm talking to you!

1579
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,118
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now, we're busy.

1580
01:48:19,369 --> 01:48:22,079
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts

1581
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:23,998
- and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1582
01:48:24,082 --> 01:48:26,041
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley,

1583
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:27,293
but it's Captain's orders.

1584
01:48:27,377 --> 01:48:29,420
Now, please, dress warmly.

1585
01:48:29,504 --> 01:48:31,047
It's quite cold out tonight.

1586
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:35,051
Now may I suggest, top coats and hats.

1587
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:36,427
This is ridiculous.

1588
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,263
Not to worry, miss.

1589
01:48:39,347 --> 01:48:41,473
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1590
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:43,768
Everybody up, lifebelts on!

1591
01:48:45,353 --> 01:48:46,896
What? What's he on about?

1592
01:48:47,647 --> 01:48:48,689
Everybody up, put your lifebelts on.

1593
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:49,774
What's the ruckus?

1594
01:48:49,982 --> 01:48:51,332
Just put your lifebelts on.

1595
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:55,029
C.Q.D.? Sir?

1596
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,365
That's right. C.Q.D.

1597
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:01,035
The distress call. That's our position.

1598
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:09,126
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head

1599
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:10,920
and need immediate assistance.

1600
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:21,806
Blimey.

1601
01:49:30,648 --> 01:49:31,649
Hold her underway.

1602
01:49:31,941 --> 01:49:34,777
Keep lowering.
Keep lowering.

1603
01:49:35,445 --> 01:49:37,071
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Pull.

1604
01:49:37,155 --> 01:49:38,114
Easy now!

1605
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:43,327
Steady! Make it taut!
And winch it out!

1606
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:51,210
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1607
01:49:52,086 --> 01:49:53,296
Release those ties!

1608
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:54,505
Roll back that cover!

1609
01:49:54,589 --> 01:49:55,589
Roll back that cover smartly, now!

1610
01:49:55,673 --> 01:49:56,674
Mr. Wilde.

1611
01:49:56,758 --> 01:49:57,841
Release the boat from...

1612
01:49:57,925 --> 01:49:58,759
Mr. Wilde.
Where are the passengers?

1613
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:00,386
They've all gone back inside.

1614
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:02,388
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1615
01:50:02,597 --> 01:50:03,598
You there.

1616
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:07,018
Get down here and help with these lines!

1617
01:50:21,491 --> 01:50:22,658
Care for a drink, sir?

1618
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:26,328
- Please put your lifebelt on.
- Hey, sonny.

1619
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:27,496
- Miss.
- What's doing?

1620
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,624
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1621
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:32,501
Sorry, ma'am.
Let me go and find out.

1622
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:33,711
Make sure the straps are secure.

1623
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:36,171
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1624
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:39,255
It's just the goddamned English
doing everything by the book.

1625
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:41,594
There's no need for language,
Mr. Hockley.

1626
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:44,722
Go back and turn the heaters
on in our rooms.

1627
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:46,689
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1628
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:48,149
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1629
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:55,482
Will you put your lifebelt on, please?

1630
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:57,860
I don't understand why didn't they know?

1631
01:50:57,944 --> 01:50:58,986
Mr. Andrews?

1632
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:02,156
I saw the iceberg.

1633
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,866
And I see it in your eyes.

1634
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:06,452
Please tell me the truth.

1635
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:08,961
Yes, madam.
Please, put it on immediately.

1636
01:51:14,919 --> 01:51:16,546
The ship will sink.

1637
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:20,216
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1638
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:21,551
In an hour or so.

1639
01:51:22,844 --> 01:51:25,294
All of this will be at
the bottom of the Atlantic.

1640
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:27,682
What?

1641
01:51:27,849 --> 01:51:29,767
Please, tell only who you must.

1642
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:32,352
I don't want to be responsible
for a panic.

1643
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:34,814
And get to a boat, quickly. Don't wait.

1644
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:38,348
You remember what I told you
about the boats?

1645
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:42,864
Yes.

1646
01:51:44,657 --> 01:51:46,158
I understand.

1647
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:50,704
Have I put this thing on right?

1648
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:52,788
Yes, madam.
Please put it on immediately.

1649
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,167
Over here, son.

1650
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:57,920
Sir, they need you up in

1651
01:51:58,004 --> 01:51:59,087
the Second-Class Purser's office.

1652
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:00,631
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on.

1653
01:52:00,715 --> 01:52:01,915
I'll keep an eye on him.

1654
01:52:02,675 --> 01:52:04,176
Aye. Right.

1655
01:52:18,024 --> 01:52:19,150
Sir.

1656
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,652
<i>Carpathia</i> says they're making 17 knots.

1657
01:52:21,736 --> 01:52:23,112
Full steam for them, sir.

1658
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:26,781
She's the only one who's responded?

1659
01:52:26,866 --> 01:52:28,325
The only one close, sir.

1660
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:30,328
Says they can be here in four hours.

1661
01:52:31,203 --> 01:52:32,330
Four hours?

1662
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:38,961
Thank you, Bride.

1663
01:52:43,799 --> 01:52:45,301
My God.

1664
01:52:45,968 --> 01:52:47,719
I really
don't think so, Mr. Wilde.

1665
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:49,263
Secure the falls aft.

1666
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:54,351
Sir?

1667
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:56,896
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1668
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:00,482
Hadn't we better get the women
and children

1669
01:53:00,566 --> 01:53:01,567
into the boats, sir?

1670
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:05,029
Yes.

1671
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:06,697
Sir?

1672
01:53:09,367 --> 01:53:12,244
Women and children first. Yes.

1673
01:53:14,205 --> 01:53:15,373
Yes, sir.

1674
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:19,585
Ladies and gentlemen,

1675
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:20,920
your attention, please!

1676
01:53:21,629 --> 01:53:23,797
Step this way, please!
That's right!

1677
01:53:23,881 --> 01:53:26,592
Come towards me! Thank you!

1678
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:29,011
Good.

1679
01:53:29,095 --> 01:53:30,679
For the time being,

1680
01:53:30,763 --> 01:53:33,557
I shall require only women and children.

1681
01:53:33,641 --> 01:53:34,641
Gentlemen, please stay where you are.

1682
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:35,768
Right here.

1683
01:53:35,893 --> 01:53:37,477
All right, boys.
Like the captain said.

1684
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:39,187
Nice and cheery so there's no panic.

1685
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:40,439
Gentlemen please stay
exactly where you are.

1686
01:53:40,523 --> 01:53:41,524
"Wedding Dance."

1687
01:53:50,324 --> 01:53:53,285
Lifebelts on.
Here, put your lifebelts on.

1688
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:56,038
Put your lifebelts on.
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1689
01:53:56,372 --> 01:53:58,457
Here, come on.
Put your lifebelt on.

1690
01:53:58,624 --> 01:54:00,209
Turn that around.

1691
01:54:01,252 --> 01:54:03,003
Please, ladies and gentlemen,

1692
01:54:03,087 --> 01:54:04,630
there isn't any reason to panic.

1693
01:54:04,714 --> 01:54:07,174
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet.

1694
01:54:07,258 --> 01:54:09,259
Please, stay calm.

1695
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:11,011
Look, please, make sure, everybody,

1696
01:54:11,095 --> 01:54:12,888
you've got your lifebelts on.

1697
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:14,431
And gentlemen,
allow the women and children

1698
01:54:14,515 --> 01:54:15,474
through to the front.

1699
01:54:15,558 --> 01:54:18,394
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

1700
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:20,938
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats,

1701
01:54:21,022 --> 01:54:22,064
they'll be starting with us,

1702
01:54:22,148 --> 01:54:23,732
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1703
01:54:23,816 --> 01:54:24,650
Everybody, not just quite yet.

1704
01:54:24,734 --> 01:54:26,027
Don't push on the gates.

1705
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:27,643
You won't get out any faster.

1706
01:54:27,945 --> 01:54:29,071
Go and get some help.

1707
01:54:29,155 --> 01:54:33,367
Lower it away.
Left and right together. Steady.

1708
01:54:34,243 --> 01:54:37,079
Both sides together. Steady.

1709
01:54:37,163 --> 01:54:38,580
Steady.

1710
01:54:38,664 --> 01:54:39,873
Steady.

1711
01:54:39,957 --> 01:54:41,457
All right, steady as she goes.

1712
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:43,002
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1713
01:54:44,462 --> 01:54:45,754
Hold the left side!

1714
01:54:45,838 --> 01:54:48,632
Right side only!
Right side only!

1715
01:54:48,716 --> 01:54:51,343
Right side only!
Hold the left side!

1716
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:54,263
Right side down!
Lower away together!

1717
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,059
Steady, lads!

1718
01:55:18,871 --> 01:55:19,913
I need two men each

1719
01:55:19,997 --> 01:55:21,797
to handle the fore
and aft port. Now.

1720
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:48,818
You know, I do believe
this ship may sink.

1721
01:55:51,237 --> 01:55:53,572
I've been asked to give you
this small token

1722
01:55:53,656 --> 01:55:54,990
of our appreciation.

1723
01:55:58,202 --> 01:56:00,830
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1724
01:56:06,877 --> 01:56:07,919
Step aboard, sir.

1725
01:56:08,003 --> 01:56:09,379
Come on, sister. You heard
the man. Into the boat.

1726
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:10,422
These gentlemen will take care of you.

1727
01:56:10,506 --> 01:56:12,632
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1728
01:56:12,716 --> 01:56:14,134
Only women at this time, sir.

1729
01:56:14,218 --> 01:56:15,260
Thank you.

1730
01:56:15,344 --> 01:56:17,144
This man here will take care of you.

1731
01:56:17,471 --> 01:56:20,015
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1732
01:56:21,684 --> 01:56:23,894
I hope they're not too crowded.

1733
01:56:25,271 --> 01:56:27,148
Oh, Mother. Shut up!

1734
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:29,441
Don't you understand?

1735
01:56:29,775 --> 01:56:32,027
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1736
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:33,279
Not enough by half.

1737
01:56:34,405 --> 01:56:36,655
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1738
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:37,992
Not the better half.

1739
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:41,578
Come on, Ruth.
Get in the boat.

1740
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:43,462
First-class seats are right up here.

1741
01:56:45,374 --> 01:56:47,125
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1742
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:48,752
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1743
01:56:48,836 --> 01:56:50,587
Women and children

1744
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:52,506
towards the front beam.

1745
01:56:52,673 --> 01:56:54,800
You unimaginable bastard.

1746
01:56:56,051 --> 01:56:57,052
Come on, Rose, darlin'.

1747
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:58,595
There's plenty of room for you.

1748
01:56:58,679 --> 01:56:59,721
Right this way, miss.

1749
01:56:59,805 --> 01:57:00,639
Come on, Rose.

1750
01:57:01,682 --> 01:57:02,766
You're next, darlin'.

1751
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:04,934
Come into the boat, Rose.

1752
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:07,897
Come.

1753
01:57:08,147 --> 01:57:09,106
Rose!

1754
01:57:10,608 --> 01:57:12,026
Get into the boat.

1755
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:13,652
Rose.

1756
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:16,530
Goodbye, Mother.

1757
01:57:18,365 --> 01:57:19,991
Rose?

1758
01:57:20,075 --> 01:57:21,284
Rose, come back here right now!

1759
01:57:21,368 --> 01:57:22,661
Where are you going?

1760
01:57:22,745 --> 01:57:24,288
What, to him?

1761
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:26,296
What? To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1762
01:57:26,582 --> 01:57:27,583
No, wait!

1763
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:29,919
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1764
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:33,756
No! No!

1765
01:57:35,007 --> 01:57:36,383
I said, no!

1766
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:40,346
Rose! Please, stop!

1767
01:57:41,513 --> 01:57:43,807
- And lower away!
- No, Rose!

1768
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,392
- And together.
- No, wait!

1769
01:57:45,559 --> 01:57:46,726
Lower away!

1770
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,146
- Rose!
- Lower together!

1771
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:50,606
Pull the left side in!

1772
01:57:54,652 --> 01:57:55,486
Help!

1773
01:57:56,695 --> 01:57:58,739
Can anybody hear me?

1774
01:58:00,032 --> 01:58:01,784
Hello, help me!

1775
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:03,786
Help me!

1776
01:58:04,161 --> 01:58:06,247
Can you hear me?

1777
01:58:06,914 --> 01:58:08,666
Can anybody hear me?

1778
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:10,501
Somebody help me!

1779
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,003
Mr. Andrews!

1780
01:58:17,216 --> 01:58:18,300
Steward, check the starboard corridor.

1781
01:58:18,384 --> 01:58:19,385
Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1782
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:22,679
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt,
get to the boat deck immediately.

1783
01:58:22,763 --> 01:58:24,347
Lucy, for God's sake,
put on your lifebelt.

1784
01:58:24,431 --> 01:58:26,031
- Set a good example.
- Yes, sir.

1785
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:28,643
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews!

1786
01:58:28,727 --> 01:58:30,437
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1787
01:58:30,938 --> 01:58:33,190
Where would the Master-at-Arms
take someone under arrest?

1788
01:58:33,274 --> 01:58:35,275
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1789
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:38,654
No! I'm doing this with or
without your help, sir.

1790
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:40,271
But without will take longer.

1791
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:44,117
Take the elevator to the very bottom,

1792
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:46,301
go to the left.
Down the crewman's passage.

1793
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,970
Then go right and left again
at the stairs,

1794
01:58:49,081 --> 01:58:50,631
you'll come to a long corridor.

1795
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:56,588
This could be bad.

1796
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:02,428
Oh, shit!

1797
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:04,054
Oh, shit!

1798
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:10,269
Excuse me. Thank you.

1799
01:59:12,062 --> 01:59:13,146
I do not care what you think.

1800
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:14,481
The lifts are...

1801
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:16,984
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1802
01:59:18,569 --> 01:59:20,946
I'm through being polite, goddamn it!

1803
01:59:21,113 --> 01:59:22,281
Now take me down!

1804
01:59:23,991 --> 01:59:25,117
E deck.

1805
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:29,872
Come on!

1806
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:31,457
Come on, come on!

1807
01:59:49,641 --> 01:59:51,601
- I'm going back up!
- No!

1808
01:59:51,685 --> 01:59:52,978
No, no!

1809
01:59:53,437 --> 01:59:54,438
Miss!

1810
01:59:57,107 --> 01:59:58,942
Come back! I'm going back up!

1811
01:59:59,026 --> 02:00:00,235
I'm going back up!

1812
02:00:09,244 --> 02:00:10,245
Crew passage.

1813
02:00:11,914 --> 02:00:13,040
Crew passage.

1814
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:34,686
Jack!

1815
02:00:39,483 --> 02:00:40,317
Jack!

1816
02:00:44,571 --> 02:00:45,572
Jack!

1817
02:00:46,532 --> 02:00:48,492
- Jack!
- Rose!

1818
02:00:50,119 --> 02:00:52,413
- Jack!
- Rose, I'm in here!

1819
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,414
- I'm in here!
- Jack!

1820
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:55,915
I'm in here!

1821
02:00:55,999 --> 02:00:57,000
- Jack!
- Rose!

1822
02:00:57,167 --> 02:00:59,044
Jack! Jack!

1823
02:00:59,128 --> 02:01:00,211
I'm sorry!

1824
02:01:00,295 --> 02:01:02,214
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1825
02:01:03,757 --> 02:01:05,008
That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.

1826
02:01:05,092 --> 02:01:07,302
I know! I know!
I know! I know!

1827
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:08,554
Listen, Rose,

1828
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,764
you're gonna have to find
a spare key, all right?

1829
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:11,681
All right.

1830
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:13,415
Look in that cabinet right there.

1831
02:01:13,642 --> 02:01:15,192
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1832
02:01:16,812 --> 02:01:17,813
Silver one.

1833
02:01:18,355 --> 02:01:19,773
These are all brass ones!

1834
02:01:20,607 --> 02:01:22,192
Check right here, Rose.

1835
02:01:26,738 --> 02:01:27,739
Rose.

1836
02:01:29,074 --> 02:01:30,874
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1837
02:01:31,493 --> 02:01:34,037
I didn't. I just realized
I already knew.

1838
02:01:36,832 --> 02:01:37,833
Keep looking!

1839
02:01:47,217 --> 02:01:48,594
No key.

1840
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,720
- There's no key!
- All right, Rose, listen.

1841
02:01:50,804 --> 02:01:52,754
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1842
02:01:53,307 --> 02:01:54,266
It'll be all right.

1843
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:00,814
I'll be right back.

1844
02:02:08,864 --> 02:02:10,115
I'll just wait here!

1845
02:02:23,629 --> 02:02:25,172
Hello, is there anyone here?

1846
02:02:26,089 --> 02:02:27,132
Hello!

1847
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:29,551
Is there anybody down here?

1848
02:02:31,345 --> 02:02:33,305
We need help! Hello!

1849
02:02:34,181 --> 02:02:35,182
Damn it!

1850
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:44,316
Can anybody hear me?
Please! Hello!

1851
02:02:44,816 --> 02:02:45,859
Hello!

1852
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:50,280
Thank God! Wait, please!
I need your help!

1853
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:51,947
There's a man back here and...

1854
02:02:52,741 --> 02:02:53,742
Wait!

1855
02:02:57,996 --> 02:02:59,331
Hello?

1856
02:03:24,982 --> 02:03:25,941
Hello?

1857
02:03:26,775 --> 02:03:27,817
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1858
02:03:27,901 --> 02:03:28,902
Wait. Please!

1859
02:03:28,986 --> 02:03:30,528
- I need your help.
- Come along.

1860
02:03:30,612 --> 02:03:31,512
This way, quickly.

1861
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:32,489
There's a man down here
and he is trapped.

1862
02:03:32,573 --> 02:03:33,865
- This way. Yes, all right.
- Please!

1863
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:36,034
- There's no need to panic.
- No, I'm not panicking!

1864
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:38,328
You're going the wrong way!

1865
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:39,788
Let go of me! Listen!

1866
02:03:45,877 --> 02:03:46,920
To hell with you.

1867
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:25,959
Oh, my God.

1868
02:05:14,591 --> 02:05:15,592
Jack!

1869
02:05:16,343 --> 02:05:17,344
Rose!

1870
02:05:18,136 --> 02:05:19,471
Will this work?

1871
02:05:21,014 --> 02:05:22,766
I guess we'll find out.
Come on!

1872
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:28,354
Wait, wait, wait.

1873
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:30,538
Try a couple of practice
swings over there.

1874
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:32,025
All right.

1875
02:05:35,487 --> 02:05:36,738
Good.

1876
02:05:36,822 --> 02:05:39,622
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1877
02:05:46,081 --> 02:05:47,749
Okay, that's enough practice.

1878
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:50,251
Come on, Rose.
You can do it.

1879
02:05:50,335 --> 02:05:53,755
Listen, just hit it really
hard and really fast.

1880
02:05:55,966 --> 02:05:57,217
Come on. Wait!

1881
02:05:57,801 --> 02:05:59,552
Open your hands up
a little more. Good.

1882
02:05:59,636 --> 02:06:01,304
- Like that?
- Right.

1883
02:06:01,388 --> 02:06:02,889
Listen, Rose.

1884
02:06:03,056 --> 02:06:04,141
I trust you.

1885
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,813
Go!

1886
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:16,778
You did it!

1887
02:06:17,571 --> 02:06:18,697
Come on! Let's go!

1888
02:06:19,531 --> 02:06:20,907
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1889
02:06:21,950 --> 02:06:23,702
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1890
02:06:29,541 --> 02:06:31,376
This is the way out.

1891
02:06:31,543 --> 02:06:33,343
We have to find another way.
Come on!

1892
02:06:34,337 --> 02:06:35,547
Pull!

1893
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:38,383
Pull!

1894
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:39,843
Put your backs into it!

1895
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:41,011
Pull!

1896
02:06:46,141 --> 02:06:47,100
Pull!

1897
02:06:48,059 --> 02:06:50,309
Now there's something you
don't see every day.

1898
02:06:50,604 --> 02:06:51,605
Pull!

1899
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:12,333
There's no room for luggage in this boat!

1900
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:14,627
What's this luggage
doing here? Get rid of it!

1901
02:07:14,711 --> 02:07:16,212
Get rid of it.
We need the room.

1902
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:17,547
Get rid of that. Out!

1903
02:07:18,507 --> 02:07:21,176
This way.
Let go, sir! Get back!

1904
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:23,762
Keep calm. Sit down.

1905
02:07:24,346 --> 02:07:25,597
- No!
- Move along now.

1906
02:07:25,931 --> 02:07:27,265
Make more room.

1907
02:07:27,432 --> 02:07:28,582
That's right. Let's go!

1908
02:07:29,643 --> 02:07:31,561
- This way, please.
- Lovejoy!

1909
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:33,728
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1910
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:35,572
We're running out of time.

1911
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:38,640
And this strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1912
02:07:38,902 --> 02:07:41,102
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1913
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:42,930
Well, then, that's our play.

1914
02:07:43,615 --> 02:07:45,665
We'll need some insurance, first.
Come on!

1915
02:07:46,535 --> 02:07:48,785
Come on this way.
It's all the way down there.

1916
02:07:51,748 --> 02:07:52,749
Here!

1917
02:07:53,416 --> 02:07:54,966
What do you think you're doin'?

1918
02:07:55,836 --> 02:07:57,736
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1919
02:07:58,171 --> 02:07:59,672
That's White Star Line property.

1920
02:07:59,756 --> 02:08:00,590
Shut up!

1921
02:08:02,259 --> 02:08:03,718
Will you hold the boat a moment?

1922
02:08:03,802 --> 02:08:05,552
I just have to run back to my room.

1923
02:08:06,388 --> 02:08:07,389
Sit down!

1924
02:08:08,098 --> 02:08:09,056
She's the last.

1925
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:10,940
- Prepare to lower.
- Mr. Lightoller.

1926
02:08:11,518 --> 02:08:13,269
Why are the boats
being launched half full?

1927
02:08:13,353 --> 02:08:15,203
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

1928
02:08:15,397 --> 02:08:17,815
Twenty or so in a boat built for 65?

1929
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:20,193
And I saw one boat
with only 12! 12!

1930
02:08:20,277 --> 02:08:23,321
Well, we weren't sure
of the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1931
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:24,948
These boats may buckle.

1932
02:08:25,115 --> 02:08:25,990
Rubbish.

1933
02:08:26,074 --> 02:08:29,076
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1934
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:30,495
Now, fill these boats,
Mr. Lightoller,

1935
02:08:30,579 --> 02:08:31,705
for God's sake, man!

1936
02:08:39,170 --> 02:08:40,171
Please.

1937
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:42,330
I need more women and children, please.

1938
02:08:47,137 --> 02:08:48,263
Get back in there.

1939
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:49,931
- This is not an exit.
- Get back. Get back in there.

1940
02:08:50,015 --> 02:08:51,141
It's not an exit!

1941
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:55,478
You can't keep us locked
in here like animals.

1942
02:08:55,562 --> 02:08:57,612
- The ship's bloody sinking.
- Stand back!

1943
02:08:57,731 --> 02:08:59,941
Bring forward the women!

1944
02:09:00,025 --> 02:09:01,484
Unlock the gates. Come on.

1945
02:09:02,986 --> 02:09:03,820
Women only!

1946
02:09:04,905 --> 02:09:06,781
No men! Get back!

1947
02:09:06,865 --> 02:09:08,116
No men!

1948
02:09:13,246 --> 02:09:14,706
Get back!

1949
02:09:16,124 --> 02:09:17,083
Get back!

1950
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:19,168
Lock the gates!

1951
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:21,129
Get away from those gates!

1952
02:09:22,213 --> 02:09:23,465
Don't touch the gate!

1953
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:30,304
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1954
02:09:30,388 --> 02:09:32,974
Let us out so we can have a chance!

1955
02:09:33,642 --> 02:09:34,643
Get back!

1956
02:09:38,438 --> 02:09:39,648
- Jack!
- Tommy!

1957
02:09:39,814 --> 02:09:41,482
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1958
02:09:41,566 --> 02:09:43,276
Well, whatever we do,
we've gotta do it fast.

1959
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,778
Jack!

1960
02:09:45,612 --> 02:09:46,446
Fabrizio!

1961
02:09:47,197 --> 02:09:48,364
The boats are all gone!

1962
02:09:48,448 --> 02:09:50,533
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1963
02:09:50,617 --> 02:09:51,617
There's <i>niente</i> this way.

1964
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:52,869
All right.

1965
02:09:53,036 --> 02:09:54,886
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1966
02:10:00,335 --> 02:10:01,335
I make my own luck.

1967
02:10:01,419 --> 02:10:02,837
So do I.

1968
02:10:11,054 --> 02:10:12,097
Come on!

1969
02:10:12,847 --> 02:10:14,347
No! Come on,
let's go this way.

1970
02:10:23,692 --> 02:10:24,818
This way!

1971
02:10:24,985 --> 02:10:27,195
Just go back to the main stairwell

1972
02:10:27,362 --> 02:10:29,322
and everything will be sorted out there.

1973
02:10:29,406 --> 02:10:30,657
The hell it will.

1974
02:10:30,824 --> 02:10:32,724
It will all get sorted out back there.

1975
02:10:33,076 --> 02:10:34,285
Go back to the main stairwell!

1976
02:10:34,369 --> 02:10:35,369
Open the gate.

1977
02:10:35,453 --> 02:10:36,454
Go back down the main stairwell.

1978
02:10:36,538 --> 02:10:37,622
Open the gate right now!

1979
02:10:37,706 --> 02:10:40,125
Go back down the main
stairwell like I told you!

1980
02:10:42,168 --> 02:10:45,171
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1981
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:46,339
Stop that!

1982
02:10:46,965 --> 02:10:48,315
Open the damn gate!
Open it!

1983
02:10:51,177 --> 02:10:52,261
Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand!

1984
02:10:52,345 --> 02:10:53,722
Move aside! Move aside!

1985
02:10:53,888 --> 02:10:55,306
Come on, pull!

1986
02:10:56,057 --> 02:10:57,058
Pull!

1987
02:10:57,976 --> 02:10:59,268
Move aside!
Quickly! Move aside!

1988
02:10:59,352 --> 02:11:01,437
- Put that down!
- Move aside!

1989
02:11:01,521 --> 02:11:03,230
- Put that down! Stop it!
- One!

1990
02:11:03,314 --> 02:11:04,774
- Stop that!
- Two! Three!

1991
02:11:07,527 --> 02:11:08,528
Again!

1992
02:11:10,572 --> 02:11:11,656
Yeah, let's go!

1993
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:15,451
Let's go Rose.

1994
02:11:15,535 --> 02:11:17,585
You can't go out there!
You can't do this!

1995
02:11:22,584 --> 02:11:23,960
Move back as much as you can!

1996
02:11:24,044 --> 02:11:25,711
Keep order!
Keep order here!

1997
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:28,256
Back. Get back. Back.

1998
02:11:33,428 --> 02:11:34,512
Hold on to her!

1999
02:11:36,097 --> 02:11:37,431
Pull her in!

2000
02:11:37,515 --> 02:11:40,518
Get back, I say!

2001
02:11:40,602 --> 02:11:42,937
Or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

2002
02:11:43,021 --> 02:11:44,147
Keep order here!

2003
02:11:45,648 --> 02:11:47,442
Keep order, I say!

2004
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:51,029
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

2005
02:11:55,575 --> 02:11:57,911
Right. Is everybody all right?

2006
02:11:58,328 --> 02:11:59,704
Nobody panic.

2007
02:12:05,752 --> 02:12:06,795
Stay back!

2008
02:12:08,004 --> 02:12:09,005
We're too late!

2009
02:12:09,172 --> 02:12:10,972
There are more boats down the front.

2010
02:12:11,216 --> 02:12:12,675
Stay with this one, Murdoch.

2011
02:12:12,842 --> 02:12:14,392
He seems to be quite practical.

2012
02:12:18,681 --> 02:12:20,350
Don't lower it!

2013
02:12:20,934 --> 02:12:22,185
Cut the falls!

2014
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,902
Sit down! Hey!

2015
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:33,112
Stay back, you lot!

2016
02:12:33,196 --> 02:12:34,030
Just stay back!

2017
02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:35,573
Stay back, the lot of you.

2018
02:12:35,657 --> 02:12:36,574
Stay back!

2019
02:12:39,244 --> 02:12:41,844
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

2020
02:12:43,998 --> 02:12:44,833
Mr. Murdoch?

2021
02:12:44,958 --> 02:12:47,919
Mr. Hockley.
You two, with me, now!

2022
02:12:48,086 --> 02:12:49,545
I'm a businessman, as you know.

2023
02:12:49,629 --> 02:12:51,679
And I have a business
proposition for you.

2024
02:12:59,139 --> 02:13:00,140
Come on, Rose.

2025
02:13:03,768 --> 02:13:04,769
The boats are gone!

2026
02:13:10,525 --> 02:13:12,193
Colonel, are there any boats
on that side?

2027
02:13:12,277 --> 02:13:13,277
No, miss, but there are

2028
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:14,570
a couple of boats all the way forward.

2029
02:13:14,654 --> 02:13:15,854
This way, I'll lead you.

2030
02:13:22,704 --> 02:13:23,704
What's the use?

2031
02:13:23,788 --> 02:13:25,438
Nobody's listening to us, anyway.

2032
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:28,292
Well, they don't listen to us
at dinner, either.

2033
02:13:28,376 --> 02:13:30,026
Come on, let's play.
Keep us warm.

2034
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:32,338
"Orpheus."

2035
02:13:37,552 --> 02:13:38,678
Music to drown by.

2036
02:13:38,845 --> 02:13:40,430
Now I know I'm in first class.

2037
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,309
Keep along. Keep going.

2038
02:13:45,852 --> 02:13:47,061
Where is everyone?

2039
02:13:47,228 --> 02:13:48,771
They're all still aft, sir.

2040
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:51,148
Come on, madam.
Don't cry. Come on.

2041
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:53,610
Do we have an understanding,
then, Mr. Murdoch?

2042
02:13:59,991 --> 02:14:00,992
Stand back!

2043
02:14:04,829 --> 02:14:07,123
Will the men please hold back?

2044
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:08,541
Hold back, I say!

2045
02:14:11,377 --> 02:14:13,880
Women and children only!

2046
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:15,340
Stand back!

2047
02:14:15,506 --> 02:14:17,383
Step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

2048
02:14:17,759 --> 02:14:19,176
This way.
Step back, sir.

2049
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:20,553
Let the women through!

2050
02:14:20,637 --> 02:14:21,846
You better check the other side.

2051
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:23,431
- Stand back, sir.
- Go!

2052
02:14:23,598 --> 02:14:25,391
Stand back, sir.

2053
02:14:25,475 --> 02:14:28,353
Any more women and children?

2054
02:14:29,187 --> 02:14:30,855
Any children?

2055
02:14:31,022 --> 02:14:32,649
I found her on the other side.

2056
02:14:33,358 --> 02:14:34,692
Waiting for a boat

2057
02:14:34,776 --> 02:14:36,194
with him.

2058
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:38,779
Any more women and children?

2059
02:14:38,863 --> 02:14:39,905
They're all aboard,
Mr. Murdoch.

2060
02:14:39,989 --> 02:14:42,116
Anyone else then?

2061
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:43,910
Hop on, sir. Hop on.

2062
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:46,018
- Anyone else?
- Do hurry. Hurry along.

2063
02:14:49,749 --> 02:14:50,833
Stand by the falls.

2064
02:14:50,917 --> 02:14:52,835
- Quickly.
- Goddamn it all to hell.

2065
02:14:53,002 --> 02:14:53,962
That's it!

2066
02:14:56,047 --> 02:14:57,298
- Shit.
- Fire!

2067
02:14:59,008 --> 02:15:00,009
Sir!

2068
02:15:00,176 --> 02:15:01,719
Sir, you can't go through here.

2069
02:15:01,803 --> 02:15:03,103
Sir, you can't go through.

2070
02:15:05,473 --> 02:15:07,350
That's just splendid. Right.

2071
02:15:09,686 --> 02:15:10,687
Right.

2072
02:15:11,896 --> 02:15:13,064
Prepare to lower!

2073
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:17,026
Ready on the left.

2074
02:15:23,491 --> 02:15:24,826
Take them down.

2075
02:15:29,914 --> 02:15:30,915
Keep it steady.

2076
02:15:33,751 --> 02:15:35,586
Both sides together. Steady.

2077
02:15:36,212 --> 02:15:37,297
Keep it steady.

2078
02:15:38,548 --> 02:15:40,174
Give her to me.

2079
02:15:40,341 --> 02:15:41,425
- Daddy!
- It'll be fine,

2080
02:15:41,509 --> 02:15:42,593
- darling.
- Take her.

2081
02:15:42,677 --> 02:15:43,928
- Don't you worry.
- Pull her up.

2082
02:15:44,012 --> 02:15:45,596
Daddy, get in the boat.

2083
02:15:45,763 --> 02:15:47,557
It's goodbye for a little while.

2084
02:15:47,724 --> 02:15:48,924
Only for a little while.

2085
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:50,851
There'll be another boat for the daddies,

2086
02:15:50,935 --> 02:15:52,853
this boat's for the mummies
and the children.

2087
02:15:52,937 --> 02:15:55,287
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

2088
02:15:56,649 --> 02:15:57,775
I'm not going without you.

2089
02:15:57,859 --> 02:16:00,069
- No, you have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

2090
02:16:00,236 --> 02:16:01,237
Women and children only, please!

2091
02:16:01,321 --> 02:16:03,656
- Get in the boat, Rose.
- No, Jack.

2092
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:05,408
Yes! Get on the boat!

2093
02:16:05,575 --> 02:16:07,285
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

2094
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:13,082
Oh, my God, look at you.
You look a fright.

2095
02:16:14,208 --> 02:16:15,209
Here.

2096
02:16:16,836 --> 02:16:18,671
Put this on. Come on.

2097
02:16:18,921 --> 02:16:20,048
On the boat, please.

2098
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:21,548
We'll pray for you.

2099
02:16:21,632 --> 02:16:23,050
Get on the boat.

2100
02:16:23,134 --> 02:16:24,385
Yes, we'll pray for you, darling.

2101
02:16:24,469 --> 02:16:25,928
Go on. I'll get the next one.

2102
02:16:26,012 --> 02:16:28,138
No, not without you.

2103
02:16:28,222 --> 02:16:30,266
I'll be all right.
Listen, I'll be fine.

2104
02:16:30,350 --> 02:16:32,434
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

2105
02:16:32,518 --> 02:16:34,270
Now, go on. Get on.

2106
02:16:34,437 --> 02:16:35,437
I have an arrangement with an officer

2107
02:16:35,521 --> 02:16:36,730
on the other side of the ship.

2108
02:16:36,814 --> 02:16:38,314
Jack and I can get off safely.

2109
02:16:38,566 --> 02:16:39,525
Both of us.

2110
02:16:40,985 --> 02:16:43,529
See?
I got my own boat to catch.

2111
02:16:43,696 --> 02:16:44,655
Come on, hurry.

2112
02:16:44,739 --> 02:16:46,407
They're almost full.

2113
02:16:47,784 --> 02:16:48,867
- Step aboard, miss.
- Go, go.

2114
02:16:48,951 --> 02:16:49,952
Come on, hurry.

2115
02:16:50,703 --> 02:16:51,745
Step aboard, please.

2116
02:16:51,829 --> 02:16:52,955
Be Daddy's good girl, all right?

2117
02:16:53,039 --> 02:16:54,540
- Step lively!
- You're my little sailor.

2118
02:16:54,624 --> 02:16:56,875
Keep back! Keep back, I say!

2119
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:58,252
Clear the rail.

2120
02:16:58,753 --> 02:16:59,903
Clear the rail, please.

2121
02:17:01,422 --> 02:17:02,673
And lower away!

2122
02:17:03,466 --> 02:17:05,134
Lower away together!

2123
02:17:06,177 --> 02:17:07,720
Lower slowly!

2124
02:17:08,304 --> 02:17:10,181
Keep going! Keep going!

2125
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:12,892
And lower away evenly, lads.

2126
02:17:13,893 --> 02:17:16,062
Easy! Lower away!

2127
02:17:16,729 --> 02:17:18,579
- You're a good liar.
- And even away!

2128
02:17:18,773 --> 02:17:19,873
Almost as good as you.

2129
02:17:19,982 --> 02:17:23,236
Easy now! And lower away!

2130
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:25,071
Steady!

2131
02:17:25,238 --> 02:17:26,948
- There's no...
- Easy!

2132
02:17:27,156 --> 02:17:28,866
There's no arrangement, is there?

2133
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:29,992
Lower away!

2134
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:31,911
- No, there is.
- Even!

2135
02:17:32,078 --> 02:17:33,912
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

2136
02:17:33,996 --> 02:17:35,289
And even away!

2137
02:17:35,957 --> 02:17:38,876
- I always win, Jack.
- And lower away evenly, lads!

2138
02:17:39,043 --> 02:17:40,086
One way or another.

2139
02:17:40,253 --> 02:17:42,713
Watch that turn!
Turn that boat!

2140
02:17:44,132 --> 02:17:45,133
Easy!

2141
02:17:46,217 --> 02:17:47,301
Even, lads!

2142
02:17:48,386 --> 02:17:50,888
Keep going! Keep going!

2143
02:17:50,972 --> 02:17:52,265
Steady!

2144
02:17:54,517 --> 02:17:55,476
And even away!

2145
02:17:56,602 --> 02:17:57,603
Lower away!

2146
02:17:59,647 --> 02:18:00,648
Steady!

2147
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:39,479
Rose!

2148
02:18:42,607 --> 02:18:43,690
- Stop her!
- Rose!

2149
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:45,374
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

2150
02:18:46,903 --> 02:18:47,904
No!

2151
02:19:06,255 --> 02:19:07,256
Rose!

2152
02:19:10,801 --> 02:19:12,261
You're so stupid!

2153
02:19:12,428 --> 02:19:13,578
Why'd you do that, huh?

2154
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:15,473
You're so stupid, Rose.

2155
02:19:17,517 --> 02:19:18,935
Why did you do that? Why?

2156
02:19:20,102 --> 02:19:21,687
You jump, I jump, right?

2157
02:19:24,232 --> 02:19:25,233
All right.

2158
02:19:27,485 --> 02:19:29,320
Oh, God! I couldn't go.

2159
02:19:30,071 --> 02:19:31,155
I couldn't go, Jack.

2160
02:19:31,822 --> 02:19:33,822
It's all right.
We'll think of something.

2161
02:19:35,243 --> 02:19:36,243
At least I'm with you.

2162
02:19:36,327 --> 02:19:37,577
We'll think of something.

2163
02:19:50,925 --> 02:19:51,884
Come on!

2164
02:19:52,927 --> 02:19:54,387
Come on! Come on!

2165
02:19:55,596 --> 02:19:56,639
Come on! Move!

2166
02:20:03,437 --> 02:20:04,438
Come on!

2167
02:20:12,738 --> 02:20:13,739
Move!

2168
02:20:19,829 --> 02:20:20,979
Come on, come on, Rose!

2169
02:20:21,998 --> 02:20:22,957
Come on!

2170
02:20:23,874 --> 02:20:24,959
Move! Come on!

2171
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:28,838
Move, Rose!

2172
02:20:32,383 --> 02:20:33,384
Go!

2173
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:45,855
I hope you enjoy your time together!

2174
02:21:00,536 --> 02:21:02,163
What could possibly be funny?

2175
02:21:03,289 --> 02:21:05,374
I put the diamond in the coat.

2176
02:21:08,628 --> 02:21:10,046
And I put the coat on her!

2177
02:21:12,298 --> 02:21:13,299
Come on!

2178
02:21:29,732 --> 02:21:30,691
Dada!

2179
02:21:32,652 --> 02:21:35,237
Dada!

2180
02:21:36,447 --> 02:21:38,616
- Dada!
- We can't leave him.

2181
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:40,534
Dada!

2182
02:21:43,162 --> 02:21:44,205
All right, come on!

2183
02:21:45,915 --> 02:21:48,334
Dada!

2184
02:22:01,263 --> 02:22:02,681
Go back!

2185
02:22:02,765 --> 02:22:06,102
Dada! Dada!

2186
02:22:13,192 --> 02:22:14,443
It's the wrong way!
Come back!

2187
02:22:14,527 --> 02:22:15,736
- No! Not that way!
- You're going the wrong way!

2188
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:17,320
- Come back!
- Come back! Stop!

2189
02:22:22,076 --> 02:22:23,786
Go!

2190
02:22:25,705 --> 02:22:26,706
Go!

2191
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:29,166
Run!

2192
02:22:40,845 --> 02:22:42,596
- Jack!
- Rose!

2193
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:56,444
This way!

2194
02:23:05,828 --> 02:23:06,829
Come on!

2195
02:23:08,414 --> 02:23:09,415
Give me your hand!

2196
02:23:18,591 --> 02:23:19,592
Oh, God!

2197
02:23:24,138 --> 02:23:25,347
Help!

2198
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:32,271
Help!

2199
02:23:34,356 --> 02:23:36,692
Wait, sir!
Sir, open the gate, please!

2200
02:23:36,859 --> 02:23:38,068
- Help us, please!
- Please!

2201
02:23:38,152 --> 02:23:39,569
Help us!

2202
02:23:39,653 --> 02:23:40,988
- Please!
- Please!

2203
02:23:42,490 --> 02:23:43,783
Bloody hell!

2204
02:23:46,827 --> 02:23:47,953
Hurry!

2205
02:23:49,914 --> 02:23:51,248
- God, come on!
- Come on!

2206
02:23:51,999 --> 02:23:53,041
Go, go!

2207
02:23:53,125 --> 02:23:54,084
Oh, Jesus!

2208
02:23:55,169 --> 02:23:56,503
- Please!
- Come on!

2209
02:23:56,587 --> 02:23:58,004
Hurry!

2210
02:23:58,088 --> 02:23:59,215
Come on!

2211
02:24:04,762 --> 02:24:06,263
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

2212
02:24:07,431 --> 02:24:08,766
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

2213
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:10,976
Don't leave!

2214
02:24:11,268 --> 02:24:13,813
Please! Send for help! No!

2215
02:24:31,205 --> 02:24:32,164
I got it!

2216
02:24:32,248 --> 02:24:33,582
- Which one is it, Rose?
- All right!

2217
02:24:33,666 --> 02:24:35,316
The short one, try the short one.

2218
02:24:36,669 --> 02:24:37,628
Hurry, Jack.

2219
02:24:41,131 --> 02:24:42,883
Oh, no! It won't go in!

2220
02:24:43,884 --> 02:24:44,718
Hurry, Jack.

2221
02:24:47,221 --> 02:24:49,598
- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Come on, Jack! Hurry.

2222
02:24:49,682 --> 02:24:52,268
- Jack! Hurry, Jack!
- Come on!

2223
02:24:54,186 --> 02:24:55,771
- Hurry, Jack!
- Go on!

2224
02:24:55,855 --> 02:24:56,939
Jack!

2225
02:24:58,232 --> 02:25:00,359
I got it! I got it!
Go! Go, Rose!

2226
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:03,571
Go! Go! Move!

2227
02:25:04,905 --> 02:25:05,990
Jack!

2228
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,081
Jack!

2229
02:25:15,332 --> 02:25:16,374
Jack!

2230
02:25:16,458 --> 02:25:17,501
Come on!

2231
02:25:19,587 --> 02:25:20,421
Move, move.

2232
02:25:29,847 --> 02:25:31,947
- Keep on working!
- Get the oars in place.

2233
02:25:32,099 --> 02:25:33,099
Get an oar under it!

2234
02:25:34,226 --> 02:25:36,437
Women and children only, damn you!

2235
02:25:36,645 --> 02:25:38,772
Hold it! Hold it!

2236
02:25:38,939 --> 02:25:40,232
Hold it!

2237
02:25:51,076 --> 02:25:53,412
Get these davits cranked in!

2238
02:25:53,579 --> 02:25:55,122
And get the falls hooked up!

2239
02:25:55,956 --> 02:25:57,082
Oh!

2240
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:05,341
Stay back!

2241
02:26:07,426 --> 02:26:09,345
Mommy!

2242
02:26:12,264 --> 02:26:13,682
Stay back, I say!

2243
02:26:15,809 --> 02:26:16,810
Keep going up!

2244
02:26:20,022 --> 02:26:21,190
Stop pushing!

2245
02:26:23,859 --> 02:26:25,277
Stay back!

2246
02:26:25,361 --> 02:26:28,029
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

2247
02:26:28,113 --> 02:26:30,657
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

2248
02:26:30,741 --> 02:26:31,742
Bastard!

2249
02:26:32,076 --> 02:26:33,243
Get back!

2250
02:26:33,994 --> 02:26:35,194
We had a deal, damn you!

2251
02:26:36,956 --> 02:26:37,914
Any more women and children?

2252
02:26:37,998 --> 02:26:42,002
Your money can't save you
any more than it could me. Get back!

2253
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:45,589
Women and children only!

2254
02:26:52,221 --> 02:26:53,555
Tommy!

2255
02:26:53,639 --> 02:26:55,182
No, no! No, Tommy!

2256
02:27:01,230 --> 02:27:02,231
Oh, no!

2257
02:27:14,785 --> 02:27:15,744
No, Will!

2258
02:27:22,584 --> 02:27:24,044
Now stand back, damn you!

2259
02:27:24,795 --> 02:27:25,796
God damn you!

2260
02:27:27,548 --> 02:27:30,134
Gently! Hold it.
Hold it, hold it!

2261
02:27:40,811 --> 02:27:41,854
I have a child!

2262
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:44,690
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

2263
02:27:45,315 --> 02:27:46,567
Please, I have a child!

2264
02:27:48,110 --> 02:27:50,571
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

2265
02:27:51,488 --> 02:27:52,781
Go on.

2266
02:27:52,948 --> 02:27:54,950
- Step back! Step back, I say!
- Please?

2267
02:27:55,117 --> 02:27:56,660
Here. Give her to me.

2268
02:27:56,827 --> 02:27:58,077
You're all right, dearie.

2269
02:28:00,831 --> 02:28:01,915
Give her here.

2270
02:28:03,959 --> 02:28:04,960
There, there.

2271
02:28:09,381 --> 02:28:10,799
Wait, wait, wait!

2272
02:28:10,966 --> 02:28:12,176
Mr. Andrews!

2273
02:28:14,595 --> 02:28:15,596
Oh, Rose.

2274
02:28:18,724 --> 02:28:20,374
Won't you even make a try for it?

2275
02:28:22,019 --> 02:28:25,981
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

2276
02:28:28,442 --> 02:28:30,360
It's going fast. We have to move.

2277
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:31,987
Wait.

2278
02:28:35,115 --> 02:28:36,408
Good luck to you, Rose.

2279
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:39,661
And to you.

2280
02:28:52,424 --> 02:28:53,425
Mr. Guggenheim?

2281
02:28:54,009 --> 02:28:55,135
These are for you,
Mr. Guggenheim.

2282
02:28:55,219 --> 02:28:56,303
No, thank you.

2283
02:28:56,470 --> 02:28:57,846
We are dressed in our best

2284
02:28:57,930 --> 02:28:59,980
and are prepared to go down as gentlemen.

2285
02:29:01,475 --> 02:29:03,185
But we would like a brandy.

2286
02:29:04,228 --> 02:29:05,771
Get the falls over here now!

2287
02:29:07,022 --> 02:29:09,191
Let them drop.
Then we'll right it.

2288
02:29:16,907 --> 02:29:18,700
Where should I go? Please.

2289
02:29:24,498 --> 02:29:25,457
Captain.

2290
02:29:26,166 --> 02:29:27,709
Captain. Sir.

2291
02:29:58,657 --> 02:30:00,075
Right. That's it, then.

2292
02:30:01,743 --> 02:30:03,043
Goodbye, Wally. Good luck.

2293
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:06,029
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

2294
02:31:20,656 --> 02:31:24,743
And so they lived happily together
for 300 years...

2295
02:31:25,494 --> 02:31:27,162
in the land of Tír na nÓg...

2296
02:31:28,580 --> 02:31:30,707
land of eternal youth and beauty.

2297
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:09,621
There's no time! Cut those falls!

2298
02:32:09,705 --> 02:32:11,957
Cut 'em! Cut 'em if you have to!

2299
02:32:12,916 --> 02:32:15,210
I need a knife! I need a knife!

2300
02:32:17,004 --> 02:32:18,588
Bloody cut the falls now!

2301
02:32:19,298 --> 02:32:20,257
Cut 'em loose!

2302
02:32:29,182 --> 02:32:30,517
Cut the falls!

2303
02:32:31,184 --> 02:32:33,145
Cut those bloody falls!

2304
02:32:38,025 --> 02:32:39,026
Here.

2305
02:32:50,662 --> 02:32:51,747
Now!

2306
02:33:20,942 --> 02:33:21,943
Gentlemen...

2307
02:33:22,694 --> 02:33:25,094
it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

2308
02:34:25,882 --> 02:34:28,682
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible. Come on.

2309
02:34:41,148 --> 02:34:42,983
This way.
Through the rail.

2310
02:34:44,985 --> 02:34:46,403
Come on, Rose.

2311
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:47,571
Jump.

2312
02:34:49,197 --> 02:34:50,574
Come on, come on.

2313
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:55,495
Help! Help us!

2314
02:35:24,357 --> 02:35:25,734
I got you. Jump.

2315
02:35:28,737 --> 02:35:29,863
I've got you, miss.

2316
02:35:31,198 --> 02:35:32,282
- Jack!
- Come on.

2317
02:35:34,075 --> 02:35:35,827
- Back!
- Help me!

2318
02:35:38,872 --> 02:35:39,831
Give me your hand.

2319
02:36:01,311 --> 02:36:02,395
Hang on, sailor.

2320
02:36:05,815 --> 02:36:07,317
No! You'll swamp us.

2321
02:36:17,911 --> 02:36:18,912
Move.

2322
02:36:20,038 --> 02:36:22,415
"Yea, though I walk through the valley

2323
02:36:22,499 --> 02:36:23,666
"of the shadow of death,
I will fear no..."

2324
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:26,550
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

2325
02:36:49,234 --> 02:36:50,235
Row!

2326
02:36:51,027 --> 02:36:52,028
Pull together!

2327
02:36:54,322 --> 02:36:55,991
Jump down, swim to the boats!

2328
02:37:16,469 --> 02:37:17,846
Holy Mary, mother of God...

2329
02:37:18,096 --> 02:37:19,263
pray for us sinners now

2330
02:37:19,347 --> 02:37:21,224
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

2331
02:37:21,975 --> 02:37:23,601
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
- This way.

2332
02:37:23,685 --> 02:37:25,735
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou...

2333
02:37:34,654 --> 02:37:36,364
Come on. Come on.

2334
02:37:46,207 --> 02:37:48,460
"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth...

2335
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:51,796
"when the first heaven and
first earth had passed away...

2336
02:37:53,673 --> 02:37:55,091
"and there was no more sea."

2337
02:37:59,054 --> 02:38:00,055
Where are you?

2338
02:38:00,889 --> 02:38:02,557
- Help me!
- It'll be over soon.

2339
02:38:03,516 --> 02:38:05,142
It'll all be over soon.

2340
02:38:05,226 --> 02:38:07,395
"And I heard a voice suddenly...

2341
02:38:07,479 --> 02:38:10,440
"Behold, the tabernacle
of God is with man,

2342
02:38:10,607 --> 02:38:14,152
"and He shall dwell with them
and they shall be His people

2343
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:16,362
"and God Himself shall be with them

2344
02:38:16,446 --> 02:38:17,781
"and be their God."

2345
02:38:18,990 --> 02:38:20,408
Jack.

2346
02:38:21,076 --> 02:38:22,494
This is where we first met.

2347
02:38:29,876 --> 02:38:32,676
"And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

2348
02:38:33,630 --> 02:38:35,632
"and there shall be no more death.

2349
02:38:36,383 --> 02:38:38,676
"Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

2350
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:41,012
"Neither shall there be any more pain...

2351
02:38:42,514 --> 02:38:45,642
"for the former world
has passed away."

2352
02:38:59,698 --> 02:39:02,033
Bloody pull faster and pull.

2353
02:39:06,913 --> 02:39:07,956
Help me!

2354
02:39:25,181 --> 02:39:26,766
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

2355
02:39:55,837 --> 02:39:58,673
Help me. Please, save me.

2356
02:40:01,551 --> 02:40:03,470
- Help!
- Hold on real tight.

2357
02:40:04,095 --> 02:40:05,388
Help me, please!

2358
02:40:21,654 --> 02:40:22,906
God Almighty.

2359
02:40:30,663 --> 02:40:33,291
Keep those breakers in. Keep them in!

2360
02:41:52,328 --> 02:41:53,496
We have to move.

2361
02:41:59,711 --> 02:42:00,711
Give me your hand.

2362
02:42:00,795 --> 02:42:01,837
- I'll pull you over.
- I can't.

2363
02:42:01,921 --> 02:42:04,171
Come on. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

2364
02:42:06,217 --> 02:42:08,052
I've got you. I won't let go.

2365
02:42:08,678 --> 02:42:09,778
Come on, I've got you.

2366
02:42:20,899 --> 02:42:22,650
What's happening, Jack?

2367
02:42:22,817 --> 02:42:24,235
I don't know.
I don't know.

2368
02:42:33,244 --> 02:42:35,330
- Hold on. Come on, Rose.
- Jack!

2369
02:42:36,623 --> 02:42:38,207
Help me, please!

2370
02:42:38,291 --> 02:42:39,918
Someone, help me, please!

2371
02:43:02,815 --> 02:43:04,400
Help! Help, help!

2372
02:43:04,484 --> 02:43:05,860
Help!

2373
02:43:16,496 --> 02:43:18,039
This is it.

2374
02:43:30,635 --> 02:43:32,553
Oh, my God, Jack. Oh, God.

2375
02:43:33,054 --> 02:43:35,098
- Oh, God.
- Hold on!

2376
02:43:35,807 --> 02:43:37,684
Oh, God. Oh.

2377
02:43:50,363 --> 02:43:51,913
The ship is gonna suck us down.

2378
02:43:52,991 --> 02:43:54,617
Take a deep breath when I say.

2379
02:44:00,248 --> 02:44:02,207
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

2380
02:44:02,291 --> 02:44:04,335
Do not let go of my hand.

2381
02:44:06,337 --> 02:44:07,338
No!

2382
02:44:08,047 --> 02:44:09,048
No!

2383
02:44:11,342 --> 02:44:12,760
We're gonna make it, Rose.

2384
02:44:13,136 --> 02:44:14,178
Trust me.

2385
02:44:14,345 --> 02:44:15,346
I trust you!

2386
02:44:20,351 --> 02:44:21,978
Ready! Ready!

2387
02:44:22,770 --> 02:44:23,771
Now!

2388
02:45:00,475 --> 02:45:02,101
Jack! Jack!

2389
02:45:02,977 --> 02:45:04,020
Jack!

2390
02:45:04,353 --> 02:45:05,605
Help me! Help!

2391
02:45:06,439 --> 02:45:07,398
Jack!

2392
02:45:12,403 --> 02:45:14,322
Jack! Jack!

2393
02:45:16,157 --> 02:45:17,158
Jack!

2394
02:45:18,034 --> 02:45:19,160
Jack!

2395
02:45:33,966 --> 02:45:35,384
Jack! Jack!

2396
02:45:40,181 --> 02:45:41,182
No!

2397
02:45:43,392 --> 02:45:44,393
Jack!

2398
02:45:45,186 --> 02:45:46,187
Rose!

2399
02:45:46,354 --> 02:45:47,396
Get off her!

2400
02:45:47,563 --> 02:45:48,940
Get off her!

2401
02:45:52,026 --> 02:45:53,736
- Rose.
- Jack.

2402
02:45:53,820 --> 02:45:55,320
Swim, Rose.
I need you to swim.

2403
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:00,701
Keep swimming.

2404
02:46:05,498 --> 02:46:07,166
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose.

2405
02:46:12,672 --> 02:46:13,673
Come on.

2406
02:46:14,048 --> 02:46:15,049
Here.

2407
02:46:15,925 --> 02:46:16,884
Keep swimming.

2408
02:46:16,968 --> 02:46:18,553
Come on.

2409
02:46:20,596 --> 02:46:22,140
Here, get on it.

2410
02:46:23,641 --> 02:46:24,725
Get on top.

2411
02:46:32,483 --> 02:46:33,526
Come on, Rose.

2412
02:46:43,578 --> 02:46:45,329
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

2413
02:46:45,872 --> 02:46:46,831
Jack.

2414
02:46:53,713 --> 02:46:54,714
No.

2415
02:47:07,059 --> 02:47:08,209
It'll be all right now.

2416
02:47:11,063 --> 02:47:12,147
It'll be all right now.

2417
02:47:12,231 --> 02:47:13,316
Oh, God!

2418
02:47:20,031 --> 02:47:21,282
Return...

2419
02:47:21,532 --> 02:47:22,825
the boats!

2420
02:47:27,121 --> 02:47:29,071
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.

2421
02:47:29,916 --> 02:47:31,566
Hold on just a little bit longer.

2422
02:47:32,043 --> 02:47:33,211
Return the boats!

2423
02:47:33,586 --> 02:47:37,131
They had to row away for the suction,
but now they'll be coming back.

2424
02:47:40,134 --> 02:47:41,426
For God's sake!

2425
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:43,346
- Help us!
- Please!

2426
02:47:43,512 --> 02:47:44,764
Help us!

2427
02:47:46,182 --> 02:47:47,266
Come back!

2428
02:47:50,102 --> 02:47:51,395
You don't understand.

2429
02:47:52,605 --> 02:47:54,732
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.

2430
02:47:54,899 --> 02:47:56,775
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

2431
02:47:56,859 --> 02:47:59,445
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

2432
02:47:59,612 --> 02:48:02,406
Come on, girls.
Grab an oar. Let's go.

2433
02:48:02,573 --> 02:48:03,949
Are you out of your mind?

2434
02:48:04,033 --> 02:48:05,951
We're in the middle
of the North Atlantic.

2435
02:48:06,035 --> 02:48:08,685
Now, do you people want
to live or do you want to die?

2436
02:48:16,295 --> 02:48:17,895
I don't understand a one of you.

2437
02:48:20,299 --> 02:48:21,676
What's the matter with you?

2438
02:48:21,842 --> 02:48:23,594
It's your men out there.

2439
02:48:26,347 --> 02:48:28,015
There's plenty of room for more.

2440
02:48:28,182 --> 02:48:30,032
And there'll be one less on this boat

2441
02:48:30,226 --> 02:48:33,604
if you don't shut that hole in your face!

2442
02:48:47,410 --> 02:48:49,161
Here, take this rope.

2443
02:48:49,328 --> 02:48:51,038
Now, bring in your oars over there.

2444
02:48:51,122 --> 02:48:53,172
And tie these two boats together as well.

2445
02:48:57,878 --> 02:49:00,028
Now make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

2446
02:49:03,968 --> 02:49:06,595
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

2447
02:49:06,679 --> 02:49:08,055
I wanna transfer all the women

2448
02:49:08,139 --> 02:49:09,973
from this boat into that boat right now.

2449
02:49:10,057 --> 02:49:11,559
As quick as you can, please.

2450
02:49:11,726 --> 02:49:13,101
Let's create some space over there.

2451
02:49:13,185 --> 02:49:14,235
Move forward and aft.

2452
02:49:24,238 --> 02:49:25,364
It's getting quiet.

2453
02:49:28,242 --> 02:49:30,619
It's just gonna take
a couple of minutes...

2454
02:49:32,079 --> 02:49:33,429
to get the boats organized.

2455
02:49:36,834 --> 02:49:38,084
I don't know about you...

2456
02:49:38,794 --> 02:49:39,962
but I intend to...

2457
02:49:40,379 --> 02:49:42,548
write a strongly worded letter...

2458
02:49:42,882 --> 02:49:45,718
to the White Star Line about all this.

2459
02:49:52,641 --> 02:49:53,809
I love you, Jack.

2460
02:50:01,025 --> 02:50:02,109
Don't you do that.

2461
02:50:04,028 --> 02:50:05,529
Don't you say your goodbyes.

2462
02:50:06,197 --> 02:50:07,198
Not yet.

2463
02:50:07,365 --> 02:50:08,783
Do you understand me?

2464
02:50:09,533 --> 02:50:10,701
I'm so cold.

2465
02:50:11,786 --> 02:50:12,828
Listen, Rose.

2466
02:50:14,330 --> 02:50:15,780
You're gonna get out of here.

2467
02:50:17,124 --> 02:50:18,174
You're gonna go on...

2468
02:50:19,835 --> 02:50:21,796
and you're gonna make lots of babies...

2469
02:50:22,671 --> 02:50:24,321
and you're gonna watch them grow.

2470
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:28,928
You're gonna die an old lady

2471
02:50:29,095 --> 02:50:30,179
warm in her bed.

2472
02:50:32,515 --> 02:50:33,516
Not here.

2473
02:50:34,392 --> 02:50:35,393
Not this night.

2474
02:50:36,268 --> 02:50:38,270
Not like this.
Do you understand me?

2475
02:50:42,024 --> 02:50:43,567
I can't feel my body.

2476
02:50:45,861 --> 02:50:47,029
Winning that ticket, Rose,

2477
02:50:47,113 --> 02:50:49,263
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

2478
02:50:51,575 --> 02:50:52,743
It brought me to you.

2479
02:50:55,246 --> 02:50:56,956
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2480
02:50:58,040 --> 02:50:59,166
I'm thankful.

2481
02:51:05,297 --> 02:51:06,674
You must do me this honor.

2482
02:51:10,261 --> 02:51:13,013
You must promise me that you'll survive.

2483
02:51:14,598 --> 02:51:17,017
That you won't give up...

2484
02:51:18,394 --> 02:51:19,895
no matter what happens.

2485
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:24,692
No matter how hopeless.

2486
02:51:28,737 --> 02:51:30,114
Promise me, now, Rose.

2487
02:51:33,033 --> 02:51:34,702
And never let go of that promise.

2488
02:51:37,079 --> 02:51:38,122
I promise.

2489
02:51:40,583 --> 02:51:41,667
Never let go.

2490
02:51:45,004 --> 02:51:46,380
I will never let go, Jack.

2491
02:51:49,884 --> 02:51:51,010
I'll never let go.

2492
02:52:15,618 --> 02:52:16,619
Right ahead, sir.

2493
02:52:20,289 --> 02:52:21,332
Oars!

2494
02:52:22,208 --> 02:52:23,417
Do you see any moving?

2495
02:52:24,919 --> 02:52:26,879
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2496
02:52:27,463 --> 02:52:28,506
Check them.

2497
02:52:29,173 --> 02:52:30,323
Bring that oar up here.

2498
02:52:37,264 --> 02:52:38,557
Check them. Make sure.

2499
02:52:39,558 --> 02:52:40,809
These are dead, sir.

2500
02:52:41,602 --> 02:52:43,979
Now, give way. Ahead easy.

2501
02:52:51,278 --> 02:52:53,948
Careful with your oars. Don't hit them.

2502
02:52:56,867 --> 02:52:58,536
Is there anyone alive out there?

2503
02:53:00,788 --> 02:53:02,039
Can anyone hear me?

2504
02:53:04,833 --> 02:53:06,544
Is there anyone alive out there?

2505
02:53:13,634 --> 02:53:15,219
We waited too long.

2506
02:53:19,682 --> 02:53:21,809
Well, keep checking them!
Keep looking!

2507
02:53:23,602 --> 02:53:25,813
Is there anyone alive out there?

2508
02:53:29,567 --> 02:53:31,151
Can anyone hear me?

2509
02:53:42,288 --> 02:53:45,165
<i>Come, Josephine</i>

2510
02:53:45,499 --> 02:53:50,379
<i>In my flying machine</i>

2511
02:53:51,714 --> 02:53:54,675
<i>And as up she goes</i>

2512
02:53:57,011 --> 02:53:59,388
<i>Up she goes</i>

2513
02:54:04,310 --> 02:54:06,604
<i>Come, Josephine</i>

2514
02:54:09,148 --> 02:54:11,525
<i>In my flying</i>

2515
02:54:30,544 --> 02:54:32,087
Can anyone hear me?

2516
02:54:35,507 --> 02:54:36,508
Jack.

2517
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:42,681
Jack.

2518
02:54:45,643 --> 02:54:46,644
Jack.

2519
02:54:54,693 --> 02:54:55,694
Jack.

2520
02:54:56,445 --> 02:54:57,446
There's a boat.

2521
02:54:58,364 --> 02:54:59,365
Jack.

2522
02:55:10,876 --> 02:55:11,877
Jack.

2523
02:55:13,087 --> 02:55:14,088
Jack.

2524
02:55:16,173 --> 02:55:17,174
Jack!

2525
02:55:20,844 --> 02:55:21,845
Jack.

2526
02:55:24,807 --> 02:55:26,266
There's a boat, Jack.

2527
02:55:29,561 --> 02:55:30,562
Jack.

2528
02:56:10,519 --> 02:56:11,520
Come back.

2529
02:56:13,063 --> 02:56:15,190
- Come back.
- Can anyone hear me?

2530
02:56:16,567 --> 02:56:17,568
Come back.

2531
02:56:19,445 --> 02:56:20,779
Come back.

2532
02:56:21,530 --> 02:56:23,657
Come back.

2533
02:56:23,866 --> 02:56:25,868
Come back. Come back.

2534
02:56:27,619 --> 02:56:29,413
Hello!

2535
02:56:30,789 --> 02:56:32,833
Can anyone hear me?

2536
02:56:33,709 --> 02:56:35,009
There's nothing here, sir.

2537
02:56:37,713 --> 02:56:40,007
- Come back.
- Can anyone hear me?

2538
02:56:40,716 --> 02:56:41,717
Come back.

2539
02:56:49,767 --> 02:56:51,268
I'll never let go.

2540
02:56:51,435 --> 02:56:52,478
I promise.

2541
02:57:36,271 --> 02:57:37,773
Come about!

2542
02:57:59,127 --> 02:58:02,422
Fifteen-hundred people
went into the sea...

2543
02:58:03,423 --> 02:58:05,926
when <i>Titanic</i> sank from under us.

2544
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:10,848
There were 20 boats floating nearby...

2545
02:58:12,432 --> 02:58:14,309
and only one came back.

2546
02:58:16,687 --> 02:58:17,688
One.

2547
02:58:19,565 --> 02:58:21,608
Six were saved from the water...

2548
02:58:22,442 --> 02:58:23,777
myself included.

2549
02:58:25,279 --> 02:58:26,280
Six...

2550
02:58:27,739 --> 02:58:29,908
out of 1,500.

2551
02:58:33,203 --> 02:58:34,288
Afterward...

2552
02:58:35,539 --> 02:58:39,960
the 700 people in the boats
had nothing to do but wait.

2553
02:58:42,254 --> 02:58:43,672
Wait to die...

2554
02:58:44,381 --> 02:58:45,424
wait to live.

2555
02:58:47,050 --> 02:58:48,552
Wait for an absolution...

2556
02:58:49,553 --> 02:58:50,888
that would never come.

2557
02:59:55,911 --> 02:59:58,162
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2558
02:59:58,246 --> 02:59:59,456
It's all steerage.

2559
03:00:02,292 --> 03:00:04,711
His hair is reddish brown, reddish brown.

2560
03:00:04,878 --> 03:00:06,254
Reddish brown and a white beard.

2561
03:00:06,338 --> 03:00:07,505
Calm down, it's all right.

2562
03:00:07,589 --> 03:00:09,716
Isn't there another passenger list?

2563
03:00:09,883 --> 03:00:12,594
- There's no other list.
- Perhaps he's on another ship.

2564
03:00:12,678 --> 03:00:14,429
We're doing all we can, ma'am.

2565
03:00:14,638 --> 03:00:16,688
There's got to be another passenger list.

2566
03:00:38,161 --> 03:00:40,163
<i>That's the last time I ever saw him.</i>

2567
03:00:41,081 --> 03:00:44,084
<i>He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.</i>

2568
03:00:45,335 --> 03:00:48,755
<i>But the Crash of '29
hit his interests hard.</i>

2569
03:00:49,256 --> 03:00:51,550
<i>And he put a pistol
in his mouth that year.</i>

2570
03:00:52,259 --> 03:00:53,468
Or so I read.

2571
03:01:06,857 --> 03:01:08,607
Can I take your name, please, love?

2572
03:01:11,403 --> 03:01:12,404
Dawson.

2573
03:01:14,823 --> 03:01:15,907
Rose Dawson.

2574
03:01:17,576 --> 03:01:18,577
Thank you.

2575
03:01:25,792 --> 03:01:27,502
We never found anything on Jack.

2576
03:01:28,086 --> 03:01:29,963
There's no record of him at all.

2577
03:01:30,589 --> 03:01:32,339
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2578
03:01:33,341 --> 03:01:35,761
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2579
03:01:36,803 --> 03:01:37,971
Not to anyone.

2580
03:01:38,972 --> 03:01:41,099
Not even your grandfather.

2581
03:01:41,266 --> 03:01:44,811
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

2582
03:01:45,812 --> 03:01:49,357
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2583
03:01:50,233 --> 03:01:52,277
and that he saved me

2584
03:01:52,444 --> 03:01:55,155
in every way that a person can be saved.

2585
03:01:57,824 --> 03:01:59,910
I don't even have a picture of him.

2586
03:02:03,038 --> 03:02:06,708
He exists now only in my memory.

2587
03:02:11,671 --> 03:02:14,633
Keldysh, Keldysh,
<i>Mir Two on our way to the surface.</i>

2588
03:02:31,733 --> 03:02:32,734
<i>You know, I was saving this</i>

2589
03:02:32,818 --> 03:02:34,444
<i>for when I found the diamond.</i>

2590
03:02:43,912 --> 03:02:44,955
I'm sorry.

2591
03:02:48,208 --> 03:02:49,376
Three years...

2592
03:02:50,210 --> 03:02:52,295
I've thought of nothing except <i>Titanic.</i>

2593
03:02:53,755 --> 03:02:55,006
But I never got it.

2594
03:02:58,677 --> 03:02:59,845
I never let it in.

2595
03:04:33,355 --> 03:04:34,481
Ha!

2596
03:07:35,286 --> 03:07:39,415
<i>Every night in my dreams</i>

2597
03:07:39,499 --> 03:07:44,837
<i>I see you, I feel you</i>

2598
03:07:44,921 --> 03:07:51,302
<i>That is how I know you go on</i>

2599
03:07:54,639 --> 03:07:59,018
<i>Far across the distance</i>

2600
03:07:59,102 --> 03:08:04,231
<i>And spaces between us</i>

2601
03:08:04,315 --> 03:08:10,697
<i>You have come to show you go on</i>

2602
03:08:13,950 --> 03:08:18,204
<i>Near, far</i>

2603
03:08:18,288 --> 03:08:22,500
<i>Wherever you are</i>

2604
03:08:22,584 --> 03:08:25,836
<i>I believe that</i>

2605
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:32,218
<i>The heart does go on</i>

2606
03:08:33,511 --> 03:08:37,598
<i>Once more</i>

2607
03:08:37,682 --> 03:08:41,936
<i>You open the door</i>

2608
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:47,149
<i>And you're here in my heart</i>

2609
03:08:47,233 --> 03:08:54,115
<i>And my heart will go on and on</i>

2610
03:08:55,241 --> 03:08:59,495
<i>Love can touch us one time</i>

2611
03:08:59,579 --> 03:09:04,917
<i>And last for a lifetime</i>

2612
03:09:05,001 --> 03:09:11,674
<i>And never let go 'til we're gone</i>

2613
03:09:14,636 --> 03:09:18,848
<i>Love was when I loved you</i>

2614
03:09:18,932 --> 03:09:24,311
<i>One true time I hold to</i>

2615
03:09:24,395 --> 03:09:31,069
<i>In my life we'll always go on</i>

2616
03:09:33,947 --> 03:09:38,200
<i>Near, far</i>

2617
03:09:38,284 --> 03:09:42,496
<i>Wherever you are</i>

2618
03:09:42,580 --> 03:09:45,833
<i>I believe that</i>

2619
03:09:45,917 --> 03:09:52,257
<i>The heart does go on</i>

2620
03:09:53,508 --> 03:09:57,636
<i>Once more</i>

2621
03:09:57,720 --> 03:10:01,974
<i>You open the door</i>

2622
03:10:02,058 --> 03:10:07,188
<i>And you're here in my heart</i>

2623
03:10:07,272 --> 03:10:14,112
<i>And my heart will go on and on</i>

2624
03:10:32,463 --> 03:10:36,759
<i>You're here</i>

2625
03:10:36,843 --> 03:10:41,055
<i>There's nothing I fear</i>

2626
03:10:41,139 --> 03:10:43,557
<i>And I know</i>

2627
03:10:43,641 --> 03:10:50,189
<i>That my heart will go on</i>

2628
03:10:52,317 --> 03:10:56,487
<i>We'll stay</i>

2629
03:10:56,571 --> 03:11:00,991
<i>Forever this way</i>

2630
03:11:01,075 --> 03:11:05,412
<i>You are safe in my heart</i>

2631
03:11:05,496 --> 03:11:11,001
<i>And my heart will go on</i>

2632
03:11:11,085 --> 03:11:15,673
<i>And on</i>
