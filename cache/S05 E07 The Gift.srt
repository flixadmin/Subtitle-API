1
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,934
You have command of castle black.

2
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,395
It is my duty to tell you

3
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,940
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

4
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,944
and an insult to all the brothers
who have died fighting the wildlings.

5
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,030
Thank you for your honesty.

6
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,206
Safe travels.

7
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,458
Thank you, Sam.

8
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,168
Oh, um...

9
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,426
It's dragonglass.

10
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,314
It's what I used to kill the white Walker.

11
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,977
I hope you don't need them.

12
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,229
Me, too.

13
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,639
There he is.

14
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,895
That laugh.

15
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,775
Egg laughed like that.

16
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,612
One of the first things I remember.

17
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,619
His little brother, aegon. He became king.

18
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,458
And before that, he was a jolly fellow,

19
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,210
like this one.

20
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,384
Get him south, gillyrower.

21
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,972
Before it's too late.

22
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,400
Theon, wait.

23
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,735
Not theon. Reek.

24
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,612
Help me.

25
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,449
You're his wife now.

26
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,660
Theon.

27
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,120
Do what he says,

28
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,788
or he'll hurt you.

29
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,874
He already hurts me every night.

30
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,586
All day I'm locked in this room,
and every night he comes...

31
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,090
It can't be any worse.

32
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,174
Itcan.

33
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,011
It can always be worse.

34
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,897
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

35
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,733
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry!

36
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,027
You have to help me.

37
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,279
He'll see us. You don't know him.

38
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,133
My family still has friends in the north.

39
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,784
All I need to do is give a signal,
and they'll rescue me.

40
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,287
Climb to the top of the broken tower.

41
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,831
Light this candle, and
put it in the window.

42
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,792
- Promise me, theon.
- My name is reek.

43
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,089
Your name is theon greyjoy.

44
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,345
Last surviving son of balon greyjoy,
lord of the iron islands.

45
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,930
Do you hear me?

46
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,184
Theon.

47
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,395
Promise me.

48
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,293
Yes, reek?

49
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,894
Aemon: Egg.

50
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,444
Mother's looking for you.

51
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,367
Get some sleep, Sam.

52
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,704
You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

53
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,249
You don't know that.

54
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,625
Get some sleep.

55
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,420
I'll watch over him.

56
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,050
Samwell: I'm staying, too.

57
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,136
He's always been good to me.

58
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,888
I can't leave him now.

59
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,640
Aemon: Egg!

60
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,737
E99,

61
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,449
I dreamed

62
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,285
that I was old.

63
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,174
Samwell: His name was aemon Targaryen.

64
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,177
He came to us from king's landing.

65
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,682
A maester of the citadel,
chained and sworn,

66
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,852
and sworn brother of the night's watch,
ever faithful.

67
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:10,151
No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder.

68
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,987
At the wall,

69
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,075
a dozen lord commanders
came and went during his years of service,

70
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,119
but he was always there to counsel them.

71
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,290
He was the blood of the dragon,

72
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,211
but now his fire has gone out.

73
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,966
And now his watch is ended.

74
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,468
All: And now his watch is ended.

75
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,666
You're losing all your friends, tarly.

76
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,914
My beautiful wife.

77
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,758
When my father told me we were marrying,
I half expected a fat, bearded beast.

78
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,390
Do you know how pleased I was
when I saw you?

79
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,976
You've made me very happy.

80
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,943
Our scouts report that Stannis
Baratheon rides for winterfell.

81
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,778
He's a respected commander.

82
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,324
His troops are loyal and battle-tested.

83
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,869
He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords
to bolster his army.

84
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,790
But this storm is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

85
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,710
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

86
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,507
His army is out there now,
suffering in the snow.

87
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,845
One day I'll be lord of winterfell
and warden of the north.

88
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,266
You'll be my lady and wardeness.

89
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,521
But isn't your stepmother pregnant?

90
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,147
What of it?

91
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,401
What happens if she has a boy?

92
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,737
Then I'll have a baby brother.

93
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,239
But he'll be the heir.

94
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,283
I'm lord Bolton's eldest son.

95
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,118
But you're a bastard.

96
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,537
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

97
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,459
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from...

98
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,836
Tommen Baratheon?

99
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,713
Another bastard.

100
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,222
Bastards can rise high in the world.

101
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,851
Like your half-brother, Jon snow.

102
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,729
Born the bastard of winterfell,

103
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,399
now the lord commander
of the night's watch.

104
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,361
You didn't know?

105
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,448
Yes, he's done very well for himself.

106
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,161
I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.

107
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,996
Come, my lady.

108
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,134
Ramsay: Your northern friend.

109
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,598
Reek told me you wanted to leave.

110
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,728
Winterfell is your home,
and I am your husband.

111
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,481
Tough old bird.

112
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,442
Everyone talks when I start peeling them.

113
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,943
But this one,

114
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,405
her heart gave out
before I even got to her face.

115
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,660
We do breed them tough in the north.

116
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,127
Bring my wife back to her chamber.

117
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,963
It's far too cold out here for a lady.

118
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,050
You should hold on to your candles.

119
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,178
The nights are so long now.

120
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,230
Davos: Forty horses died in the night.

121
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,275
We'll lose more come sunset.

122
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,818
We're running out of food.

123
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,529
We can't open the supply line
until the snow clears.

124
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:52,994
What else?

125
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,872
The stormcrows rode off last night.

126
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,918
Five hundred men.

127
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,465
Sellswords.

128
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,718
Loyal to nothing but gold.

129
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,724
We still have a hard march to winterfell,

130
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,767
and we won't be marching anywhere
in this weather.

131
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,311
And?

132
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,896
This isn't our time.

133
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,483
We should head back to castle black
when the snow clears.

134
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,902
I retreated from king's landing.

135
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,405
If I retreat again,
I'll become the king who ran.

136
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,616
- Your grace...
- Winter is coming.

137
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,827
Those aren'tjust the
stark words. It's a fact.

138
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,707
If we march back to castle black,
we winter at castle black.

139
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,628
And who can say how many years
this winter will last?

140
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,689
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

141
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,049
This is the right time,
and I will risk everything.

142
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,510
Because if I don't, we've lost.

143
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:56,766
We march to victory, or we march to defeat,

144
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,936
but we go fonnard. Only fon/vard.

145
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,280
Your grace.

146
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,121
I've trusted in your visions,

147
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,958
in your prophecies for years.

148
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,920
You saw it yourself,
when you stared into the flames.

149
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,256
A great battle in the snow.

150
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,216
- I don't know what I saw.
- You do know.

151
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,592
Trust yourself.

152
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,803
And you? Do you trust yourself?

153
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,138
I trust in the lord.

154
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,309
Are you sure?

155
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,986
I have seen myself
walk along the battlements of winterfell.

156
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,323
I have seen the flayed man banners
lowered to the ground.

157
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,128
But sometimes sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

158
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,716
I have shown you the power of king's blood.

159
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,135
The usurper, robb stark.

160
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,429
The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon.

161
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,848
We don't have Robert's bastard here.

162
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,892
We have someone better,

163
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,314
and your blood runs through her veins.

164
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,026
Have you lost your mind?

165
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,694
Do you doubt me?

166
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,404
Still?

167
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,865
After all that you've seen.

168
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,908
There must be another way.

169
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,411
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

170
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,664
You must become king
before the long night begins.

171
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,417
Only you can lead the
living against the dead.

172
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,295
All your life has led us to this moment.

173
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,756
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

174
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,635
Get out.

175
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,336
Man 1: There's always some sort of grub on.

176
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,994
Man 2: A bit of mutton would be nice.

177
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,584
Man 1: A beauty from beyond the wall.

178
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,771
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?

179
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,841
No, the question is, "is she
pretty down south in the real world,

180
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,925
"or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?"

181
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,804
Even in white harbor, I'd want a kiss.

182
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,682
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

183
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,808
Leave me alone.

184
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,827
Man 1: Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

185
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,496
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

186
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,146
A man gets lonely guarding the wall.

187
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,611
There's no need to be rude.

188
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,279
We just want a little affection.

189
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,656
Ooh.

190
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,785
Get your hands off her.

191
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,455
Brother Derek, brother brant,

192
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,509
I believe you both have guard duty tonight.

193
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,167
Sam the slayer.

194
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,836
You gonna slay me with that sword?

195
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,337
Brant: Look at his hand shake.

196
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
Gilly, go on.

197
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,466
Get back to your room, lock the door.

198
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,055
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

199
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,140
Come on.

200
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,981
You lying sack of shit.

201
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,400
Killed a white Walker, eh?

202
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,693
You fat-ass fuck.

203
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,695
Come on, get up.

204
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,031
- Gilly: No!
- This your hero? This hog?

205
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,825
Leave him alone!

206
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,620
Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you?

207
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,082
- Come on!
- Gilly: No!

208
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,878
- Sam!
- Come on!

209
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,764
Gilly: Sam! Derek: Come on.

210
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,087
Brant: Right.

211
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,392
Derek: Hold still.

212
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,040
Derek: Turn her over.
Brant: All right.

213
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,694
I said, get your hands off her.

214
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,338
Brant: You're gonna get yourself killed.

215
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,782
Your lover Jon snow's not here to save you.

216
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,451
I killed a white Walker, I killed a thenn.

217
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,162
I'll take my chances with you.

218
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,434
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

219
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,728
Just a bit woozy.

220
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,464
The next time you see something like that,
you leave it alone.

221
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,342
I will not. They would have...

222
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,556
I don't know what they would have done.

223
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,975
I know they would have killed you
if ghost hadn't come.

224
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,228
No. They were tiring out.

225
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,939
I had them in the palm of my hand.

226
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:42,403
Don't be stupid. You're not a fighter.

227
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,738
What kind of man would I be

228
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,782
if I ran away
when I saw someone hurting you?

229
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,910
Just promise me,

230
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,788
whatever happens,
you'll take care of little Sam.

231
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,707
But of course I will.

232
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,584
And

233
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,587
I'll take care of you, too.

234
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,803
I need more water.

235
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,808
Stay.

236
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,769
Please.

237
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,456
Am I hurting you?

238
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:22,836
Are you sure?

239
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,660
Oh, my!

240
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,763
Malko: A rare find for the fighting pits,
my friend.

241
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,434
Not your usual street
tough or drunken pirate.

242
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,770
This one's a westerosi knight

243
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,191
from an ancient house
trained in sword and Lance.

244
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:31,071
He fought beside the stag king Robert
on the far side of the narrow sea.

245
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,533
He was first through the breach
during the siege of spike,

246
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,870
slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.

247
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,665
He killed the great khal drogo
in single combat.

248
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,209
Betrayed by his woman,

249
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,671
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

250
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,966
Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

251
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,553
Thirteen. Do I have 14?

252
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,183
Fifteen? 15 gold honors.

253
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,478
Do I hear 16? 16.

254
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,313
Twenty.

255
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,856
Sold.

256
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,658
Wait!

257
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,578
- You have to buy me as well.
- Why?

258
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,247
We're a team.

259
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,916
I'm a great fighter, too.

260
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,963
He's funny. You have to give him that.

261
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,451
You're right, he's funny.

262
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,627
Thank you.

263
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,753
Yes.

264
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,297
My lord, if I may.

265
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,800
I've heard meereen has become a free city.

266
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,695
You might run into trouble if you
try to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

267
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,039
Now, if you were to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage...

268
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,269
There's your wages, funny man.

269
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,271
Should last the rest of your life.

270
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,775
Malko: These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

271
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,111
Five, going once...

272
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,827
How long before the king of meereen
comes to claim my pillow?

273
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,287
Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,915
My marriage to hizdahr is political.

275
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,585
I think he's smart
enough to understand that.

276
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,630
I think the sons of the harpy
have stopped killing

277
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,924
because their leader was made king.

278
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,554
Are you jealous?

279
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,724
Do you think I'm petty enough to
speak ”I of a man

280
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,976
just because he represents competition?

281
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,103
I do.

282
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,732
You're right.

283
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,359
My motivations are entirely impure.

284
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,995
Doesn't make me wrong.

285
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:33,879
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

286
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:38,425
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of meereen behind me.

287
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,927
I have no choice.

288
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,304
Everyone has a choice.

289
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,348
Even slaves have a choice,

290
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,016
death or slavery.

291
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,477
So what else can I do, hmm?

292
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,939
Marry me instead.

293
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:58,070
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

294
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,448
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

295
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,117
You are queen. You can do what you like.

296
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,331
No, I can't.

297
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,793
Then you are the only person in meereen
who's not free.

298
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,683
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

299
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,852
but can I make one more suggestion?

300
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,774
Of course.

301
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,405
On the day of the great games,

302
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,202
gather all the great masters and wise
masters and worthy masters you can find,

303
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,830
and slaughter them all.

304
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:57,004
I am a queen, not a butcher.

305
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,886
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

306
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,521
Olenna: You there.

307
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,483
Where would I find
the high septon, or high sparrow,

308
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,652
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

309
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,947
It's not as good a name as queen of thorns,
I'll admit.

310
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:30,162
You should have the decency
to stand when you speak to a lady.

311
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,497
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

312
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,583
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

313
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,422
For me, it's the knees.

314
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,597
A man of the people. Is that your game?

315
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,476
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

316
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,019
A man of the people

317
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,314
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

318
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,359
The people always do the dirty work.

319
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,570
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

320
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,030
Useful talent.

321
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,949
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

322
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:12,829
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

323
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,124
The fatherjudges us all.

324
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,878
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

325
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,548
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

326
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,551
Don't you walk away from me.

327
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,762
You don't give commands here.

328
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,263
What is it you want?

329
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,182
Gold?

330
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,394
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

331
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,230
What, then?

332
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,483
I imagine this is strange for you.

333
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:47,572
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

334
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,659
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

335
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,661
I serve the gods.

336
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,871
The gods demand justice.

337
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,457
How do they communicate their demands?

338
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,126
By raven or horse?

339
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,837
By the holy text, the seven-pointed star.

340
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,966
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

341
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,552
I've read the seven-pointed star.

342
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,973
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

343
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,267
Your grandchildren will be punished

344
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,980
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

345
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,860
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

346
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,321
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

347
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:33,785
and yet you punish loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

348
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,037
and margaery for defending her brother?

349
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,539
Yes.

350
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,459
The gods' laws must
be applied to all equally.

351
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,253
If it's equality you want, so be it.

352
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,299
When house Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

353
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,551
everyone here will starve.

354
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,637
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

355
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,518
Have you ever sowed the field?

356
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,355
Have you ever reaped the grain?

357
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,567
Has anyone in house Tyrell?

358
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,572
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

359
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,950
You are the few,

360
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,703
we are the many.

361
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,917
And when the many stop fearing the few...

362
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,474
Lady olenna.

363
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,323
Cersei: Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

364
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:01,289
She's in a prison cell,
and there is nothing I can do.

365
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,545
I am the king!

366
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,798
The queen is in prison,
and there is nothing I can do!

367
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,189
No matter who you are,

368
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,781
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,

369
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,404
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

370
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:37,158
Events you couldn't possibly have
anticipated or prevented, even if you had.

371
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,619
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

372
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,913
Your father,

373
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,541
your brother, your grandfather...

374
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,252
I was queen of the seven kingdoms,
and what could I do?

375
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,838
Hold them as they left this world.

376
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,465
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

377
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,926
I'll call in the army.

378
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,557
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

379
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,811
I'll start a war if I have to.

380
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,315
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.

381
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,738
I love her.

382
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,743
I love her,

383
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,164
and I can't help her.

384
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,725
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

385
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,853
I will speak with the high sparrow.

386
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,647
There must be something he...

387
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,523
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

388
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,903
The king cannot Sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

389
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,323
You will try to help her?

390
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,826
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

391
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,537
Your happiness is all I want in this world.

392
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,290
I know.

393
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,125
No, you don't.

394
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,214
You can't possibly.

395
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,301
Not until you have children of your own.

396
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,054
I would do anything for you.

397
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,183
Anything to keep you from harm.

398
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,021
I would burn cities to the ground.

399
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,692
You are all that matters.

400
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,820
You

401
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,364
and your sister.

402
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,741
From the moment you came into this world.

403
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,285
My boy.

404
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,665
My only boy.

405
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,601
Prince doran hopes this satisfies your
concerns about the Princess' well-being.

406
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,985
You looked different when I left.

407
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,904
You had more hair.

408
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,489
And more hands.

409
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,827
- How's trystane?
- He'll be all right.

410
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,911
I'm sorry for that.

411
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,640
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

412
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,331
Why is it happening at all?

413
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,668
Your mother's worried about you.

414
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,256
Threats have been made.
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

415
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,675
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

416
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,039
This has been my home for years.

417
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,764
I didn't want to come here, but
she told me to. I did what she said.

418
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,600
I did my duty,
and now she's forcing me to go back?

419
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,644
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

420
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,980
No, it's not complicated
at all. It's simple.

421
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,942
I love trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

422
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,819
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

423
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,446
You don't know me.

424
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:14,375
Bronn: Brothers, oh, brothers,
my days here are done

425
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,838
the dornishman's taken my life

426
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,843
but what does it matter
for all men must die

427
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,472
and I've tasted the dornishman's wife

428
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,848
lhave

429
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:33,353
I've tasted the dornishman's wife

430
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,107
He's got a good voice.

431
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,944
We're lucky he's a singer.

432
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,321
If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

433
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,449
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

434
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,619
It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

435
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,287
I wouldn't say you beat me.

436
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,081
How's your arm?

437
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,541
Wonderful.

438
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,002
Wouldn't feel right to leave dorne
without a new scar.

439
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,270
You think you're leaving dorne?

440
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,090
No great hurry.

441
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,093
Dornish women
are the most beautiful women in the world.

442
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,678
Thank you.

443
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,597
I said dornish women. I didn't say you.

444
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,811
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

445
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,315
Bronn: I've seen quite a few women
in all the seven kingdoms.

446
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,652
Name one more beautiful than I am.

447
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,281
Well, now,

448
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:31,411
in king's landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous...

449
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,125
There was a what?

450
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,796
In king's landing, you were saying?

451
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,590
Was I?

452
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,635
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

453
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,470
Was there?

454
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,973
My memory's not what it was earlier.

455
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,811
How's your arm now?

456
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,646
You seem concerned with it.

457
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,648
You must really like me.

458
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,910
And how about your head?

459
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,541
My head.

460
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,752
My head?

461
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,505
You don't even want to know
what's going on in...

462
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,184
Your nose is bleeding.

463
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,190
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

464
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,947
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from asshai.

465
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,824
They call it the long farewell.

466
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,035
It takes time to work,

467
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,623
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

468
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,707
death.

469
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,051
The only antidote.

470
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,475
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

471
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,228
You.

472
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
Sorry? Who?

473
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,068
You.

474
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,406
Don't drop it.

475
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,171
I think you're very handsome as well.

476
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,594
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

477
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,973
It felt like the safest place.

478
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,726
Not for your clientele, clearly.

479
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,812
It was an establishment like no other.

480
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,149
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

481
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,151
Desires that didn't even exist

482
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,653
until we invented them.

483
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,157
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

484
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,160
The past is the past.

485
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,915
The future is all that's worth discussing.

486
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,043
The future of house Tyrell.

487
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,754
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

488
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,547
my grandchildren, or me.

489
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,092
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

490
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,677
as soon as things started to go wrong.

491
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,971
- I promise you...
- I promise you, lord baelish,

492
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,890
that our fates are joined.

493
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,767
Together we murdered a king.

494
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,312
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

495
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:33,653
And if I should meet with some accident
here at your broken little flesh market,

496
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,115
they'll never even find what's left of you.

497
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,036
Do you deny a part in all this?

498
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,289
Cersei summoned me to king's landing.

499
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,083
I dared not refuse her.

500
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,001
And what did she want?

501
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,712
A piece of information she knew that I had.

502
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,216
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

503
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,635
But I have other information

504
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,929
of which she is unaware.

505
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,267
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

506
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,812
I have a gift for you.

507
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,772
What kind of gift?

508
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,774
The same kind I gave Cersei.

509
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,986
A handsome young man.

510
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,713
Yezzan: Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

511
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,383
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

512
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,386
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

513
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,639
But if you do happen to triumph here,

514
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,977
you will fight at the great pit of
daznak itself, in front of the queen.

515
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,939
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

516
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,777
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

517
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,324
You and you. You.

518
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,535
You two.

519
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,331
You, you, and you.

520
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,629
- Valar morghulis.
- All: Valar dohaeris.

521
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,963
Prepare yourselves.

522
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,187
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

523
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,148
For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

524
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,652
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

525
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,029
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

526
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,535
Move yourselves.

527
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,585
Your grace.

528
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,379
Your future grace.

529
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,214
You honor us all.

530
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,468
Stand there.

531
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,846
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

532
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,475
We fight and die for your glory,

533
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,227
o glorious queen.

534
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,984
All: We fight and die for your glory,
o glorious queen.

535
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,988
Man: Fight!

536
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,006
I think I've seen enough.

537
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,176
Your grace, it is a tradition

538
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,179
for the queen to stay
until the Victor has emerged.

539
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,342
I've sacrificed more than enough
for your traditions.

540
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,604
What are you doing?

541
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,907
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.

542
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,998
Get him out of my sight.

543
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,333
Khaleesi, please.

544
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,669
I just need a moment of your time.

545
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,546
I brought you a gift.

546
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,548
Tyrion: It's true.

547
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,968
He has.

548
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,804
Who are you?

549
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,849
I am the gift.

550
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,061
It's a pleasure to meet you.

551
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,607
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

552
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,059
Cersei: This is horrible.

553
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,685
Unacceptable.

554
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,773
Are they feeding you enough at least?

555
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,901
I brought you this.

556
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,528
Venison.

557
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,613
It's quite good.

558
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,786
I had it myself for supper only last night.

559
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,168
We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

560
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:49,547
Tommen even went to the sept himself
to confront the high sparrow.

561
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,384
But I fear the faith
has left reason behind.

562
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,427
I know you did this.

563
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,515
We are making every effort on your behalf.

564
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,726
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

565
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,271
Lies come easily to you.

566
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,480
Everyone knows that.

567
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,607
But innocence,

568
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,652
decency, concern,

569
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,655
you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

570
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:20,578
Perhaps that's why your son was
so eager to cast you aside for me.

571
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,331
You're upset.

572
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,667
You're not thinking clearly.

573
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,503
I'll visit again when you've had a chance
to calm down.

574
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,589
I don't want to see you again.

575
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,966
I do hope you change your mind about that.

576
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:38,178
I've been told men often go mad
in the black cells beneath the red keep.

577
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,433
Though I suppose your isolation will end
when your trial begins.

578
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,894
Leave.

579
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,813
Yes.

580
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,859
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now more than ever.

581
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,486
Get out, you hateful bitch!

582
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,169
Sleep well, sister.

583
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,657
Thank you, boake.

584
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,582
- You saw her?
- Yes.

585
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,293
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

586
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,544
What happens to her now?

587
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,424
Well, she and her brother are
both being held under fair suspicion.

588
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:03,430
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

589
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:07,226
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

590
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,061
Who will stand judge?

591
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:13,357
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the targaryens.

592
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,901
Will you be one of them?

593
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,945
I will.

594
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:24,368
If one or both of them were to
confess before the trial...

595
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,203
Then they will be shown the mother's mercy.

596
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,456
And what does the mother's mercy entail?

597
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,418
It depends upon the situation.

598
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,713
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

599
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,631
Thank you, high septon,

600
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,176
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

601
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,846
in the eyes of the seven.

602
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,228
Did you know this chapel is
one of the oldest structures

603
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,438
in king's landing?

604
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,024
I think I may have heard at one point.

605
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,777
Baelor built his sept around it.

606
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,240
But men worshipped here long before him.

607
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,076
Who carved this altar?

608
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,996
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

609
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,790
No one does.

610
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,003
There's no name on it,
or anywhere else in the chapel.

611
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,382
No, the people who built this place

612
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,344
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them,

613
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,891
the way baelor did with that
great gilded monstrosity up there.

614
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,975
Hmm.

615
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,144
Their faith was clean.

616
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,523
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

617
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,568
knock down the statues and the pillars,

618
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,154
and this is what remains.

619
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,618
Something simple,

620
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,583
solid, and true.

621
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,466
The tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

622
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:08,055
Their lies knocked down.
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

623
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,809
And so it will be for all of us.

624
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,853
High and low alike.

625
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,901
What will we find

626
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,238
when we strip away your finery?

627
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,494
A young man came to us not long ago,

628
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,664
broken in body and spirit.

629
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,418
He had so much to strip away.

630
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,256
So much weighing him down.

631
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,261
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

632
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,264
Let go of vanity,

633
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,016
pride, sin.

634
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,688
Now his soul is so light,

635
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,650
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

636
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,026
Hmm.

637
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,909
And he has much to say about you.

638
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,934
Move.

639
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,523
Let me go immediately.

640
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,318
You will order her to let me go.

641
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,279
I am the queen!

642
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,031
Have you lost your mind?

643
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,490
Let me go!

644
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:55,996
Your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

645
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,416
I am the queen! Let me go!

646
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,341
Look at me.

647
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,553
Look at my face.

648
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,184
It's the last thing you'll
see before you die.
