1
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:24,566
I got out of the institution
on the day of my sister's wedding.

2
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,569
I had started to get used to the place.

3
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,071
Breakfast at 8:00, classes at 2:00,

4
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,533
therapy at 4:00 and asleep by 10:00.

5
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,160
You can call me any time, Lee.

6
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,205
I will always try to be of help to you.

7
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,541
Inside, life was simple.

8
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,002
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

9
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:47,046
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.

10
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,923
Bon voyage.

11
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,639
Hi, Peter.

12
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:41,726
Peter, yeah,
who you almost successfully forgot.

13
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,645
- No, I did not.
- Come on, everybody!

14
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,897
Are you happy to be home?

15
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,360
I mean, are you happy to be home?

16
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,655
I don't know.

17
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:57,116
I know what you mean.

18
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:15,009
Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

19
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:17,637
Boy!

20
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,140
You look so beautiful.

21
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:23,685
Thanks, Dad.

22
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:28,022
I thought you stopped.

23
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,362
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

24
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,823
Well, I missed you, too.

25
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,831
You know what?

26
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:47,041
I don't feel too good.

27
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:49,377
Let's go sit down.

28
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,252
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

29
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,342
- Have fun!
- Goodbye! Take care!

30
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,321
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

31
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:43,324
<i>You want to treat me like I'm a child.
You want to talk to me like a child.</i>

32
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:44,408
<i>- Huh? You think I'm a child?
- You...</i>

33
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:45,827
<i>You think I don't know
what I'm doing?</i>

34
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,245
<i>You act like a child!</i>

35
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,329
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

36
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:51,165
<i>You don't act like a man.
You've been fired!</i>

37
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,585
<i>Well, I'm glad I'm fired!</i>

38
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,088
I'm glad I'm fired!
Boy, I hated that job!

39
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,757
I don't care that you hated it!
You're drunk!

40
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:02,593
I'm not drunk! Why do you...
Why do you... I'm not drunk!

41
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:05,680
- Why do you always say that?
- Get off my back!

42
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:23,197
Watch this. You watch this.

43
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:30,181
Avoid the temptation
of placing your fingers

44
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,266
on the home keys by sight.

45
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:37,230
Strike each key so that your fingers
bounce with each stroke.

46
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,607
Do not strike without thinking.

47
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,861
Do not even attempt
to steal a glance at your paper.

48
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,198
"My flowers had just
about given up in despair,

49
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,451
"so with the exception
of a few potted plants from the florist,

50
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:53,621
"we're flowerless
for the first spring in years."

51
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,289
And time!

52
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,419
I'm so proud of you, honey.

53
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,297
Getting out in the world like this.

54
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,052
When my accident happened,

55
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:12,765
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

56
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:16,727
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work

57
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:18,980
at Havis department store.

58
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:23,317
Because there was a limited amount of time
that my mom's back was turned...

59
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,404
- Lee!
- I slipped and cut too deep.

60
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,324
I'm not sure how I could have misjudged.

61
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:33,160
I've been doing it since seventh grade.

62
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,346
Just a precaution.

63
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:41,354
"Be a leader."

64
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,366
I have never had a job before,

65
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:59,497
but I can assure you that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

66
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:01,957
Thank you.

67
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:07,338
Well, I don't have any references yet.

68
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:11,050
But I think that the municipal tax office

69
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:15,888
would be a wonderful place to begin

70
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:19,266
my career.

71
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,362
"Secretary."

72
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,647
Hello. I...

73
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,318
Wait! I...

74
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:12,222
Hello?

75
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:22,473
In here.

76
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:37,196
Hi.

77
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,325
Are you the lawyer?

78
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:43,811
Oh. Uh...

79
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:47,314
Yes.

80
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,334
I'm sorry. I'll just come back later.

81
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,568
No.

82
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:54,588
No, stay.

83
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,276
It said "secretary."

84
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,697
That's right.

85
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:26,370
Are you pregnant?

86
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:30,399
No.

87
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,295
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

88
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:39,491
No.

89
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,887
- Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

90
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:46,640
- Alone?
- With my parents.

91
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:48,434
Siblings?

92
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,229
Well, my sister is going to live
in the backyard

93
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:54,732
with her husband in the pool house.

94
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,009
Are you married?

95
00:15:58,403 --> 00:15:59,553
No.

96
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:04,491
Have you ever won an award?

97
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:05,784
Yes.

98
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:07,745
What did you win the award in?

99
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:08,996
Typing.

100
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:16,837
Are those your scores?

101
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:21,825
Yes.

102
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,387
"Lee Holloway."

103
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,068
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

104
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,048
Do you really want to be a secretary, Lee?

105
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes, I do.

106
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:55,978
You scored higher
than anyone I've ever interviewed.

107
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,774
You're really over-qualified for the job.

108
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:04,653
- You'd be bored to death.
- I want to be bored.

109
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:15,497
I have a part-time paralegal.

110
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:21,378
All I need is a typist

111
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,467
who can get to work on time
and answer the phone.

112
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,260
I can do that.

113
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:32,306
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

114
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,082
That's fine.

115
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:37,186
It's very dull work.

116
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,730
I like dull work.

117
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,114
There's something about you.

118
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:53,185
You're...

119
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:59,291
You're closed up tight.

120
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:02,795
A wall.

121
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:05,881
I know.

122
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,676
Do you ever loosen up?

123
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,140
I don't know.

124
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,604
I'm not here.

125
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:37,621
Less sugar in the coffee.

126
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:47,756
How'd it go?

127
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,052
I got it.

128
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:03,355
I knew you could do it!

129
00:20:18,663 --> 00:20:19,813
Hello.

130
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,370
Hello.

131
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:41,643
You have reached the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

132
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:46,607
Please leave your message
and the time you called,

133
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:49,735
along with your phone number

134
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,404
and the best time to reach you,

135
00:20:55,783 --> 00:21:02,539
and we will get back to you
as soon as possible.

136
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,610
We.

137
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,422
Secretary.

138
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:26,313
Type up this letter and send four
copies to O'Malley and Barrett.

139
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:29,274
Right away, sir.

140
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,665
That's good. That's good.

141
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:51,380
So, you're the new secretary.

142
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:54,908
Yeah.

143
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,223
Excuse me.

144
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,600
What exactly is a paralegal?

145
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,276
See you.

146
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,367
Oh, um...

147
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,593
Okay.

148
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:44,516
Up at the sides. Wide-eyed.

149
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,209
I brought you these.

150
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,680
I think I accidentally threw out my notes
on the Feldman case.

151
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,098
Maybe you could...

152
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,267
Go through the garbage?

153
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,150
Yes, Lee. Thank you.

154
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:51,351
Why are you here?

155
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:54,938
I'm just waiting for you, honey.

156
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:57,357
But I'm here for five more hours.

157
00:24:58,484 --> 00:24:59,693
I know.

158
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:14,040
Excuse me, sir.

159
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,378
It's okay. I found another set.

160
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,550
This needs more sugar.

161
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:26,052
- Sugar?
- And six copies of these.

162
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:30,640
Freshen up that trap, Lee.

163
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:32,517
And put out one more.

164
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:03,089
Mice like to go behind the chairs, too, Lee.

165
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,342
Just because it's hard to reach

166
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:08,261
does not mean that we don't
take care of every possibility.

167
00:26:14,602 --> 00:26:16,436
Here. Give me that.

168
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,620
Thank you.

169
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,790
E. Edward Grey's office. May I help you?

170
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:23,003
We're very happy with AT&T.
Thanks, though.

171
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,421
Is he in?

172
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:25,672
Could you just wait one moment?

173
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:30,302
You're right.
That is a very good offer.

174
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:31,594
I'm going back now.

175
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,306
Could you just wait one minute, please?

176
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:37,892
Yes, I do understand that.

177
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:39,936
Submissive.

178
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:43,882
Excuse me?

179
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:45,133
Edward!

180
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:51,281
Listen, I have no idea if we make over $40

181
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:54,409
worth of long distance calls
to Chattanooga each month.

182
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,957
Tell him it's Tricia O'Connor.

183
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:04,085
Mr. Grey?

184
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,886
Hello?

185
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:19,976
Mr. Grey?

186
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:22,187
Ms. Holloway.

187
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:33,365
Mr. Grey?

188
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,910
I'm not here.

189
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:42,499
Okay.

190
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:50,799
I'm afraid he's gone.

191
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:53,218
Is that right?

192
00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:01,935
E. Edward Grey's office.

193
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:04,354
Is that you, honey? It's me.

194
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:05,588
Daddy?

195
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,732
It's so good to hear your voice.

196
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:09,109
Dad.

197
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:11,052
Where are you?

198
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:14,072
I'm downtown, somewhere.

199
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:17,450
Could you please hold?

200
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:22,038
Do you have a message, Ms. O'Connor?

201
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:35,677
Tell him to sign the settlement.

202
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,642
Hello?

203
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:45,061
Hello?

204
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:47,480
Hello, Dad?

205
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,228
How's work?

206
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:09,879
Fine.

207
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,649
How's Mr. Grey?

208
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,485
He's fine.

209
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,695
Well, Peter called.

210
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,667
Some people, right, have to wash
something as soon as they've worn it,

211
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,585
- you know, for, like, half a day.
- Yes.

212
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,629
And then you got your more
laid-back folk who just,

213
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:37,006
you know, maybe they'll
wash their stuff when it's dirty.

214
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:38,800
Which kind are you?

215
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,719
I'm the type of guy

216
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,807
who wants to get married and have a kid.

217
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:52,188
I wash my clothes just when they're dirty.

218
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:56,442
Me, too, and...
And that is what counts in a relationship.

219
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:58,778
Compatibility.

220
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,574
In a relationship?

221
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:03,955
- Ln a relationship.
- Relationship.

222
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:18,673
May I interest you in a little more?

223
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:21,843
- Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

224
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:31,060
You're different
than you were in high school, Peter.

225
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:33,521
I... I changed.

226
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:35,189
What happened?

227
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,734
I had a nervous breakdown.

228
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:40,069
Me, too.

229
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:43,698
Sort of.

230
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,081
Two items. This and these.

231
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,042
- Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

232
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:58,379
I've read that if you
wear that kind of underwear,

233
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,841
that it squeezes

234
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,844
your things.

235
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:06,929
- Balls.
- Yes.

236
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:08,164
Balls?

237
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:10,767
My grapes.

238
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:11,934
Your grapes?

239
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,169
My...

240
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,188
Your testicles.

241
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:20,193
Your sperm gets squozen,
and then you can't have babies,

242
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:23,112
and I thought that
you said that you wanted to have babies.

243
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,948
There you go. I said it.

244
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,244
To babies!

245
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:33,081
To diapers.

246
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:35,024
To diaper rash.

247
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,919
To breast-feeding. And to crying.

248
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:26,384
Look at it!

249
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:28,928
Do you see that?

250
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:30,246
What?

251
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:32,432
This letter has three typing errors in it,

252
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:34,767
one of which is, I believe, a spelling error.

253
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,812
I'm... I'm sorry.

254
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:39,156
This isn't the first time, either.

255
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:41,941
There've been others that I let go
because it was in the first few weeks.

256
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,860
This cannot go on.

257
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:47,029
Do you know what this makes me look like
to the people who receive these letters?

258
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:49,866
I... I'm sorry. I'm...

259
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:53,202
Type it again and get it right.

260
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,889
You're wasting my time.

261
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,165
Bye.

262
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:14,700
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.

263
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:16,786
Aren't you going to proofread the letter?

264
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,304
Lee.

265
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,352
When people come into this office,

266
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:44,772
you are a visual representation
of my business.

267
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:47,358
And the way you dress is disgusting.

268
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:53,489
I'm sorry.

269
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:57,034
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

270
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,078
You're either going to
have to wear a hairnet

271
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:00,872
or stop playing with your hair.

272
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:06,794
And another thing,

273
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,048
do you realize that
you are always sniffling?

274
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,968
I... I'm sniffling?

275
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,179
And what is with your tongue

276
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:19,765
when you're typing?

277
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:23,436
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I sniffled.

278
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,773
Well, you do.

279
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:36,616
Mr. Grey,

280
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:43,289
thank you so much for
your helpful suggestions.

281
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,793
Because I am trying to be

282
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,632
the very best secretary that I can be.

283
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:55,468
For you.

284
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:58,471
The sentence should read,

285
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:02,350
"Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,

286
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,810
"my client would never have made

287
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:08,648
"these material decisions on her own."
Period!

288
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,650
I have repeated the sentence twice.

289
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:15,947
Why don't you listen, think
and then respond.

290
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:17,907
Okay?

291
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,459
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

292
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:31,754
We make it homemade, don't we, Stewart?

293
00:38:32,214 --> 00:38:33,381
Try it. It's good.

294
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,007
Would you like some, Lee?

295
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:37,301
No, thank you.

296
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:39,053
Not right now, Sylvia.

297
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:41,597
You know,
Peter talks about you all the time.

298
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:44,183
He says he's found his soul mate.

299
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:47,770
Did you say that?

300
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:51,440
I did.

301
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:53,693
Peter's sister, Lindsey,

302
00:38:54,152 --> 00:38:57,196
is getting married this
coming winter in Vegas.

303
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,534
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at JC Penney?

304
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:03,369
They even gave him a cell phone.

305
00:39:03,453 --> 00:39:05,287
Perhaps it'll be a double wedding?

306
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:10,835
Mom.

307
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:38,070
Ms. Holloway, come into the library.

308
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:40,948
Immediately.

309
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,842
"Refer only to slanderous remarks
made in print.

310
00:39:59,926 --> 00:40:01,260
"In summation of the events

311
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:05,139
"in regard to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely, etc."

312
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,920
Okay.

313
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:14,273
The phone is ringing.

314
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,930
Answer it.

315
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,100
I'm sorry...

316
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,192
Oh.

317
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:37,379
Hello?

318
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,465
This is the office of...

319
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:40,699
Listen.

320
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:41,884
You're a big girl.

321
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:45,971
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

322
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,499
Tiny.

323
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:50,584
Ms. Holloway.

324
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:52,770
You told me when I hired you

325
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:55,356
that you were used to answering phones.

326
00:40:56,274 --> 00:40:57,424
I am.

327
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:00,361
Did you get enough sleep last night?

328
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:02,780
- I...
- The phone is ringing!

329
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:07,409
Hello.

330
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:12,206
This is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

331
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:15,459
You see? You see?
You see? You see?

332
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:17,419
That's showing a little spunk.

333
00:41:17,504 --> 00:41:19,338
After all, I'm not running a mortuary.

334
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:20,906
No.

335
00:41:31,518 --> 00:41:32,668
Lee.

336
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:35,354
Mr. Grey.

337
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:39,591
Come here.

338
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:08,596
Did you have a date recently?

339
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:13,876
Yes.

340
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,564
With whom did you have a date?

341
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,401
- Peter.
- Peter?

342
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:23,944
Did you have sex?

343
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:28,557
No?

344
00:42:31,453 --> 00:42:32,912
I don't know.

345
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,875
Are you shy?

346
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:41,712
I'm shy.

347
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:44,548
You're not shy.

348
00:42:45,091 --> 00:42:46,717
You're a lawyer.

349
00:42:49,888 --> 00:42:51,096
I'm shy.

350
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:54,099
I overcome my shyness to...

351
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,104
Ln order to get things done.

352
00:43:01,524 --> 00:43:03,484
I don't think you're shy.

353
00:43:08,865 --> 00:43:11,200
Lee, I want to be frank with you.

354
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:15,621
Now, I know I'm your employer,
and we have

355
00:43:16,164 --> 00:43:18,165
a prescribed relationship.

356
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,298
But you really should feel free

357
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:32,179
to discuss your problems with me.

358
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:36,625
Oh.

359
00:43:43,817 --> 00:43:46,694
What's going on
with the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

360
00:43:54,286 --> 00:43:55,436
Lee?

361
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,041
I feel...

362
00:44:04,004 --> 00:44:05,254
- Shy.
- Shy.

363
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,093
Do you want some hot chocolate?

364
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:13,203
Okay.

365
00:44:28,236 --> 00:44:30,362
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?

366
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:37,202
I don't know.

367
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:41,123
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to
come to the surface,

368
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:43,417
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside,

369
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:46,462
you finally know you are really here?

370
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:48,714
Then, when you watch the wound heal,

371
00:44:48,882 --> 00:44:51,216
it's comforting. Isn't it?

372
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:55,537
I...

373
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:01,518
That's a way to put it.

374
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:05,647
I'm going to tell you something, Lee.
Are you ready to listen?

375
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:08,008
Yes.

376
00:45:08,193 --> 00:45:09,860
Are you listening?

377
00:45:13,156 --> 00:45:14,406
You will never,

378
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:18,994
ever cut yourself again.

379
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:21,246
Do you understand?

380
00:45:22,165 --> 00:45:24,500
Have I made that perfectly clear?

381
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:27,669
You're over that now.

382
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:30,214
It's in the past.

383
00:45:36,596 --> 00:45:37,746
Yes.

384
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:42,684
Never again.

385
00:45:46,147 --> 00:45:47,297
Okay.

386
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:52,486
Now, you know what I want you to do?

387
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:57,282
I want you to leave work early.

388
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,245
You're a big girl, a grown woman.

389
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:03,144
Your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

390
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:09,378
I want you to take a nice walk home,
in the fresh air.

391
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:11,630
Because you require relief.

392
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:15,634
Because you won't be doing that anymore.

393
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:17,428
Will you?

394
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:19,763
No, sir.

395
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:23,125
Good.

396
00:46:38,283 --> 00:46:39,825
Look who's early.

397
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:42,828
Mom,

398
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:47,416
I'm going to walk home from now on.

399
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:52,296
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,

400
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:57,301
and it was as if I'd never
taken a walk by myself before.

401
00:46:57,844 --> 00:47:03,015
And when I thought about it, I realized
I probably never had taken a walk alone.

402
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,768
But because he had given me
the permission to do this,

403
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:09,104
because he'd insisted I do it,

404
00:47:09,189 --> 00:47:13,901
I felt held by him as I walked along.

405
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:16,820
I felt he was with me.

406
00:47:18,323 --> 00:47:23,952
At the same time, I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey,

407
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:29,541
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

408
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:35,589
nursed on the feeling that he had
discovered something about me.

409
00:47:37,675 --> 00:47:41,136
The next day, I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine.

410
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:44,014
But I did make another typing mistake.

411
00:47:44,224 --> 00:47:47,434
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do.

412
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,270
Type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

413
00:47:50,355 --> 00:47:52,648
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it certainly seems to be.

414
00:47:52,732 --> 00:47:55,150
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me!

415
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:59,071
What goes on inside that head of yours?

416
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,373
Come into my office and bring that letter.

417
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:06,638
Put the letter on my desk.

418
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:21,778
Now, I want you to bend over the desk,
so you're looking directly at it.

419
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:28,035
Get your face very close to the letter,
and read the letter aloud.

420
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,747
I don't understand.

421
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,499
There's nothing to understand.

422
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:38,211
Put your elbows on the desk, bend over,

423
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:42,674
get your face close to the letter
and read it aloud.

424
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,937
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

425
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:59,399
"I'm grateful to you for referring..."

426
00:50:11,788 --> 00:50:13,038
Continue.

427
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:16,441
Um...

428
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:19,544
Ms. Holloway, read.

429
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,851
"For referring me to your case.

430
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:41,692
"The subject of animal captivity
has been of interest to me for quite a while.

431
00:50:42,443 --> 00:50:46,029
"And my secretary has prepared
research material

432
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:49,157
"that I think you'll find illuminating.

433
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:51,451
"If you would be so kind

434
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,624
"as to send me the June 5th letter
of which we spoke,

435
00:50:58,418 --> 00:51:01,503
"my associates and I
will review it immediately."

436
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:06,925
"Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

437
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:11,263
"Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey."

438
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:22,524
Read it again.

439
00:51:28,614 --> 00:51:30,031
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

440
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,121
"I am grateful to you

441
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:40,542

"that I think you'll find illuminating."

446
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,399
Now straighten yourself up
and go type it again.

447
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:37,177
Ms. Holloway. Good letter.

448
00:54:57,573 --> 00:54:58,723
Mom?

449
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:03,161
The lock can come off the cabinet now.

450
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:13,546
Honey.

451
00:55:54,296 --> 00:55:57,674
- Oh!

452
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:23,199
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

453
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,060
120 watts.

454
00:56:26,662 --> 00:56:28,788
- Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

455
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:31,249
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.

456
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,751
I'm sorry about the typo.

457
00:56:43,763 --> 00:56:48,600
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed, no, creamed potatoes,

458
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:52,854
green peas, iced tea and ice cream.

459
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:56,357
Okay. Just a scoop of creamed potatoes,

460
00:56:56,734 --> 00:57:01,863
and a slice of butter, four peas

461
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:05,950
and as much ice cream
as you'd like to eat, doll.

462
00:57:46,492 --> 00:57:51,830
Cosmo's advice for getting your man
to share his feelings more intimately

463
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,958
is to first try some breezy humor.

464
00:57:56,127 --> 00:58:01,297
Whatever you do, don't jump
too quickly into relationship talk.

465
00:59:21,086 --> 00:59:25,548
I'm your secretary.

466
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:28,801
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes,

467
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,763
one slice of butter,

468
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:36,100
and four peas.

469
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,399
How many inches away...

470
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:48,238
Had you turned off the furnace
before you went down to the basement?

471
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:58,648
Okay.

472
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:02,794
Maybe you didn't squeeze it hard enough.

473
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:06,506
Well, there's
always concern about it bursting.

474
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:13,263
No! God, no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

475
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:16,975
I'm doing as much as I possibly can.

476
01:00:22,648 --> 01:00:25,942
Where was she when
you crawled under the house?

477
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:33,116
And the lockbox?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?

478
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:34,826
Mud upstairs?

479
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:39,289
No, I'm confused by that.

480
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:41,165
But...

481
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:46,254
All right. This was the overweight child,
or your nephew from Baltimore?

482
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:48,923
On the banister.

483
01:00:56,682 --> 01:00:58,224
I have to work.

484
01:01:01,979 --> 01:01:05,148
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

485
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:07,275
I'm sorry, the office has been

486
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:11,821
overwhelmed.

487
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:17,368
Mr. Grey, I'm going to go home now.

488
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:23,207
If you need any more typing done,
I could come back later.

489
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:31,549
Thank you, Ms. Holloway, good night.

490
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,267
That'll be all.

491
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:49,150
Here's just one example.

492
01:01:49,234 --> 01:01:53,112
He asked me out to Red Lobster
the other night for a nightcap.

493
01:01:53,322 --> 01:01:54,489
- Right.
- Yeah.

494
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:57,700
And yesterday,
he asked if my hose were control-top,

495
01:01:57,785 --> 01:02:00,286
and if they were, I certainly didn't need it.

496
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:02,580
- Your boss?
- Yeah.

497
01:02:02,873 --> 01:02:05,750
You should sue him for sexual harassment.

498
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:08,044
- I like that idea.
- Hello.

499
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:12,256
My lawyer's representing a woman who's
suing her boss for sexual harassment.

500
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:14,092
Is he a good lawyer?

501
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:17,095
He's the best.

502
01:02:17,554 --> 01:02:19,263
"He's the best."

503
01:02:19,348 --> 01:02:21,599
How long will he be there?

504
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:29,774
Who was that?

505
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:32,568
He checked himself into the hospital.

506
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:00,162
Lee?

507
01:03:31,628 --> 01:03:33,379
Yes? Lee?

508
01:03:35,757 --> 01:03:36,907
Hi.

509
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:41,746
I...

510
01:03:43,432 --> 01:03:45,141
I just wanted...

511
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:50,313
I needed you...

512
01:03:52,274 --> 01:03:54,192
I wanted you to...

513
01:03:57,863 --> 01:03:59,655
You need me to what?

514
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:11,501
I just wanted you not to forget
to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.

515
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,589
No. I haven't.

516
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:19,634
That's good.

517
01:04:23,222 --> 01:04:24,514
Thank you, Lee.

518
01:05:14,064 --> 01:05:18,234
After he turned me away from his house,
he put me back at my old desk,

519
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,112
and he just stopped doing it.

520
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:24,657
He threw out all his red pens.

521
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:31,789
I kept making typos, but he just
treated me like a regular old secretary.

522
01:05:32,499 --> 01:05:33,749
Are you coming?

523
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:37,878
After a while,
I began to wonder if that was all I was.

524
01:05:41,466 --> 01:05:43,593
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

525
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,177
No, sir.

526
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:48,014
File these.

527
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:02,028
That's a pretty tie.
But I guess you won't be golfing today.

528
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:03,637
What?

529
01:06:03,947 --> 01:06:05,197
Your tie.

530
01:06:05,574 --> 01:06:07,366
It has golfers on it.

531
01:06:14,124 --> 01:06:15,274
Right.

532
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,171
Damn it.

533
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:29,568
Don't be scared.

534
01:09:32,322 --> 01:09:33,781
I'm not. I'm...

535
01:09:45,043 --> 01:09:46,710
That's not what I meant.

536
01:09:50,257 --> 01:09:54,218
I'm sorry, I just... Look here.

537
01:09:56,137 --> 01:09:57,471
I'm sorry.

538
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:02,726
Okay, but my clothes
get to stay completely on

539
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:04,687
and I want the lights out.

540
01:10:34,718 --> 01:10:36,886
Lee, Lee, Lee.

541
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:44,476
I didn't hurt you, did I?

542
01:10:47,105 --> 01:10:48,255
No.

543
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:22,491
Ms. Holloway.

544
01:12:25,203 --> 01:12:26,704
Yes, Mr. Grey?

545
01:12:26,955 --> 01:12:28,706
Come into my office.

546
01:12:31,334 --> 01:12:33,377
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

547
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:39,049
Ms. Holloway, come into my office.

548
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,551
Yes, sir.

549
01:12:43,096 --> 01:12:44,847
Finally.

550
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:23,594
Ignore it.

551
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:42,112
Now, pull up your skirt.

552
01:13:45,075 --> 01:13:46,225
Why?

553
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:50,162
You're not worried
that I'm going to fuck you, are you?

554
01:13:51,748 --> 01:13:54,666
I'm not interested in that, not in the least.

555
01:13:55,335 --> 01:13:57,252
Now, pull up your skirt.

556
01:13:58,797 --> 01:14:00,464
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee

557
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:05,385
Lee?

558
01:14:08,932 --> 01:14:10,974
I said, pull up your skirt.

559
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,270
Peter.

560
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:20,484
I'm not going to be able to
come to the diner today, okay?

561
01:14:24,531 --> 01:14:25,681
Okay.

562
01:14:26,991 --> 01:14:30,702
That's okay.
Because... That's all right.

563
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:57,855
Pull down your panty hose and underwear.

564
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:05,529
I told you I'm not going to fuck you.

565
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:01,371
Get these forms filled out,

566
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:04,458
and then you can take your lunch break.

567
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:09,004
Bring me my sandwich, I'm eating in.

568
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:15,802
And you'll have the usual.

569
01:18:19,432 --> 01:18:21,350
No mayonnaise this time.

570
01:18:22,477 --> 01:18:26,855
And send in what's his name.

571
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:34,554
Okay?

572
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:22,786
Mr. Grey.

573
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:48,103
Cock. Place your prick in my mouth.

574
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:50,272
Screw me.

575
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,501
Shit. Fuck.

576
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:15,130
Mayonnaise. Orchid.

577
01:20:16,883 --> 01:20:18,341
Mr. Grey.

578
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:43,200
Edward.

579
01:21:03,095 --> 01:21:07,349
Most people think that
the best way to live is to run from pain.

580
01:21:07,892 --> 01:21:11,895
But a much more joyful life
embraces the entire spectrum

581
01:21:11,979 --> 01:21:13,605
of human feeling.

582
01:21:13,898 --> 01:21:18,068
If we can fully
experience pain, as well as pleasure,

583
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:22,239
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

584
01:22:10,121 --> 01:22:11,746
- Ms. Holloway.

585
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:16,376
Yes, sir?

586
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,962
- Bring your typing scores.
- Okay.

587
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:44,821
What happened?

588
01:22:47,408 --> 01:22:48,908
Are you pregnant?

589
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:52,729
No.

590
01:22:54,332 --> 01:22:56,666
- Do you plan on getting pregnant?
- Could I...

591
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:58,835
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

592
01:23:00,796 --> 01:23:01,946
No.

593
01:23:02,465 --> 01:23:04,674
Are you living in an apartment?

594
01:23:04,884 --> 01:23:06,134
A house.

595
01:23:06,969 --> 01:23:08,136
Alone?

596
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,555
With my parents.

597
01:23:12,183 --> 01:23:13,808
Are you married?

598
01:23:15,645 --> 01:23:16,795
No.

599
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:28,198
Are those your scores?

600
01:23:29,992 --> 01:23:31,142
Yes.

601
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:40,543
Do you really want to be my secretary?

602
01:23:43,422 --> 01:23:44,756
Yes, I do.

603
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,556
This isn't just about typos, tape,
staples and pencils, is it, Lee?

604
01:23:54,392 --> 01:23:56,393
- No, sir.
- What?

605
01:23:57,853 --> 01:23:59,062
No, sir.

606
01:24:04,068 --> 01:24:07,987
I like you, Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

607
01:24:10,741 --> 01:24:11,891
Why?

608
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,495
It's your behavior.

609
01:24:17,581 --> 01:24:19,457
What about my behavior?

610
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:21,084
It's very bad.

611
01:24:25,589 --> 01:24:29,134
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

612
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:32,595
- Time-out!
- Time-out?

613
01:24:32,763 --> 01:24:34,681
- You're fired.
- You're fired!

614
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:37,434
You're fired. Now, Lee, get out!

615
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:48,737
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

616
01:24:48,988 --> 01:24:51,573
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

617
01:24:51,657 --> 01:24:54,868
Are you aware
you kick your shoes off under your desk?

618
01:24:54,952 --> 01:24:56,661
I can smell your feet.

619
01:24:56,746 --> 01:24:58,371
Do you ever change your panty hose?

620
01:24:58,456 --> 01:24:59,606
Every day.

621
01:24:59,749 --> 01:25:03,710
Every time you erase,
there are little shavings all over your desk.

622
01:25:03,961 --> 01:25:07,422
I told you to take that Walkman home.

623
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,676
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music

624
01:25:11,761 --> 01:25:13,386
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

625
01:25:13,471 --> 01:25:17,015
I saw it in your desk. I know it's there.

626
01:25:17,433 --> 01:25:18,892
I'll move it.

627
01:25:59,058 --> 01:26:01,351
You have to go, or I won't stop.

628
01:26:02,686 --> 01:26:03,853
Don't.

629
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:09,567
I cannot do this anymore.

630
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,656
But I want to know you.

631
01:26:41,058 --> 01:26:43,810
I'm so sorry for what happened between us.

632
01:26:45,062 --> 01:26:50,900
I've realized
what a terrible mistake I made with you.

633
01:26:52,862 --> 01:26:56,114
And I can only hope that you understand.

634
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,411
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

635
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:11,087
Get out.

636
01:27:11,589 --> 01:27:14,173
- What are you doing...
- Get out!

637
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:33,044
I opened the envelope
the second I got home.

638
01:28:33,212 --> 01:28:38,341
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.

639
01:28:38,801 --> 01:28:42,095
It occurred to me to tear up the check,
but I didn't.

640
01:28:42,721 --> 01:28:45,348
I felt like I was doing the right thing.

641
01:28:45,432 --> 01:28:48,226
And I didn't tell anybody about any of it.

642
01:28:49,478 --> 01:28:51,896
I pretended to go to work as usual,

643
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:55,483
and watched his office
from across the street.

644
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:59,988
He hired a new girl
and changed the locks on the doors.

645
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:05,159
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

646
01:29:15,879 --> 01:29:21,926
My doctor at the institution once said,
"Every journey begins with the first step."

647
01:29:22,636 --> 01:29:26,264
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

648
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:31,394
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples

649
01:29:31,478 --> 01:29:33,813
before we even made it to his car.

650
01:29:34,148 --> 01:29:35,148
Hi.

651
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,359
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio,

652
01:29:38,444 --> 01:29:40,403
and when I refused, he said...

653
01:29:40,487 --> 01:29:42,071
I thought you were a masochist.

654
01:29:42,197 --> 01:29:45,241
Then there was the one
who liked being tied to a gas stove

655
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:49,328
while the burners were on full blast,
and I had to throw tomatoes at him.

656
01:29:49,413 --> 01:29:50,663
Thank you.

657
01:29:50,748 --> 01:29:54,083
For a while I just stopped trying
and stayed at home,

658
01:29:54,418 --> 01:29:57,086
helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.

659
01:29:57,921 --> 01:29:59,380
Until one day,

660
01:29:59,673 --> 01:30:03,342
out of the blue,
Peter proposed marriage to me

661
01:30:03,427 --> 01:30:05,845
in the basement of JC Penney's.

662
01:30:07,097 --> 01:30:10,600
I think I said yes
because I didn't know what else to do.

663
01:30:10,851 --> 01:30:14,228
Well, I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

664
01:30:14,855 --> 01:30:16,064
Okay.

665
01:30:19,109 --> 01:30:21,402
Now, if you hold your breath
through the wedding, you'll make it.

666
01:30:21,487 --> 01:30:23,529
Don't move. I'm going to get Stewart.

667
01:30:23,614 --> 01:30:26,449
You're beautiful.
You're just too beautiful.

668
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,100
Lee?

669
01:30:52,184 --> 01:30:54,769
No! I'm not supposed
to see you before the wedding!

670
01:30:54,853 --> 01:30:56,896
Where are you going?

671
01:31:12,162 --> 01:31:14,956
- I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

672
01:31:15,374 --> 01:31:16,749
I love you.

673
01:31:17,751 --> 01:31:19,877
Lee, you should not be here.

674
01:31:20,003 --> 01:31:21,337
I love you.

675
01:31:35,602 --> 01:31:38,688
I'm sorry,
but I don't believe that to be true.

676
01:31:39,148 --> 01:31:41,774
Well, it is true. Lt is.

677
01:31:44,862 --> 01:31:46,612
This matter was resolved

678
01:31:46,697 --> 01:31:49,740
when I received
your canceled severance check.

679
01:31:51,785 --> 01:31:53,161
I love you.

680
01:31:56,206 --> 01:31:59,208
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

681
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:00,751
Why not?

682
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:18,561
Put both your hands on the desk.
Palms down.

683
01:32:27,362 --> 01:32:29,113
I want to make love.

684
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,290
Keep both your feet on the floor
until I come back.

685
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:30,549
Hello?

686
01:33:30,634 --> 01:33:33,803
In case you're wondering,
your fiancée is at my office.

687
01:34:07,796 --> 01:34:10,464
Lee, I'm very fond of you as well.

688
01:34:16,555 --> 01:34:18,931
Oh, it's you.

689
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,984
What are you...
What are you doing?

690
01:34:30,068 --> 01:34:33,946
Lee, I don't...
I don't know what the deal is with...

691
01:34:34,364 --> 01:34:36,949
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

692
01:34:39,619 --> 01:34:41,704
I'm your fiancée, Lee!

693
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,873
You are trespassing.

694
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:47,626
You are making an unwarranted incursion,

695
01:34:47,711 --> 01:34:51,255
a gradual or stealthy
entrance into the sphere of another.

696
01:34:55,719 --> 01:34:57,553
Okay, Lee, Lee,

697
01:34:58,847 --> 01:35:04,226
are you doing something sexual right now?

698
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:07,521
Does this look sexual to you?

699
01:35:10,108 --> 01:35:11,776
I don't know, Lee!

700
01:35:13,653 --> 01:35:15,363
Why don't you move your hands?

701
01:35:19,493 --> 01:35:21,410
Because I don't want to.

702
01:35:25,457 --> 01:35:26,607
No!

703
01:35:57,948 --> 01:36:02,701
Peter, I don't want you.

704
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:09,542
Now, get out.

705
01:36:11,461 --> 01:36:12,670
Get out.

706
01:36:15,632 --> 01:36:16,799
Get out!

707
01:36:54,629 --> 01:36:56,630
- Here you go.
- Great.

708
01:36:58,216 --> 01:37:00,342
I brought you some peas.

709
01:37:05,182 --> 01:37:09,977
There are no statutes capable of controlling
the relations between men and women.

710
01:37:10,061 --> 01:37:12,188
There are other ways to show
your feelings, Lee.

711
01:37:13,023 --> 01:37:14,607
More conventional ways.

712
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:18,694
I expect that dress back,
dry-cleaned, in perfect condition.

713
01:37:18,945 --> 01:37:22,114
I'm just going to leave you
with this literature.

714
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:26,494
Why don't you read about
women's struggle first?

715
01:37:42,135 --> 01:37:46,597
You know, Lee, there's a long
history of this in Catholicism.

716
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:50,684
The monks used to wear thorns
on their temples.

717
01:37:51,353 --> 01:37:54,772
And the nuns, they wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

718
01:37:54,856 --> 01:37:58,484
Two years ago, when it didn't work out
between us, that was it.

719
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,528
I let him slip through my fingers.

720
01:38:00,612 --> 01:38:03,405
You are part of a great tradition.

721
01:38:03,490 --> 01:38:04,990
I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

722
01:38:05,116 --> 01:38:08,953
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I have ever known.

723
01:38:09,162 --> 01:38:11,205
The worm. Amazing.

724
01:38:11,331 --> 01:38:14,542
Who's to say that love needs to be
soft and gentle?

725
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:19,088
"You are the child of God's holy gift of life.

726
01:38:20,423 --> 01:38:23,759
"You come from me, but you are not me.

727
01:38:25,595 --> 01:38:31,392
"Your soul and your body are your own,
and yours to do with as you wish."

728
01:38:34,938 --> 01:38:36,605
Thank you, Daddy.

729
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,249
Drinks.

730
01:38:56,126 --> 01:38:57,585
Take what you ordered.

731
01:38:57,669 --> 01:39:00,796
Now don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

732
01:39:00,922 --> 01:39:06,594
<i>Fifty-seven bottles of beer on the wall</i>

733
01:39:08,138 --> 01:39:13,058
<i>Fifty-seven bottles of beer</i>

734
01:39:15,395 --> 01:39:17,730
<i>Take one down...</i>

735
01:39:32,829 --> 01:39:35,289
We're here on day three
of what has come to be known

736
01:39:35,373 --> 01:39:38,042
as the Lee Holloway hunger strike.

737
01:39:38,376 --> 01:39:41,211
Now, you may have heard
that there are those in the community

738
01:39:41,296 --> 01:39:45,090
who wonder if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

739
01:39:49,346 --> 01:39:52,514
In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

740
01:39:52,807 --> 01:39:54,850
I don't know why, exactly.

741
01:39:55,352 --> 01:39:59,438
But I do know that I'm not so scared
of suffering now.

742
01:40:00,148 --> 01:40:02,775
I feel more than I've ever felt,

743
01:40:03,026 --> 01:40:09,531
and I've found someone to feel with,
to play with, to love

744
01:40:10,784 --> 01:40:13,744
in a way that feels right for me.

745
01:40:14,663 --> 01:40:17,956
I hope he knows that
I can see that he suffers, too.

746
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,751
And that I want to love him.

747
01:42:53,196 --> 01:42:59,701
Each cut, each scar, each burn,
a different mood or time.

748
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:03,038
I told him what the first one was.

749
01:43:03,498 --> 01:43:06,208
I told him where the second one came from.

750
01:43:06,376 --> 01:43:08,252
I remembered them all.

751
01:43:09,337 --> 01:43:11,713
And for the first time in my life,

752
01:43:12,507 --> 01:43:14,800
I felt beautiful.

753
01:43:15,969 --> 01:43:18,011
Finally part of the earth.

754
01:43:19,347 --> 01:43:23,851
I touched the soil, and he loved me back.

755
01:43:45,456 --> 01:43:47,749
Where did you go to high school?

756
01:43:50,795 --> 01:43:52,838
What was your mother like?

757
01:43:55,091 --> 01:43:56,758
What was her name?

758
01:44:00,972 --> 01:44:05,893
What did it say under
your senior yearbook picture?

759
01:44:10,565 --> 01:44:12,524
Who was your first love?

760
01:44:16,529 --> 01:44:21,283
When did your heart first get broken?

761
01:44:27,832 --> 01:44:29,750
Where were you born?

762
01:44:38,593 --> 01:44:40,218
Des Moines, Iowa.

763
01:45:00,907 --> 01:45:05,869
All our activities melted
into an everyday sort of life

764
01:45:06,329 --> 01:45:09,539
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

765
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:14,795
Turn that over, yes. Just pull it tight.

766
01:45:16,172 --> 01:45:19,257
Now, these pillows like to be stacked.

767
01:45:21,594 --> 01:45:23,345
Largest to smallest.

768
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:27,224
We had a June wedding,

769
01:45:27,308 --> 01:45:30,018
by ourselves at the justice of the peace.

770
01:45:31,479 --> 01:45:34,064
Then, we honeymooned in the mountains.

771
01:45:34,774 --> 01:45:38,610
We only had the weekend
because Edward had to get back to work.
