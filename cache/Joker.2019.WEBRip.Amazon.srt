 Good morning.

 It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on this
Thursday, October 15th.

00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:20,930
 I'm Stan L. Brooks, and here's 
what's happening. 

7
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:23,544
 It's day 18 
of the garbage strike, 

8
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:26,329
 with 10,000 tons of garbage 
piling up every day. 

9
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:29,625
 Even the nicest sections 
of the city are looking like slums.

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,682
 Health Commissioner 
Edward O'Rourke is

 declaring a city-wide 
state of emergency 

12
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:35,430

[O'Rourke] There's no need
to wait until somebody dies

14
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:39,342
 or comes down 
with typhoid fever. 

15
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,518
 It's already 
a serious situation. 

16
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,954
[news anchor] 
It's something that affects 

17
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:46,088
 almost everyone in the city, no matter
who they are or where they live.

18
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,155
[man 1] You can't 
go down no one avenue

19
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:50,491
 without seeing nothing 
but garbage and rats. 

20
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,051
[man 2] It's starting to 
affect my business 

21
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,691
 when customers can't get in here
because of the garbage situation.

22
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,702
[woman 1] I'm not 
out that long to smell it, 

23
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,750
 but I think to look at it, 
it's terrible. 

24
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,363
[man 3] 
It don't affect me except 

25
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,148
 for the very bad 
smell here. 

26
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,323
 It's horrific. 

27
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:06,063
[woman 2] It's a mess. I've been in this
country for 50 years, 

28
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:07,616
 and I've never seen 
anything like it. 

29
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:09,242
 What is this world 
coming to? 

30
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,876
[man 4] Put 'em 
in a room, let 'em sit there

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,074
and talk until 
they get it over with. 

32
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,649
 24 hours, 48 hours, 
how long it takes.

[man 5] The idea of 
the National Guard moving in

34
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:18,381

out there?

Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

Yes, ma'am.

Great.

104

Did you bring it
with you?

Arthur.

106
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,897
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

107
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:35,891
with you
for these appointments.

108
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,640
Can I see it?

109
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:52,481
I've been using it
as a journal,

110
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,548
but also
as a joke diary.

111
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:00,533
Funny thoughts
or observations.

112
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:02,994
I think
I told you

113
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,103
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

114
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,152
No, you didn't.

115
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,960
I think I did.

makes more sense than my life."

How does it feel
to have to come here?

119
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,581
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

120
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:53,837
I think
I felt better

121
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,319
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

122
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,457
And have you
thought more about

123
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:01,991
why you were
locked up?

Who knows?

126
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,410
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

127
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:20,019
to increase
my medication.

128
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:28,640
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

129
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,852
Surely, they must be
doing something.

130
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,327
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

134

I wasn't bothering him.

135

And finally, tonight, 

151
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,194
 just when you thought 
it couldn't get any worse...

 ...authorities are saying 

153

 the city is under siege 
by scores of rats.

 And not just any rats, 

155
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,615
 but super rats, 
who are hard to kill.

getting my letters.

Yeah.

He's a busy man.

Please. I worked
for that family for years.

161
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,889
The least he could do
is write back.

162

Here. Don't get
all worked up. Eat.

163
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,070
You need to eat.

164

00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:00,730
 Tonight, Murray welcomes 
Sandra Winger... 

178
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,764
Oh, Sandra Winger's on.

179
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,680
 ...and the piano stylings 
of Yeldon and Chantel. 

180
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,856
 Joining Murray, 
as always, 

181
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,729
 Ellis Drane 
and his jazz orchestra. 

182
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,557
 And now, 
without further ado, 

183
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:16,430
Murray Franklin.

186
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,487
-Thank you.
-[Arthur cheering]

187
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:32,968
Thank you.

188
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:35,710
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

189
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,712
Yeah!

190
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,801
Wow. Thank you.
Thank you.

191
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,629
Thank you.

192
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:44,066
So, everybody's heard about
the super rats that

193
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,590
-are in Gotham now, right?
-[audience] Yeah.

194
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:50,116
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

195
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,483
You ready for this?

196
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:53,293
Super cats.

197
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,729
[all laughing]

198
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,081
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

199
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,735
[Arthur] I love you,
Murray!

200
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,476
[audience chuckling]

201
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,825
I love you, too.

202
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:05,696
[all laughing]

203
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,437
Hey, Bobby, would you put
the lights on?

204
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,627
Who is that?

205
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,919
Was that you? You wanna
stand up, please?

206
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:13,008
Stand up for me.

207
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,213
Go ahead.

208
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:20,871
What's your name?

209
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:23,627
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

210
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,215
-Arthur?
-My name's Arthur.

211
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,276
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

212
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,415
Arthur, I could tell.

213
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,590
Where are you from?

214
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,461
I live right here
in the city

215
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,462
-with my [stammers] mother.
-[audience laughing]

216
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:35,797
[Murray] Okay,
hold on. Hold on.

217
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:36,941
There's nothing funny
about that.

218
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,730
I lived with my mother
before I made it. Just me and her.

219
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:42,733
I'm that kid whose father
went out for a pack of cigarettes,

220
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:43,822
and he never
came back.

221
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,154
[audience] Aww.

222
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:46,706
[Arthur] I know
what that's like, Murray.

223
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,828
I've been the man of the house for as long
as I can remember.

224
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,612
I take good care
of my mother.

225
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,837
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

226
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,241
She does.

227
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,192
She always tells me
to smile and put on a happy face.

228
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:07,410
She says I was put here to spread
joy and laughter.

229
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:08,890
[audience] Aww.

230
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,285
Wow.

231
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:17,899
I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.

232
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:20,902
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

233
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,425
-[audience cheering]
-Come on! Come on.

234
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:23,949
[upbeat jazz music playing]

235
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:31,347
Come on.

236
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:41,618
[audience cheering loudly]

237
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,930
Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.

238
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:51,498
We'll be right back.

239
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,195
That was great,
Arthur. Thank you.

240
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,980
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

241
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:56,372
It made my day.

242
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,983
Thanks, Murray.

243
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,767
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

244
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,203
the audience,
all that stuff?

245
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:02,465
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

246
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:03,684
to have a kid
like you.

247
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:22,529

-[Randall] What's up, ladies?
-Hey, Randall. What's up?

251
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,078
Another day
in chuckle town.

252
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:51,123
[man] Yup.

253
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:55,779
You okay?

254
00:15:57,738 --> 00:15:59,819
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

255
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,650
Fucking savages.

256
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,491
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

257
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:09,323
No. They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

258
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,665
All the crazy shit
out there.

259
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,406
-They're animals.
-[chuckles]

260
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:19,194
You know what?

261
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,461
Here.

262
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:28,812
What is it?

263
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:29,944
Take it.

264
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:31,946
It's for you.

265
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,646
[chuckling]

266
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,490
[Randall] You gotta
protect yourself out there.

267
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,607
Otherwise, you're gonna
get fucked.

268
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,392
Randall,

269
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:47,483
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.

270
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,586
Don't sweat it, Art.

271
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,793
No one
has to know.

272
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,623
And you can pay me back
some other time.

273
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,405
You know
you're my boy.

274
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,581
[laughing]

275
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,852
[Gary] Arthur,

276
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,455
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

277
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:05,110
Hey, Gary. You know what
I've always wondered?

278
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:06,502
No idea.

279
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:08,330
Do you people call it
miniature golf

280
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,146
or is it just golf
to you?

281
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,073
[Randall and Arthur
laughing]

282
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,699
[man] Punch him
in the dick, Gary.

283
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,212
[laughing]

284
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:34,704
Hello, Hoyt.

285
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:37,512
Gary said you wanted
to see me.

286
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:41,015
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

287
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,364
Not quite.

288
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,497
Just been working on
my material.

289
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,586
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

290
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:48,580
Look,
I like you, Arthur.

291
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:49,699
You know,
a lot of the guys,

292
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:51,285
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

293
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,867
I don't even know
why I like you.

294
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,744
But I got
another complaint.

295
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,353
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

296
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,365
The guy said
you disappeared.

297
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,298
Never even
returned his sign.

298
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,101
Because I got jumped.

299
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:07,353
Didn't you hear?

300
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:09,231
For a sign?

301
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:12,438
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

302
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,570
Just get him
his sign back.

303
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:17,138
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

304
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:19,097
Why would
I keep his sign?

305
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,882
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

306
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,277
If you don't
return the sign,

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,366
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

308
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:29,585
Are we clear?

309
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,024
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.

310
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,157
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

311
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,457
The other guys,

312
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,508
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

313
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,641
because people
think you're weird.

314
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:44,557
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

315
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,036
[Hoyt continues indistinctly]

316
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,347

[jabbing buttons]

319
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:35,260
[Sophie] Wait,
wait, wait.

320
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:36,304
Wait.

321
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,700
Thank you.

322
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:02,678
[GiGi giggles]

323
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,290
This building
is so awful, isn't it?

324
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:10,022
This building is so awful,
right, Mommy?

325
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:12,340
Yes, we can
hear you, GiGi.

326
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:15,300
It's so awful,
Mommy.

327
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:16,388
[imitates gunshot]

328
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,142
Right, Mommy?

329
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:23,308
[elevator bell dings]

330
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:27,050
-Good night.
-[GiGi] This building's so awful,


331
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:28,269
-isn't it?
-Mmm-hmm.

332
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,402
-[baby crying]
-[man shouting]

333
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:34,754
Hey.

334
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:37,539
[imitates gunshot]

335
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,457
Come on.

336
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:50,248
[upbeat music playing]

337
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,250
[door closes]

338
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,484
-[Arthur] Look up.
-[Penny] Mmm.

339
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,437
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

340
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,267
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

341
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,616
What do you think
he's gonna do?

342
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,049
He's gonna help us.

343
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:17,231
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

344
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,277
Why would
he help us?

345
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,965
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

346
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,097
If he knew
how we were living,

347
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,581
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

348
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,429
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

349
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,932
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

350
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,645
Or me.

351
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:41,081
Everybody's telling me

352
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:44,737
that my stand-up's

a guy in full makeup.

536
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:51,643
[man 2] No, it says
right here it was a mask.

537
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:53,949
[man 1] Either way,
I think it's good for business.

of every newspaper.

539

Big man,
what's the good word?

540
00:36:57,866 --> 00:36:59,083
[Gary] Hey.

["My Name Is Carnival"

542
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:04,308
Hey, Arthur, I heard
what happened.

543
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,787
Sorry, mate.

544
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:07,441
[Randall] Yeah.

545
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:08,877
It doesn't seem fair,

546
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,792
getting fired like that.

547
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:12,944
Did you really
bring a gun

548
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,803
to the children's hospital,
Artie?

549
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:17,277
What the fuck
would you do that for?

550
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,713
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

551
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:19,975
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

552
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,150
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

553
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:22,587
[men laughing]

554
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,426
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?

555
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:26,460
It was his gun.

556
00:37:26,504 --> 00:37:28,500
-[Randall] What?
-I still owe you for that,

557
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:29,550
don't I?

558
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,552
What the fuck
are you talking about?

559
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,424
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

561
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:39,908
[Arthur gasps] Oh, no!

562
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:43,347

to punch out.

[Chuck on TV] And as our city 
tries to make sense 

566
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:19,687
 of the brutal triple murder 
on the subway last week, 

567
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,341
 we're joined 
by Thomas Wayne. 

568
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,988
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

569
00:38:24,022 --> 00:38:25,345
Yes, Mother.

570
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,648
[Thomas] Thanks for 
having me on, Chuck. 

571
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,523
[Penny] They're asking him about those
horrible subway murders.

572
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,743
[Chuck] Thank you, Thomas. 
I know 

573
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,787
 this is a difficult time 
for you. 

574
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:34,615
Why him?

575
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,661
Looks like
he's gained weight.

576
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:39,098
[Thomas] Yes, all three worked 
for Wayne Investments. 

577
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:40,926
 Good, decent, educated. 

578
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:43,921
 Although I didn't know 
any of them personally. 

579
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:49,238
 Like all Wayne employees,
 past and present, they're family.

580
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:51,066
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

581
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,685
-[shushing]
-[Chuck] There now seems to be 

582
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,177
 a groundswell 
of anti-rich sentiment in the city. 

583
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,159
 It's almost as if our 
less fortunate residents 

584
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,510
 are taking the side 
of the killer. 

585
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:00,841
[Thomas] Yes, 
and it's a shame. 

586
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,730
 It's one 
of the reasons why 

587
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,172
 I'm considering 
a run for mayor. 

588
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:06,293
 Gotham's lost its way. 

589
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:08,881
 What about 
the eyewitness report 

590
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:11,403
 of the suspect being a man 
in a clown mask? 

591
00:39:11,957 --> 00:39:13,673
[Thomas] Well, it makes 
total sense to me. 

592
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,570
 What kind of coward would do something 
that cold-blooded? 

593
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,877
 Someone who hides 
behind a mask. 

594
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,400
 Someone who is envious 

595
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:24,055
 of those more fortunate 
than themselves, 

596
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:26,994
 yet they're too scared 
to show their own face. 

597
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:30,074
 And until those kind of people 
change for the better, 

598
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:34,371
 those of us who have made 
something of our lives 

599
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,521
 will always look 
at those who haven't 

600
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:39,089
 as nothing but clowns. 

601
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,885
[laughs]

602
00:39:40,908 --> 00:39:43,249
 Thomas Wayne, thank you for 
coming in this morning. 

603
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,293
It's not funny.

604
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:05,967
[laughs]

605
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,444
I heard this song
on the radio the other day,

606
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:15,107
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

607
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:17,457
[social worker] Arthur...

608
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,676
Which is crazy,

609
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,660
because that's
my clown name at work.

610
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,171
And until
a little while ago,

611
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:31,018
it was like
nobody ever saw me.

612
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,755
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

613
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,779
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

614
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,396
You don't listen,
do you?

615
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,338
I don't think you ever
really hear me.

616
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:52,738
You just ask the same questions
every week.

617
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:56,770
"How's your job? Are you having
any negative thoughts?"

618
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,723
All I have are
negative thoughts,

619
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,786
but you don't
listen anyway.

620
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,472
I said,
for my whole life,

621
00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:11,076
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

622
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:13,992
But I do.

623
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:18,958
And people are
starting to notice.

624
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:22,371
They've cut our funding.

625
00:41:23,044 --> 00:41:24,858
We're closing down
our offices next week.

626
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,397
The city has cut funding
across the board.

627
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:30,120
Social Services is
part of that.

628
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,236
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

629
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:34,708
Okay.

630
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,212
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

631
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:44,811
And they really
don't give a shit

632
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:46,203
about people
like me, either.

633
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:51,246
Fuck.

634
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:01,663
How am I supposed
to get my medication now?

635
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,053
Who do I talk to?

636
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:10,618
I'm sorry, Arthur.

637
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:17,211
 I think... I think most women look at sex
like buying a car. 

638
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:20,002
 You know, like, "Can I see myself 
in this long-term?" 

639
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:21,919
 "Is it safe?" 

640
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:24,149
 "Is it reliable?" 

641
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:26,499
 -"Could it kill me?"
-[audience laughing] 

642
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,845
 Most guys, we look at sex 
like parking a car. 

643
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:30,523
 We're like, 
"There's a spot." 

644
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:32,513
 "There's another spot. 

645
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:34,012
 -That would work."
-[Arthur exhales deeply] 

646

Never mind."

00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,188
 Thanks for watching. 

703
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,269
 Good night, 
and always remember, 

704
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:45,149
 -that's life.

[softly] That's life.

707
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,858
Momma, time to wake up
and go to bed.

708
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,410
-Hmm? Oh...
-[grunting]

709
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,732
Oh, Happy.

710
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,346
Happy, I wrote
a new letter.

711
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:10,744
Come on,
dance with me.

712
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:13,525
[Penny] For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

713
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,569
[Arthur whistles]

714
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:18,530

[Arthur humming]

716
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,231
You smell like cologne.

717
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,886
It's 'cause I just had
a big date.

718
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,714
[chuckles] Oh.

719
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:33,153
Just don't forget
to mail it.

You're gonna kill me.
You're gonna give me a heart attack!

726
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:10,689
Don't give me your...

727
00:49:10,753 --> 00:49:12,818
-[pounding on door]
-[Penny] No. No.

728
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:15,952
I'm not talking
to you until you stop being angry!

729
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,257
Okay.

730
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:18,389
Okay.

731
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:24,462
I'm not angry, Mom.

732
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,586
I'm not angry.

733
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,095
Please.

734
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,925
Mom, is this real?

735
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,192
He's an extraordinary man,
Happy.

736
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,992
He's a very
powerful man.

737
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:45,104
We were in love.

738
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:48,926
He said it was best that
we not be together

739
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,812
because of appearances.

740
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,344
And I could never
tell anyone because...

741
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:00,648
Well, I signed
some papers.

742
00:50:02,476 --> 00:50:04,130
And besides,
you can imagine

743
00:50:04,174 --> 00:50:07,908
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

744
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:11,659
What they'd say
about you.

745
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:17,883
What would
they say, Mom?

746
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:19,406

[Arthur continues humming]

750
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:07,949
[Arthur] Hmm.

751
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:10,561
[Arthur exhales deeply]

752
00:52:18,786 --> 00:52:19,918
Hmm.

[Arthur singing]

756
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:52,080
Hi.

757
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,389
What's your name?

758
00:52:57,651 --> 00:52:58,962
I'm Bruce.

759
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,525
Bruce.

760
00:53:03,233 --> 00:53:04,745
I'm Arthur.

761
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:28,116
That's better.

762
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,017
[Alfred] Bruce! Bruce!

763
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,503
Get away
from that man.

764
00:53:33,536 --> 00:53:35,089
It's okay.
I'm a good guy.

765
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:36,801
What are you doing?
Who are you?

766
00:53:37,604 --> 00:53:39,229
I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne.

767
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:41,956
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

768
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:44,855
Why did you give him
these flowers?

769
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:46,407
[Arthur] No,
they're not real.

770
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,498
It's magic.

771
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:51,705
I was just trying to
make him smile.

772
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:53,414
Well, it's not funny,
is it?

773
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:55,927
Do I need
to call the police?

774
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,865
[Arthur] No. Please.

775
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,560
My mother's name
is Penny. Penny Fleck.

776
00:54:02,063 --> 00:54:03,410
She used to work here
years ago.

777
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:05,481
Can you please tell
Mr. Wayne I need to see him?

778
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:07,926
You are her son.

779
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,240
[Arthur] Yeah.

780
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:10,991
Did you know her?

781
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:17,069
[whispers] I know about
the two of them.

782
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:19,427
She told me everything.

783
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:24,216
[whispers] There's nothing
to know.

784
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:26,996
There is no "them."

785
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:29,896
Your mother
was delusional.

786
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:32,355
She was
a sick woman.

787
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:34,634
Don't say that.

788
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:36,902
Just go.

789
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:38,452
Mmm?

790
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:40,537
Before you make a fool
of yourself.

791
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:44,742
Thomas Wayne
is my father.

792
00:54:44,806 --> 00:54:45,977
[Alfred laughing]

793
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:49,197
[Alfred yelping]

794
00:54:49,737 --> 00:54:51,330
He left me.

795
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:52,859
[Alfred choking]

796
00:54:53,577 --> 00:54:55,513
-Let go! Let go!
-[Arthur grunts]

797
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:57,989
[Alfred continues choking]

798
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:05,997
[panting]

799
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,362
Keep the respirations
above 15.

800
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:26,212
Slow and steady. We got some
stairs coming up.

801
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:28,062
Mom?

802
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:29,924
What happened?

803
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,312
-Who are you?
-I'm her son.

804
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:33,459
-What happened?
-You can probably help us

805
00:55:33,503 --> 00:55:35,103
out inside. We don't know
what happened yet.

806
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:36,810
-Hop in the back of the ambulance.
-[paramedic 2] Step.

807
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:38,513
[paramedic 1] One more.
We got one more lift.

808
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:39,552
[paramedic 2] I'm getting

809
00:55:39,595 --> 00:55:40,914
a little resistance here,
Michael.

810
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:43,251
[paramedics chattering
indistinctly]

811
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:44,706
[paramedic 1] Lift.

812
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:51,477
[Arthur] I'm right here.

813
00:55:51,521 --> 00:55:52,587
Excuse me, sir.

814
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,268
Does your mother take
any medications?

815
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:55,323
-No.
-Excuse me,

816
00:55:55,337 --> 00:55:56,656
-I couldn't hear you.
-No.

817
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,139
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

818
00:55:58,172 --> 00:55:59,267
I don't know.

819
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:02,183
[siren wailing]

820
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:45,436
[Garrity] Mr. Fleck.

821
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,752
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

822
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:50,970
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

823
00:56:51,494 --> 00:56:54,192
We had a few questions
for you, but you weren't home,

824
00:56:54,322 --> 00:56:57,195
so we spoke
with your mother.

825
00:56:58,936 --> 00:56:59,937
Oh.

826
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:02,635
What did you
say to her?

827
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:03,810
Did you do this?

828
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,464
What? No.

829
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,437
No, no, no. We just asked her
some questions,

830
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,034
and she got hysterical.

831
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:10,979
Hyperventilating,

832
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:12,532
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.

833
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:14,806
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

834
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,075
We're sorry to
hear about that.

835
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:20,958
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

836
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:22,597
They're about
the subway killings

837
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,700
that happened
last week.

838
00:57:23,743 --> 00:57:24,962
You've heard
about them, right?

839
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:26,224
Yeah.

840
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:27,399
It's horrible.

841
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,572
Right.

842
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:32,839
So, we spoke with your boss
over at Haha's.

843
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,972
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

844
00:57:35,015 --> 00:57:36,452
into the children's hospital.

845
00:57:37,975 --> 00:57:39,677
-Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
-It was a prop.

846
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:41,356
It's part
of my act.

847
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:43,546
I'm a party clown.

848
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,504
All right. So, why were
you fired?

849
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,768
[sighs heavily]

850
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:51,510
They said
I wasn't funny enough.

851
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:53,599
Can you imagine that?

852
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:57,603
If you don't mind, I have to go take care
of my mother.

853
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,180
[Burke] Your boss also gave us
one of your cards.

854
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:04,480
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

855
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,656
is it real,

856
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:08,859
or some sort
of clown thing?

857
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:11,415
-A clown thing?
-Yeah.

858
00:58:12,009 --> 00:58:14,315
I mean, is it part
of your act?

859
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:18,232
What do you think?

860
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:25,629
[Burke] It's exit only.

861
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,701
She's gonna be okay.

862
00:58:56,183 --> 00:58:57,881
I'm gonna
get a coffee.

863
00:58:58,621 --> 00:58:59,709
You want one?

864
00:58:59,752 --> 00:59:00,753
Yeah.

865
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:13,853
[audience laughing on TV]

866
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:16,987
[Murray] So, the other night, 
I told my youngest son Billy, 

867
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,764
 you know, the new one, 
the not-so-bright one. 

868
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:22,231
 I told him, 
"The garbage strike 

869
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:23,820
 is still going on, Billy." 

870
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:25,691
 And he says, and I'm not kidding, 
Billy says, 

871
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:27,693
 "So, where are we gonna get 
all our garbage from?" 

872
00:59:27,737 --> 00:59:29,913
-[laughs]
-[audience laughing]

873
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:31,392
[audience applauding]

874
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:37,442
 And finally, in a world 
where everyone 

875
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:39,096
 thinks they could 
do my job, 

876
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:41,108
 we got this video tape 
from Pogo's Comedy Club, 

877
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:42,506
 right here in Gotham. 

878
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,953
 Here's a guy who thinks 
if you just keep laughing, 

879
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:46,547
 it'll somehow

Oh, my God.

883
00:59:54,709 --> 00:59:58,219
[Arthur on TV] 
I hated school as a kid. 

884
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:01,509
 But my mother 
would always say, 

885
01:00:02,293 --> 01:00:03,687
[imitates Penny] 
"You should enjoy it. 

886
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:06,359
 One day, you'll have to 
work for a living." 

887
01:00:06,863 --> 01:00:08,172
[normal voice] 
"No, I won't, Ma. 

888
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:10,127
 I'm gonna be 
a comedian."

890
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:18,570

listened to your mother.

[audience laughing
and applauding]

892
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:22,525
 Hey, one more. 
One more, Bobby. 

893
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:24,648
 All right, let's see 
one more. I love this guy. 

894
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:27,423
[Arthur] It's funny, 

895
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,166
 when I was 
a little boy 

896
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:32,419
 and told people I was gonna 
be a comedian, 

897
01:00:32,932 --> 01:00:34,558
 everyone laughed at me. 

898
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:36,997
 Well, no one's 
laughing now. 

899
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:41,419
[audience laughing]

900
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:43,124
 You can say 
that again, pal.

[audience applauding]

902
01:00:49,122 --> 01:00:52,082
 All right, we got 
a great show for you tonight. 

903
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:55,433
 Chuck Conby is here, 
actress Joanne Mulligan, 

904
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:59,306
 and new music from 
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

905
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:07,924
[news anchor] As tensions 
mount around the metro area,

906
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,480
 Mayor Stokes has pleaded for 
cooler heads to prevail. 

907
01:01:11,494 --> 01:01:13,451
 City services 
have been affected, 

908
01:01:13,494 --> 01:01:15,540
 and some businesses 
have decided 

909
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:18,289
 to remain closed 
amid the unrest. 

910
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:20,731
 Chuck Stevens 
filed this report. 

911
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:22,515
[Chuck] The anger 
and resentment 

912
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,333
 that's been building 
in the city for weeks 

913
01:01:24,357 --> 01:01:25,956
 seems close to exploding. 

914
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,248
 Protesters, many dressed 
as clowns, 

915
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,793
 took to the streets today 

916
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:31,469
 in one of several planned 
demonstrations

917
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:33,166
 taking on 
the city's elite, 

918
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,994
 including a massive rally 
outside 

919
01:01:35,038 --> 01:01:37,335
 tomorrow night's 
benefit at Wayne Hall. 

920
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:39,119
[reporter 1] 
What's the point of all this?

921
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,174
[bleep] the rich.
[bleep] Thomas Wayne. 

922
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:43,052
 That's what this whole[bleep] 
thing is about. 

923
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,767
[bleep] the whole system. 

924
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,092
[Chuck] Wayne, 
who recently announced 

925
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,528
 he is running for mayor, 

926
01:01:47,572 --> 01:01:49,356
 will be attending 
the benefit. 

927
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,532
 You might remember 
it was Thomas Wayne 

928
01:01:51,576 --> 01:01:52,799
 who first referred to 

929
01:01:52,823 --> 01:01:55,698
 many of Gotham's residents 
as "clowns." 

930
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:58,715
 Today, he offered 
little in the way of an apology. 

931
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:00,716
 Well, what 
I will say is, 

932
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:01,928
 there's something wrong 
with those people. 

933
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,144
 I am here 
to help them. 

934
01:02:03,188 --> 01:02:04,537
 I'm gonna 
lift them out of poverty, 

935
01:02:04,571 --> 01:02:05,763
 help make 
their lives better. 

936
01:02:05,816 --> 01:02:07,225
 That is why 
I'm running. 

937
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,073
 And they may not realize it, 
but I'm their only hope. 

938
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:11,727
[protesters shouting]

939
01:02:25,828 --> 01:02:28,700
[protesters] Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

Can I help you, pal?

950

I don't know
what to say.

Do you want an autograph
or something?

954
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:23,919
No.

955
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,372
My name is Arthur.

956
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:34,842
Penny Fleck
is my mother.

Jesus.

958
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:39,935
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.

959
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:43,206
-Yes.
-[Thomas laughs]

960
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:45,221
I'm sorry
I just showed up.

961
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,898
But my mother
told me everything,

962
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,986
and I had
to talk to you.

963
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:50,780
Look, pal,
I'm not your father.

964
01:05:50,844 --> 01:05:52,773
[chuckling]
What's wrong with you?

965
01:05:54,427 --> 01:05:55,951
Look at us.

966
01:05:57,474 --> 01:05:58,866
I think you are.

967
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,651
Well, that's impossible

968
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:02,110
because you're adopted,

969
01:06:02,144 --> 01:06:03,570
and I never slept with
your mother.

970
01:06:03,623 --> 01:06:05,192
-I wasn't adopted.
-What do you want from me?

971
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:06,309
-Money?
-No, I don't...

972
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:07,614
I wasn't adopted.

973
01:06:07,658 --> 01:06:09,173
Jesus.
She never told you?

974
01:06:09,796 --> 01:06:11,077
Told me what?

975
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:12,585
[sighs]

976
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,578
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

977
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:15,829
That's not true.

978
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,301
Why are you
saying that?

979
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:18,625
Then she was arrested
and committed

980
01:06:18,669 --> 01:06:19,931
to Arkham State Hospital,

981
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:21,454
when you were
just a little boy.

982
01:06:21,498 --> 01:06:22,803
Why are you
saying this?

983
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,414
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

984
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:26,163
I know
it seems strange.

985
01:06:26,207 --> 01:06:27,824
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

986
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:29,675
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.

987
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:30,938
I don't know
why you are.

988
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:32,422
I don't want
anything from you.

989
01:06:32,465 --> 01:06:34,995
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, Dad!

990
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,992
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?

991
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,515
What is it
with you people?

992
01:06:38,558 --> 01:06:40,437
You say that stuff
about my mother.

993
01:06:40,691 --> 01:06:42,084
She's crazy.

994
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,216
She's... [laughing]

995
01:06:51,832 --> 01:06:53,292
You think
this is funny?

996
01:06:54,835 --> 01:06:58,013
Dad, it's me.
Come on.

997
01:06:59,623 --> 01:07:00,798

 Hello, Mr. Fleck. 
This is Detective Garrity. 

1005
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:28,315
 We met the other night 
at Gotham General. 

1006
01:07:28,359 --> 01:07:31,133
 My partner and I had a few more 
questions for you. 

1007
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:34,223
 We stopped by your apartment today, 
but you weren't home. 

1008
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:36,138
 Please give me a call 
when you get this message. 

1009
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,227
 Again, Detective Garrity, 

1010
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:42,454

01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:27,276
[Shirley] This message is 
for Arthur Fleck. 

1015
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:29,104
 My name 
is Shirley Woods. 

1016
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:31,130
 I work on 
The Murray Franklin Show. 

1017
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:32,846
 I don't know 
if you're aware, 

1018
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,326
 but Murray played 
a clip of your stand-up 

1019
01:08:34,349 --> 01:08:36,095
 on the show recently, 

1020
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,595
 and we have gotten an amazing response 
from our viewers. 

1021
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:41,356
 Murray asked me to give you a call 
and see if you're... 

1022
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:47,034
Who is this?

1023
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:48,969
 Oh, hi, 
this is Shirley Woods. 

1024
01:08:49,051 --> 01:08:51,778
 I'm the show booker from
Live with Murray Franklin. 

1025
01:08:51,822 --> 01:08:52,866
 Is this Arthur? 

1026
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:55,879
Yes.

1027
01:08:56,202 --> 01:08:58,117
 Hi, Arthur. 
Well, as I was saying, 

1028
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,278
 we've gotten a lot of calls 
about your clip. 

1029
01:09:00,322 --> 01:09:01,886
 Amazing responses. 

1030
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,443
 And Murray asked 
if I would reach out to you 

1031
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:06,141
 to see if you would 
come on as his guest. 

1032
01:09:11,407 --> 01:09:14,180
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

1033
01:09:14,714 --> 01:09:16,486
 Yeah. 
Isn't that great? 

1034
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,024
 He'd love to talk to you, 
maybe do some of your act? 

1035
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,734
 That sound good 
to you? 

1036
01:09:26,857 --> 01:09:28,643
Yeah, that sounds great.

1037
01:09:29,076 --> 01:09:30,948
 Can we set up 
a date right now? 

1038
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:32,689
 Are you available 
next Thursday?

[clerk] Hey.

1042
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:30,312
[sighs] Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

1043
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,758
All records 10 years
or older, they store in the basement,

1044
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:35,665
and you're talking about something
30 years ago, so...

1045
01:10:37,057 --> 01:10:39,146
Can I ask you
a question?

1046
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,331
Sure.

1047
01:10:40,974 --> 01:10:44,556
How does someone
wind up in here?

1048
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:49,480
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?

1049
01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:51,898
Well, yeah, some have.

1050
01:10:51,942 --> 01:10:54,945
You know,
some are just crazy.

1051
01:10:54,988 --> 01:10:56,976
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

1052
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,254
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

1053
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,473
Don't know what to do,
you know?

1054
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:05,260
-Yeah. I hear you, brother.
-Hmm.

1055
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:08,142
Sometimes, I don't know
what to do.

1056
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:12,606
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

1057
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,992
I thought it was gonna bother me,
but it really hasn't.

1058
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:19,752
What's that?

1059
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,934
I fucked up and did some
bad shit.

1060
01:11:24,997 --> 01:11:26,018
[chuckles]

1061
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:30,052
You know
what I'm talking about,

1062
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:35,379
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.

1063
01:11:37,248 --> 01:11:39,903
Hey, listen, man.

1064
01:11:39,946 --> 01:11:41,776
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

1065
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,123
Like a clerk,
you know.

1066
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:44,734
All I do
is file paperwork.

1067
01:11:45,865 --> 01:11:47,133
I don't know
what to tell you.

1068
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,122
But you should
see somebody.

1069
01:11:49,695 --> 01:11:51,001
You know,
they got programs,

1070
01:11:51,044 --> 01:11:52,839
city services,
stuff like that.

1071
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:54,906
Oh, yeah.

1072
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,039
[in high-pitched voice]
They cut all those.

1073
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:58,878
[clerk laughs]

1074
01:12:01,838 --> 01:12:03,970
All right,
here it is. Fleck.

1075
01:12:04,014 --> 01:12:06,799
Penny Fleck.
Let's see.

1076
01:12:06,843 --> 01:12:11,035
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

1077
01:12:11,978 --> 01:12:16,156
Oh. "The patient
suffers from delusional psychosis

1078
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,154
and narcissistic personality disorder."
Mmm.

1079
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:21,988
"Was found guilty
of endangering

1080
01:12:22,032 --> 01:12:25,207
the welfare
of her own child."

1081
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:34,740
What?

1082
01:12:38,178 --> 01:12:39,615
You said
she's your mother.

1083
01:12:44,576 --> 01:12:45,745
Uh...

1084
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,526
I'm sorry, man. Like I said, I can't
release these records,

1085
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,627
you know,
without proper forms.

1086
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:54,107
I could
get in trouble.

1087
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:56,277
Look, if you want to bring your mom
in here to sign,

1088
01:12:56,301 --> 01:12:57,328
that'll be much easier,

1089
01:12:57,362 --> 01:13:00,319
but I can't let this go without
her signature, okay?

1090
01:13:00,723 --> 01:13:01,724
I'm sorry.

1091
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:08,644
No, man! Shit!

1092
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:10,889
Come on, man.
Give it...

1093
01:13:11,473 --> 01:13:13,779
Hey! Hey!

1094
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,402
[panting]

1095
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:49,162
[door closes]

1096
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:15,667
[Stoner] We went over this, Penny. 
You adopted him. 

1097
01:14:15,711 --> 01:14:18,061
 We have all the paperwork 
right here.

1098
01:14:18,104 --> 01:14:20,498
[Young Penny] 
That's not true. 

1099
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:22,848
Thomas had that
all made up,

1100
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:25,475
so it stayed
our secret.

1101
01:14:25,938 --> 01:14:27,418
[gasps]

1102
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:29,385
[Stoner] You also 
stood by 

1103
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,857
while one
of your boyfriends

1104
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:35,532
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

1105
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,213
and battered you.

1106
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:43,869
[laughing]

1107
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,614
Penny,

1108
01:14:59,668 --> 01:15:02,964
your son was found tied
to a radiator

1109
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:05,682
in your filthy apartment.

1110
01:15:06,065 --> 01:15:08,937
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

1111
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,766
and severe trauma
to his head.

1112

[Arthur laughing]

1113
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:15,510
[Young Penny]
I never heard him cry.

1114
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:18,991
He's always been
such a happy little boy.

1115
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:21,385
[laughing tearfully]

1116

-What are you doing in here?
-[thunder rumbling]

1123
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:32,678
You're in the
wrong apartment.

1124
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,210
Your name's Arthur, right?

1125
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,222
You live
down the hall.

1126
01:17:46,443 --> 01:17:48,227
I really
need you to leave.

1127
01:17:52,536 --> 01:17:55,015
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

1128
01:18:00,631 --> 01:18:01,676
Please.

1129
01:18:04,374 --> 01:18:06,057
I had a bad day.

1130
01:18:09,736 --> 01:18:11,547
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

1131
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,142

Hey, Penny.

1143
01:20:02,971 --> 01:20:04,320
Penny Fleck.

1144
01:20:12,502 --> 01:20:14,330
I always hated
that name.

1145
01:20:17,942 --> 01:20:19,857
You know
how you used to tell me

1146
01:20:21,903 --> 01:20:24,927
that my laugh
was a condition?

1147
01:20:26,081 --> 01:20:28,170
That there was something wrong
with me?

1148
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,478
There isn't.

1149
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:36,943
That's the real me.

1150
01:20:37,527 --> 01:20:39,207
[Penny, weakly] Happy.

1151
01:20:41,226 --> 01:20:43,707
Happy. Hmm.

1152
01:20:47,015 --> 01:20:48,767
I haven't been happy

1153
01:20:49,931 --> 01:20:52,400
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

1154
01:20:58,944 --> 01:21:00,780
You know
what's funny?

1155
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,076
You know what really
makes me laugh?

1156
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:10,374
I used to think that my life
was a tragedy...

01:21:13,824 --> 01:21:15,391
it's a fucking comedy.

01:26:55,861 --> 01:26:57,602
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1228
01:26:57,936 --> 01:26:59,256
I feel
a lot better now.

1229
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:03,913
Oh, okay.
Good for you.

1230
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:09,048
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1231
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:12,226
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,

1232
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:16,273
talking to all the guys about those
subway murders.

1233
01:27:16,317 --> 01:27:18,341
-And, um...
-They didn't talk to me.

1234
01:27:20,059 --> 01:27:22,707
That's because the suspect was
a regular-sized person.

1235
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,761
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1236
01:27:26,805 --> 01:27:28,285
[Arthur laughing]

1237
01:27:31,549 --> 01:27:32,942
Anyway, um,

1238
01:27:32,985 --> 01:27:37,120
Hoyt said that they talked
to you,

1239
01:27:37,163 --> 01:27:38,469
and now
they're looking for me,

1240
01:27:38,513 --> 01:27:40,254
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1241
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,038
Make sure
our stories line up.

1242
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:45,041
-Seeing as how you're my boy.
-Yeah, that's important.

1243
01:27:45,084 --> 01:27:46,839
-That makes a lot of sense.
-You know what I mean?

1244
01:27:46,882 --> 01:27:48,942
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1245
01:27:49,175 --> 01:27:50,264
-[Randall groaning]
-[Gary screaming]

1246
01:27:54,355 --> 01:27:56,008
[Gary] Arthur!

1247
01:27:56,052 --> 01:27:57,358
-No!
-[Randall's head thudding]

1248
01:27:58,707 --> 01:27:59,708
What?

1249
01:28:01,057 --> 01:28:02,058
No!

1250
01:28:03,668 --> 01:28:05,364
-[Arthur panting]
-[Gary sobbing]

1251
01:28:09,979 --> 01:28:12,198
Why would
you do that, Arthur?

1252
01:28:12,242 --> 01:28:14,592
-[breathing rapidly]
-[Gary continues sobbing]

1253
01:28:33,132 --> 01:28:35,352
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

1254
01:28:35,396 --> 01:28:36,788
-[Gary whimpering]
-Yeah.

1255
01:28:38,137 --> 01:28:39,399
I'm gonna be
on tonight.

1256
01:28:40,183 --> 01:28:41,706
[whimpering]

1257
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:46,015
[in cockney accent]
It fucking crazy, innit?

1258
01:28:46,058 --> 01:28:47,346
Me on the telly.

1259
01:28:49,932 --> 01:28:51,490
What the fuck, Arthur?

1260
01:28:53,152 --> 01:28:54,240
[normal voice] What?

1261
01:28:59,245 --> 01:29:00,856
It's okay, Gary.

1262
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:02,118
You can go.

1263
01:29:02,161 --> 01:29:03,162
[Gary groaning]

1264
01:29:04,468 --> 01:29:05,752
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

1265
01:29:09,081 --> 01:29:10,735
Oh!

1266
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,868
Don't look.
Just go.

1267
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:19,330
[Arthur yells]

1268
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,311
[whimpering]

1269
01:29:25,266 --> 01:29:26,403
[crying] Fuck.

1270
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:28,536
[sighs tearfully]

1271
01:29:31,713 --> 01:29:33,018
Hey, Arthur?

1272
01:29:33,062 --> 01:29:34,188
Yeah?

1273
01:29:35,281 --> 01:29:37,845
[stammering]
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1274
01:29:40,586 --> 01:29:41,932
Shit.

1275
01:29:42,376 --> 01:29:43,812
Sorry, Gary.

1276
01:29:54,779 --> 01:29:55,954
Gary?

1277
01:29:55,998 --> 01:29:56,999
Yeah.

1278
01:29:59,523 --> 01:30:01,664
You were the only one that was
ever nice to me.

1279
01:30:04,223 --> 01:30:05,399
Skedaddle.

1280
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:10,534

Hey, Arthur!

1285
01:31:34,139 --> 01:31:35,706
We need to talk.

1286
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,925
[Arthur] Oh!

1287
01:31:36,968 --> 01:31:38,970
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1288
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:45,499
[Garrity] Arthur!

1289
01:31:48,066 --> 01:31:49,677
Watch it!
Out of the way!

1290

[detectives] Hey! Hey!

1294
01:32:09,653 --> 01:32:11,094
[Garrity] Arthur, stop!

1295

[announcer on PA] Now 
departing, O-Train, downtown. 

1297
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:25,273
 Stand clear of 
the closing doors. 

1298
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:28,367
[panting]

1299
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:37,159
Hold that train!
Hold it!

1300
01:32:39,074 --> 01:32:41,380
Get out!
Get outta here!

1301

Next stop, Bedford Park.

Masks off!

1304
01:32:58,615 --> 01:32:59,964
Get your mask off!

1305
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:02,576
Signs down! Now!

1306
01:33:11,715 --> 01:33:13,195
Police! Signs down!

1307
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,458
Signs down.

1308
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:21,513
What the fuck!

1309
01:33:22,552 --> 01:33:24,206

-[man] Beat his ass!
-[crowd shouting]

1311

What the...

1320

Arthur!

1321

-[Arthur laughing]
-[crowd shouting]

1323
01:34:03,811 --> 01:34:05,290
Don't do it!

1324
01:34:17,781 --> 01:34:18,782
[laughs]

1325
01:34:55,123 --> 01:34:56,733
 Two officers on the train 

1326
01:34:56,777 --> 01:34:58,088
 were violently confronted 
by the crowd, 

1327
01:34:58,122 --> 01:34:59,562
 and tonight are in serious 

1328
01:34:59,605 --> 01:35:01,825
 but stable condition 
at Gotham Metropolitan.

1329
01:35:01,869 --> 01:35:03,827
-[laughs] 
-We're going live now to 

1330
01:35:03,871 --> 01:35:05,432
 co-anchor Courtney Weathers, 

1331
01:35:05,546 --> 01:35:07,439
 who's standing by outside 
the Bedford Park Station, 

1332
01:35:07,483 --> 01:35:09,441
 near where the shooting 
took place. 

1333
01:35:09,485 --> 01:35:11,400
 Courtney, what's the 
scene there? 

1334
01:35:11,443 --> 01:35:12,662
[knocking on door]

1335
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:13,707
[door opens]

1336
01:35:16,361 --> 01:35:17,711
Murray.

1337
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,277
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1338
01:35:19,321 --> 01:35:21,715
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1339
01:35:22,803 --> 01:35:23,978
Thank you, Murray.

1340
01:35:25,196 --> 01:35:26,656
I feel like
I know you.

1341
01:35:27,459 --> 01:35:29,418
I've been
watching you forever.

1342
01:35:29,461 --> 01:35:30,724
Thank you.

1343
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:32,247
What's with the face?

1344
01:35:32,290 --> 01:35:34,292
I mean, are you part
of the protest?

1345
01:35:34,336 --> 01:35:35,685
No.

1346
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:37,475
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1347
01:35:37,948 --> 01:35:39,404
I don't believe
in anything.

1348
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:41,822
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.

1349
01:35:41,865 --> 01:35:43,473
For your act?
Didn't you hear

1350
01:35:43,497 --> 01:35:45,273
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1351
01:35:45,296 --> 01:35:46,652
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1352
01:35:46,696 --> 01:35:48,000
No, I hadn't heard.

1353
01:35:48,393 --> 01:35:49,636
-Yeah.
-You see? This is

1354
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,204
what I'm telling you. The audience is
gonna go crazy if you put this guy on.

1355
01:35:52,248 --> 01:35:54,466
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1356
01:35:54,509 --> 01:35:56,759
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1357
01:35:57,402 --> 01:35:59,709
-We're gonna go with it.
-[Arthur and Murray laugh]

1358
01:35:59,753 --> 01:36:01,276
Thank you, Murray.

1359
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:02,625
Couple rules, though.

1360
01:36:02,668 --> 01:36:04,496
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1361
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:05,927
We do a clean show.

1362
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:07,576
-Okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

1363
01:36:07,629 --> 01:36:09,023
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1364
01:36:09,066 --> 01:36:10,198
I love Dr. Sally.

1365
01:36:10,241 --> 01:36:11,655
Good, good.
Someone will

1366
01:36:11,688 --> 01:36:13,941
-come and get you, okay?
-Okay. Perfect.

1367
01:36:14,194 --> 01:36:15,389
Good luck.

1368
01:36:15,423 --> 01:36:16,544
-Thanks, Murray.
-Okay.

1369
01:36:17,242 --> 01:36:20,774
-Murray, one small thing.
-Yeah.

1370
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,601
When you
bring me out,

1371
01:36:22,645 --> 01:36:24,647
can you
introduce me as Joker?

1372
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:26,294
What's wrong
with your real name?

1373
01:36:26,997 --> 01:36:29,391
That's what you called me
on the show.

1374
01:36:29,434 --> 01:36:30,696
A joker.

1375
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,046
Do you remember?

1376
01:36:32,089 --> 01:36:34,222
-Did I?
-[Gene] I don't know.

1377
01:36:34,265 --> 01:36:36,785
Well, if you say so,
kid, you know, Joker it is.

1378
01:36:36,808 --> 01:36:37,870
It's good.

1379
01:36:37,903 --> 01:36:39,032
Thanks, Murray.

1380
01:36:51,587 --> 01:36:52,806
[gun clicks]

1381
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,380
[Murray] I'll try it,
you know,

1382
01:37:02,424 --> 01:37:04,078
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.

1383
01:37:04,121 --> 01:37:05,470
[audience laughing]

1384
01:37:05,514 --> 01:37:07,037
Maybe my next wife.

1385
01:37:07,081 --> 01:37:08,817
-[Murray laughing]
-[audience cheering]

1386
01:37:10,562 --> 01:37:12,434
You gotta see our next guest
for yourself.

1387
01:37:12,477 --> 01:37:14,828
I'm pretty sure this guy
could use a doctor.

1388
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:15,916
-[audience laughing]
-[Dr. Sally] Oh!

1389
01:37:15,959 --> 01:37:17,787
Does he have
sexual problems?

1390
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:19,920
[Murray] Oh, he looks
like he's got a lot of problems.

1391
01:37:19,963 --> 01:37:21,407
[audience laughing]

1392
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:23,924
All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.

1393

[Arthur laughing

1394
01:37:30,147 --> 01:37:33,170
[Arthur] 
I hated school as a kid.

1395
01:37:34,848 --> 01:37:37,981
 But my mother 
would always say, 

1396
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:39,853
[imitates Penny] 
"You should enjoy it. 

1397
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,638
 One day, you'll have to 
work for a living." 

1398
01:37:42,681 --> 01:37:44,310
[normal voice] 
"No, I won't, Ma. 

1399
01:37:44,344 --> 01:37:45,902
 I'm gonna be 
a comedian." 

1400
01:37:45,946 --> 01:37:47,817

1401
01:37:52,169 --> 01:37:55,912
-[Murray] Okay. You may...
-[audience laughing]

1402
01:37:55,956 --> 01:37:59,307
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.

1403
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,875
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say

1404
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:03,441
that we're
all heartbroken

1405
01:38:03,485 --> 01:38:05,574
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1406
01:38:05,617 --> 01:38:08,011
But this is how he wanted
to come out,

1407
01:38:08,055 --> 01:38:11,406
and honestly, I think we could
all use a good laugh.

1408
01:38:11,449 --> 01:38:14,800
So, please welcome, Joker.

1409

[audience whooping
and whistling]

1412
01:38:56,233 --> 01:38:57,669
Are you
all right, Doctor?

1413
01:38:57,713 --> 01:38:58,975
[audience laughing]

1414
01:39:01,456 --> 01:39:03,937
Well, that was quite
an entrance.

1415
01:39:08,028 --> 01:39:09,551
[scattered laughter
from audience]

1416
01:39:10,465 --> 01:39:11,746
You okay?

1417
01:39:14,175 --> 01:39:15,311
Yeah.

1418
01:39:15,905 --> 01:39:18,603
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1419
01:39:20,562 --> 01:39:22,390
Well, that makes
one of us.

1420
01:39:22,433 --> 01:39:23,913

01:39:23,957 --> 01:39:24,958
[audience applauding]

1422
01:39:29,223 --> 01:39:31,529
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1423
01:39:31,573 --> 01:39:32,961
When we spoke earlier,

1424
01:39:32,964 --> 01:39:35,295
you mentioned that this look is not
a political statement.

1425
01:39:35,318 --> 01:39:36,447
Is that right?

1426
01:39:36,491 --> 01:39:38,058
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1427
01:39:38,471 --> 01:39:40,369
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1428
01:39:40,843 --> 01:39:43,385
-And how's that going for you?
-[audience laughing]

1429
01:39:43,672 --> 01:39:45,152
[laughing]

1430
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,898
So, I know
you're a comedian.

1431
01:39:52,942 --> 01:39:54,833
You been working on
any new material?

1432
01:39:54,857 --> 01:39:56,069
You wanna
tell us a joke?

1433
01:39:56,902 --> 01:39:58,034
[audience applauding]

1434
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:02,691
Yeah?

1435
01:40:04,867 --> 01:40:05,868
Okay.

1436
01:40:09,567 --> 01:40:10,960
[audience laughing]

1437
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:13,528
He's got a book.

1438
01:40:14,442 --> 01:40:15,921
A book of jokes.

1439
01:40:25,757 --> 01:40:27,258
Take your time.
We got all night.

1440

[Murray chuckles]

1442
01:40:33,156 --> 01:40:35,463
Okay, okay.
Here's one.

1443
01:40:38,596 --> 01:40:40,088
Knock, knock.

1444
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:42,905
And you had to
look that up?

1445
01:40:42,948 --> 01:40:44,689
-[laughing]

1446

[audience applauding]

1447
01:40:49,488 --> 01:40:50,948
I want to
get it right.

1448
01:40:53,176 --> 01:40:54,483
Knock, knock.

1449
01:40:54,917 --> 01:40:56,397
Who's there?

1450
01:40:57,876 --> 01:40:59,400
It's the police, ma'am.

1451
01:40:59,443 --> 01:41:01,402
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1452
01:41:01,445 --> 01:41:04,361
-He's dead. [laughing]
-[audience gasps]

1453
01:41:04,405 --> 01:41:05,754
[plays sad note]

1454

-[audience booing]
-Oh, no, no, no.

1455
01:41:07,538 --> 01:41:09,670
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1456
01:41:09,743 --> 01:41:11,672
Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.

1457
01:41:11,736 --> 01:41:14,229
That's not that kind of humor
we do on this show.

1458
01:41:14,632 --> 01:41:16,900
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1459
01:41:16,973 --> 01:41:21,509
It's just, you know, it's been a rough
few weeks, Murray.

1460
01:41:21,552 --> 01:41:23,032
[chuckling]

1461
01:41:23,076 --> 01:41:24,523
Ever since

1462
01:41:27,428 --> 01:41:29,691
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

1463
01:41:29,734 --> 01:41:30,909
[all gasp]

1464
01:41:36,176 --> 01:41:38,091
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

1465
01:41:39,614 --> 01:41:40,801
There is
no punch line.

1466
01:41:42,747 --> 01:41:44,619
-It's not a joke.
-[audience murmuring]

1467
01:41:49,276 --> 01:41:51,230
You're serious, aren't you? You're
telling us you killed

1468
01:41:51,263 --> 01:41:52,888
those three young men
on the subway?

1469
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:54,150
[Arthur] Mmm-hmm.

1470
01:41:54,194 --> 01:41:55,934
And why should
we believe you?

1471
01:41:55,978 --> 01:41:57,936
I got nothing
left to lose.

1472
01:41:59,938 --> 01:42:01,624
Nothing can
hurt me anymore.

1473
01:42:03,725 --> 01:42:05,118
[laughs]

1474
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:08,066
My life is
nothing but a comedy.

1475
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:10,253
[audience booing]

1476
01:42:11,546 --> 01:42:12,666
Well, let me
get this straight,

1477
01:42:12,689 --> 01:42:15,040
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1478
01:42:15,693 --> 01:42:16,894
I do.

1479
01:42:17,347 --> 01:42:19,673
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.

1480
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:22,439
Comedy is subjective,
Murray.

1481
01:42:22,483 --> 01:42:23,831
Isn't that
what they say?

1482
01:42:24,354 --> 01:42:25,786
All of you,

1483
01:42:26,269 --> 01:42:28,681
the system
that knows so much,

1484
01:42:29,054 --> 01:42:31,883
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1485
01:42:31,927 --> 01:42:37,150
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!

1486
01:42:38,455 --> 01:42:40,196
[man] Get him off!

1487
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,750
Well, okay, I think
I might understand

1488
01:42:44,244 --> 01:42:45,767
that you did this to
start a movement,

1489
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:48,378
to become a symbol?

1490
01:42:48,422 --> 01:42:50,119
Come on, Murray.

1491
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:51,338
Do I look like
the kind of clown

1492
01:42:51,381 --> 01:42:52,622
that could
start a movement?

1493
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:55,565
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1494
01:42:56,169 --> 01:42:58,780
Everybody is awful
these days.

1495
01:42:58,823 --> 01:43:00,957
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1496
01:43:01,261 --> 01:43:03,176
[Murray] Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.

1497
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:05,482
That's your defense for killing
three young men?

1498
01:43:06,135 --> 01:43:07,282
No.

1499
01:43:07,876 --> 01:43:11,488
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1500
01:43:11,532 --> 01:43:13,098
[audience booing]

1501
01:43:13,142 --> 01:43:16,583
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1502
01:43:17,277 --> 01:43:19,304
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1503
01:43:19,328 --> 01:43:20,628
you'd walk
right over me!

1504
01:43:20,671 --> 01:43:22,934
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1505
01:43:22,978 --> 01:43:25,371
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1506
01:43:25,395 --> 01:43:26,982
went and cried
about them on TV?

1507
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:29,202
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1508
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:30,767
Yes, I do.

1509
01:43:31,661 --> 01:43:34,859
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?

1510
01:43:34,903 --> 01:43:37,420
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1511
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:42,084
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.

1512
01:43:42,127 --> 01:43:43,981
Nobody's civil anymore.

1513
01:43:44,434 --> 01:43:47,696
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.

1514
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:51,659
You think men like Thomas Wayne
ever think

1515
01:43:51,702 --> 01:43:53,571
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1516
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:56,707
To be somebody
but themselves? They don't.

1517
01:43:56,751 --> 01:43:58,927
They think that
we'll just sit there

1518
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:01,582
and take it,
like good little boys!

1519
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,845
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1520
01:44:03,888 --> 01:44:05,279
You finished?

1521
01:44:05,673 --> 01:44:08,153
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1522
01:44:08,197 --> 01:44:09,764
You sound like
you're making excuses

1523
01:44:09,807 --> 01:44:11,331
for killing
those young men.

1524
01:44:11,374 --> 01:44:13,289
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1525
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:14,725
not everyone is awful.

1526
01:44:17,032 --> 01:44:18,338
You're awful, Murray.

1527
01:44:18,381 --> 01:44:20,383
Me? I'm awful?

1528
01:44:20,427 --> 01:44:21,811
Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?

1529
01:44:24,344 --> 01:44:25,823
Playing my video.

1530
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,775
Inviting me
on this show.

1531
01:44:30,219 --> 01:44:33,483
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1532
01:44:33,527 --> 01:44:35,616
You're just like
the rest of them.

1533
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:37,705
You don't know the first thing
about me, pal.

1534
01:44:37,748 --> 01:44:40,447
Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.

1535
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:42,318
There are riots
out there.

1536
01:44:42,362 --> 01:44:43,885

01:44:45,234 --> 01:44:46,454
You're laughing.

1539
01:44:46,498 --> 01:44:49,325
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1540
01:44:49,369 --> 01:44:50,848
I know.

1541
01:44:53,416 --> 01:44:54,939
How about
another joke, Murray?

1542
01:44:54,983 --> 01:44:56,550
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1543
01:44:56,593 --> 01:44:57,942
-What do you get...
-I don't think so.

1544
01:44:57,986 --> 01:45:00,641
...when you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1545

with a society
that abandons him

1546
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:04,590
and treats him
like trash?

1547
01:45:04,624 --> 01:45:05,690
Call the police, Gene!

1548
01:45:05,714 --> 01:45:07,163
-I'll tell you what you get!
-Call the police.

1549

fucking deserve!
