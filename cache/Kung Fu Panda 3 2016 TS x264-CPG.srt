KUNGFU PANDA 3 (TELKAH CINE BETINYU) :D
Banda Aceh, 11 February 2016 with Google Translate
Subbed By Rizdar Wien Argum Gayo

2
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,165
I have two "justice saucers"?

3
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,205
Three. - And what tofu sandwiches.

4
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:21,025
The spicy noodle soup for Tiger. With extra sauce?

5
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,255
Apart.
- Apart.

6
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:26,636
You can do it.

7
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,676
Turn it on, Dragon Warrior. - Defend the valley.

8
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:36,175
Turn it on, Dragon Warrior. - Defend the valley.

9
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,486
Nobody does the dramatic pose, either?

10
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:46,081
Should we pose at each landing?

11
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:49,374
Never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance.

12
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,894
I've heard some masters win a fight by throwing a door.

13
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:57,646
Dramatic entrance?

14
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,031
The Dragon Warrior is right.

15
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:03,666
Really? I was just ... Yeah, that's right.

16
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:06,987
At the stroke of the fist, comes the battle of the mind.

17
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:09,960
Therefore, the dramatic entrance.

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,973
What a great dramatic entrance.

19
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,706
What's the occasion? - Today is my last day of classes.

20
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:31,171
You last? I did not even know you were sick?

21
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:33,300
Although you looked pretty ... - I'm not sick.

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,768
healthy, one bit. Very well actually.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,240
It's my last day of class, because as of now ...

24
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:43,952
you are trained by the Dragon Warrior.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,680
What?

26
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:52,583
I teach? Why not Tiger? She tells everybody what to do.

27
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,611
Be still, Po. - See?

28
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:57,888
Tiger is not the Dragon Warrior. That's you.

29
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,306
These are the fiery five. What can I learn from them?

30
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:05,336
There is always something to learn. Even for a master.

31
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,361
For example, these sets.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,338
The dramatic departure.

33
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:14,210
What is that?

34
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:18,841
Is this a joke?

35
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,947
Where did he go? - Master.

36
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:27,286
He is gone. It is well. - We are waiting for your instructions, Master.

37
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:30,622
You only have to lose our respect.

38
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,167
How bad can it be?

39
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:43,363
Let's swap. Monkey, 'Unwavering Mountain Shock.

40
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:48,606
I mean, Tiger, 'Tornado backflip. - Yes, Master.

41
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:51,689
Oh nee. Vuur.

42
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:56,049
Sorry. My mistake. Crane go up, I mean down.

43
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:03,622
My claw thingy. - Adder and Tiger as a "Totem Pole ...

44
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:09,503
technique. Julie two a swarm insect bites with a yellow jacket "...

45
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,751
spicy tuna ...

46
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,305
Well done, Po.

47
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:27,926
Have you learned anything? - Yes, you can not teach.

48
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:30,810
And Tiger is obviously flammable.

49
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:40,008
That was an absolute disaster.

50
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:43,270
Glad I do not have Po. - What a loser.

51
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:46,850
How do Shifu. - What about Oogway did.

52
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:53,658
I think he heard us. - No, it is not.

53
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,861
He said you're a loser.

54
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,603
I'm sorry, Oogway.

55
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:15,519
Want to do more? - How was your first day?

56
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:17,816
Humiliating. - I've heard it.

57
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,532
Whose? Tiger.

58
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:24,463
I've heard of Monkey, Crane, Mantis your father, and Mrs. Chow souvenir shop ...

59
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:28,187
and those ducks we saw before, and I heard it from Tiger.

60
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,495
She has also said that it does not happen anymore, because I quit.

61
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,636
Teaching, or humiliated?

62
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:36,664
Both of them. I do not know why you thought I could learn some class.

63
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:39,173
I knew you could not. - What?

64
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,565
Why did you fail me?

65
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:46,467
If you do only what you can do you will never be more than you are now.

66
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:49,411
I do not want anymore. I am happy with myself.

67
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,185
You do not even know who you are.

68
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:55,508
Of course it is. I am the Dragon Warrior.

69
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:59,344
What does that mean exactly? Dragon Warrior.

70
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,552
It means kicking and hitting.

71
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:09,084
And defend the valley.

72
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:10,960
Kicking and hitting?

73
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,994
Do you think Master Oogway it had in mind for you?

74
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:19,698
completed a five hundred year old prophecy, so you can spend your days ...

75
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:23,963
to fall on him? And high fivend can run through the village?

76
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:31,586
Oogway saw something in you. Against all knowledge.

77
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,447
More than you can see in yourself.

78
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,990
There awaits a stunning effect.

79
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:42,168
It surpasses your wildest imagination.

80
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:02,049
What was that? - That was Chi.

81
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:04,746
Wat is Chi?

82
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:09,397
The energy that flows through all living beings.

83
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:13,250
So when I teach, I can too?

84
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,539
No, if you are a teacher, I can do it.

85
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:22,147
It requires self-control to control Chi.

86
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:28,012
Oogway was 30 years in one cave. With the question...

87
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,775
'Who am I?'

88
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:31,658
'Who am I?'

89
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,544
I'm lucky if I get five minutes before you interrupt.

90
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,568
So I have now for 30 years alone in one cave?

91
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,575
Finally. After teaching controlled.

92
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,706
Teaching? I can never be like you.

93
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,956
I'm not trying to change me.

94
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:49,752
I'm trying to change yourself.

95
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:56,290
I change myself? Wait? Is that true ...

96
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,519
You're almost there, Shifu. Even more confusing and you will be the next Oogway.

97
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:06,182
Sorry, no offense, Master Oogway, it is ....

98
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:09,631
I'll let you go back to your eternal peace.

99
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:54,169
What is this place? - The farm of my brother.

100
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,801
If I were you, would you die?

101
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,604
And?

102
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:04,767
The mortal realm.

103
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:08,802
Did you hear that, Oogway? I am back again.

104
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:13,068
Kai is back.

105
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,819
Wie; - Kai. Generaal Kai.

106
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,271
The highest warlord China.

107
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:25,158
No. No idea. - The Jade Butcher. Master of pain.

108
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:28,345
You know me I think as' The Beast of Vengeance. "

109
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:30,394
The Widow Maker.

110
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,810
I once worked for Oogway.

111
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:39,243
Oh Oogway. A great warrior. - Yeah, we know ...

112
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:41,817
Enough. Silence.

113
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,244
Search Oogways students and bring them to me.

114
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:01,833
By the time I've destroyed them ...

115
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:06,493
none remains about which name you will remember.

116
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:10,451
Kai is coming.

117
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,774
I'm ready...

118
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,951
to teach you a lesson. - Learning?

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,294
No. It's the Dragon Master. - He is so handsome.

120
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,320
Thanks for the compliment.

121
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,596
Teach me do not die.

122
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,465
Hello, Dad. How is it going?

123
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:36,824
I just stopped by for a bath.

124
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:42,721
Good. What's wrong? - Nothing.

125
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,390
Nothing? I come home and you sit in the bath with your dolls.

126
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,550
Action Figures. - Instead of using bath salts ...

127
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,965
take peppercorns. - What?

128
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,576
My Gems.

129
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:03,009
There is indeed something wrong. - Tell your father just about everything.

130
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,593
Put your arm.

131
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,703
According Shifu I do not know what it means to be a Dragon Warrior.

132
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,752
And now I must teach.

133
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:13,739
I thought I knew who I was. If I'm not the Dragon Warrior, who am I?

134
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,171
A teacher who teaches kung fu?

135
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,490
That's a promotion. Take it to work.

136
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,551
If you take over the palace one day, then I sell my noodles in the lobby.

137
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:30,399
Why are you still in the bath as a baby? Out. Rise.

138
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:34,428
Company Expansion waiting. - And the Dragon Warrior look-alike contest?

139
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,334
Mrs. Chow who always wins.

140
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,734
En de Drakenkrijger dumplingwedstrijd?

141
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:44,706
I have to defend my title. - No one will break your dumpling record.

142
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:47,328
Someone is about to break your record.

143
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:53,356
Those who eat my dumplings? - And who pays for it?

144
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:56,557
101, 102 ...

145
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:07,353
103.

146
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,762
Is that a new record?

147
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,710
Who are you?

148
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:24,278
Ik ben Li Shang.

149
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,765
I'm looking for my son.

150
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:35,534
You lost your son? - Yes. Many years ago.

151
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,587
I lost my father. - Sorry.

152
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,502
Thanks.

153
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,339
I wish you the best. - You too.

154
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:50,595
I hope you will find your son.

155
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:54,012
And I hope you will find your father.

156
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:07,938
Son? You're right.

157
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:11,514
Do not stand there. Give your father a hug.

158
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:16,164
I can not believe you're here now.

159
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:24,512
I thought I had lost you forever. Little Lotus.

160
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:30,766
This is quite embarrassing, but you confuse me with one panda named Lotus. I am Po.

161
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:34,025
Of course. You can never ...

162
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,449
Little Lotus was the name that you got when you were born.

163
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:38,921
Really? - Really.

164
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:43,504
I can not believe you're here now. This is amazing.

165
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,708
Dad? Say hello to ...

166
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,694
I do not know what to call you. - He just said his name is Lee.

167
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:55,152
Come here you.

168
00:12:56,115 --> 00:13:00,274
Thank you properly care for my son.

169
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:07,347
Your son? Wait. How do we know that this stranger or one akin?

170
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,418
Look. Our bellies are like brothers.

171
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:15,152
Let me teach belly dancing.

172
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,065
Like looking in a mirror dikmaak.

173
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,597
I can not believe we're in the picture.

174
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,485
I get it still does not. Po was still the only surviving panda?

175
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,092
No. There are many more. - True?

176
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:40,676
A hidden panda village in the mountains. - A hidden Panda ...

177
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:46,946
How did you know where I was? - Because the message I received.

178
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:51,145
How could you receive something if nobody could find?

179
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:53,435
That sounds suspicious.

180
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,677
It was a message from the universe.

181
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:01,759
Why are you a Dragon Warrior?

182
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:05,818
How did you know I was that? Through the universe?

183
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:11,272
No. The courier and the souvenir shop. I bought this little cup.

184
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,824
Of course.

185
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,930
You have no idea. I have so much to show you. You will be very proud.

186
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,539
I'm not terribly proud.

187
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,965
Yet to enter a few.

188
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:35,835
Do you have property asthma? Is this a family thing?

189
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:38,672
Dad, are you going to find this amazing.

190
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:40,578
It's the coolest place ever.

191
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,367
Hero Gallery.

192
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:48,481
All Kung Fu priceless artifacts from China.

193
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:52,207
This place is really ... - Great! Did you say that?

194
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,376
Because that's it. - Really.

195
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:58,693
Be careful. Everything is fragile here. Like the urn whispered Warriors.

196
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,407
Someone broke once.

197
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,130
Who? - A fool.

198
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:08,181
Master Rhinos armor. - Do you think it fits me?

199
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,977
Unbelievable. I also asked myself.

200
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,645
Whether it suits me? - No, if I can handle it.

201
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,742
Dad, you have to look.

202
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,142
Master Rams crossbow. The 'Infinite Gates Breaker.

203
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:22,253
Pap. Look. Helmets master Rats army. They are so small.

204
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,941
Master Dolfijns waterproof armor. It's my favorite.

205
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:29,968
Look, the legendary fighter rickshaw.

206
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,465
How cool.

207
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:38,620
What are you doing? We are allowed to touch anything. - Sorry. Will I recover?

208
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:42,783
Yes please. But it is you.

209
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:46,488
How does it feel? Itches? Smells of rhino?

210
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,837
Feels impenetrable? Can you give a thousand warriors?

211
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,816
And remain unscathed?

212
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:57,035
Yeah, it's pretty cool this.

213
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,339
Where was this for? I pull it on.

214
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,477
I think I just peed.

215
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:17,863
Anything else we can try?

216
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,262
Search.

217
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:28,297
Master...

218
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,257
Thumb War. - I got reinforcement.

219
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,987
It is so nice ...

220
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,456
Here we go. - Cool.

221
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:48,243
Calm down. - All is well with me.

222
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,686
Dolphin attack.

223
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:54,353
You've got me. - Dolphin attackers retreat.

224
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:56,538
Catch.

225
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,999
I was not ready yet.

226
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:04,121
I give him back. - I've got it. Higher.

227
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:09,819
I'll get you. - Come on, Master Rhino.

228
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:11,058
Here I come over.

229
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:26,833
I'll take you to graze.

230
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:32,388
Who do you graze?

231
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:38,221
Master Rhino. - What is it?

232
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:50,937
Boys. You'll never guess who just showed up.

233
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,510
Try it. - Your father.

234
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:58,040
How did you know? Of course. We look like each other.

235
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:02,652
Pap. Say goodbye to my friends. Mantis, Tigress, Monkey, Crane. Viper.

236
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,922
Viper right? - Monkey, sir.

237
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:06,789
They're my best friends.

238
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:10,060
This is Master Shifu. A legend.

239
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:13,595
It's an honor to meet you.

240
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:18,522
Maybe you want father to accompany us to the training room. Your son teaches.

241
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:25,092
He is tired. You are tired. He is tired. I bring him to the chrysanthemums suite.

242
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:28,610
Tired? I feel fine. It seems to me only to see teaching you.

243
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:31,860
It is better to see me fight.

244
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:34,671
What is that? - Our valley is attacked.

245
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:38,305
We are being attacked? - This is perfect.

246
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,493
Now you see what it's like to be the Dragon Warrior.

247
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,866
Follow me.

248
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:52,935
Enemies of justice. Get ready for war ...

249
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:54,564
Is this a joke?

250
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:05,543
Who are those green guys?

251
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,445
Jade Zombies.

252
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,223
Zombies?

253
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:16,173
Lotus. Be careful. - It is well. I do this every day.

254
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:21,886
I recognize these guys. Master Das twins.

255
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:24,650
The "Crashing double gong technique.

256
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,263
Yes that's them. And that guy is ...

257
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,345
Meester Stekelvarken.

258
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:35,468
he died a century ago?

259
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,407
These are legends.

260
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,518
Make a quick sketch of us.

261
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,289
Is it successful?

262
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:51,233
I blinked. we do another one?

263
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:58,382
I am strangled by Master Porcupine. This is really fat.

264
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,283
This is you. - Po, concentrate.

265
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:06,728
Notice of the universe? I will give you a message.

266
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,613
Stay away from my son.

267
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:13,417
Sorry, Dad. I'll clean it up later. - Not my good pan. Take this.

268
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,488
Lotus, pas op.

269
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,541
Dad, look at my calamity dumplings again.

270
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,393
Got it.

271
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,195
I see you.

272
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:45,967
Your Chi will soon be mine.

273
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:48,666
Is he talking to me. - Who? They all talk.

274
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:50,888
You're right. That's so scary.

275
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,284
Let's try. Maybe they find that scary.

276
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:56,483
First let's make a plan. Otherwise it's not scary. But stupid.

277
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,079
They do not talk. Idiots.

278
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,477
I'm talking. Kai.

279
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:04,193
Who? - Enough.

280
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:12,311
Did you see that?

281
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,195
Green smoke disappeared. Shifu what was that?

282
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,151
Kai;

283
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,700
No, never heard of.

284
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:27,387
Where is it? There is so much wisdom here that I can not find anything.

285
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,621
Behold.

286
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,045
All the answers are here.

287
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:39,623
What? Nothing?

288
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,466
Is this a joke? Not again.

289
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:48,343
Wait a second. Sorry. Good. Here we go.

290
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:51,730
It was written by Oogway.

291
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:56,127
I once had a brother. - Oogway had a brother?

292
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,088
Brother weapon.

293
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:01,764
He says a brother in arms. - Can you roll it all the way?

294
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:07,301
I was an ambitious young warrior. And led a large army.

295
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,003
Kai fought by my side.

296
00:22:12,943 --> 00:22:15,101
My best friend.

297
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:22,487
One day we were attacked. I was badly injured.

298
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:27,667
My friend has carried me for days. Looking for help.

299
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:32,394
Until we saw a secret village. High in the mountains.

300
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:35,542
An ancient healing place spot.

301
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,244
A panda village.

302
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,405
Panda's? - Yeah, panda's.

303
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:47,202
Pandas used their chi to heal me.

304
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:53,913
They taught me to give Chi.

305
00:22:56,906 --> 00:23:02,686
Kai wanted that power only for themselves.

306
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:08,192
He saw what you could give, it can be taken away too.

307
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,856
I had to stop him.

308
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:21,236
Our struggle has made the earth shake.

309
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,471
Until I left Kai banished to the spirit realm.

310
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,384
Should he return to the mortal realm ...

311
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:33,507
he can only be stopped by one full Chi Master.

312
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:36,617
A true Chi Master? Just like you.

313
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:38,770
I can barely make a flower bloom.

314
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:41,340
I need at least another 30 years, and a cave.

315
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:54,390
I can teach you.

316
00:23:55,553 --> 00:24:00,823
You can do that? - Of course, I'm a panda.

317
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:04,138
That must be the reason why the universe sent you here.

318
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,111
What should I do?

319
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:09,390
You should come home with me.

320
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:12,005
To the secret village?

321
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:15,888
You must rediscover what it means to be a panda.

322
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,630
You have to learn to live like a panda. Sleep like a panda.

323
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:22,220
Eating like a panda.

324
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:26,895
The 103 dumplings that was just the beginning.

325
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:30,409
I found all that I ate too little.

326
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:35,099
Po You can not take away from me. I want a second opinion.

327
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,951
Shifu? Make another roll open.

328
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:41,010
I think he should go. - Fine. A third opinion?

329
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:46,109
Monkey? Viper? Tiger? - You heard Shifu and Oogway.

330
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,954
It can only be stopped by someone who has mastered Chi.

331
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,646
And I can only control Chi, if I know who I am now really.

332
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,539
I'm a panda.

333
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:01,909
I'll pack your lunch on the go.

334
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:12,300
Do you think Chi Po in time to control it? - It does not matter what I think.

335
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:16,402
But what about the universe. - Is that a no?

336
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:20,292
What do we do? - You're going to find out where Kai is.

337
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:23,785
Follow the trail of the Jade beings, but they do not fall to ...

338
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:27,390
as with any enemy he is facing, Kai becomes stronger.

339
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,636
Why me? Because I asked? - No, because you can fly.

340
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:35,057
Go ahead. - You should have said nothing.

341
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:38,602
And take Mantis. - What? Because I...

342
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:10,179
Lunch break. - You do not ask me twice.

343
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:13,668
Papa -? Ja.

344
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,426
What are you doing here? - What I do? getting back pain.

345
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:20,492
Did you really get up every stone?

346
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:24,002
No. Why are you here? - What could I do?

347
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:26,261
If the store does not have your favorite food?

348
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:29,984
You can not save the world on an empty stomach.

349
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:32,646
I consider my presence mission critical.

350
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:37,005
We may not share the location of the village with others.

351
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:41,400
So ... - You think I can not keep a secret?

352
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,856
Po I have for 20 years been brought up before I told him he was adopted.

353
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,795
Really? - Yes.

354
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,335
Well then. It would be cruel to let you back now fly.

355
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,752
You can fly? - I am a bird, Po.

356
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:14,439
We are here.

357
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,859
It seems extremely high.

358
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:24,988
My son hates stairs. Let's go home.

359
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,555
We are pandas. We do not kick in.

360
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:30,221
I am waiting my whole life for those words.

361
00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:02,007
Is this the secret panda village? No wonder you can 't hide.

362
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:06,060
If I could live here, I would tell no one.

363
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:14,314
Now you may say WoW. - WoW.

364
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,838
Li is back.

365
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,041
They are back both. - He found his son.

366
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:56,604
They made it. - He found his son.

367
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,767
Moment. We komen.

368
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,182
He made it.

369
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:05,096
Why do we run?

370
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:10,815
He made it. - Li Shang's back.

371
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:25,521
come all standing around us. This is my son.

372
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:29,391
Triplets. - I'm Ku Ku.

373
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,391
And I Shuai Shuai. - My name is Meng Meng. He smells like cookies.

374
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:36,934
He is as handsome as his father. - Thanks.

375
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:40,826
These are your cousins. And Dim Sum.

376
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:43,285
I have nephews. - Welcome.

377
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,804
Bread on a chain. - We call it Snack Less.

378
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,864
We make another one.

379
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,025
It's you.

380
00:29:52,177 --> 00:29:56,560
What good to see you. - I have no idea who you are.

381
00:29:56,689 --> 00:30:00,142
Striped baby. So beautiful.

382
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:04,485
Careful. That is my action figure. - Can I keep her?

383
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,990
Problem. That's why I brought her. Take good care of her.

384
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:12,540
Striped baby.

385
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:17,027
She looks like me, but as a baby.

386
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:25,957
You look like me, but old. And you're also like me, but thicker.

387
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:29,543
Do you also like me, but ...

388
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,805
with a hat.

389
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,731
You all look like me.

390
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,657
Let's celebrate in honor of my son.

391
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:45,851
Pandas do not run, we roll.

392
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:53,058
Have you ever seen someone who looked so ridiculous?

393
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,101
What are you doing?

394
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:13,917
You're right. That's better than walking.

395
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:22,273
Which panda now do not know how he should roll?

396
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:24,538
I did not know that pandas did.

397
00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:27,519
What pandas are you? You have a weird neck.

398
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:29,129
I'm not a panda. What is that?

399
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:32,737
My hat. My wings. My dumplings.

400
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:35,687
No more questions. Go away, kid.

401
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:38,184
I packed your chopsticks. Thanks, dad.

402
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,266
What? - What are those for?

403
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,521
Here you can eat dumplings with it.

404
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,825
Do you eat only one at a time?

405
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:56,454
I knew I was not much ate as I could.

406
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:13,177
I'm Mei Mei.

407
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:16,834
She is amazing. She is so beautiful.

408
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,386
That's sweet, Po. Keep all compliments until after the performance.

409
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:27,043
I? I said...

410
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:30,633
Mouth closed. After the performance.

411
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,214
It has already begun?

412
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,703
Best ribbon dancer in the world.

413
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:42,236
That says said. - Do not look.

414
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:44,766
You can not, do you?

415
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:50,169
Why she keeps staring at me? - Try to follow it.

416
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:54,912
I can not dance. - Of course it is.

417
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:57,556
Pandas can dance.

418
00:32:57,581 --> 00:33:01,356
I know what you're thinking. How a panda can now be so beautiful.

419
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:06,289
For me?

420
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:13,898
Help me, Daddy's. - You're doing great, son.

421
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:17,373
Your turn.

422
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:35,919
It's gonna be fine.

423
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,779
I have so much to learn.

424
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,733
Wings monitoring.

425
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,837
How do you do that? You say wings ...

426
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,178
something. That does not mean it is something special.

427
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,981
I say, "antenna effect". Whether...

428
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:00,628
"Create brisket sandwiches.

429
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:04,029
Wings of disagreement.

430
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:08,768
Master Bear, Chicken Master, Master Crow, what are you doing here?

431
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,863
Green creatures have attacked our village. We followed them.

432
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:18,257
They are there to worry.

433
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,079
Master Shifu had advised us ...

434
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,602
not to engage in the struggle ... - We have to go into it.

435
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,762
Master Shifu said ... - Are you really scared now?

436
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,553
Even Master chicken goes into it. And he's a chicken.

437
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:43,562
I'm going in there. - Mantis, we have orders to ...

438
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:46,465
They need our help. I go by air, you over the ground.

439
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:49,724
No, wait. - Here comes the bug.

440
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:52,813
Well, you little ...

441
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:55,713
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming. - Aerial of power.

442
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:57,775
That worked. - Mantis.

443
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:04,040
Mantis?

444
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:06,470
Mantis?

445
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:24,497
Your Chi is strong. Like that of your friend, the beetle.

446
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:26,456
Mantis.

447
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:39,973
Do not worry, little bird. I'm going to use your good Chi.

448
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:45,403
To destroy the Jade Palace, and everyone who is in it.

449
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:46,684
No.

450
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,391
Wings up.

451
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:09,721
First day panda training. I'm going to bloom, flower.

452
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:16,383
What is it? - I'm ready for the panda training.

453
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,744
Learning to be a panda. Chi master. save the world.

454
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:22,105
Pandas sleep until after midnight.

455
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:25,304
Lesson number one. Go back to bed.

456
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:26,807
Of course.

457
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:31,643
No one said this would be easy.

458
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:40,932
I overslept? - Yes, definitely.

459
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:45,690
Show him, children. - Can you do this and do that?

460
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:47,972
Is this good?

461
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,399
I understood.

462
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:55,643
Panda, Vangen. - Ga maar ROLLEN.

463
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,545
Po lunchtime.

464
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:09,047
Let the hill tell you where you need to roll over.

465
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:14,217
Beginners error. - Dim Sum, lets see how we do it.

466
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:18,473
It's beautiful. - Snack Time.

467
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,707
Can you fly? - I am coming...

468
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,610
Pick them when they are cold.

469
00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:30,701
What are you doing there? That food is for Po.

470
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:40,081
Do you feel relaxed? - Totally.

471
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:43,197
Let yourself fall into it. - Got it.

472
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,278
It's okay ...

473
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:52,416
Go ahead. Pour it out.

474
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,346
Well done, son.

475
00:37:55,508 --> 00:37:56,903
Go out.

476
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,750
Let my noodles alone.

477
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:10,227
Very subtle, Po. - Give me some.

478
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:14,035
Let my ...

479
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:21,214
We love noodles. - Like my Po.

480
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:28,531
What are you looking at?

481
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:37,721
How we roll. Canyon ball.

482
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:01,050
How is that?

483
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,946
Try again. But do not mind your best.

484
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:19,632
Much better.

485
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:28,904
Thanks, dad. - What?

486
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:32,999
Just. Because you show me how it feels.

487
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:35,643
To be a panda.

488
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:41,719
If you think I'm ready? To become a Chi Master.

489
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,314
Very soon.

490
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,765
Come on. I want to show you something else.

491
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:54,324
Sorry about the mess. I do not often visit.

492
00:40:04,578 --> 00:40:08,038
Is this my mummy?

493
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:16,575
I made this on your hundredth day.

494
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:21,334
Your mom could not keep you quiet.

495
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,444
You ate almost the paper.

496
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:27,158
It's true. - How was she?

497
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:32,502
She had it all.

498
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:36,854
Smart, beautiful.

499
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:39,925
A great appetite.

500
00:40:40,424 --> 00:40:42,924
She was the love of my life.

501
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:47,184
And just when I thought I could not be happier ...

502
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:51,217
you came. My little Lotus.

503
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,674
I had it all really.

504
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:00,819
Until that one moment ...

505
00:41:04,452 --> 00:41:07,164
when I...

506
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,637
all lost.

507
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:53,214
Dad, do not worry. You will never lose me again.

508
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:04,444
there Give me some of it.

509
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,867
This is from the eastern provinces.

510
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:17,733
That's the lizard.

511
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:21,183
Master Ox, Master Eagle. All.

512
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:26,989
In each village from the sea up here every Master in China ...

513
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,874
disappeared. - Maybe they're all at a party.

514
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:32,355
Monkey. - I'm not invited.

515
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:34,473
Kai has taken away their Chi.

516
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:39,226
We are the only ones still standing between him and the remaining knowledge ...

517
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:40,959
in our care.

518
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:44,374
Evacuur the villagers. - Done, Master.

519
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:47,267
Crane, Mantis. - Still nothing.

520
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:49,331
Wait, there they are.

521
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,295
Kai.

522
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:17,296
Beautiful, very awkward.

523
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:20,699
How dare you come here.

524
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:23,123
Look at you pathetic idiots sometimes.

525
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:27,166
Crawling at the feet of the great Oogway.

526
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:29,925
You are not worthy to speak his name.

527
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:32,148
I'm not worthy, little kitten?

528
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:39,456
I fought at his side, and loved him as a brother.

529
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,265
And he betrayed me.

530
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:51,119
Now I will destroy everything he has created.

531
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:53,289
Hurry up.

532
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:16,773
What do you say to a little kitten?

533
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:35,215
I will not let you destroy Oogways memory by you.

534
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:38,164
Why not? He who has destroyed me.

535
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:41,917
Mantis, it's me. You monkey.

536
00:44:46,563 --> 00:44:49,626
Sorry, Tiger.

537
00:45:05,531 --> 00:45:08,580
Shivu. - Bring them to me.

538
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:21,537
No, warn Po. - Master, please.

539
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:34,586
I'll show you the true power of Chi, brother.

540
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:37,419
No.

541
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:16,220
Oogway, forgive me.

542
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:21,770
Do you forgive him, Oogway?

543
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,175
You can then have destroyed the Jade Palace ...

544
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:27,565
but you'll never succeed.

545
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:32,078
There will always be someone who holds you back.

546
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,657
Who? Panda? He has a strong Chi, but ...

547
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,695
it will not be enough.

548
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:43,607
He will suffer the same fate as you.

549
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:47,079
And every panda in that village too.

550
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:12,586
He is so handsome.

551
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:16,833
A handsome panda hug.

552
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:01,703
Tiger?

553
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:06,612
Who is she?

554
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:13,319
Large Skazy Dazy. - What are you doing here?

555
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,837
Kai has attacked the valley. He took each master in China.

556
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,638
Shifu and others. It's all gone, Po.

557
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,361
Everything, everyone. - Everybody?

558
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:25,861
Everybody. - How's my restaurant?

559
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:30,107
We'll talk later. - Now he comes over here.

560
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:34,028
He's after you, Po. Behind all the pandas.

561
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,931
How long do we have? - Not long.

562
00:48:37,007 --> 00:48:39,508
Please tell me that you are the Chi master.

563
00:48:39,573 --> 00:48:42,026
Take the baby. Who belongs to this.

564
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:44,516
Teaching me the secret Chi technique. - No.

565
00:48:44,517 --> 00:48:48,365
You need more time. Grab your stuff.

566
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:52,645
I have to learn it now. - Sorry, you're not ready yet.

567
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:54,537
Pack everything. - I'm ready for it.

568
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,436
Not quite. - I've done everything you asked.

569
00:48:57,546 --> 00:49:01,006
I have a nap under the knee, sleep, hammocks, hot tubs.

570
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:02,998
I share one with my panda.

571
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,103
Why do you want me to learn? - I do not know it.

572
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,446
I do not know it.

573
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:15,081
Nobody can do it. Maybe used to be.

574
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:18,031
Not any more. - You lied?

575
00:49:18,108 --> 00:49:19,882
No.

576
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:24,769
Yes. - Why?

577
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:29,108
To save your life. I find out that one with knife-wielding idiot ...

578
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:31,817
coming to get you. What should I do?

579
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:35,770
It just happen? - Yes, I am the Dragon Warrior.

580
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:38,332
Idiots to face is my job.

581
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:41,270
Because of you I have unprotected left the valley.

582
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,280
And my friends.

583
00:49:43,379 --> 00:49:46,372
And now they're all ...

584
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:48,152
This had happened to you also.

585
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:54,227
I've already lost, that does not happen to me again.

586
00:49:55,288 --> 00:49:56,906
I can not do that.

587
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,101
You've just done.

588
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:29,035
I'm so worried about you. I can not even enjoy my right.

589
00:50:29,131 --> 00:50:32,158
Run as fast as you plump legs can carry you.

590
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:35,368
I can not go anywhere racing. - What are you going to do?

591
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:41,666
I'll stay and fight that monster. - He's otherwise still your father.

592
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,910
He did not, but Kai. - No.

593
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,330
Hungry? - Not really.

594
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:35,887
One then.

595
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:40,813
You lied alone.

596
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:46,137
I have not gone because I thought Po hunger would get.

597
00:51:46,162 --> 00:51:49,844
I was worried about you. - I'd get hungry?

598
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:54,769
No, you would take away from me Po. - I would do what?

599
00:51:54,952 --> 00:51:57,289
That was idiotic.

600
00:51:58,186 --> 00:52:03,811
I now know that if you Po have in your life, I can not do less far.

601
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:06,017
It means more to Po.

602
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:11,834
I'm not in his life.

603
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:15,720
Not anymore. - Your son was mad at you.

604
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,986
Welcome to parenthood. - You do not understand.

605
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,334
I lied to him. He never forgive me.

606
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,452
I have long been lying to him for 20 years. He still thinks he came out of an egg.

607
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,071
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons.

608
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:43,649
Look, he is in pain.

609
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:48,383
He is confused, and should still save the world.

610
00:52:49,135 --> 00:52:52,016
He needs both fathers.

611
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,907
This does not work. - It has to.

612
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:14,774
You're not thinking clearly. - Welwaar.

613
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:17,586
Nietus. - Welus.

614
00:53:18,652 --> 00:53:21,440
I saw Kai, and seen what he can do.

615
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,013
But he has not seen what I can do.

616
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:30,989
You hold my finger? - That's my best grip.

617
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:35,478
I have to go to Kai, grab his finger and then back to the spirit realm.

618
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,513
He has an army Jade Warriors.

619
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,074
Everything they see, he sees too. You can not sneak up on him.

620
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:44,066
You'll never get close enough. - It'll work.

621
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,588
He can only be restrained by a Chi Master.

622
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:52,791
You sound just like Shifu. Chi this and Chi it.

623
00:53:52,935 --> 00:53:56,588
I'm not a Chi Master. I'm not sure I'm a Dragon Warrior.

624
00:53:56,692 --> 00:54:00,155
I do not even know if I'm a panda. I do not know who I am.

625
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,814
You're right. I can not stop him and his army.

626
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,128
Unless you yourself have an army.

627
00:54:16,143 --> 00:54:19,429
Do you? - I'm not alone.

628
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:22,951
Us. - All of us.

629
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:35,598
I finally found my son. After all those years.

630
00:54:35,974 --> 00:54:40,057
There is much more than the end of the world to pick us apart.

631
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:44,071
You do not know Kung Fu. - Then you learn us.

632
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:48,924
I can not teach you Kung Fu. I could not learn Kung Fu Tiger.

633
00:54:48,925 --> 00:54:52,110
And they already know Kung Fu.

634
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:57,993
Po, I'm the last person you want to trust now.

635
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:01,987
But, believe me. We can do this.

636
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:06,859
We can learn Kung Fu. We can just as you are.

637
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:11,558
What did you just say? - We can do this.

638
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,208
We can learn Kung Fu. - Thereafter.

639
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:18,954
We can just as you are? - No, you can not.

640
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:22,424
But you do not.

641
00:55:22,425 --> 00:55:25,568
That meant Shifu. I do not have to change in me ...

642
00:55:25,674 --> 00:55:29,875
I have to turn you into yours. - That makes no sense.

643
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:32,354
I know that.

644
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:35,109
Thanks, Dad's. - You're welcome?

645
00:55:35,176 --> 00:55:37,655
I'm going to do something I thought I could never do that.

646
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:40,567
I'm going to teach Kung Fu.

647
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:46,154
Your strength lies in getting the best from yourself up.

648
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,887
Who are you? What are you good at?

649
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:52,168
Where do you like? What makes you, you.

650
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,488
Yeah, fine. Again.

651
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:02,362
Good. Again.

652
00:56:02,397 --> 00:56:04,787
Good. Again.

653
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:11,627
Faster. Turning with ribbons.

654
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:17,055
Hug stump like it's the last time you smooch. Goodbye forever.

655
00:56:17,056 --> 00:56:20,279
Higher and more to the left this time. You can do it.

656
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:25,221
They may not touch the ground.

657
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,731
Try it with this.

658
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:45,103
Well done. With this.

659
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,080
Good. Try it now with this.

660
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,326
They are ready.

661
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,099
What?

662
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,599
Note that I do this, but ten times over.

663
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,557
Here is the only entrance to the village.

664
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,610
The Dumpling Unit is here, and the Biscuits Unit is here.

665
00:57:43,611 --> 00:57:47,049
When I say it, the two units will ...

666
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:52,007
Good. The Dumpling Unit will ...

667
00:57:57,036 --> 00:58:01,295
Remember that this is the point that ...

668
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:07,679
Remember one thing ...

669
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,127
infer the Jombies until I'm so close I finger grip Wuxi ...

670
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:13,883
can do when Kai. Got it?

671
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,065
Pandas, on three.

672
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:20,176
Forget it. I teach you later.

673
00:58:54,602 --> 00:58:58,919
I wish I had you learned this, son.

674
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,933
That's okay, Dad ...

675
00:59:07,531 --> 00:59:08,895
He is here.

676
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,983
That's what I call a dramatic entrance.

677
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:45,187
You must be the Dragon Warrior.

678
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,889
And you must be Kai.

679
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:50,805
The Beast of Revenge. The Widow Maker.

680
00:59:51,392 --> 00:59:53,896
Yes finally.

681
00:59:53,897 --> 00:59:58,606
Thanks. I almost want to save your life. - Really?

682
00:59:58,691 --> 01:00:02,970
Save me just chitchat. But come on.

683
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:07,750
I grab your Chi occasionally those of all other pandas.

684
01:00:07,852 --> 01:00:12,190
Terrible chitchat.

685
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,463
In ... - chitchat.

686
01:00:14,464 --> 01:00:16,727
You puffy, small ...

687
01:00:20,942 --> 01:00:23,377
Make them all off.

688
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:40,954
It's true. You have all become green.

689
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:43,714
Except for you, Mantis. You were already green.

690
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,998
Now? - Wait for the sign.

691
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,173
Here we go.

692
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:05,177
Dumpling Unity, ready? Just go.

693
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:07,062
Belly.

694
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:13,245
Really? - You did it.

695
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:15,067
Sorry, Crane.

696
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,911
Spring rolls Unity, we'll take some.

697
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:35,830
Yesterday, Mr Jombie.

698
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:44,012
I do not know who you are.

699
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,528
Noodle Unit.

700
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:52,241
Get ready to dance with danger.

701
01:01:55,788 --> 01:01:56,845
Beautiful.

702
01:02:09,131 --> 01:02:11,171
Scar Daza.

703
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:17,483
Do it. - You're mean.

704
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:24,665
Fire.

705
01:02:30,235 --> 01:02:31,521
Here it comes.

706
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:37,423
Well done, guys.

707
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:42,060
No, Master Shifu.

708
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:46,281
I can not hit Shifu.

709
01:02:47,272 --> 01:02:50,571
I can do that. - And I.

710
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,358
Duplicate Dad defense.

711
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,526
Goed zo, papa. - Bedankt, papa.

712
01:02:57,728 --> 01:03:00,849
We manage it, son. - Go for it, Dad's.

713
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:10,905
Now we have him. - Stop. Enough.

714
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,460
Let's finish this.

715
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:23,368
Well done, son.

716
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,709
Sorry, buddy. I must return you to the spirit realm.

717
01:03:45,676 --> 01:03:49,314
That did not work. Just try.

718
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:54,076
Wait. It works.

719
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:57,815
No.

720
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:04,963
No, it does not work. Oogway has taught you that trick?

721
01:04:05,496 --> 01:04:08,815
Pity. It only works with mortals.

722
01:04:08,962 --> 01:04:12,882
And I'm a Ghost Warrior.

723
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,464
Come on.

724
01:04:59,423 --> 01:05:01,510
Son. - Po.

725
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:08,715
I was wrong. Sorry. Racing.

726
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:26,020
It was therefore destined to stop me, Oogway?

727
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:31,121
I will tackle Chi, and that of all of them.

728
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,453
And you...

729
01:05:49,997 --> 01:05:54,914
Do you really thought you could send me back to the spirit realm?

730
01:06:00,368 --> 01:06:02,511
You're just a silly mortal.

731
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,651
It only works with mortals.

732
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:10,981
You're right. I can send you not go there.

733
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:15,081
But I can with it to increase. What is that?

734
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:19,314
Po. - Son.

735
01:06:21,636 --> 01:06:23,093
Son.

736
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,026
No.

737
01:06:45,738 --> 01:06:48,964
What happened? Where is Po?

738
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:52,670
He took Kai. He saved us.

739
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:54,351
No.

740
01:06:55,797 --> 01:06:58,491
He saved us, but who saves him?

741
01:07:03,526 --> 01:07:07,717
The spirit realm. It worked.

742
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,512
You've brought me back?

743
01:07:13,018 --> 01:07:15,608
Do not blame me. I tried to end it in the real realm.

744
01:07:15,677 --> 01:07:18,069
Then we end it here.

745
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,250
Come on, son. Fight.

746
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:05,134
We have to help him.

747
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:08,014
all come closer.

748
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:10,581
Come on. This we will succeed.

749
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,607
Po, you taught us what we needed to be.

750
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,257
A father.

751
01:08:32,332 --> 01:08:35,730
A friend. - A dumpling chopper.

752
01:08:35,755 --> 01:08:38,381
A little fighting machine. - A cuddly.

753
01:08:40,495 --> 01:08:42,552
A nunchuckmeisje.

754
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,537
Striped baby.

755
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,025
A family.

756
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:18,359
Beautiful.

757
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,701
Who are you? - I have asked the same question.

758
01:09:42,357 --> 01:09:44,383
I am the son of a panda?

759
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:47,862
The son of a goose? A student?

760
01:09:48,053 --> 01:09:49,673
A teacher?

761
01:09:50,745 --> 01:09:53,773
It turns out that I am all.

762
01:10:02,886 --> 01:10:06,837
I am the Dragon Warrior.

763
01:10:07,181 --> 01:10:09,622
Do you understand? See that big dragon?

764
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,665
Get ready to feel the thunder.

765
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,952
This is fantastic.

766
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:43,876
Buikstoot.

767
01:10:43,901 --> 01:10:45,676
Kick ass.

768
01:10:48,186 --> 01:10:51,376
Maybe have lunch. I'm starving.

769
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:11,830
We're going to do this.

770
01:11:16,281 --> 01:11:17,207
Beware.

771
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:36,314
It took me 500 years to take away Oogways Chi.

772
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:39,897
I'll take yours too, if it takes me another 500 years.

773
01:11:40,043 --> 01:11:42,707
Chitchat.

774
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:56,993
You want my love to Chi? Grab it.

775
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:08,069
Yes, the power is mine.

776
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:16,019
No, that's too much.

777
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:22,485
No.

778
01:12:33,903 --> 01:12:35,293
Where is he?

779
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:46,928
We are back. - I'm still green. It did not work.

780
01:12:46,977 --> 01:12:49,353
So I'm usually out too.

781
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:52,292
Green baby. - No baby.

782
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,808
En Po and?

783
01:12:55,809 --> 01:12:58,508
Have you seen Po? - No. Is not he here?

784
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:04,407
Why is not he back?

785
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,349
Dragon warrior. - Oogway?

786
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:23,631
I can not believe it.

787
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:27,254
You shine all. - You too.

788
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:31,564
What a great cape. If I run it is completely fantastic.

789
01:13:31,565 --> 01:13:33,889
He looks good. You have grown.

790
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:37,959
I must leave the panda buffet. - Become adult.

791
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:42,775
Just as I had hoped, when I sent the message to your father.

792
01:13:42,806 --> 01:13:47,183
You sent the universe post?

793
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:50,394
Because the universe needed you.

794
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:57,608
You finally got the panda to which you were assigned.

795
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:02,192
But how did you know I could do that? - On the first day we met ...

796
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,298
I saw Kung Fu future.

797
01:14:08,154 --> 01:14:10,828
And the past.

798
01:14:12,764 --> 01:14:16,594
I saw the panda who could unite them both.

799
01:14:16,992 --> 01:14:19,589
That is why I chose you, Po.

800
01:14:19,971 --> 01:14:23,474
Kanten Beide van de Ying en Yang.

801
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:27,766
And my true successor.

802
01:14:30,364 --> 01:14:34,638
I? I can not accept. - Yes, take it.

803
01:14:34,797 --> 01:14:36,863
I have a bigger one.

804
01:14:37,996 --> 01:14:42,047
You are enlightened and so. I'm just ...

805
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,903
Really? - Yes.

806
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,760
What are we going to do now?

807
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:03,369
You tell me. - No. Oogway. Do not go away.

808
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:06,419
I'm not going anywhere. I live here.

809
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:12,786
Right. - You must decide whether you stay or leave.

810
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,699
Can I go back? - Who knows.

811
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:19,377
I've never tried it.

812
01:15:45,204 --> 01:15:49,764
Po. - You can really fly.

813
01:15:54,915 --> 01:16:00,050
Daddies. - Son.

814
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:06,581
Disappearing never again. - We thought we'd lost you.

815
01:16:06,746 --> 01:16:11,333
