1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,440
I'll just take it then, Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,140
What would you guys do without me?

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,599
I want 10% of your drugs, and I want you
and your friends to join the <i>kose</i> group.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,960
Yeah just find a seat,
then we can start.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,820
Come outside.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,520
So that's why I was wondering if you wanted
to be in a group with me.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,060
Yeah, I kind of already agreed to
be in a group with...

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,980
- With...
- Even.

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,640
<i>[Hello again.]</i>

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>[Hi how's it going?]</i>

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,519
<i>[Horny, you?]</i>

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,120
<i>[Location?]</i>

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,740
Look at this guy.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,300
Do you think he's handsome?

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,180
This guy.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,840
- I don't fucking know.
- Look!

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,840
Definitely handsome.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,180
Isak, you can say a guy's
handsome without being gay.

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,140
I said he's definitely handsome.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,020
I'm going to meet him, you know.

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,560
You need my confirmation that
he's hot before you meet him?

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,800
He writes that he isn't gay, but
likes to suck cock for fun.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,140
My boy, you have one year and
then you'll be out of the closet.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,920
Eskild, why do you think every guy is gay?

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,220
I don't think every guy is gay, Isak.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,240
But I have quite a good gaydar.

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,800
You know?

28
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:16,240
How does this gaydar work?
What's the characteristic of a gay guy?

29
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Okay.

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,560
A clue, for example, is when someone starts
talking about sucking dick with a stranger.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Right?

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,840
It's also a bit suspicious
when you have a Grindr profile.

33
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
Hi!

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Noora.

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm in Isak's room.

36
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,500
No, it's better now. He's cleaned
up a little. However, it smells…

37
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,380
Yo, what's up people?

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
Straight out of Elvebakken.

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,380
Today I'm talking to my best buddy Even.

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,519
What's up, bro? Tell us about your movie.

41
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,100
The movie is about Captain
America and Vladimir Putin

42
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,380
who are in love with each other.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,800
But they can't be together because
Sarah Palin has bewitched them.

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,920
So when they kiss, a cat dies of AIDS.

45
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,839
Who is this Barbie? Sarah Palin?

46
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,920
No! She's just Barbie.

47
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,840
You always have to have a hot woman.

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,320
- Sarah Palin is considered a hot woman.
- What?!

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,860
Who's your favourite director?

50
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,120
Baz Luhrmann.

51
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,680
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

52
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,060
- Are you kidding me?
- No I'm not kidding you.

53
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,720
- Baz Luhrmann?
- Why are you so skeptical?

54
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,159
He makes cliché movies where the leads die.

55
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
He makes epic love stories, man!

56
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,720
The lead must die,
otherwise it's not an epic love story.

57
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Hello.

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,620
Do you have my stuff?

59
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,900
What stuff?

60
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,780
What stuff?!

61
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,820
I thought you said it wasn't yours.

62
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,780
Can't you just give it to me?

63
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,940
I didn't see your friends at the meeting.

64
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,120
I can't force them to come, can I?!

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,780
Control yo hoes, is all that I'm saying.

66
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,960
- I can't be bothered with this anymore.
- Neither can I.

67
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,860
- Where do you want it?
- You have it?

68
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,060
No! The big compartment.

69
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,480
Sana and Isak! What are you guys doing?

70
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,260
What was it you put in your burqa just now?

71
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,960
- My burqa?
- Niqab, then.

72
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,719
Niqab? You can't name the
garment 10% of your students wear?

73
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you a racist?

74
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,540
- What's it called then?
- It's called a hijab!

75
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,879
Great. Hijab.
But now you guys need to pay attention.

76
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,540
Please, class starts now.

77
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,060
Vilde?

78
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Hi!

79
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,380
I was just thinking, are there
any more <i>kose</i> group meetings?

80
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,779
How unbelievably nice that you're engaging!

81
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,179
We won't have a group meeting this week,
but next week there's the theatre party.

82
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
So we'll have a group pre-drink.

83
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,900
Could the pre-drink maybe be at yours?

84
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,200
Why?

85
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Because my mom is hosting a wine reception,
Eva's house was completely trashed

86
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,480
and Sana's parents are Muslim.
But it could be at yours!

87
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,820
- Maybe...
- What's up here?

88
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,060
Isak will throw next week's pre-drink.
Do you guys want to come?

89
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Eh, group pre-drink?

90
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,080
What the fuck…

91
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,960
Why are you laughing?
Do you think the theatre is stupid?

92
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,739
The theatre will lay the social foundation
for how you'll be at school if you engage.

93
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,060
That's where class, age,
race, sexual orientation...

94
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Hi!

95
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,000
Did you get my messages?

96
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,880
Sorry. No I didn't get them.

97
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,160
We'll have a pre-drink on Friday.
We were wondering if you guys want to come.

98
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,460
Friday?

99
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,380
I don't really know. I think…
- Isak has brain damage. We're coming.

100
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, yeah. Cool. I'll text you.

101
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,920
What the fuck is your deal?
Are you gay or what?

102
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,899
Where do these first
year girls get the confidence?

103
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,500
Why are first year girls inviting
second year guys to a bus pre-drink?

104
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,860
Are they complete noobs?
They're not meant to go after you?

105
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,339
What's the problem with that?

106
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,879
The problem is that there's a system!

107
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,659
If first year girls start sleeping with third
year guys, and second year guys as well...

108
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,220
Who will we sleep with?

109
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,940
I'm available if you want to have sex.

110
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,420
Don't be rude.

111
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,480
- Dude, you're such an idiot.
- What the fuck did you mean by that?

112
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,660
Is she playing me, guys?

113
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm so damn hungover.

114
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
It's Wednesday...

115
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,860
You always have to have a hot woman.

116
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,120
- Sarah Palin is considered a hot woman.
- What?!

117
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,940
Who is your favorite director?

118
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,140
Baz Luhrmann.

119
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,680
Seriously?

120
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,080

125
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,959
- You owe me a drink. Yeah.
- Huh?!

126
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,860
That party Ina and Hedda had together...

127
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,159
You drank almost all of my six pack.

128
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,220
It's you who owes me.
I gave you like three beers at a party.

129
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,920
That was ages ago!

130
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,839
At that one party you didn't have shit,
and I had a six-pack.

131
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,439
You almost finished the
entire fucking six pack.

132
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,320
When I came up to you, you gave me some.

133
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,560
- Why are you saying it's true?
- He gets it!

134
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,680
It goes without saying.

135
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,960
- Eskild will get it for sure.
- Eksild? Eksild will get it.

136
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,199
- Later, guys!
- Text me when we're leaving.

137
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,460
- I'll find out.
- Bye!

Hello.

142
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Going home?

Yeah.

You too?

Nice chat...

Could you maybe buy some beer?

Don't know where I've put it.

Did you draw these?

155
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Yeah.

156
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,760
- They're good.
- Thanks

157

No, but...

Haven't you skipped school yet?

161
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,640
I just skipped class earlier.

162
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,380
You didn't get caught yet?
I skipped a few hours.

163
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,539
- What's the limit?
- The limit is 10 hours.

164
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,399
But if the principal likes you it's 15.

165
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,659
- Really?
- Yeah.

166
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,020
But I don't think the principal likes me.

167
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
What do you listen to
when you listen to music?

168
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,540
- I'm quite a big N.W.A. fan.
- That's what gets you going?

169
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,400
That's what you listen to
when you want to feel though.

170
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,580
Have you listened to anything from Nas?

171
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,420
Nas?

172
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,620
Are you kidding?
You haven't checked that out?

173
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,599
- I've listened to it. Nas. Nas?
- Nas?

174
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,359
- Have you even heard of it?
- I have heard of it!

175
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,940
It doesn't sound like it.

176
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,320
I've heard of it...

177
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,060
You should listen to it later.

178
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,280
That there is a sweaty cheese, man.

179
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,080
I know, I forgot about it
when I went to school today.

180
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,060
It has almost melted.

181
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,800
- Has that happened to you before?
- Yeah, I always forget the cheese.

182
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,720
- You do that too?
- Yeah.

183
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,340
Fuck, that's a problem.

184
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,580
Cheese and keys. Especially cumin cheese. (Word
play on nøkler = keys, and nøkkel = cumin)

185
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,060
Those are the things I forget most.

186
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Beer?

187
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,520
There you go.

188
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

189
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,140
So, what kind of spices do
you want? Let's start with...

190
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,100
- Caribbean Jerk Barbecue.
- Caribbean Jerk sounds perfect! Go ahead!

191
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,220
- Chili?
- Chili? Always chili.

192
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,080
Rosemary?

193
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,059
- Rosemary? Yes, loads.
- Loads of rosemary? Okay.

194
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Let's do this.

195
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,900
- Even more?
- No, this is great.

196
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,600
- Pottagaldrar?
- Pottagaldrar? Eh, yes!

197
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,760
<i>[When should we be at Emma's?
Did you get beer? Answer.]</i>

198
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,021
<i>[Hi we'll start the pre-drink at 7PM. Maria
lives in Torshov, just call when you</i>

199
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:30,407
<i>[guys are outside the 7-eleven, I'll come
out to meet you. When are you guys coming?]</i>

200
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,559
<i>[My friends are also wondering if you
could bring some of the stuff you</i>

201
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,779
<i>[gave me in the bathroom at that party.
Only if it isn't much trouble.]</i>

202
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Cinnamon?

203
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah, fuck it!

204
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,640
I think it's gonna taste like balls.

205
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,520
But we can't go back now.

206
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,440
No, we can't go back now.

207
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,699
<i>[Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.]</i>

208
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,739
I'll just put a little bit more pepper. <i>[Sorry man, Emma and her friends
cancelled the pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.]</i>

209
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,900
<i>[Sorry man, Emma and her friends cancelled the
pre-drink soooo I think I'm just gonna chill at home.]</i>

210
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>[Sorry we forgot some other stuff we were
doing, but we'll join another time.]</i>

211
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,000
Should we put it in the oven?

212
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,820
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

213
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,499
There's something that doesn't
taste right in there.

214
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:38,684
- It's absolutely terrible.

215
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,320
So bad that it was good in a way.

216
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,139
No, it's so bad that it's even worse.

217
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,100
It was you who wanted
to use all the spices.

218
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,260
A lot of cardamom is essential.

219
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,480
Is that the trick?
For it to be good?

220
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,900
- Have you heard rumors about my rapping?
- I actually have.

221
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,220
Come on! Focus!

222
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,080
- What time is it?
- Ten to eight.

223
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,360
I've invited a few friends.
But just stay. We have lots of beer.

224
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,480
- Hi.
- Introduce yourself.

225
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,280
- Hi. Elise. Nice to meet you.
- Isak.

226
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,500
- And this here is Sonja. My girlfriend.
- Sonja. Nice to meet you.

227
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Isak.

228
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,080
Your girlfriend became the
saleswoman of the month.

229
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,224
- Really? What?!

230
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,999
- You're so smart.
- Yeah, yeah.

231
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,780
You must be quite proud.

232
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,340
<i>[Why are you lying?
Talked to Emma and her friends.]</i>
