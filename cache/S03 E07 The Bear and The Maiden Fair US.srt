1
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,129
How far are we?

2
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,884
-About a week, I think.
-You think? You don't know?

3
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,680
When we went to Castle Black,
we took the Kingsroad.

4
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,224
You and your roads.

5
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,601
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

6
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:27,272
You march down the road
banging drums and waving banners?

7
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,065
Most of the time, yes.

8
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,068
How do the men
holding the banners fight?

9
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,487
They don't, really.

10
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,740
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

11
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,870
And the drummers…
is that a great honor, too?

12
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,664
Usually, it's the young boys
banging the drums.

13
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,499
So what good are they?

14
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,586
-They help the men march.
-How?

15
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,381
Well, it's the rhythm.

16
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,136
You mean right foot, left foot,
right foot, left foot, right foot?

17
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,138
You need help remembering that?

18
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,142
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

19
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,729
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

20
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,647
No.

21
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,818
No, you're just gonna light
the biggest fire

22
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,446
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

23
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,324
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

24
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,329
She's right, you don't.

25
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,626
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

26
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,796
Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her sulking about it?

27
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,301
That's because she understands
the way things are.

28
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
And are you gonna share it with me?

29
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,308
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

30
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,229
People work together when it suits them.
They're loyal when it suits them.

31
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,649
They love each other when it suits them.

32
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,692
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

33
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,528
She knows that, you don't.

34
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,698
Which is why you'll never hold onto her.

35
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,175
That rain will cost us another day.

36
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,055
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

37
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,351
-Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
-Prickly? That what you call it?

38
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,937
Might be the least pleasant man
I've ever met.

39
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,731
-Yes, and that is why--
-I've seen wet shits

40
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,692
I liked better than Walder Frey.

41
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,905
Apologies, Your Grace.

42
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,492
Spent too many years
around lancers and pikemen.

43
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,370
I've spent the last two years
nursing wounded men,

44
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,663
watching them bleed and die.

45
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,541
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

46
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,004
Lord Frey will take this delay
as a slight.

47
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,338
He can take it as he likes.

48
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,507
He's getting the wedding he wanted.

49
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,802
He's getting a wedding.
It was a king he wanted.

50
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,557
Edmure is the best match a Frey has had
in the history of their house.

51
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,393
We should all get some sleep.

52
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,142
If you don't put some clothes on,
I can't promise I won't attack you again.

53
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,144
Attack. Attack.

54
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,127
Who are you writing?

55
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,129
My mother.

56
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,050
-Is that Valyrian?
-Gaaa.

57
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,136
Gaaa?

58
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,727
Say hello for me.

59
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,313
Rytsas.

60
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,108
"Ritsas."

61
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,944
That was close enough.

62
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,032
Does she know her daughter's a queen?

63
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,618
Not yet.

64
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,039
That will be a surprise, I expect.

65
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,752
Many surprises for her.

66
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,885
How am I supposed to sit here
planning a war

67
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,553
when you're over there looking like that?

68
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,768
Will you come with me one day to Volantis?

69
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,564
-When all this is over?
-I will.

70
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,234
I promise.

71
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,532
I know she'd love to meet you.

72
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,536
And her grandchild.

73
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,542
What, now?

74
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,299
Are you certain?

75
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,261
Are you angry with me?

76
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,472
Angry?

77
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,894
You're my queen.

78
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,734
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

79
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,278
Maybe one of each.

80
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,156
Don't get greedy.

81
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,377
Can you leave the war for one night?

82
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,506
I love you.

83
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,717
Do you hear me?

84
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,637
I love you.

85
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,113
Most men fuck like dogs.

86
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,159
No grace, no skill.

87
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,495
A few dozen thrusts and done.

88
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,665
You need to be patient. Give her time.

89
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:48,379
Your cock shouldn't go near her
till she's slick as a baby seal.

90
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,717
And then you go inside, but slowly.

91
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,304
Don't jam it in
like you're spearing a pig.

92
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,097
Come on!

93
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,975
Hey, come on.

94
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,989
You think he loves you, is that it?

95
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,784
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

96
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,870
and live with you in some castle?

97
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,374
No, he didn't tell me anything.
He barely talks.

98
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,293
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

99
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,628
giggling like a pair of girls.

100
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,007
-What, you're jealous?
-Of course I'm jealous.

101
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,011
-You should be with one of your own.
-And you're one of my own?

102
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,597
I've never heard a kind word
from your mouth.

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,807
You would if you were mine.

104
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:49,815
I'd tell you that you're beautiful…
and fierce and wild.

105
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,443
I'd be good to you.

106
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,739
You love him?

107
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,123
'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?

108
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,710
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

109
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,799
-You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
-Don't touch me.

110
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,676
You won't love him so much
when you find out what he really is.

111
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,809
Growing up at Winterfell,
all I ever wanted was to escape,

112
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,521
to come here… to the capital.

113
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,982
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

114
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,527
and King's Landing after dark.

115
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,365
All the candles burning
in all those windows.

116
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,869
I'm stupid.

117
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,125
A stupid little girl with stupid dreams
who never learns.

118
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,501
Come on.

119
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,713
Come walk with me.

120
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,802
I remember the first time I saw you
in the throne room.

121
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,680
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

122
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,891
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

123
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,435
and so does my grandmother.

124
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,523
You would have been happy
at Highgarden.

125
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,194
But women in our position must make
the best of our circumstances.

126
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,406
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

127
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,408
I have to marry him.

128
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,705
-Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
-No.

129
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,999
Has he been kind to you?

130
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,876
He's tried.

131
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,838
-You don't want him, though.
-He's a Lannister.

132
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,215
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

133
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,096
I'm sorry.
Here I am complaining to you…

134
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,515
My son will be king.

135
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,603
Sons learn from their mothers.
I plan to teach mine a great deal.

136
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,774
And your son, if I'm not mistaken,

137
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,651
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

138
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,487
and the North someday.

139
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,532
What?

140
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,621
My son… with him.

141
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,958
I'll have to…

142
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,045
We'll have to…

143
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,340
-If it's the pain you're worried about--
-I'm not afraid of the pain.

144
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,636
-Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
-What is it, then?

145
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,265
He's rather good-looking,
even with the scar.

146
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,311
-Especially with the scar.
-He's a dwarf.

147
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,438
And Loras…

148
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,024
Loras.

149
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,489
Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.

150
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,492
Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

151
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,121
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.

152
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,875
Most women don't know what they like
until they've tried it.

153
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,213
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

154
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,006
before we're old and gray.

155
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,718
Tyrion may surprise you.

156
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,429
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

157
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,768
-And that's a good thing?
-It can be.

158
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,438
We're very complicated, you know.
Pleasing us takes practice.

159
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,066
How do you know all this?

160
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,569
Did your mother teach you?

161
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,783
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

162
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,623
-She's a child.
-She's a foot taller than you.

163
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,584
A tall child.

164
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,087
-What's the youngest you've ever had?
-Not that young.

165
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,755
How much older?

166
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,425
Older.

167
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,469
You're a lord, she's a lady.

168
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,973
And a beauty at that.
I don't see the problem.

169
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,685
-Shae isn't going to like it.
-Shae is a whore.

170
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,479
Are you gonna marry her, eh?

171
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,524
How did marrying a whore work out
for you the first time?

172
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,402
I should never have told you about that.

173
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,239
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

174
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,576
All you have to do is get a son
in the Stark girl.

175
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,246
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.
You can rule the North in his name.

176
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,374
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

177
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,587
Two women to despise me
and a whole kingdom to join them.

178
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,799
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

179
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,303
you'll end up the most popular
dead man in town.

180
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,977
You want to fuck that Stark girl.
You just don't want to admit it.

181
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,565
I don't pay you to put evil notions
in my head.

182
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,526
The ones already there don't need company.

183
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,945
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

184
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,784
Evil notions come free.

185
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,901
Your Grace.

186
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,945
Grandfather.

187
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,698
You wanted to speak to me?

188
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,574
Yes.

189
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,328
I'd like a report on the meetings
of my small council.

190
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,083
You're welcome to attend the meetings
of your small council, Your Grace.

191
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,378
-Any or all of them.
-I've been very busy.

192
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,964
Many important matters require
a king's attention.

193
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,424
Of course.

194
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,053
You've been holding
the council meetings

195
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,348
in the Tower of the Hand
instead of the small council chamber.

196
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,016
I have, yes.

197
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,186
May I ask why?

198
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,939
The Tower of the Hand is where I work.

199
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,276
To walk from there to here
would take time,

200
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,028
time I could otherwise spend productively.

201
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,781
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

202
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,326
I would now have to climb
all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

203
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,511
We could arrange to have you carried.

204
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,603
Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east and her dragons.

205
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,981
-Where did you hear about this?
-Is it true?

206
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,109
Apparently so.

207
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,782
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

208
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,078
When I was Hand of the King
under your father's predecessor,

209
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:05,501
the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons
were kept in this room.

210
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,298
The skull of the last of them
was right here.

211
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,885
It was the size of an apple.

212
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,931
And the biggest was the size
of a carriage.

213
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:24,311
Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged
died 300 years ago.

214
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,274
Curiosities on the far side of the world
are no threat to us.

215
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,861
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

216
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,864
and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?

217
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,784
Because we have been told as much
by the many experts

218
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,869
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

219
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,913
on matters about which he knows nothing.

220
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,415
But I haven't been counseled.

221
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,544
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

222
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,632
I should be consulted about such things.

223
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,886
From now on, I will see to it
that you are appropriately consulted

224
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,890
on important matters
whenever necessary.

225
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,648
Your Grace.

226
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,081
Yunkai. The Yellow City.

227
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,505
The Yunkish train bed slaves,
not soldiers.

228
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,465
We can defeat them.

229
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,887
On the field, with ease.
But they won't meet us on the field.

230
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,473
They have provisions, patience,
and strong walls.

231
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,226
If they're wise,
they'll hide behind those walls

232
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,687
and chip away at us, man by man.

233
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,441
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

234
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,360
We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi.

235
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,822
Taking this city will not bring you
any closer to Westeros

236
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,157
or the Iron Throne.

237
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,078
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

238
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
Two hundred thousand, if not more.

239
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,170
Then we have 200,000 reasons
to take the city.

240
00:21:55,272 --> 00:22:00,152
Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz
of that ancient and honorable house,

241
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,614
master of men and speaker
to savages, to offer terms of peace.

242
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,204
Noble lord, you are in the presence
of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,

243
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,626
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

244
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,629
Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.

245
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,967
You may approach. Sit.

246
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,645
Will the noble lord take refreshment?

247
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,243
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

248
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,207
Our empire was old before dragons
stirred in Old Valyria.

249
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,086
Many an army has broken against our walls.

250
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,338
You shall find
no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.

251
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,721
Good. My Unsullied need practice.
I was told to blood them early.

252
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,642
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.

253
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,812
But why?

254
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,148
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

255
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,944
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

256
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,035
The wise masters of Yunkai have sent
a gift for the Silver Queen.

257
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,461
There is far more than this
awaiting you on the deck of your ship.

258
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,381
-My ship?
-Yes, Khaleesi.

259
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,759
As I said, we are a generous people.

260
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,345
You shall have as many ships
as you require.

261
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,763
And what do you ask in return?

262
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,059
All we ask, is that you make use
of these ships.

263
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,312
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

264
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,439
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

265
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,112
I have a gift for you as well.

266
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,740
-Your life.
-My life?

267
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,995
And the lives of your wise masters.
But I also want something in return.

268
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,082
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

269
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,752
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

270
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,507
clothing, and property as they can carry
as payment for their years of servitude.

271
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,179
Reject this gift,
and I shall show you no mercy.

272
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,722
You are mad.

273
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,308
We are not Astapor or Qarth.

274
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,811
We are Yunkai
and we have powerful friends.

275
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,814
Friends who would take great pleasure
in destroying you.

276
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,151
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

277
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,445
Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

278
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,034
-You swore me safe conduct.
-I did,

279
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,206
but my dragons made no promises.
And you threatened their mother.

280
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,500
Take the gold.

281
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:16,264
My gold. You gave it to me, remember?
And I shall put it to good use.

282
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,059
You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.

283
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,977
Now get out.

284
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,152
The Yunkish are a proud people.
They will not bend.

285
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,488
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

286
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,659
He said he had powerful friends.
Who was he talking about?

287
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,370
I don't know.

288
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,497
Find out.

289
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,222
Chains?

290
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,725
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

291
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,770
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

292
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,273
Golden chains.

293
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,651
You could buy a ship with these.

294
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,653
-Do I need a ship?
-What?

295
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,198
-Am I going somewhere?
-Of course you're not going anywhere.

296
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,119
So, am I invited to your wedding?

297
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,248
I didn't ask for this marriage.

298
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,917
-I didn't want it.
-No?

299
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,004
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

300
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,422
That doesn't mean that…

301
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,675
This is duty, not desire.

302
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,969
Is that what you will tell yourself
when you fuck her?

303
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:40,181
-I don't have a choice. My father--
-Does not rule the world.

304
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:49,024
-We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
-What would I do there? Juggle?

305
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,902
I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

306
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,530
And I'm Shae the funny whore.

307
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,034
My feelings for you have not changed.

308
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,996
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

309
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,334
While I empty her chamber pot
and lick your cock when you're bored?

310
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:12,047
-I swear to you, it will not be like that.
-No? What will it be like?

311
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,093
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

312
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:22,640
You will have fine clothes,
guards to keep you safe, servants.

313
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:29,105
Any children we might have
will be well provided for.

314
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:33,276
Children? You think I want children
who can never see their father?

315
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,113
Who would be killed in their sleep
if their grandfather found out about them?

316
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,159
Listen. Listen to me, my lady.

317
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,870
-I'm not your lady.
-You are.

318
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,748
You'll always be my lady.

319
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,629
I'm your whore.

320
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:58,176
And when you are tired of fucking me,
I will be nothing.

321
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,042
-What happened?
-Wildfire.

322
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,087
I should have been here.

323
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,801
After all the running and fighting,
here I am, back where I started.

324
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,762
Do you miss it?

325
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,266
-King's Landing?
-Your father's house.

326
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,269
Never had a father. Never wanted one.

327
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,313
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

328
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,025
-Your talent for fighting?
-I'm lowborn.

329
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,736
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

330
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,823
Mine was a slave. So was I.

331
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,453
Bought and sold, scourged and branded,

332
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,874
until the Lord of Light reached down,
took me in his hand and raised me up.

333
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,629
-I was born in Flea Bottom.
-Your blood is noble.

334
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:22,927
Are you saying my father,
he was some lord or…

335
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,931
There. Your father's house.

336
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,899
I'm just a bastard.

337
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,361
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

338
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,574
First of His Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men.

339
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,244
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

340
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,457
There is power in a king's blood.

341
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,892
Come sit by the fire, child.

342
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,523
Not talking, eh? That's a first.

343
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,817
I don't talk to traitors.

344
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,406
-I didn't like giving up the boy.
-But you did.

345
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,535
You took the gold and you gave him up.

346
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,664
The Red God is the one true god.

347
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,958
You've seen his power.

348
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,752
When he commands, we obey.

349
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,172
He's not my one true god.

350
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,634
No? Who's yours?

351
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,222
Death.

352
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,443
Spotted a Lannister raiding party.

353
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,405
-How many?
-No more than 20.

354
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,574
-How far?
-Less than a day's ride south.

355
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,538
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

356
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,956
Yeah!

357
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,670
But what about Riverrun?
It's not south. It's west of here.

358
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,839
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

359
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,050
-You swore.
-To take you home, and I will.

360
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,054
-But we need to do this first.
-Why? So you can steal their gold?

361
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,681
I swear to you, this isn't--

362
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,309
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

363
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,102
You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.

364
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,855
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters kill you all.

365
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,649
One day you'll understand, but now…

366
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,655
-Anguy, bring her back.
-Come back, girl!

367
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,225
Kick all you like, wolf girl.
Won't do you no good.

368
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,829
-I thought you were gone.
-Tomorrow.

369
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,795
Have they told you
what they plan to do with me?

370
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,007
Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.

371
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,511
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

372
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,805
You're to remain here.

373
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,766
With Locke?

374
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,024
I owe you a debt.

375
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,408
When Catelyn Stark released you,
we both made a promise to her.

376
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,952
Now it's your promise.

377
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,329
You gave your word.

378
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,625
Keep it and consider the debt paid.

379
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,505
I will return the Stark girls
to their mother.

380
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,717
I swear it.

381
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,266
Goodbye, Ser Jaime.

382
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,913
Here. Let me.

383
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,590
It will take time.

384
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,639
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

385
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,974
to give him back his chain.

386
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,728
My father will make him Grand Maester
if he grows me a new hand.

387
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,149
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

388
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,404
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry
I couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

389
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,740
The Lannisters send their regards.

390
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,331
Safe journey, Kingslayer.

391
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,417
Nothing to say?

392
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,586
I liked you better before.

393
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,923
I don't remember
chopping your balls off, too.

394
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:57,553
And don't you worry about your friend.
We'll take good care of her.

395
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,808
Gentle, my lord.

396
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,018
Gentle.

397
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,074
Myranda knows what she's doing.

398
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,951
Let her.

399
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,413
She trained as a septa, only…

400
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,375
she had other urges.

401
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,546
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

402
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,675
-Where is he?
-Who, my lord?

403
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,971
There's no one here but you,
me, and Violet.

404
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,140
Please.

405
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,475
Don't you want us to see it?

406
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,813
Come on. Let us see it.
Everybody talks about it.

407
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,734
-He sent you.
-Who sent us?

408
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,530
We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
We heard so much about it.

409
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,034
Please.

410
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,536
There it is.

411
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,918
Do you think we're ugly?

412
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,962
He thinks we're ugly.

413
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:59,216
Well, he's been through so much.
Look at his poor face.

414
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,303
Help me.

415
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,306
If he comes back…

416
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,977
We need to make him feel better.

417
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,606
And how can we make him feel better?

418
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,691
I have an idea.

419
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,215
She's shy.

420
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,386
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

421
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,807
Maybe he doesn't know how we are.

422
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,239
I felt something.

423
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,578
Lord Greyjoy.

424
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,833
As good as they say?

425
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,429
And why should you get all the fun?

426
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,608
What? You like her better?

427
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,531
Plenty there for both of us.

428
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,660
I was here first.

429
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,628
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

430
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,506
Terrible timing.

431
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,553
But I was getting jealous.

432
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,517
Well?

433
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,355
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

434
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,369
Everyone knows you love girls.

435
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,873
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

436
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,886
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

437
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,431
Would you say
it's your most precious part?

438
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,313
Please.

439
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:06,821
No. No! Mercy, please!
Please, mercy! Mercy!

440
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,614
This is mercy.

441
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,325
I'm not killing you.

442
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,454
Just making a few alterations.

443
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,292
No! No! No!

444
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:25,381
Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!

445
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,302
You're gonna scare it off.

446
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,096
I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.

447
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,891
It's too far away.

448
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,499
Is that a palace?

449
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,129
It's a windmill.

450
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,715
Windmill.

451
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,343
Who built it? Some king?

452
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,096
Just the men who used to live here.

453
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,099
They must have been great builders,
stacking stones so high.

454
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,686
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

455
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,647
"I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell."

456
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,651
"My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived
in a tower that touched the clouds."

457
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,404
If you're impressed by a windmill,

458
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,240
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

459
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,783
What's swooning?

460
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,660
Fainting.

461
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,288
What's fainting?

462
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,670
-When a girl sees blood and collapses.
-Why would a girl see blood and collapse?

463
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,671
Well…

464
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,175
Not all girls are like you.

465
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,595
Well, girls see more blood than boys.

466
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,682
Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?

467
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,020
A spider! Save me, Jon Snow.

468
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,816
My dress is made of the purest silk
from Tralalalaleeday.

469
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,402
I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

470
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,281
Would you?

471
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,536
So I could tear it off you.

472
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,917
Well, you rip my pretty silk dress,
I'll blacken your eye.

473
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,094
Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.

474
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,764
Or maybe one day I'll take you there.

475
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,392
After we've taken our land back.

476
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,105
Ygritte.

477
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,818
You won't win.

478
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,698
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

479
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,784
-You know nothing--
-Six times in the last thousand years,

480
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,036
a King-Beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

481
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:04,331
-Six times they failed.
-And how do you know that?

482
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,667
Every boy in the North knows it.

483
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,503
We grow up learning it.
Where the battles were fought,

484
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,255
the names of the heroes, who died where.

485
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,968
Six times you've invaded
and six times you've failed.

486
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,679
The seventh will be the same.

487
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,598
-Mance is different.
-You don't have the discipline.

488
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,977
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

489
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,021
You don't know how to fight together.

490
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,439
-You don't know that.
-I do.

491
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,816
I know it.

492
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,653
If you attack the Wall, you'll die.
All of you.

493
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,164
All of us.

494
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,017
You're mine as I'm yours.

495
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,395
And if we die, we die.

496
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,523
But first we'll live.

497
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,486
Yes, first we'll live.

498
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,088
What's he going on about?

499
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,883
And how come
he always gets to sit and chat

500
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,718
while we do all the work?

501
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,931
Hodor.

502
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,519
-That's where we are.
-What are you telling him?

503
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,355
-It's all right, Osha.
-It's not all right.

504
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:55,109
You think I can't hear you every day?
Filling his head with black magic.

505
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,195
Talking about visions
and three-eyed ravens and worse.

506
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,531
-Leave him alone.
-He can speak for himself.

507
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,992
-I don't fill his head with anything.
-So what do you talk about?

508
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,414
What's happening to him
and what that means.

509
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,166
Go on, then. Tell us what it means.

510
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,378
It's not like that.
I wish I could tell him all the answers.

511
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,462
It would be much easier.

512
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,049
I don't want you talking to him anymore.

513
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,343
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

514
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,512
-We're not going to Castle Black.
-What did you say?

515
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,307
I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.

516
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,977
Bran needs to find the raven
beyond the Wall.

517
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,813
Oh, no. I'm not going back there.
Your brother is at Castle Black.

518
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:33,856
That's where we're going.

519
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,443
Look at me.

520
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,698
The raven's been coming to me
ever since I fell from that tower.

521
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,242
He wants me to find him.

522
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,495
I don't have my legs anymore.

523
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,417
-This is what I have now.
-You have a family.

524
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,752
You need to go back to Castle Black

525
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,630
so you can get back to them
where you belong.

526
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,840
What if I belong in the North?

527
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:05,679
What if… I fell from that tower
for a reason?

528
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,641
Is that what he's telling you?
That it's all for a reason?

529
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,894
All these bad things happened

530
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,896
because the Gods got big plans
for you?

531
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,649
I wish it were true, little lord,
but the Gods wouldn't spare

532
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,819
a raven's cold shit
for you or me or anyone.

533
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,947
-You don't understand. You don't know.
-You don't know.

534
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,617
None of you know.
None of you have been up there.

535
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,792
I had a man once.
A good man. Bruni, his name was.

536
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,462
I was his and he was mine.

537
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,298
But one night Bruni disappears.

538
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,844
People said he left me, but I knew him.

539
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,890
He'd never leave me. Not for long.

540
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,351
I knew he'd come back.

541
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,521
And he did.

542
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,025
He came in through the back of the hut.

543
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,696
Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.

544
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:11,828
His skin was pale like a dead man's.

545
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,874
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

546
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,131
He came at me, grabbed me by the neck

547
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:29,012
and squeezed so hard
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

548
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,809
I don't know how I got the knife.

549
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:39,064
When I did, I stuck it
deep into his heart.

550
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,903
And he hardly seemed to notice.

551
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,534
I had to burn our hut down
with him inside.

552
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,747
I didn't ask the gods what it meant.

553
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,875
I didn't need to. I already knew.

554
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,838
It meant the North was no place
for men to be.

555
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,840
Not anymore.

556
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,763
I promised your maester I'd get you
to Castle Black and no further.

557
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,816
How is the pain, my lord?

558
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,822
What's the purpose of an arm
with no hand?

559
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,370
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

560
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,373
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

561
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,167
You're a learned man.

562
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,127
All the good it's done me.

563
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,046
You did well sewing up this mess.

564
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:49,426
You're far better at this sort of work
than Grand Maester Pycelle.

565
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,803
Faint praise, my lord.

566
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,099
So why did the Citadel take your chain?

567
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,730
-Did you fondle one boy too many?
-No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

568
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,067
What is?

569
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,696
Curiosity.

570
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,450
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

571
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,746
And the only way to understand it
is to study the afflicted.

572
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,291
You performed experiments on living men.

573
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,043
-On dying men.
-With their permission?

574
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:28,006
My studies have given me insight
that has saved many lives.

575
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,758
Dying paupers, I assume.

576
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,844
Men with no families to complain.

577
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,641
You found them moaning in the poorhouse
and had them carted back to your garret

578
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,311
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

579
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,522
How many men have you killed, my lord?

580
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,610
-I don't know.
-Fifty? One hundred?

581
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,030
Countless.

582
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,284
-Countless has a nice ring to it.
-And how many lives have you saved?

583
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,537
Half a million.

584
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,166
The population of King's Landing.

585
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,133
You were in charge of the ravens
at Harrenhal.

586
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,138
Did you get a bird
off to Brienne's father in Tarth?

587
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,515
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

588
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:24,771
Lord Selwyn Tarth offered
300 gold dragons

589
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,189
for his daughter's safe return.

590
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,943
-A fair offer.
-A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

591
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,238
Why not?

592
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,743
He's convinced Lord Tarth owns
all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

593
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,579
He feels he's being cheated.

594
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,665
They'd be fools to kill her.

595
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,919
These men have been at war a long time.
Most of them will be dead by winter.

596
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,589
She'll be their entertainment tonight.

597
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,469
Beyond tonight, I don't think
they care very much.

598
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,740
We have to return to Harrenhal.

599
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,494
-Why?
-I've left something behind.

600
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,247
Absolutely not.
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.

601
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,957
And what are those orders?

602
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,543
To deliver you to your father
at King's Landing.

603
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,463
You think you'll get a reward.

604
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,844
I serve Lord Bolton.
Any appreciation your father--

605
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,597
You think you're getting a reward.
Let me explain something to you.

606
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,475
When my father sees me,
the first thing he's going to ask

607
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,186
is what happened to my hand.
And I'm going to tell him

608
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,939
-this man chopped it off.
-I had nothing--

609
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,983
Or I could tell him
this man saved my life.

610
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,196
We return to Harrenhal now.

611
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,513
-Eyes open, lads.
-Be quiet.

612
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,230
The bear, the bear and the maiden fair

613
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,607
From there to here, from here to there

614
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,985
All black and brown and covered in hair

615
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,153
He smelled that girl in the summer air

616
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,406
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!

617
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,370
Don't spare her.

618
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,414
Don't spare her!

619
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,378
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

620
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,297
Stop running and fight.

621
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,972
A wooden sword?

622
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,142
-I thought you'd gone.
-You gave her a wooden sword.

623
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,437
-We've only got one bear.
-I'll pay her bloody ransom.

624
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,065
Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
Just get her out of there.

625
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:19,404
All you lords and ladies still think
that the only thing that matters is gold.

626
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,700
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

627
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,952
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

628
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:30,707
So go buy yourself a golden hand
and fuck yourself with it.

629
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,770
-Get behind me.
-I will not.

630
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,033
What the fuck are you doing
to my bear?

631
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,077
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

632
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,746
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

633
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,584
Pull her up.

634
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:29,933
Hold my legs.

635
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,541
Pull him up!

636
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,845
The bitch stays.

637
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,268
We're taking her to King's Landing.
Unless you kill me.

638
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,191
She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.

639
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,861
What do you think is more important
to Lord Bolton?

640
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,488
Getting his pet rat a reward

641
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,116
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

642
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,056
Well, we must be on our way.

643
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,103
Sorry about the sapphires.
