[yells] Help!

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,991
Freddy Meyers, you stand convicted
of seven counts of murder,

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:36,203
all occurring on June 2nd, 1989.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,080
You have been sentenced to death
by a jury of your peers.

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,708
The State will now proceed
with your sentence.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,710
Do you have anything to say
before your sentence is carried out?

16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,880
Only...

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,719
that I love my mother.

I'm leaving before you
and your band of botherers

can suck me into another
world-saving sing-along.

Actually, I was just gonna say
we're still waiting for you to move out.

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,819
There's a box in the library
labeled "arcana"

44
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,196
that's been sitting there for months.

I'd avoid touching that, if I was you.

46
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,449
Yeah. Behrad already tried to move it,

47
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,785
and now he thinks he's being haunted
by a forlorn mariner.

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,870
And he's right, but I can't stick around
to help the bloke,

49
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm off to research
a more lasting solution

50
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,665
to your Encore problem.

51
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,043
[in sing-song voice]
Did someone say "Encore"?

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:34,506
I also said no musical numbers,
so please, don't start.

53
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,383
Listen, I might have a solution
to your problem.

54
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,635
I can't take you with me
on this one, squire.

55
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,721
Where I'm going, I need to walk alone.

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,556
With Gary.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,768
Okay. But, look, we're on a Timeship,
and let's be honest,

58
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,021
we're a little past the whole, "Should
we change history?" debate, right?

59
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,483
So, what if we go back
to when the Encores were kids

60
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,486
and reform them before they break bad?

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,697
Ray, we're dealing with the villains
of history fresh out of hell.

62
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,867
- They can't just be reformed like your--
-[Nora] Ray, where are you?

Like your Fairy God-girlfriend.

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,249
Speaking of which, I think that
your services are required, squire.

65
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,795
Well, look who's finally off the clock.

66
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,296
Oh, no. Not again.

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,466
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
It's the same thing every time.

Well, maybe next time
you should say "nay."

[blowing raspberry]

73
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:37,277
Well, right now,
it's all about what you want.

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,114
[groans] Oh, what I want is to be done
with this gig.

[sighs]

76
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
I know.
But, look, at least with this job,

77
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,204
you have the opportunity
to make people's lives better.

78

How am I supposed to help kids in need

79
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,292
when these kids don't even know
what they need?

80
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,254
Because, trust me, no one has ever
become a better person with a pony.

81
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,215
Probably true, but, look,
I'm setting the mood.

82
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,510
Gideon, dim the lights,

83
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:07,307
and play "You're the Inspiration"
by Chicago.

84
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,227
And now, it's whatever you wish, Nora.

doesn't bring back some fond memories?

90
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,332
If I had fond memories of this place,
I'd book a lobotomy.

91
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,127
Okay. Whatever you people do here,
just show me the exit.

92
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm due for a content drop.

93
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,882
Oh, and also to tell Maman and Baba
you're not really in business school.

94
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,676
But before you do that,
let's make sure you can't do that.

95
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,553
- Look over here.
- Is that a camera?

96
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,888
- Wait!

[whispers] You can't wipe her memory.

99
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,686
All right? There's a timeline
where she was here.

100
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,938
Okay, so maybe her being here,

101
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,232
she'll remember what we did
and who she was.

102
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,816
[whispers] Look, I know Zari,

103
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,945
and there's no way she was
ever anyone but her.

104

Hey, what's with the Wi-Fi?

105

Cat-Chat's the chat app
that lets you clap back--

00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,120
I didn't say tell me.

00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,582
[Gideon] Mr. Tarazi and Mr. Heywood,
you're needed on the bridge.

110
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,043
Look, no one wants you out of here
more than I do,

111
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,170
but I need you to stay put
until we finish this job.

112
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,256
[door opens]

113
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,552
Wait. Wait... Are you keep--

114
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,886
Are you taking me prisoner?

116

I have a sneaker drop,

117
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,061
and I'm supposed to be releasing
a new fragrance for Dragonesque today.

118
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,105
We've been working on this launch
for months.

119
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,690
This is high stakes!

120
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,903
[Gideon] A serial killer has been freed
from hell and is on the loose in 2004.

121
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,322
And somehow the scariest thing
about this mission

122
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,700
is going back to the early 2000s.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,119
[Gideon] A coroner was found dead
while transporting the body

124
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,245
of a famed serial killer.

125
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,540
[gasps] Oh, my God, it's Freddy Meyers,
the Prom Night Slasher.

126
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,003
Come on, guys. I ranked him number five
killer of all time on StabCast.

127
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,756
- My podcast about serial killers. Babe?
- Oh.

128
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,300
[Gideon] As I was going to say,

129
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,801
Freddy killed seven
of his peers before--

130
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,511
At his high school prom in 1989,

131
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,139
he used a kitchen knife,
and he wore a creepy mask.

132
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,559
I actually did a whole series on it,
so none of you open my e-mails, clearly.

133
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,602
[Gideon] And following the murders--

134
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,063
He spent 15 years on death row
before he was executed in 2004.

135
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,190
[Gideon] Which is when
the timeline changed,

136
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,110
starting with the death of the coroner
and the disappearance of Freddy's body.

137
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,278
I don't even wanna think about

138
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,363
what a serial killer would do
with his second act.

139
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,282
Tiffany.

140
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,159
She was the final girl.

141
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,746
[both] The one target
that survived Freddy's attack!

142
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,750
It's informative and entertaining.
It's good.

143
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,209
See? Thank you.

144
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,379
Guys, check this out.
The Central City High class of '89

145

their fallen peers

146
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,593
at their 15-year reunion
this Friday night.

147
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,263
We have to go. That's where
Freddy will be to finish the job.

148
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,725
Well then, babe,
grab your autograph book...

149
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,685
because we're gonna go catch
a serial killer.

150
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,854
Gideon, take us to 2004.

151
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,775
And order one of these mattresses
using promo code "laceration."

The only thing killing it out here
is my wardrobe.

154
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,166
Can't believe I'm here. Seriously.

where he stalked his victims.

You guys, he made his first kill
in this cafeteria. [gasps]

- Babe.
- What? What?

159
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,515
Babe, that's the trophy that Tiffany
fashioned into a makeshift weapon.

160
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,809
Why didn't you tell me we were
coming back to my old school?

161
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,144
- You went to school here?
- What?

162
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,689
Mick, this is why you need
to come to team meetings.

163
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,357
Do you remember anything about Freddy?

164
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,984
- Yeah. He was... He was a loser.
- Oh, come on.

165
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,611
Frigging Mick Rory!

166

Ali, remember?

167
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,116
Is that you, or...

168

No.

169

Are you sure? 'Cause you look, like,
exactly like Mick... Mick Rory.

No. My name is Dick.

I'm telling you, Dick,
team meetings work wonders.

- I'm, uh...

I'm Lisa, and this is Kelly,

177

'cause we were losers.

my appetite for broccoli.

[Nate] Guys, Freddy's on the scene.

195
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,316
And he's got his first victim.

Welcome back.

It means so much
to see all of you here tonight.

And here to unveil our memorial
to our fallen peers

200
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,499
is our very own survivor,

Of course she makes
a dramatic entrance. [chuckles]

00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,898
We didn't cover this
in rehearsal, Tiffany.

Look, he's here. We need backup.

212

That's him.

213

Guys, watch out. You're stuck in
a school with the Prom Night Slasher.

214
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,621
[Gary] Master, I'm sorry I'm so late.

215
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,083
I tried a teleportation spell
to get here ASAP,

216
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,793

Damn it, Gary. Pull yourself together,
will you? We've got work to do.

And the answers we need
lie behind this door.

What is this place?

221
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,514
Can't say I've ever had anything
as comfy as a home,

222
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,932
but I lived here once.

223

- Hey, go on. Get off my stairs.
-[groans]

All right. Who's responsible for this?

230
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,916
And I thought I was the one
with the magic touch.

231
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,379
All right. Everybody out.

232

You wanna party,
you do it somewhere else, all right?

233
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,221
How did you even
find this place, Charlie?

234
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,185
You told me about it
when you were wasted once.

235
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,605
[Constantine] You found your way here.

236
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,981
You can find your way out.

What is with him, huh?

238
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,280
- What are you doing here?
- Do the Constantine trick again.

239
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,701
All right, everyone. Stay sharp.
The killer could be anywhere.

240
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,995
[sighs] We gotta get everyone
out of here.

Thanks for the heart attack!

Sorry. Swiss Army knife.
Usually solves a jam in a jiff,

No way in or out.

246
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,048
This place always smelled like a prison.

247
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,133
Telekinesis. It makes perfect sense.

248
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,927
Killers often act
out of feeling powerless,

All right. Immortal killer.
How do we stop him?

We can't from in here,
but maybe you guys can.

Look, Ray, it's time to put
your crazy plan to the test.

You gotta go back and fix Freddy.

Turns out I don't have a date
to prom tonight,

What? Me... Me, go with you to prom?

She's working with those bullies.
This could be what sets him off.

Okay. We gotta talk this kid

New teachers. Cool new teachers.

And judging by your test scores here,

282
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,607
maybe you should skip the prom
and hit the books.

283

Turn this A into an A-plus.

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,043
I can hear them.
Their.., their voices.

314
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,337
Fairy Godmothers
have sort of a special radar

315
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,881
that tunes in to kids' wishes,

316
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,676
and prom night is
a minefield of teenage need,

317
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,721
so when it locks on
to the kid with the deepest need,

318
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,472
I just go straight to...

319
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,727
No, no, no, no, no. It's happening.

320
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,318
Where the hell did you come from, huh?

321
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,279
- Oh, Freddy, uh...
- Huh?

322
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,407
I am your Fairy Godmother.

323
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,076
So...

324
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,164
Please don't kill me?

325
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,214
You're a Fairy Godmother?

326
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,673
- My Fairy Godmother?
- Uh-huh.

327
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,591
Prove it.

328
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,635
You think I'd be wearing this
if I really had the choice?

329
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,097
- Huh?
- So, anything I ask for...

330
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,515
you have to do it.

331
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,060
So, you should really think
about what you want,

332
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,978
especially the consequences.

333
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,147
I already know what I want.

334
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,900
Prom's tonight, and--

335

-[knock at door]
-[Cathy] Freddy, honey.

336
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,111
- Hide.
-[exclaims]

337
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,158
Hey, Freddy.
You ready, Freddy, for movie night?

338
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,243
I got the Jiffy Pop going.

339
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,244
Actually, Mom...

340
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,411
[whispers] Ray, I'm with Freddy.

341
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,163
Nora. Good! That... That's great.

342
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,958
How is that great?
I'm a serial killer's Fairy Godmother.

343
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,710
This is perfect. Old Freddy didn't have
a Fairy Godmother.

344
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,506
So, if you give him the prom
every kid dreams of,

345
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,674
maybe he won't hurt anyone.

346
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,551
Except this kid's dream
is for everyone to be dead.

347
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,886
[Freddy] ...gonna go to prom.

348
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,846
Hmm. Prom.

349
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,557
Wow, Freddy.

350
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,020
Uh, do you need a ride?
Or I could help you with your tie...

351
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,564
You know what, I got it, but...
Love you. Okay, I just gotta go.

352
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,524
Okay.

353
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,775
[door closes]

354
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,568
Now...

355
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,612
Back to my wish.

356
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,327
I'm gonna make it so those kids
never make fun of me again,

357
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,287
because I wish for...

358
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,413
Uh...

359
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,706
A suit.

360
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,582
A suit?

361
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
Yeah. If I'm gonna take Tiffany,
I gotta look good.

362
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,879
So, I want a cool suit. Can you do that?

363
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,132
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Okay.

364
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,091
- Ready?
- Yeah.

365
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,557
Check it out.

366
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,768
Okay.

367
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,894
Okay.

368
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,604
Now I gotta show up in style.

369
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,607
- I want a pony.
- Ugh. Seriously, kid?

370
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,333
[whooshing]

371
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,754
Hey, Freddy.

372
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,173
- Hey, Tiffany.
- Wow. Cool suit.

373
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,467
Thanks. Here.

374
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,846
- Thank you.
- Should we, um...

375
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,389
- Yes.
- Okay.

376
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,438
Looks like your plan just might work.

377
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,565
Well, only thanks to you.

Hey, Palmer.

379
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,069
Will you go to prom with me?

380
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,403
Oh, shucks.

00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,699
All right.

-[device trills]
- Huh.

385
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,803
I knew it. You stole our family's totem.

386
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,096
It's not like that. I...

387
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,847
I needed to take it.

388
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,600
You could've just asked for it.
Maman and Baba would've given it to you.

389
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,893
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,436
Oh, you really don't know?

391
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,689
You're never around,
you don't do any work,

392
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,275
and they still treat you
like you're some kind of hero.

393
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,987
If you only knew what I've done,
what I've survived,

without getting any credit...

395
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,699
Not that you'd understand,
'cause you only care about yourself.

396
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,992
Whatever. Don't tell me.

397
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,620
But wait till they see you've turned it
into a stupid stoner bracelet.

Hey, screw you.

402

I'm not a void.

403
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,506
I'm a business.

Not like it works here anyway.

I'm gonna find a way out of the school.

Look at them,
just waiting to be picked off.

410
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,753
Never fit in with them when I went here,

411
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,921
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna die with them.

I like the way you think.

There's an old vent in the wood shop

No, no, no. Actually, I think I kind of
get the whole nostalgia thing for once.

I watch a lot of music videos.

So, that's the prank.

She leads him to the center
of the dance floor,

Let me do this, Freddy.

634
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,850
[Agent Sharpe] I can't move.

635
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,813
[both straining]

636
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,489
You don't need them, you need me.

637
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,950
We can get away with this together.

638
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,284
No! No.

639
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,705
I know who I am now,
and I'm not gonna lock myself away.

640
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,501
Then this is for your own good.

641
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,174
[groans]

642
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,849
- They did it.
-[gasps]

643
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,228
Behrad?

644
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,690
Sorry. You okay?

645
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,234
I totally get why you stole that.

646
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,027
Fair enough.

647
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,532
Wow, this was.., a lot.

648
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,452
-[siren wails]
-[gasps]

649
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,336
Ma'am, you were in the limo,
is that right?

650
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,629
- Yes.
- Thanks.

651
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,880
I'll be back.

652
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,894
I know she needs help, but...

653
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,358
She was all I had,
and they took her away. [sniffs]

654
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,694
Mmm-hmm.

655
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,821
So, what do I do?

656
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,240
You survive.

657
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,619
Freddy, my upbringing
was only dysfunction.

658
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,707
But dysfunction doesn't get to choose
who you are.

659
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,126
You do.

660
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,714
- You hear me?
- Yeah. Okay.

661
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,093
We should head back
and check on the team,

662
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
make sure everything's back to normal.

663
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,143
I know.., you're gonna be okay, kid.

664
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,745
Dr. Gideon treating you right?

665
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,706
Pretty cool, huh?

666
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,876
So, this is what you do,
travel around time

667
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,128
and save people using wind? That's...

668
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,174
Well, I wouldn't say "cool,"
exactly, but...

669
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,094
no wonder you're the favorite.

670
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,595
The favorite?

671
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,724
Maman and Baba only treat me how they do
'cause they're worried about me.

672
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,103
I mean, I've been in business school
for five years.

673
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,897
You were a self-made millionaire
by the age of 19.

674
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,066
You're right, I am very impressive.

675
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,485
Like, how did you jailbreak
your way out of here anyway?

676
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,196
I was poking around
your weird little screens,

677
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,782
and suddenly
I knew how to hack my way out.

678
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,492
Right.

679
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,495
Yeah, time travel
always has these weird side effects.

680
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,831
Huh.

681
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,625
Well, hopefully it wears off

682
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,169
because I was thinking of
sticking around for a while.

683
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,212
Huh.

684
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,047
I weirdly wouldn't hate that.

685
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,467
<i>[Sara] Hey, guys, we're still in 2004.
Where the hell are you?</i>

686
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,385
You coming?

687
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,766
[upbeat dance music playing]

688
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,268
How about this for a reunion?

689
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,813
[all cheering]

690
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,985
And, uh, what's your sister doing here?

691
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,988
Probably Cat-Chatting. No judgment here.

692
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,281
- Yes.
- Wait.

693
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,949
Where's Mick?

694
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,998
Mick?

695
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,128
-[pop song playing]
- Mick Rory?

696
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,672
Ali.

697
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,596
Hey, Freddy.

698
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,347
Hey, Tiffany. Congrats.

699
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,562
Nora, may I have this dance?

700
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,398
Ah, but of course.

701
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,656
I cannot believe I got to get
an exclusive scoop for <i>StabCast,</i>

702
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,200
and I got to be the final girl.

703
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,702
Well, technically, I never died, so...

704
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,871
Technically, you've died
more than three times,

705
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,706
so just give me this one, babe.

706
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,793
- You are my final girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

707
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,796
Hey, guys.

708
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,964
Photo booth.

709
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,883
- Oh, no.
- Yes!

710
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,218
[music continues]

711

- Wait. Where's Mick?

712
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,650
[song resumes]

713
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,736
[both moaning]

714
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,453
Wow, Mick.

715
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,581
That's my gun.

716
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,221
[sighs] I thought I told you
to piss off.

717
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,724
Gary just filled me in
on that business with Astra.

718
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,811
So, why are you drowning your sorrows
instead of doing something about it?

719
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,854
What happened here, John?

720
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,696
Oh, I used to run with a bunch
back in the day.

721
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,323
Became known as "the Newcastle Crew,"

722
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,450
spent most of our misbegotten youth
in this place.

723
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,123
One of them was a powerful witch.

724
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,750
I'm back here to consult with her.

725
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,044
She's through there.

726
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,217
So, what are you waiting for?

727
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,468
Come on. Get off your arse
and go and do it.

728
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,262
Because it's not that easy,
all right, Charlie?

729
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,140
That witch is Astra's dead mother.

730
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,144
Her spirit is waiting
on the other side of that door, and...

731
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,229
none too happy with me.

732
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,609
There are things in my past
that I haven't told anyone.

733
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,529
So, I get the whole
wanting to do it on your own.

734
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,451
But if there was some door that I could
walk through to solve all my problems...

735
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,662
I sure as hell would take that chance.

736
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,300
I call upon Hecate,

737
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,553
lady of keys and guardian of crossroads.

738
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,476
Sever this seal.

739
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,483
By my blood, be open.

740
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,996
Don't look back, John-o.

741
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,373
You got this.

742
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,875
Let's hope you're right, love.

743
