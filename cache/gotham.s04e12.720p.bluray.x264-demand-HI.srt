What you got?

176
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,582
Well, it seems like
a piece of a toy plane.

177
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,284
And, yet, if I'm not mistaken,

178
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,162
it's covered in
plastic explosive residue.

There's also the remnants of
what seems like a trigger wire.

180
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,918
Whoever built it,

181
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,219
takes pride in their work
and has considerable talent,

182

Pretty elaborate.

184
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,437
I can think of easier ways

185
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,765
to kill a room full of criminals
than with a toy plane.

186
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,309
Perhaps, it was intended
to fly to someone specific

187
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,894
and not destroy the whole room.

188
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,903
Like an assassination attempt?

189
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,948
If so, who was the target?

190
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,031

needs to be made an example of.

- Oh, of course, it was.

193

I just think that maybe
the best thing for The Narrows

194
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,299
is to burn it to the ground! Start over.

suit everyone, wouldn't it?

00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,322
I love bartending, it involves
two of my favorite things,

00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,875
- drinking and ignoring people.

Oh, he's a bloody murderer.

664
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,503
Then call a cop, I'm a bartender.

665
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,213
No, he's the murderer.

- I have an alibi.
- HARVEY: Oh! Yeah?

00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,881
Let me guess,
one of these guys is your alibi?

668
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,265
- What do you say now, pal?
- Oh, I'm not an alibi.

669
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,183

You suck at following people,

00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,489
Just different flesh.

676
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,373
What happened to you?

it's my essence.

Your mouth drying up?

685
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,861
It lives within me now.

00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,626
It'll counteract the toxin.

690
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,971
It took me a few tries,

691
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,925

What?

709
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,530
You paid me good money to kill the Doc.

Did he say anything about who hired him?

(STAMMERS) It was him, all him.

728
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,879
He was a lone wolf. That's what he said.

729
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,470
He was afraid of what
Lee was gonna do to The Narrows.

Are you sure? His son said
he was talking to somebody

on the phone about the Doc.

he was calling around

trying to get support,
but no one would help him.

So he went alone. Crazy.
