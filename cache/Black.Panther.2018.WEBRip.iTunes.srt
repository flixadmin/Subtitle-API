MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one?

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,472
The story of home.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,226
Millions of years ago...

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,978
a meteorite
made of vibranium...

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,481
the strongest substance
in the universe...

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,566
struck the continent
of Africa...

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,613
affecting the plant life
around it.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,782
And when
the time of man came...

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,786
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,083
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,418
until a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,547
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,758
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,177
a plant that granted him

18
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:56,265
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,850
The warrior became king...

20
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,394
and the first Black Panther...

21
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,146
the protector of Wakanda.

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,149
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...

23
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,654
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,449
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...

25
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,870
more advanced
than any other nation.

26
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,705
But as Wakanda thrived...

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,292
the world around it descended
further into chaos.

28
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,672
To keep vibranium safe...

29
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,800
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

30
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,636

of their power

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,722
from the outside world.

32
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,100

33
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,144
Yes.

watch from the shadows.

1797
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:47,089
We cannot.

1798
02:05:48,215 --> 02:05:49,716
We must not.

1799
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:52,678
We will work to be an example
of how we...

1800
02:05:52,845 --> 02:05:55,097
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...

1801
02:05:55,264 --> 02:05:57,307
should treat each other.

1802
02:05:57,474 --> 02:05:59,309
Now, more than ever...

1803
02:06:00,561 --> 02:06:04,982
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1804
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:07,317
We all know the truth.

1805
02:06:07,484 --> 02:06:10,904
More connects us
than separates us.

1806
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:12,781
But in times of crisis...

1807
02:06:12,948 --> 02:06:15,409
the wise build bridges...

1808
02:06:15,576 --> 02:06:18,370
while the foolish
build barriers.

1809
02:06:18,537 --> 02:06:20,581
We must find a way...

1810
02:06:20,747 --> 02:06:23,375
to look after one another...

1811
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:28,255
as if we were one,
single tribe.

1812
02:06:28,422 --> 02:06:29,882
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...

1813
02:06:30,048 --> 02:06:31,300
what can a nation of farmers

1814
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:33,260
have to offer
the rest of the world?

1815

(BOYS GIGGLING)

1818
02:13:32,846 --> 02:13:34,848
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1819
02:13:34,932 --> 02:13:35,933
-No.
-You're teasing him again.

1820
02:13:37,351 --> 02:13:39,478
-Don't wake him. He must rest.
-THABO: No, I'm not.

1821
02:13:40,437 --> 02:13:41,813
No, I'm not.

1822
02:13:42,773 --> 02:13:43,982
SHURI: Thabo,
you're doing that.

1823
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:45,526
KID 2: He's doing it.
He's lying.

1824
02:13:45,692 --> 02:13:47,110
SHURI: No, he's resting.

1825
02:13:47,402 --> 02:13:48,612
Go, go!

Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

1830
02:13:58,872 --> 02:13:59,873
Bucky.

1831
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,543
How are you feeling?

1832
02:14:03,168 --> 02:14:04,169
Good.

1833
02:14:06,797 --> 02:14:07,881
Thank you.

1834
02:14:07,965 --> 02:14:09,508

Much more for you to learn.
