1
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:48,001
Wireless crackling
with instructions.

2
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:00,459
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

3
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:02,168
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

4
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,084
It's always crowded here.

5
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,644
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

6
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,376
Look at that... you scum!

7
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,251
You get awesome chicken
on the left here.

8
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,751
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

9
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,709
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

10
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:40,126
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

11
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,668
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,584
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

13
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,459
Boss is in a bad mood today.

14
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,334
He's pissed with everyone.

15
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,293
His wife must've screamed at him

16
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,251
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

17
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,168
he forgot to take his wife
shopping for their anniversary.

18
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:05,043
She got so upset she cancelled
their dinner reservations.

19
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,376
We can handle the
toughest of criminals easily...

20
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:12,459
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

21
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:13,626
So true, Ma'am.

22
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:16,209
That's why Morey is
taking the day off tomorrow.

23
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:19,071
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

24
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:19,668
Yes, Ma'am.

25
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,543
How is your younger
one studying?

26
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,168
Wonder when she studies!

27
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:25,668
She's always glued
to the TV or the computer.

28
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:27,793
That reminds me...

29
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:32,793
Hello.

30
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,084
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

31
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,293
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

32
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,459
I can hear the TV.

33
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,293
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

34
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:42,168
- Have you got it?
- What?

35
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:42,793
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,001
I was speaking to Jafar.

37
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:45,876
Okay.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,584
Better get done with
your revision till I am back.

39
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,251
Okay, bye.

40
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,043
Have you fed them?

41
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,084
They are getting a royal treatment.

42
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,626
Morey, is feeding them
cheese since the afternoon.

43
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,084
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

44
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,293
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

45
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,001
These guys love cheese.

46
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,418
Our surveillance team
is already there, right?

47
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:07,001
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

48
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:09,251
Shinde...

49
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,543
The baby's crying...

50
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:49,918
Oh my God!

51
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,709
You son of a...

52
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:54,834
Get up!

53
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:57,043
Bloody rascal!

54
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:02,376
Only a mouse can get
another mouse out of his hole.

55
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,376
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

56
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:07,334
We are not going to shoot you.

57
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,251
Please, Ma'am...

58
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,126
I don't have orders to shoot you,
you scum.

59
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,293
I have to take you in alive.

60
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,626
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:19,001
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:23,501
God knows who else is hiding
inside for a threesome.

63
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:25,376
Get him!

64
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,543
You son of a...

65
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,834
You have dodged us
four times before.

66
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,418
You think we'll let
you escape so easily?

67
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,584
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

68
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,584
Take him away!

69
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:52,501
Giving refuge to
rats spreads plague.

70
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,376
Rehman, you should be
thankful to me.

71
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,209
You could at least
make love one last time.

72
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,668
Jafar was all set
to spoil it for you.

73
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,334
You are ragging me,
aren't you, Ma'am?

74
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:19,626
Sir's call.

75
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:21,209
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

76
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,814
Yes, we are taking
him to the station.

77
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,084
I had ordered you to
get him out and nab him...

78
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:26,793
...not barge right inside the chawl.

79
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,293
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

80
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,459
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

81
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,418
We would have arrested
him again if he escaped.

82
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,283
But who would be responsible...

83
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:37,933
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

84
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,409
We had taken precautions, Sir.

85
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,189
Taking rats along
was your precaution?

86
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,584
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

87
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:45,668
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

88
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,501
Your job is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

89
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:58,126
Someone please take
Sir's wife for shopping.

90
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:10,834
Go home, Ma'am.

91
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:13,543
Meera has asked you
to come early, right?

92
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,751
If we don't get this
rascal's paperwork right...

93
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:18,923
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

94
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:20,209
No chance, Ma'am.

95
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,021
We'll keep the papers
ready by morning.

96
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,048
You have a look at it.

97
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:24,793
Okay.

98
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:00,001
Sorry, I am late again.

99
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,043
It's okay.

100
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,543
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

101
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:04,376
Sorry...

102
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:05,876
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

103
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,793
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

104
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:10,376
For me?

105
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,251
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

106
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,459
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

107
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:18,293
Yes.

108
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,418
Happy birthday to you...

109
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:33,543
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

110
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,209
Happy birthday to you.

111
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,043
This is for Meera.

112
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,001
And for me? Come on...

113
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,543
Fast, fast, fast.

114
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:56,459
And this is for you.

115
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,501
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

116
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,626
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

117
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,751
Wear these goggles
and ride a bike in style...

118
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,376
Hey, hey!

119
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,709
If I look like John Abraham,
then girls will chase me.

120
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,126
Show me something else.

121
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,418
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

122
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,084
I have a lot of variety.

123
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:38,209
Try this one.

124
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,709
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

125
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:44,084
He was a cop just like you.

126
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,543
Roam around in style with these.

127
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:52,376
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

128
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:57,001
Ma'am, I also have
a Sunny Leone style goggle.

129
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,334
But that one doesn't have a glass.

130
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:02,084
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

131
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:04,168
But don't worry Ma'am.

132
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:06,626
I know exactly
what you are looking for.

133
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,418
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

134
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,031
What the hell is going on there?

135
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:16,001
Go check Morey.

136
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,126
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the crime branch.

137
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,793
Why do we need to get into it?

138
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,168
Morey, we are from
the crime branch later.

139
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,918
We are cops first. Let's go.

140
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,043
Let's go.

141
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,751
Ma'am, goggles...

142
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,126
How dare they celebrate
Valentine's Day!

143
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,418
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

144
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:56,084
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do our job.

145
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,418
Get lost!

146
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:02,168
Only one of us can
do our job right now.

147
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,459
And right now, I am on duty.

148
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,126
So, you stop working
and let me work.

149
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,418
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

150
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,668
You guys keep going!

151
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:13,043
Last warning.

152
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:14,751
You and your bloody last warning!

153
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:17,584
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

154
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:18,751
Start counting, Morey.

155
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:21,001
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

156
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,834
Section 147 - rioting.

157
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,084
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

158
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:27,543
Section 504 - intentional
insult with intent...

159
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:28,826
...to provoke breach of peace.

160
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:31,501
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

161
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:33,209
Get up!

162
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,459
Two more sections left. Get up!

163
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:41,543
Section 188 - disobedience
to order given by public servant.

164
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:44,626
And Section 353 - assault
or criminal force...

165
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,293
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

166
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,876
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

167
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,084
Jafar, did you get
record the video?

168
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:58,126
Yes, Ma'am.

169
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,001
Make sure your boss
gets my name right.

170
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,459
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

171
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,709
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

172
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:11,418
Unit 3.

173
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,501
Do whatever the hell you want!

174
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:14,376
Get lost!

175
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,946
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

176
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:28,918
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

177
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,164
No, no. Give it for thirty.

178
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:31,459
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,144
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

180
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:34,126
Okay.

181
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:35,584
Pyaari!

182
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:37,751
Pyaari! Come here!

183
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:39,001
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

184
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,001
Here's a twenty... thirty...

185
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,001
Pyaari, come quickly!

186
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,001
Coming!

187
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:46,433
Keep the change.

188
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,251
Pyaari, get in.

189
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,376
How are you?

190
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:01,543
There it is.

191
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,668
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

192
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,376
I am going to treat
both of you this Friday.

193
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,001
Really? Why?

194
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,084
It's my birthday.

195
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:11,834
- Really?
- No.

196
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,376
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

197
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,543
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

198
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:16,793
Very smart.

199
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,626
If the whole of India
will celebrate...

200
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,584
...then even we must too, right?

201
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,668
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

202
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:24,751
Kaalakhatta.

203
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,001
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

204
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,219
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

205
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:33,001
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

206
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:34,459
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

207
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:35,418
Me too.

208
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,001
You too? Same pinch.

209
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,334
What a stroke of luck
it was that I found you!

210
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,413
Remember how you were standing
at the railway station?

211
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:49,459
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

212
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:51,543
Aunty, but you met me, right?

213
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,043
My Ganpati selected you for me.

214
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,251
And me?

215
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,001
You, I have selected myself!

216
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,056
Shivani, please put
these eye drops for me.

217
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,209
Just a second. I am on my last set.

218
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:08,543
Again?

219
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,543
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

220
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:20,436
What happened?

221
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:24,001
Your Kaku never lets
me work out in peace.

222
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,001
Really.

223
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:33,001
Why are there so many
boxes of cake in the fridge?

224
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,494
There will be one more today.

225
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:35,126
Why?

226
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,126
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

227
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,793
It's been three days,
I just can't find her.

228
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,876
So a new cake every day?

229
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:44,168
We can't feed her a stale
cake on her birthday, can we?

230
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,584
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

231
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:48,376
Very good.

232
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:57,001
Yes, Jafar.

233
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,501
I'll handle that.

234
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,376
You keep the charge sheet ready.

235
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,671
I'll come in some time.

236
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:05,834
Yes, Jafar.

237
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:08,709
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

238
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:09,584
Who are you?

239
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:11,626
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

240
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:13,209
Who is Shivani Aunty?

241
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,126
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

242
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,168
Did you find her?

243
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,459
- Who?
- Her.

244
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:29,084
Who's her?

245
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,918
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

246
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,584
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

247
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:42,334
I thought since you are
a cop you might have found Pyaari.

248
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,293
Who let these kids inside?

249
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:46,881
What's wrong with her?

250
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:49,104
She's missing since
the last four days.

251
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:52,459
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

252
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,043
These kids wander off sometimes.

253
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,418
But they come back
in a couple of days.

254
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,471
Pyaari didn't come
back till last evening...

255
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,084
...so we filed a missing complaint.

256
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,101
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

257
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,251
This is D. N. Nagar...

258
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:06,584
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

259
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,041
When did you see her last?

260
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:09,043
Four days back.

261
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:10,749
I want to meet these kids.

262
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,293
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

263
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,251
She was with us
three days ago. And...

264
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:18,459
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

265
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,251
Kids get lost but
they also come back.

266
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,751
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

267
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:27,043
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

268
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,043
I haven't seen her after that.

269
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,459
I saw her when I came
in the morning.

270
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,313
Don't know where she
disappeared later.

271
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,584
She was carrying her bag of books.

272
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,501
I even asked her
where she was going.

273
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,543
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

274
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,834
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

275
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,001
One cup of tea

276
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:58,543
Since when do you
have your stall here?

277
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,626
What's the matter Ma'am?
Is anything wrong?

278
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,084
Just answer my question.

279
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,209
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

280
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:08,251
You won't have to pay,
if you work for me.

281
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,043
What's the job?

282
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,043
You have to keep an
eye on this shelter home.

283
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,001
Who comes in, who goes out.

284
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,251
You want me to be
an informer, right?

285
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:19,918
You are very smart, huh?

286
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,459
A girl called Pyaari
is missing from here.

287
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,459
Give me all the
information you can get.

288
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:29,334
Clear?

289
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:30,584
Write my number down.

290
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,334
9-8-2...

291
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:35,459
Meera, are you ready?

292
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:38,251
I have made your
favourite breakfast today.

293
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,584
Sharda Bai, one more
cup of tea please.

294
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:40,293
Yes, Sir.

295
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,251
Let me comb your hair today.

296
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:47,001
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

297
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,084
You need a good hair-cut.

298
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:55,251
We'll go to a posh salon
in Bandra this Sunday...

299
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,918
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

300
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,793
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

301
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,001
Pyaari is missing since five days.

302
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,293
And we are behaving
as if it never happened.

303
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:07,876
She has been kidnapped.

304
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:14,751
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

305
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,209
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

306
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:24,876
There's no network inside.

307
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,501
So he comes out to take his calls.

308
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:27,793
Something about dealings...

309
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,251
He bought a new cell
phone a few days ago.

310
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,709
He is obsessed with
clicking snaps on his phone.

311
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,001
He has clicked mine too.

312
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,251
Where would he be right now?

313
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:38,376
Ogling at girls outside
Chaaya restaurant.

314
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:02,251
Kapil!

315
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:05,636
What are you up to?

316
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,793
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

317
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,918
Heading home? I'll drop you.

318
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,376
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

319
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,001
It's no bother. Come, sit.

320
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,001
Come.

321
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,376
Come sit.

322
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,001
Half our life is spent
waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

323
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:40,538
Whose call is it? Answer it.

324
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:43,543
It's from home.
I am going home anyway.

325
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,543
Your family is missing you, huh?

326
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,501
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

327
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,293
Anyway...

328
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,739
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

329
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,376
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:04,709
Take a good one.

331
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,709
Done? Show me.

332
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:10,293
What a phone you have there!

333
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:11,594
Ma'am, take a look.

334
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:13,001
Latest mobile.

335
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,001
Wow!

336
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:19,418
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

337
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:20,168
Peanuts!

338
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:25,626
We should also quit
our jobs and join an NGO.

339
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,209
Pick little girls
from the shelter home...

340
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,348
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

341
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:35,084
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

342
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,168
Don't play dumb. We know.

343
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:48,793
Jafar, let's start his
interrogation here itself.

344
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:53,584
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

345
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:54,751
Good idea, Ma'am.

346
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:58,209
Speak up. Who do you work for?

347
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:02,376
I don't understand what
you are talking about, Sir.

348
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:04,834
Why are you stretching it?

349
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,501
We are in an 'instant' era.

350
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,543
The quicker you answer,
the quicker you get home.

351
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,251
Come on speak up.

352
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,721
On whose instructions
did you kidnap Pyaari?

353
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:14,584
Where is she?

354
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,293
Speak UP, you scum!

355
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:23,876
He's just pretending.

356
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:28,543
You are messing with my head now!

357
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:30,334
Are you done?

358
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:34,251
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

359
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:38,668
There they are!

360
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:41,168
Morey, call the control
room and get reinforcement.

361
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:42,168
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

362
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:43,751
Morey keep his mobile.

363
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:53,084
Move aside!

364
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:03,626
Move!

365
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,001
The other shooter.

366
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,334
Jafar, this matter
is getting complicated.

367
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:36,293
Damn!

368
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,293
Pyaari, where are you my child!

369
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,209
Come here.

370
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:52,543
Move.

371
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:58,001
Stop fooling around, guys!

372
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:00,834
Come on.

373
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,543
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

374
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,668
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

375
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,626
Will you rip it or should I?

376
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,251
- Come on.
- No, please no!

377
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:12,459
Come here.

378
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:13,543
No!

379
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:18,418
Get her.

380
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,001
Come on. Stand straight, you!

381
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,418
I am telling you for the last time.

382
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,001
Don't do this to me.

383
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,418
Please!

384
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,584
Easy, Mattu!

385
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:11,251
Take it off!

386
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:25,168
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

387
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,584
In spite of you around?

388
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:29,043
Don't you find anyone
else to pick on!

389
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,459
Put her in No. 2.

390
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:33,543
Baby Doll!

391
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:36,543
Come here to Papa. Come.

392
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:38,543
Hey!

393
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:45,126
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

394
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,043
Are you insane?!

395
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,876
Who will you kill
with that splinter?

396
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,084
Myself. I will slash myself.

397
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,168
Don't slash your wrists.

398
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:56,501
It'll hurt more
and will take more time.

399
00:25:58,293 --> 00:25:59,501
Loretto School, Kolkata, huh?

400
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:01,918
Her school is very famous.

401
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,543
I was in Hindu College.

402
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:07,918
Dropped out in the second year.

403
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,626
But that I can help you with.

404
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:13,209
No really.

405
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:18,084
If you really want to die
then cut this vein of your neck.

406
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:20,126
It'll be quick and
it'll be painless.

407
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:25,084
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

408
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,001
Because you have seen me.

409
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,251
What's her name?

410
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:30,834
Mrunal.

411
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:36,293
Mrunal, now it leaves
us with two options.

412
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,626
You either work for me...

413
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,043
Don't come, don't come.

414
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,251
Chill. It's okay.

415
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,334
Or I will have to kill you.

416
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:48,501
What were you about to do?

417
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:52,251
Yeah. I would have
also done the same.

418
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:54,668
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

419
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:57,084
It would have taken
5-7 days for you to die.

420
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,501
In front of all the girls.

421
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,376
Is that what you want?

422
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:04,876
But what to do?

423
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:07,834
A bit of drama is required
to control so many of you.

424
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:11,084
And that leaves us
with our last option.

425
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:13,834
If you want to stay alive...

426
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:17,543
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

427
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,834
You are quite hot, you know.

428
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:22,168
I can get you the best clients.

429
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:27,918
5 star hotels, fine dining,
beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

430
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,418
Think about it.

431
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:36,668
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

432
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,084
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

433
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,876
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

434
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,626
Put her in No.1

435
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,876
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

436
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,709
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

437
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:43,501
Look at this.

438
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,584
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

439
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,918
All the notorious ones together?

440
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:53,001
Ma'am most of them are
members of the Ali Gang.

441
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,168
This one is Balu Kotian...

442
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,918
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

443
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,376
Go back.

444
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:02,459
Just a moment.

445
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:06,584
This...

446
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:11,668
Who's this?

447
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,668
I have never seen him before.

448
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:17,001
Kapil loved to flaunt
his connections.

449
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,709
He's surely a member of some gang.

450
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,918
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

451
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:29,834
To pick up a girl so smoothly,
and then shoot him...

452
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:33,668
Only an organized gang
can operate with such finesse.

453
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:42,834
There is one man,
who keeps track of such things.

454
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,251
Is this a new style
of interrogation?

455
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,626
Feed meat and extract information?

456
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,668
Tell me, Rehman,
is anything free in life?

457
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:58,001
If everything was without a price...

458
00:29:58,251 --> 00:29:59,851
...then would you
have become a gangster?

459
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:01,418
You are right.

460
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:11,001
Do you know him?

461
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:14,293
Are you kidding me?

462
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,346
You want me to be an
informer at my stature?

463
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:19,293
You idiot!

464
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,584
When I had come to arrest you...

465
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:25,001
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

466
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,334
And now you talk about stature?

467
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,668
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

468
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:33,043
Katyal.

469
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,001
He is Sunny Katyal.

470
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,084
He's not from Mumbai.

471
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:40,838
He started operating here
around three years ago.

472
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,418
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

473
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,209
But the real dough comes from
drugs and trafficking.

474
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:58,418
Whenever a girl between
8 to 18 years disappears...

475
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,709
more often than
not he is involved.

476
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:05,084
You can call him
the wholesaler of trafficking.

477
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:08,751
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

478
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,709
Why is he not on our radar yet?

479
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:15,001
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

480
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,626
It's impossible to crack
how he smuggles drugs and girls.

481
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,793
How do the other
gangs let him operate?

482
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,168
He is a very smart man.

483
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:24,966
Keeps everyone happy.

484
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:26,626
Has no enemies.

485
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:30,418
But I have a strong doubt that
he is not the brain behind all this.

486
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:33,001
There is someone
bigger supporting him.

487
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:36,876
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

488
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:44,668
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

489
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,876
Thanks for the meat.

490
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:57,626
Katyal.

491
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,126
Sunny Katyal.

492
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,293
I want to know about
every message...

493
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:02,709
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

494
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:06,084
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

495
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:07,499
I want to know everything.

496
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,168
Got it?

497
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:09,043
Yes, Ma'am.

498
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:35,001
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

499
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:36,418
I want it clear.

500
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,543
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

501
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,084
The crime branch people
have made my life hell.

502
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,381
I think they'll very soon
monitor me in the loo!

503
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,501
How did they get to know about you?

504
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,334
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

505
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:28,293
I just know that they are
behind my life with a vengeance.

506
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:29,383
What will you do now?

507
00:33:29,668 --> 00:33:31,428
I am thinking of talking
to the commissioner.

508
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:32,251
Moron!

509
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,876
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

510
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:37,566
Then please tell
me what I should do.

511
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:40,251
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

512
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:41,961
Throw some money at him.

513
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:43,834
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

514
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:44,626
It's some woman.

515
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:46,549
She has a track record
of not accepting bribes.

516
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:49,418
Woman? Tell me her name.

517
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,751
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the crime branch.

518
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:54,751
Do one thing.

519
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:57,626
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

520
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:03,876
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

521
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,918
Where the hell am I sitting!

522
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:09,126
Just when some money
was on its way...

523
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:12,543
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

524
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:18,709
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

525
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,168
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

526
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:22,209
Yes.

527
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:27,668
The batch of girls
this time is superb.

528
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:30,251
Really?

529
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:32,501
What did he say?

530
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,793
He signed a 200,000 deal.

531
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:39,168
The foreigners loved the
service that our girls gave.

532
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:41,881
What is the status of the girls
from Bangladesh?

533
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,043
It's getting delayed.

534
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:46,001
The security at the border
has become very stringent.

535
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,376
It will take a week more.

536
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,001
You are very lenient with them,
Vakil Sir.

537
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:57,876
They are very prompt
at collecting their payments.

538
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,501
But when it comes to delivery,
a week's delay?

539
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,668
Not done.

540
00:35:05,543 --> 00:35:06,263
What was her name?

541
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:07,709
Shivani Roy.

542
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:11,001
Wow! She's hot.

543
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:14,793
Let it be, Vakil sir.

544
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,334
You are too old to
deal with women like her.

545
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:22,001
I'll talk to her.

546
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,209
Tell Katyal to get
all information on her.

547
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,126
A week has passed
and no leads yet.

548
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,299
Either he is smart
or our information is wrong.

549
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:34,334
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

550
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:36,709
Let's wait for a few more days.

551
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,001
I am sure he will
commit some mistake.

552
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:48,084
Come on. I have got dinner.

553
00:35:58,251 --> 00:35:59,043
Hello?

554
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:00,793
You reached home, Ma'am?

555
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:01,793
Who's this?

556
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:02,793
Doesn't matter.

557
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:05,501
How come you picked dinner
from Aaswaad tonight?

558
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,441
Sharda bai didn't
come to work today?

559
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,543
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

560
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,501
- Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

561
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,501
Aunty, what have you got?

562
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,126
Someone else would
have been rattled.

563
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:17,793
Set the plates.
I am very hungry. Call Kaku.

564
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:19,334
Go, quick, quick.

565
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,126
Tell me.

566
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:23,751
Why are you watching me?

567
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:28,001
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

568
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:31,376
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

569
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:34,001
You sound like his son though.

570
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:35,418
How does it matter?

571
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:37,834
It's the same family.

572
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,668
The whole family seems twisted.

573
00:36:41,418 --> 00:36:44,001
You are calling me from VOIP
so I can't trace your call?

574
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:46,459
To deal with a sharp
officer like you...

575
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,584
...one needs to be prepared, right?

576
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:51,709
No point tracing the IP address...

577
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:53,961
You won't find anything.

578
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,334
Enough bragging-

579
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:58,168
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

580
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,543
Stop watching my people
and quote your price.

581
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,334
I want my daughter back.

582
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:05,709
Daughter?

583
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:08,126
You have a daughter?

584
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:11,876
The girl you picked up
from the Andheri shelter home...

585
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,126
...is like my daughter.

586
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,584
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

587
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,959
It might have been possible
if you had asked earlier.

588
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,084
It's difficult now.

589
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,584
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

590
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:32,126
You are stretching this
a bit too much.

591
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,418
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

592
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:38,876
Let's do one thing.

593
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:42,918
There's a 35 story skyscraper
coming up in Wadala.

594
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,793
The top floor is yours.

595
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:51,584
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

596
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,001
Then tell me what you want.

597
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,084
I told you I want Pyaari back.

598
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,293
Shivani ji, you
aren't listening to me.

599
00:38:02,668 --> 00:38:05,168
That girl has seen too much.

600
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,209
I don't take such
a risk in my business.

601
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,709
It's too late now.

602
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,668
Aunty, hurry up!

603
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,418
Listen, kid.

604
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:20,084
I'll come hunting to
your house to rescue Pyaari.

605
00:38:20,293 --> 00:38:21,013
But rescue I will.

606
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:23,793
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

607
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,084
Chill. Don't get worked up.

608
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:27,501
It doesn't suit you.

609
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:28,376
Anything else?

610
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:34,418
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

611
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:37,293
You need to think about it Junior.

612
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,876
I won't take too
long to reach Pyaari...

613
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:43,001
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

614
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:48,543
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

615
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,084
Let's just both do
what's best for business.

616
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:54,251
But I have to admit
it was fun talking to you.

617
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,293
Bye Ma'am.

618
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:04,501
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

619
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,668
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

620
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:10,043
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

621
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:13,043
How dare you touch me?

622
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:17,043
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

623
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:20,709
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

624
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,418
I will speak to the Human Rights
Organisations...

625
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:25,621
...and feed you to the dogs.

626
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:26,793
Sure.

627
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:28,501
- Jafar?
- Patil?

628
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:37,001
You feed us to the dogs
and we will feed you jalebis.

629
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:38,668
Jalebi?

630
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:44,626
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

631
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:46,843
I don't eat jalebis.

632
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:48,293
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

633
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:53,001
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

634
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,584
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

635
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:56,376
Eat.

636
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:09,126
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

637
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:16,543
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

638
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,001
She looks grown
but is just a child.

639
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:26,376
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

640
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:38,751
No!

641
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:46,418
I thought I'll celebrate
my birthday with Ganpati.

642
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,266
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

643
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:50,751
How are you?

644
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:53,001
- How old will you be?
- How old are you?

645
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:54,168
- Twelve.
- Me too.

646
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:55,043
You too?

647
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:58,751
Pyaari, come quickly.

648
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:08,168
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

649
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:09,418
What will you become
when you grow up?

650
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:10,751
An airplane driver.

651
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:11,668
What?

652
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:15,626
It's called a pilot,
not a driver, you fool!

653
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:17,001
Same thing.

654
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:21,168
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

655
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:36,001
Ma'am, have your ginger
tea and fix your mood.

656
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,376
Thank you, Jafar.

657
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,168
He's a seasoned player.

658
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:47,584
We stuffed him with
a kilo of jalebis...

659
00:41:47,918 --> 00:41:49,558
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

660
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:51,793
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

661
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:55,334
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

662
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:59,168
Ask Morey and Pawaskar
to continue later.

663
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:01,168
Don't let him sleep
even for a second.

664
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:02,251
Yes, Ma'am.

665
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:03,668
Thank you.

666
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:13,459
I am coming. Two minutes.

667
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,459
Aunty, you are so late!

668
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:22,834
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

669
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:26,168
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

670
00:42:58,043 --> 00:42:59,834
It won't hurt after
a couple of times.

671
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,084
Here...

672
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:06,126
...cupcake.

673
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,918
For both of you.

674
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,584
Every girl gets it
after her first night.

675
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:14,293
Have it.

676
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:21,168
I too blew my past away
after my first night.

677
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,543
That's the only way to survive here.

678
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,876
Otherwise your life will be hell.

679
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:31,709
Come on, now blow the candle
and move on.

680
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:34,584
Come on.

681
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:44,501
It's a great idea to teach
that nosy cop a lesson.

682
00:43:44,793 --> 00:43:47,459
But we'll have to
pay a fat price for it.

683
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,209
This guy will do our job for free.

684
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:53,459
Here.

685
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:55,751
Call Riyaz.

686
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,501
Tell him that this job must be done.

687
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,501
Performance bonus guaranteed.

688
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:10,959
Shivani ji, you will
stop nosing around after this.

689
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,876
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

690
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:21,001
It's good that way.

691
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:24,084
Fear gets work done faster.

692
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:36,293
Morey... 21 missed calls!

693
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:47,459
Ma'am, come quickly.

694
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:48,418
Why?

695
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,001
Ma'am, come quickly please.

696
00:44:59,876 --> 00:45:01,543
Get the pervert doctor!

697
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:26,168
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

698
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:28,293
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

699
00:46:28,376 --> 00:46:30,084
...of inappropriate behaviour.

700
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:32,293
Runa, that's my Kaku!

701
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:34,876
What's going on?

702
00:46:38,168 --> 00:46:39,751
A few hours after the allegations...

703
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:42,001
...the members of
Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

704
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:47,084
...attacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

705
00:46:48,043 --> 00:46:50,751
We had no intentions of
taking the law in our hands.

706
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:54,168
But the people are
fuming with anger...

707
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:56,293
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

708
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:58,918
The anger found its vent this way.

709
00:47:00,376 --> 00:47:02,126
That doctor must be punished.

710
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:05,584
Please eat.

711
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:47,376
Hello?

712
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:50,709
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

713
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:55,834
I am genuinely sorry
for what's happened.

714
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:59,459
In fact I even had tears
when I heard the news.

715
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:02,584
But I hope this doesn't
change things between us.

716
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:06,084
Because I am just
starting to like you.

717
00:48:06,834 --> 00:48:09,459
There was nothing personal
about this, Ma'am.

718
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:12,459
It's just business.

719
00:48:14,001 --> 00:48:16,001
Please don't harbour
any misunderstanding.

720
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:17,251
Please.

721
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:22,626
You know what, Junior,
I grew up in a village.

722
00:48:23,418 --> 00:48:26,501
There was a dense
forest near my house.

723
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,668
That's why from early on
in life I knew animals very well.

724
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:36,209
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the crime branch.

725
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,418
To trap a mouse you
have to act like one.

726
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,709
To catch a dog you
have to think like one.

727
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:44,251
To hunt a tiger you
have to become one.

728
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:46,459
You know what you are?

729
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,793
You are that poisonous
snake near the river...

730
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:58,001
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

731
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:03,376
You should have been with
the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

732
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:05,626
What are you doing
in the police force?

733
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:10,376
You are the one who's
about to be discovered, kid.

734
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,209
I don't know what your name is.

735
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:15,876
I don't know
where you are speaking from.

736
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:19,459
Who your boss is
or where you have kept Pyaari.

737
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:22,793
But I've figured your type

738
00:49:24,668 --> 00:49:28,376
No matter how far you
try to stay away...

739
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:31,084
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

740
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:33,001
30 days.

741
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:35,751
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

742
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:40,834
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

743
00:49:41,793 --> 00:49:43,918
Mark my words. 30 days.

744
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:05,001
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

745
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:08,001
You hear everything, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

746
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:10,084
Sir, first you don't give
me an opportunity to work...

747
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:12,459
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

748
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:16,001
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

749
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:18,834
Now you are making me drool.

750
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:21,293
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

751
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:24,709
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

752
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:25,834
That's awesome, Sir.

753
00:50:26,168 --> 00:50:28,668
The contract for Taneja's
personal party must come to us.

754
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,418
Why should I get you the contract?

755
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:34,709
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

756
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:39,584
And as far as girls go,
look at the choice, Sir.

757
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:41,834
Film star or porn star.

758
00:50:43,084 --> 00:50:44,668
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

759
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,126
Why should I get you the contract?

760
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:52,209
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

761
00:50:53,168 --> 00:50:55,001
The list will obviously
begin with you, Sir.

762
00:50:55,209 --> 00:50:58,876
And shame on me if you
have to tell me your list.

763
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:05,459
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

764
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:11,418
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

765
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:13,293
Darling, baby, come here.

766
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:15,376
Don't be shy. Come here.

767
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:19,084
Good girl.

768
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:22,168
Keep the tray here and
take Sir to the washroom.

769
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:25,959
Call me on Monday.

770
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,209
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

771
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:32,959
Don't forget, Sir!

772
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:34,584
Come, baby...

773
00:51:43,126 --> 00:51:43,918
Hey, Mattu.

774
00:51:44,793 --> 00:51:47,501
You really do appear out of nowhere!

775
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:48,959
I have been watching you.

776
00:51:49,084 --> 00:51:50,709
How long does it
take to crack a deal?

777
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:52,251
I am not selling water purifiers.

778
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:54,626
I am trying to crack a deal
worth crores. It takes time.

779
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:56,543
If he doesn't call on Monday...

780
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:58,793
I swear I'll go to Katra
and sell religious CDs.

781
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:00,376
If this deal doesn't come through...

782
00:52:00,459 --> 00:52:03,126
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

783
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:04,751
I am at it.

784
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,084
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

785
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:08,959
Okay. You crack this deal.

786
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,203
I'll send you to Mumbai
to look after our set up there.

787
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:12,293
Mumbai?

788
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:14,709
But Katyal is looking
after Mumbai, right?

789
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:17,334
Left... left... Very good.

790
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:19,543
Good Job.

791
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:21,793
You fool! Be careful.

792
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:23,584
The packet will break.

793
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:25,126
Be careful.

794
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:29,459
Guggu, will the car
be fixed by evening?

795
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,126
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

796
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:35,751
Hello, Vakil Sir.

797
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:38,209
This time the consignment is superb!

798
00:52:38,418 --> 00:52:40,209
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

799
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:43,709
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

800
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:46,876
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

801
00:52:47,293 --> 00:52:48,293
Should I fix her?

802
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:51,001
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

803
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,293
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

804
00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:55,506
What should I do then?

805
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:57,168
Go underground for a few days.

806
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:59,271
One of my men will
come in the evening.

807
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:00,626
Go with him to the safe house.

808
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:03,168
He will make arrangements
for you there.

809
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,126
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

810
00:53:05,376 --> 00:53:06,709
Don't crib so much!

811
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:08,959
Pack your bag and
be ready in the evening.

812
00:53:09,293 --> 00:53:10,709
Go with my man.

813
00:53:12,168 --> 00:53:12,834
Bye.

814
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:16,418
Pour it in my mouth!

815
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:18,084
Get lost!

816
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:20,168
I am surrounded by duck heads!

817
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:24,168
What's going on?

818
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:32,126
Vakil Sir has sent
such an atrocious car!

819
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:35,251
Good bye, Sir!

820
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:41,501
Hello? Hello?

821
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:48,918
The network conks off
at the slightest disturbance.

822
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:54,043
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

823
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:59,834
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

824
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:01,751
Hello?

825
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:05,168
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

826
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:08,209
Everything is bloody jinxed!

827
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:09,626
Get out of the car.

828
00:54:12,418 --> 00:54:13,001
Get out.

829
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,251
Vakil Sir!

830
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:17,293
Get out of the car
or I'll shoot you.

831
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:19,376
I am getting out!

832
00:54:21,084 --> 00:54:22,168
Listen to me.

833
00:54:22,668 --> 00:54:24,209
Why are you doing this? For money?

834
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:25,626
I'll give you double.

835
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:26,751
Move!

836
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:29,418
Listen to me once.

837
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:32,376
I'll give you all the money
you want right away.

838
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:33,379
Your life will be made.

839
00:54:33,459 --> 00:54:34,793
What's happening with me!

840
00:54:37,126 --> 00:54:38,376
Isn't there a chance?

841
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:44,251
Vakil, what a way
to repay my loyalty!

842
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:47,543
Let me tell you one
thing before I die.

843
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:50,959
Don't ever be overtly
loyal to anybody in life.

844
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:53,709
It screws you.

845
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:55,584
Look at me.

846
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,876
Fifteen years...

847
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:13,834
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

848
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:17,043
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

849
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:19,626
What a business you guys run!

850
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,584
May I ask you something?

851
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:26,876
How did you know about this?

852
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:30,959
I am beginning to know
your boss a little bit.

853
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:37,834
He knew that if he didn't
pick you up I would have.

854
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:42,501
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

855
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:44,334
When you sat in the car,

856
00:55:44,418 --> 00:55:47,209
Morey recognized that
your driver was Hanif's man.

857
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:50,459
Hanif has a brick factory
here in Kharegaon.

858
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:52,959
It makes it easier
to dispose bodies.

859
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:54,668
True.

860
00:55:56,876 --> 00:55:57,916
I won't leave that rascal.

861
00:55:58,251 --> 00:55:59,459
Nor will I.

862
00:56:00,459 --> 00:56:02,459
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

863
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:06,043
Kid? Which kid?

864
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:07,418
Your boss.

865
00:56:08,126 --> 00:56:09,486
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

866
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:10,793
What are you saying, Ma'am.

867
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,793
Vakil is at least
50 - 55 years old.

868
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:14,543
He is not a kid.

869
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:15,876
You scum!

870
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,126
If you waste our time again...

871
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,959
...I'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

872
00:56:21,168 --> 00:56:22,834
I swear by God I am not lying.

873
00:56:23,251 --> 00:56:24,251
If I am lying...

874
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:26,459
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

875
00:56:27,168 --> 00:56:29,626
Vakil got me to
Mumbai four years ago.

876
00:56:30,501 --> 00:56:31,918
I am working with him since then.

877
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:33,668
Keep talking.

878
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:35,126
I know Vakil very well.

879
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:36,501
He stays in Delhi.

880
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,293
Hello?

881
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:39,834
Damn! Katyal escaped.

882
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:40,876
How?

883
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:42,876
Hanif's man was found dead.

884
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:44,834
How did he die?

885
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,126
He was shot.

886
00:56:46,293 --> 00:56:47,043
Where?

887
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:50,834
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

888
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:52,918
On the body.

889
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:56,043
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

890
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:00,441
He was shot in the head from behind.

891
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:01,793
Where did they find the dead body?

892
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,361
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

893
00:57:07,168 --> 00:57:08,418
Hang up the other phone.

894
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:11,293
Hung UP-

895
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:15,376
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

896
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:16,918
But who saved him?

897
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:18,168
Who else?

898
00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:20,418
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

899
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:23,918
It's time to send her another gift.

900
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:09,668
Congrats Ma'am.

901
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:12,959
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

902
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:15,209
Every time you point
a finger at me...

903
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,376
...you will get this gift from me.

904
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:20,043
Your Kid.

905
00:58:41,376 --> 00:58:45,543
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

906
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,709
Hello!

907
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:10,418
I have left from the hotel.
I am going to office now.

908
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:14,376
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

909
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,418
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

910
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:26,168
He was my senior in the institute.

911
00:59:26,418 --> 00:59:28,126
We used to have
fun times those days.

912
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:30,293
He praises you very highly.

913
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,751
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like a wild bull.

914
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:37,459
You know what.
Good officers like you...

915
00:59:37,793 --> 00:59:39,293
- May I?
- Yes, come in.

916
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:42,959
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

917
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,584
Meet Sub-Inspector
Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

918
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:47,918
A very efficient officer.

919
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,168
Shivani Roy.

920
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:51,626
- Ma'am... - Senior Inspector,
Mumbai Crime Branch.

921
00:59:52,584 --> 00:59:54,584
She has come with information
on a huge child...

922
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:56,918
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

923
00:59:57,584 --> 01:00:01,001
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

924
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:01,976
Thank you, Sir.

925
01:00:02,543 --> 01:00:04,459
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

926
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:06,293
Your source? Here?

927
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:09,251
I have got him here
with Sinha Sir's help.

928
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:11,228
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

929
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:13,459
Ditto! This is exactly how he looks.

930
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:16,626
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

931
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:19,459
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

932
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:21,501
But nobody knows his real name.

933
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:23,876
He sometimes deals
as Devinder Pasricha.

934
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:26,084
Or opens an office
in the name of Aakash Pandey.

935
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,501
But he keeps no name
or office for more than six months.

936
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,418
We haven't heard of him ever.

937
01:00:33,876 --> 01:00:35,501
He takes pride in that.

938
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:37,879
He always boasts that
he will never get arrested.

939
01:00:38,084 --> 01:00:39,626
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

940
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:41,209
Of course there is.

941
01:00:41,793 --> 01:00:43,834
One is drugs and the other is girls.

942
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:46,334
And that too because
he is getting senile with age.

943
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:50,126
We can't go posing
as customers for girls.

944
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:52,751
He will be expecting me
to do something like this.

945
01:00:53,043 --> 01:00:55,043
We'll have to play him
in such a way...

946
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,709
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

947
01:00:59,043 --> 01:01:02,834
Usually drug suppliers
deal only in one kind of drug...

948
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:05,209
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

949
01:01:05,543 --> 01:01:07,584
If he has his way he'll sell
cough syrup as drugs.

950
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:08,834
He is that greedy.

951
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:10,751
As far as I know, Sodhi...

952
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,418
...South American drug
is hard to get, right?

953
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:15,669
Right. And even if you get it,
its very expensive.

954
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:19,876
That means a higher profit margin.

955
01:01:21,418 --> 01:01:23,584
He will do anything for business.

956
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,293
If we can get this news to Vakil
that we are not buyers...

957
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:32,168
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

958
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:35,209
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

959
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:38,709
If he comes to know
then it is sure to reach Vakil.

960
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:43,418
But our drug supplier
should look genuine.

961
01:01:51,168 --> 01:01:52,251
Why should we do it?

962
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,418
Because it's a question
of somebody's life Mbangwa.

963
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:57,543
But it's a matter of our life too.

964
01:01:57,834 --> 01:01:58,959
And what if we get killed?

965
01:01:59,209 --> 01:02:00,543
Who will kill you?

966
01:02:00,793 --> 01:02:02,584
We are here to protect you. Relax.

967
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:04,543
Stupid policeman.

968
01:02:06,584 --> 01:02:07,209
No.

969
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:10,543
Listen to me Mboso.

970
01:02:12,126 --> 01:02:14,376
Don't forget
you don't have any passport.

971
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:17,376
So either I will make
papers to deport you back...

972
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:19,504
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

973
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,293
You decide.

974
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:37,418
- Where's Bob?
- What?

975
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:40,334
- Where Bob? Bob?
- Bob? Down there.

976
01:02:40,418 --> 01:02:41,084
Okay.

977
01:02:45,918 --> 01:02:46,918
Hail Almighty!

978
01:02:48,043 --> 01:02:50,001
Mind-blowing stuff!

979
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:52,168
Very good, very good.

980
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:54,084
- Hey, Bob!
- Baby!

981
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:57,084
- Having fun?
- Yeah!

982
01:02:57,168 --> 01:02:58,126
Go enjoy!

983
01:03:01,668 --> 01:03:03,084
So, big guy, how much do you have?

984
01:03:03,834 --> 01:03:04,376
Five.

985
01:03:04,751 --> 01:03:05,918
Five what?

986
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:07,293
Five kilos.

987
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,126
Are you crazy?

988
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:13,001
I want 100 grams only.

989
01:03:14,668 --> 01:03:17,834
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

990
01:03:18,168 --> 01:03:18,918
Let's go.

991
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:23,834
Listen, come here.

992
01:03:25,709 --> 01:03:29,293
I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

993
01:03:29,626 --> 01:03:31,459
The whole material. Okay?

994
01:03:32,084 --> 01:03:34,376
How much longer? Please hurry.

995
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,751
What should I tell Bob?

996
01:03:40,168 --> 01:03:41,001
Who's Bob?

997
01:03:41,834 --> 01:03:43,959
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

998
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:48,376
He met those Nigerians.

999
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,001
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1000
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,251
Give me some onions.

1001
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:57,168
The material will be
good if Bob has checked it.

1002
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,043
Besides the cricket season
is beginning from next month.

1003
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,459
How much longer?

1004
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:05,084
It's been a long time now.

1005
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:14,376
Tell all our people that
if someone demands girls...

1006
01:04:15,168 --> 01:04:18,918
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

1007
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:22,584
Our cop chick will surely
send someone as a customer.

1008
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:24,993
Not to take any new customers?

1009
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:27,043
I said no.

1010
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:29,293
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1011
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:32,168
Taste from my plate
if you are in such a rush.

1012
01:04:34,376 --> 01:04:35,501
What else to say!

1013
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:39,668
Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

1014
01:04:43,168 --> 01:04:44,168
Yeah, Bob.

1015
01:04:45,168 --> 01:04:47,626
The call has come. I am leaving.

1016
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:49,168
Okay.

1017
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:55,376
Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road.

1018
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:57,459
Tell me the position
of Mboso's car later.

1019
01:04:58,043 --> 01:04:58,793
Let's go.

1020
01:05:14,168 --> 01:05:16,293
- Auto!
- Lajpat Nagar, please.

1021
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:19,459
Ma'am, what are you doing?
We called for it first.

1022
01:05:19,668 --> 01:05:21,376
Shut up! Or I'll call the police.

1023
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,376
Ma'am we are the police.

1024
01:05:23,543 --> 01:05:25,463
We are going to raid a place.
Want to come along?

1025
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:26,626
Ma'am, let's go.

1026
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:28,001
Sit. Quick.

1027
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:30,043
I am leaving. Have patience.
Let me take my bag.

1028
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,376
The cops are riding autos
these days.

1029
01:05:33,084 --> 01:05:33,964
- Please hurry.
- Auto!

1030
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:36,209
- Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.
- Right away Ma'am.

1031
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:54,793
We have got a biker
who's asking us to follow.

1032
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:55,834
Follow him.

1033
01:05:56,543 --> 01:06:00,543
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1034
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:49,001
Sodhi, stop.

1035
01:06:49,543 --> 01:06:51,709
Stop following Mboso.
They are watching.

1036
01:06:58,918 --> 01:07:00,501
Come, Sodhi. They have left.

1037
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:05,584
- Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1038
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:07,918
Track the car on
GPS and let me know.

1039
01:07:08,293 --> 01:07:09,418
- Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1040
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:15,084
Go.

1041
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:22,793
Yes, Mathur.

1042
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:24,876
Sodhi, take a left.

1043
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,251
Vakil sir, is everything fine?
Should I come up?

1044
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:31,959
All okay. You can come up.

1045
01:07:34,043 --> 01:07:34,709
Okay.

1046
01:07:39,418 --> 01:07:41,626
Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car.

1047
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:15,293
The cops are here.

1048
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:17,834
Get out from the back door.

1049
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:21,543
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1050
01:08:21,876 --> 01:08:22,751
Cover from there.

1051
01:08:23,501 --> 01:08:25,501
Bloody swine! You got the cops!

1052
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:27,584
Ratan, they'll come
up if they hear a gun shot.

1053
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:29,084
You leave from the back door.

1054
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,801
Vakil Sir, leave!
The cops have surrounded us.

1055
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,293
You've deceived Vakil!

1056
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:07,084
Leave, Vakil Sir.
Hurry! The police is here.

1057
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,959
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1058
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:20,043
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1059
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:21,543
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1060
01:09:21,626 --> 01:09:22,251
Okay.

1061
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:31,501
Break it.

1062
01:09:36,126 --> 01:09:37,566
Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1063
01:09:41,584 --> 01:09:42,501
Come, you...

1064
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:45,001
You conned us!

1065
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:56,043
In the Nehru Place office...

1066
01:09:56,126 --> 01:10:00,376
...there's a black diary
beneath my chair.

1067
01:10:00,626 --> 01:10:02,376
It has the numbers and
addresses of our clients.

1068
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:04,584
Keep that carefully.

1069
01:10:07,793 --> 01:10:09,418
I don't have time.

1070
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:15,543
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1071
01:10:16,793 --> 01:10:18,293
And I won't ever let that happen.

1072
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:20,626
What are you talking about,
Vakil Sir?

1073
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:23,459
We'll get you out somehow.
You just leave now.

1074
01:10:23,709 --> 01:10:27,501
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1075
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:29,501
Hello? Vakil Sir?

1076
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:33,418
Vakil Sir?

1077
01:10:52,376 --> 01:10:54,376
Move, move. Sodhi.

1078
01:11:21,209 --> 01:11:21,793
Damn!

1079
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:56,168
You piece of trash!

1080
01:12:32,168 --> 01:12:33,793
- Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1081
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:35,918
Did you sleep well?

1082
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:39,626
You are up so early?
Do you work in a call centre?

1083
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:41,168
What to do Ma'am!

1084
01:12:41,876 --> 01:12:44,459
I couldn't sleep wondering
how to kill you.

1085
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:47,918
So have you decided
how you'll kill me?

1086
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:52,543
I won't kill you.
You will kill yourself.

1087
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:56,418
I am just going to
lie back and watch you.

1088
01:12:57,668 --> 01:13:00,834
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1089
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:02,959
Are you done wishing good morning...

1090
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:04,928
...or is there anything
else you want to say?

1091
01:13:06,084 --> 01:13:07,168
What is there to say?

1092
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:11,001
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1093
01:13:12,876 --> 01:13:15,209
You are sharp I must admit.

1094
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:18,168
You killed Vakil Sir...

1095
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:21,793
...hid your family safely.

1096
01:13:23,293 --> 01:13:25,501
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1097
01:13:27,043 --> 01:13:27,876
Because I am still alive.

1098
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:29,959
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1099
01:13:31,584 --> 01:13:33,459
But you are in my territory.

1100
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:36,543
Beware.

1101
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:51,043
Don't chew. Swallow!

1102
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:54,209
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1103
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:56,084
You just have to eat this pellet.

1104
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:58,001
Even the grapes are here.

1105
01:13:58,168 --> 01:13:59,959
Will you practice with grapes?

1106
01:14:00,459 --> 01:14:02,293
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1107
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:04,168
You better!

1108
01:14:04,209 --> 01:14:05,209
Open your mouth.

1109
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:06,876
Give me some other work.

1110
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,043
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1111
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:13,418
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1112
01:14:13,668 --> 01:14:16,168
- Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1113
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:18,418
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1114
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:20,084
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1115
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:21,376
Yes, they are.

1116
01:14:21,459 --> 01:14:22,709
You worry too much.

1117
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,209
By the way when are you
sending me to Mumbai?

1118
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,751
I'll take care of our set up there.

1119
01:14:26,084 --> 01:14:28,459
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1120
01:14:29,126 --> 01:14:31,793
6 girls are leaving for London
and 3 for Texas.

1121
01:14:31,876 --> 01:14:34,668
Their domestic help visas
and documents are ready.

1122
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:36,876
Last time on the way
to the airport...

1123
01:14:36,959 --> 01:14:38,876
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1124
01:14:39,168 --> 01:14:39,959
Remember?

1125
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:41,918
Is anyone else
going to die this time?

1126
01:14:42,001 --> 01:14:44,084
No. This time Alka
has taken all precautions.

1127
01:14:44,168 --> 01:14:45,793
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1128
01:14:46,043 --> 01:14:47,793
This time I have used
the safest coatings.

1129
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:49,543
The pellets won't burst.

1130
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,151
Chill. Everything is under control.

1131
01:14:51,293 --> 01:14:51,876
Yes.

1132
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:55,626
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1133
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:57,168
We must have only
the best in the party.

1134
01:14:57,293 --> 01:14:58,418
- Alka.
- Yes.

1135
01:14:58,668 --> 01:15:00,376
Have you sent our man
to the police headquarters?

1136
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:03,043
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1137
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:04,668
She will definitely go there.

1138
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:07,043
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1139
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:10,293
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1140
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,543
Angelina, baby...

1141
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:17,168
...what's wrong with you?

1142
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:18,918
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1143
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:21,168
She hasn't slept well last night.

1144
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,709
Is your name Julia or Angelina?

1145
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:25,834
Julia...

1146
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:28,293
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1147
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:33,459
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1148
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:35,626
I am just tired...

1149
01:15:37,126 --> 01:15:38,709
Tired, huh?

1150
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:42,376
That's why you have this
strip of cloth on your forehead.

1151
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:44,834
I understand.

1152
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:47,459
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1153
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,459
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1154
01:15:50,668 --> 01:15:51,501
No, no, no...

1155
01:15:51,709 --> 01:15:53,876
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1156
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:57,376
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1157
01:15:59,043 --> 01:16:02,543
Please let her stay. Please.

1158
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:05,668
- Come on.
- I am all right.

1159
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,959
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1160
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:17,751
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1161
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:21,668
- Hurry.
- Yes.

1162
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:26,168
Runa...

1163
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:28,793
Runa...

1164
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:32,376
Get her quickly!

1165
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:35,793
Runa... No! Runa!

1166
01:16:35,876 --> 01:16:37,001
Take her away. Come on!

1167
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:38,168
Runa!

1168
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:41,376
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1169
01:16:50,918 --> 01:16:55,084
Shivani, don't stretch
this case too much.

1170
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:58,043
We have got the man
we were looking for.

1171
01:16:58,168 --> 01:16:59,459
But we didn't, Sir!

1172
01:16:59,668 --> 01:17:01,959
The mastermind of this
syndicate is still roaming free!

1173
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:05,126
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1174
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:08,459
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1175
01:17:09,043 --> 01:17:10,126
And not just drugs...

1176
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:12,129
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1177
01:17:12,959 --> 01:17:15,751
Shivani, trafficking is
altogether a different matter.

1178
01:17:16,168 --> 01:17:19,168
We have a trafficking
department to investigate that.

1179
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:20,584
Department?

1180
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:25,834
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1181
01:17:26,251 --> 01:17:29,171
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1182
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:31,751
Sir, you don't need
the law to do something.

1183
01:17:31,918 --> 01:17:33,001
You need intent.

1184
01:17:33,251 --> 01:17:36,251
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1185
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:38,876
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1186
01:17:39,834 --> 01:17:45,584
All these girls who need our
help just end up being 'that girl'.

1187
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:48,668
No name, no ties.

1188
01:17:50,793 --> 01:17:52,751
It's very easy to give up on them.

1189
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,959
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1190
01:17:56,168 --> 01:17:58,876
So one should get emotional
only after girls are raped?

1191
01:17:59,251 --> 01:18:03,168
What's the point of holding a candle
march after everything's over?

1192
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:07,126
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1193
01:18:07,293 --> 01:18:10,709
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1194
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,418
But that doesn't mean that...

1195
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:16,209
...I forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1196
01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:18,376
And that too after
being a police officer.

1197
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:20,751
You know what, Sir...

1198
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:24,918
The day our police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1199
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:27,584
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1200
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:28,501
Enough, Shivani!

1201
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:31,959
I agree that we have
arrested a drug dealer...

1202
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:34,459
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1203
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:37,418
But now allow us
to take over from here.

1204
01:18:37,668 --> 01:18:38,709
Is that clear?

1205
01:18:39,126 --> 01:18:40,126
Sir, why us all the time?

1206
01:18:40,168 --> 01:18:42,543
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1207
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:44,459
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1208
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:45,376
Thank you, Sir.

1209
01:19:27,251 --> 01:19:29,171
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1210
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:31,751
I asked since when do you
drive an auto.

1211
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,584
Past four or five years.

1212
01:19:34,584 --> 01:19:36,376
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1213
01:19:36,543 --> 01:19:38,751
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1214
01:20:00,043 --> 01:20:01,418
She escaped!

1215
01:20:35,709 --> 01:20:36,293
Hello?

1216
01:20:36,584 --> 01:20:38,626
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1217
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,556
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1218
01:20:40,876 --> 01:20:42,793
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1219
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:46,418
We share the smallest
details of our life...

1220
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:49,709
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1221
01:20:50,209 --> 01:20:51,959
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1222
01:20:52,168 --> 01:20:52,709
Correct!

1223
01:20:52,918 --> 01:20:54,558
So Vakil will also
have someone like this.

1224
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:56,209
Nobody came to claim his body.

1225
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:58,279
Because of fear of interrogation.

1226
01:20:58,293 --> 01:20:59,959
Tell me what's your point.

1227
01:21:01,293 --> 01:21:02,876
Vakil must surely have someone.

1228
01:21:03,168 --> 01:21:04,376
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1229
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,751
She will surely know
whom Vakil worked for.

1230
01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:11,293
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1231
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:14,126
Whatever you found
on Vakil's body...

1232
01:21:14,293 --> 01:21:16,668
...gun, pant, shirt,
wallet, anything.

1233
01:21:16,918 --> 01:21:17,626
Get everything.

1234
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:20,584
We'll definitely find a clue.

1235
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,501
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1236
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:24,084
How can get it out of office?

1237
01:21:24,168 --> 01:21:26,793
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1238
01:21:27,793 --> 01:21:29,353
You will get me
in trouble Miss Shivani.

1239
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:33,084
I was so worried getting
these things out of office.

1240
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:36,751
Honestly whatever
we are doing is illegal.

1241
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:38,918
Always by the book.

1242
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:43,376
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1243
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:47,376
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1244
01:21:48,209 --> 01:21:51,084
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1245
01:21:51,293 --> 01:21:52,251
Please, Ma'am.

1246
01:21:53,168 --> 01:21:55,626
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1247
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:58,459
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1248
01:22:06,376 --> 01:22:08,168
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1249
01:22:10,209 --> 01:22:11,043
That's surprising.

1250
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:14,043
In an era of readymade,
this guy wore stitched clothes!

1251
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:15,543
Classic old school.

1252
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:19,084
Someone who stitches his trousers
and shirt form the same tailor...

1253
01:22:19,418 --> 01:22:21,459
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched from him.

1254
01:22:21,543 --> 01:22:23,293
Where is Modern Tailors?

1255
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:24,896
- Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:27,543
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1257
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:29,251
- From here?
- Yes.

1258
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:31,043
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1259
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:36,751
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1260
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:40,959
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1261
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:44,209
I know him for the past 23 years.

1262
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,876
Was this an accident
or some police case?

1263
01:22:48,376 --> 01:22:49,918
I don't know that.

1264
01:22:50,168 --> 01:22:53,293
My job is to find out
if he has any relatives.

1265
01:22:54,418 --> 01:22:57,751
I don't know of any relatives.

1266
01:22:58,501 --> 01:23:01,084
But there is a lady with
whom he was acquainted with...

1267
01:23:01,168 --> 01:23:02,668
...for the past many years.

1268
01:23:05,126 --> 01:23:08,918
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1269
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:13,376
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1270
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,834
Then she should
know about his death.

1271
01:23:17,084 --> 01:23:17,959
Where does she stay?

1272
01:23:18,418 --> 01:23:21,793
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1273
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:25,376
Yes?

1274
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:26,668
Is Minu Rastogi here?

1275
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:27,793
Who are you?

1276
01:23:28,626 --> 01:23:30,543
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1277
01:23:31,084 --> 01:23:31,751
Please come in.

1278
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:34,209
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1279
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:36,209
Harish...

1280
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:38,168
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1281
01:23:44,584 --> 01:23:45,793
Get this medicine.

1282
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:48,251
Yes, Ma'am.

1283
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:49,918
Please sit.

1284
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:53,418
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1285
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:56,501
I have diabetes.

1286
01:23:57,501 --> 01:23:59,834
My doctor has completely
banned sugar for me.

1287
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:02,001
You are young.

1288
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:05,834
- Here...
- Thank you.

1289
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,918
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1290
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:14,543
It's a long story.

1291
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:17,793
I have a lot of time.

1292
01:24:19,751 --> 01:24:21,584
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1293
01:24:22,334 --> 01:24:23,918
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1294
01:24:24,001 --> 01:24:26,918
If I find it later,
you know I'll shoot you, right?

1295
01:24:27,084 --> 01:24:27,668
Yes.

1296
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:30,376
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1297
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:34,001
Go do your work.

1298
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:40,293
Actually...

1299
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:43,918
I hadn't sent Harish
to get medicine.

1300
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:48,293
I had sent him to see
if there are cops outside.

1301
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,709
No, no, I have come alone.

1302
01:24:55,459 --> 01:24:58,959
O God, strange are your ways!

1303
01:25:00,543 --> 01:25:03,709
The person my son is looking
for in the whole city...

1304
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:06,959
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1305
01:25:11,709 --> 01:25:16,168
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1306
01:25:18,543 --> 01:25:20,293
What do you call him?

1307
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:24,376
The kid.

1308
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:27,584
This is his house.

1309
01:25:29,793 --> 01:25:31,209
What's happening to you?

1310
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:32,834
Feeling dizzy?

1311
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:37,543
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1312
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:44,793
Now you won't be capable
of doing anything.

1313
01:25:45,876 --> 01:25:49,459
And my Karan will
be back in some time.

1314
01:25:52,293 --> 01:25:54,251
You killed Vakil, right!

1315
01:25:56,626 --> 01:25:59,376
My Karan will torture you to death.

1316
01:26:02,751 --> 01:26:03,834
What fun it'll be!

1317
01:26:16,918 --> 01:26:19,001
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1318
01:26:24,834 --> 01:26:25,376
Hey...

1319
01:26:29,168 --> 01:26:30,168
lam Walt.

1320
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,293
Actually my name is Karan.

1321
01:26:35,293 --> 01:26:37,418
But I have changed it to Walt.

1322
01:26:40,126 --> 01:26:42,751
It's the name of the
hero in an English show.

1323
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:46,084
So you did keep your promise.

1324
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:49,168
You found me on the 27th day.

1325
01:26:49,876 --> 01:26:51,959
That's amazing.

1326
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:55,834
Congratulations!

1327
01:26:56,751 --> 01:26:59,501
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1328
01:27:01,543 --> 01:27:03,126
I'll just bring you to a state...

1329
01:27:03,209 --> 01:27:05,543
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1330
01:27:08,168 --> 01:27:09,168
You!

1331
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:31,209
Mom, what's for lunch?

1332
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:37,168
Are all the girls ready?

1333
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:40,293
Alka, you are on WhatsApp again!

1334
01:27:40,668 --> 01:27:41,959
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1335
01:27:42,043 --> 01:27:43,793
I'll get them ready
in just five minutes.

1336
01:27:44,918 --> 01:27:48,834
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1337
01:27:49,376 --> 01:27:53,168
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1338
01:27:53,584 --> 01:27:55,376
Honey, please. Thank you.

1339
01:27:55,543 --> 01:27:56,293
Open your mouth...

1340
01:27:57,543 --> 01:27:58,501
Properly...

1341
01:28:00,251 --> 01:28:01,126
Good girl!

1342
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:07,376
That's good.

1343
01:28:08,209 --> 01:28:10,459
And don't behave like a fool there.

1344
01:28:11,043 --> 01:28:12,209
Be sexy!

1345
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:13,626
Good girl!

1346
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:15,459
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1347
01:28:15,793 --> 01:28:17,418
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1348
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,126
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

1349
01:28:21,376 --> 01:28:22,376
Thank you.

1350
01:28:23,209 --> 01:28:24,418
Look at that.

1351
01:28:27,793 --> 01:28:29,918
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1352
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:31,418
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1353
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:33,876
- And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1354
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:35,376
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1355
01:28:35,459 --> 01:28:36,584
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1356
01:28:36,668 --> 01:28:37,918
She's very strong.

1357
01:28:38,168 --> 01:28:40,459
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1358
01:28:41,876 --> 01:28:43,168
Who is she?

1359
01:28:43,959 --> 01:28:44,834
I don't know.

1360
01:28:45,584 --> 01:28:48,168
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1361
01:28:48,959 --> 01:28:51,668
Is everyone ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1362
01:28:52,001 --> 01:28:53,293
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1363
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:55,043
Should I take them downstairs?

1364
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:57,126
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1365
01:28:57,209 --> 01:28:58,489
Everybody please wait and watch.

1366
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,168
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1367
01:29:01,376 --> 01:29:03,043
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1368
01:29:03,126 --> 01:29:04,584
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1369
01:29:04,959 --> 01:29:05,751
Get out.

1370
01:29:07,126 --> 01:29:09,626
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1371
01:29:09,709 --> 01:29:11,001
She's not asking you.

1372
01:29:11,959 --> 01:29:14,543
Julia, there's no movie
being shown here.

1373
01:29:15,626 --> 01:29:16,376
Go.

1374
01:29:16,959 --> 01:29:18,168
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1375
01:29:18,209 --> 01:29:18,876
Go!

1376
01:29:21,543 --> 01:29:24,501
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1377
01:29:24,584 --> 01:29:25,626
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1378
01:29:27,334 --> 01:29:31,293
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1379
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:34,626
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1380
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:38,084
Hold it Madam. Cool down.

1381
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:39,168
Get lost!

1382
01:29:39,376 --> 01:29:40,709
Listen girl!

1383
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:44,751
I have been doing this since
before you were even born!

1384
01:29:45,084 --> 01:29:47,418
I know exactly how to
tame the likes of you!

1385
01:29:48,043 --> 01:29:49,243
Just untie my hands and see...

1386
01:29:49,626 --> 01:29:53,459
...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

1387
01:29:53,918 --> 01:29:56,084
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1388
01:29:56,501 --> 01:29:57,418
Don't hit the face.

1389
01:29:57,918 --> 01:29:59,376
- Aunty!
- Pyaari!

1390
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:01,209
Hey! Wait!

1391
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:03,418
- Aunty! Please!
- Pyaari!

1392
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:07,251
Please, please! Let her go!
Let me meet her.

1393
01:30:07,584 --> 01:30:08,959
Once, just once.

1394
01:30:09,418 --> 01:30:11,959
I'll do whatever you say.
Do my make-up.

1395
01:30:12,876 --> 01:30:15,959
Saw Mattu!
That's how you fix such dames!

1396
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:18,089
Get your make-up done.

1397
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:19,418
- Pyaari!
- Aunty!

1398
01:30:27,501 --> 01:30:29,209
I slapped her hard.

1399
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:32,043
Pyaari...

1400
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:44,626
All this is because of me.

1401
01:30:46,376 --> 01:30:47,293
No, Aunty!

1402
01:30:49,168 --> 01:30:51,126
I am alive because of you.

1403
01:30:56,209 --> 01:30:59,459
Enough of this nonsense!
Enough! Stop it!

1404
01:31:01,293 --> 01:31:03,959
Stop this emotional
melodrama. Come on!

1405
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:06,251
Aunty, no!

1406
01:31:06,376 --> 01:31:08,456
- You have to get your make-up done.
- Take her away!

1407
01:31:08,751 --> 01:31:09,584
Aunty!

1408
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:14,709
Now, it's looking beautiful.

1409
01:31:17,418 --> 01:31:18,418
Hi, darling!

1410
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:24,626
Oh hi! Long time.

1411
01:31:27,126 --> 01:31:28,376
Take good care of them, sweety.

1412
01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:31,459
Please come, Sir!

1413
01:31:31,668 --> 01:31:33,418
The whole arrangement
is especially for you.

1414
01:31:33,751 --> 01:31:34,418
Thank you.

1415
01:31:34,626 --> 01:31:35,668
Everything is ready, Sir.

1416
01:31:35,918 --> 01:31:36,543
Sir...

1417
01:31:37,418 --> 01:31:38,418
Hi, good evening.

1418
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:40,751
Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

1419
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:44,376
- He will come at his own time.
- Oh yes. Of course!

1420
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:45,751
You first show me your arrangements.

1421
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:47,209
- Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1422
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:50,501
Angie, baby, wait. Right
now he's just checking things out.

1423
01:31:50,876 --> 01:31:51,876
He'll come later.

1424
01:31:52,584 --> 01:31:53,126
Come, Sir.

1425
01:31:53,168 --> 01:31:54,543
Security is very tight.

1426
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:56,668
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1427
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:59,418
Only when there's no fear
of being photographed...

1428
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:02,084
...can a person enjoy freely.

1429
01:32:04,834 --> 01:32:05,959
Julia, come, baby.

1430
01:32:06,584 --> 01:32:09,209
Come, come, for Sir.

1431
01:32:09,793 --> 01:32:11,251
Don't be shy. Sir...

1432
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:21,876
Girls get abducted
in our cities for free...

1433
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:23,501
In broad day light.

1434
01:32:25,918 --> 01:32:29,876
But when one guy sets up
a small organized business...

1435
01:32:30,376 --> 01:32:31,543
...and everyone gets upset!

1436
01:32:33,834 --> 01:32:35,626
Why did you do all of this?

1437
01:32:36,668 --> 01:32:37,709
What did you get?

1438
01:32:41,626 --> 01:32:44,251
You women get personal too soon.

1439
01:32:46,543 --> 01:32:49,834
I agree that you are a cop,
from the crime branch.

1440
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:52,376
But to obsessively chase
just one criminal?

1441
01:32:52,459 --> 01:32:54,418
What kind of professionalism
is this?

1442
01:32:55,584 --> 01:32:56,793
Where did you learn this?

1443
01:32:58,001 --> 01:32:58,834
Nonsense.

1444
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:07,293
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1445
01:33:08,251 --> 01:33:10,376
You know what I am saying,
Miss Shivani?

1446
01:33:13,834 --> 01:33:15,126
The night is young.

1447
01:33:15,751 --> 01:33:18,126
Stare at the ceiling
and scream your lungs out.

1448
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:20,001
Scream?

1449
01:33:25,709 --> 01:33:26,376
Scream.

1450
01:33:37,209 --> 01:33:38,168
That's right.

1451
01:33:40,043 --> 01:33:41,043
There's no point.

1452
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:47,293
Crime branch!

1453
01:33:59,126 --> 01:34:00,001
Sir has come.

1454
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:07,584
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1455
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:08,959
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1456
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:10,209
- How are you?
- All good.

1457
01:34:10,293 --> 01:34:12,043
Everything's ready for you.

1458
01:34:14,668 --> 01:34:15,626
Welcome, Sir!

1459
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,043
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1460
01:34:18,293 --> 01:34:19,543
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1461
01:34:20,084 --> 01:34:20,793
Wait here.

1462
01:34:26,043 --> 01:34:26,751
Come, Sir.

1463
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:29,084
Come, Sir.

1464
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,543
Tandon, have you checked
everything personally?

1465
01:34:31,668 --> 01:34:32,501
Yes, Sir.

1466
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,876
You are bound to be happy
with the arrangements.

1467
01:34:37,418 --> 01:34:38,418
Come, Sir.

1468
01:34:39,626 --> 01:34:41,168
- Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1469
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:43,459
Sir, to your left.

1470
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:53,584
The arrangements look great.

1471
01:34:54,501 --> 01:34:57,043
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1472
01:34:57,376 --> 01:34:59,751
There's a special gift
for you in the suite upstairs.

1473
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:01,841
You should check it
out if you are in the mood.

1474
01:35:02,168 --> 01:35:03,209
Everybody knows.

1475
01:35:03,626 --> 01:35:05,709
Be it the opposition or women...

1476
01:35:06,251 --> 01:35:08,418
...I am always in a mood to crush!

1477
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:13,043
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1478
01:35:22,918 --> 01:35:23,584
Hello!

1479
01:35:25,876 --> 01:35:27,251
I have heard a lot about you.

1480
01:35:29,918 --> 01:35:30,501
You?

1481
01:35:31,668 --> 01:35:33,751
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1482
01:35:35,293 --> 01:35:37,501
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1483
01:35:38,168 --> 01:35:39,584
I am sure even you do.

1484
01:35:40,543 --> 01:35:41,501
My hobby is this.

1485
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:44,751
Have you really come to rape me?

1486
01:35:45,168 --> 01:35:47,709
I don't know how
one pretends to rape.

1487
01:35:48,168 --> 01:35:51,418
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1488
01:36:10,168 --> 01:36:11,251
You want to rape me!

1489
01:36:13,293 --> 01:36:15,543
Get up! Come on!

1490
01:36:19,709 --> 01:36:20,876
Stop this party!

1491
01:36:21,168 --> 01:36:22,459
Get out!

1492
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:23,709
What is happening?

1493
01:36:24,043 --> 01:36:25,751
Walt, where the hell are you?

1494
01:36:25,959 --> 01:36:27,084
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1495
01:36:27,251 --> 01:36:28,709
Where did she come from!

1496
01:36:29,168 --> 01:36:30,168
She has lost it!

1497
01:36:32,793 --> 01:36:36,376
Karan Rastogi, do you want
this minister alive or not?

1498
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:38,626
Tandon! Do something, Tandon!

1499
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:39,418
Mattu, wait!

1500
01:36:40,043 --> 01:36:41,959
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1501
01:36:42,168 --> 01:36:44,668
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1502
01:36:45,084 --> 01:36:46,834
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1503
01:36:47,376 --> 01:36:49,793
I want all the girls out.

1504
01:36:50,376 --> 01:36:52,496
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1505
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:53,293
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1506
01:36:53,501 --> 01:36:54,376
Mattu, are you dead!

1507
01:36:55,293 --> 01:36:57,333
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1508
01:36:57,376 --> 01:36:58,001
Hurry UP!

1509
01:36:58,126 --> 01:36:59,043
Fast

1510
01:36:59,668 --> 01:37:00,626
Fast, girls! Fast!

1511
01:37:01,001 --> 01:37:01,876
Hurry up, Alka.

1512
01:37:02,876 --> 01:37:03,918
- Pyaari, wait.
- Aunty.

1513
01:37:04,751 --> 01:37:05,626
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1514
01:37:05,793 --> 01:37:07,751
Give the key of the
mobile locker to Pyaari.

1515
01:37:07,959 --> 01:37:09,126
Give her the damn key.

1516
01:37:13,251 --> 01:37:14,418
You got the girls.

1517
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:15,756
What else do you want?

1518
01:37:16,084 --> 01:37:16,709
You.

1519
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:18,209
You will come with me.

1520
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:23,751
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1521
01:37:23,834 --> 01:37:25,584
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1522
01:37:25,959 --> 01:37:28,418
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1523
01:37:29,834 --> 01:37:33,418
Tell them that no one moves
from here till you get back.

1524
01:37:33,668 --> 01:37:35,628
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1525
01:37:35,918 --> 01:37:36,418
You wait.

1526
01:37:36,834 --> 01:37:38,876
Everybody, we have got
a bit of a situation.

1527
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:40,293
I am going to sort
it out and be right back.

1528
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:42,168
Raise your hands! Move!

1529
01:37:43,126 --> 01:37:43,918
Move!

1530
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:45,918
Come on.

1531
01:37:48,376 --> 01:37:50,251
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1532
01:37:54,376 --> 01:37:56,084
Damn! She has locked the door!

1533
01:37:57,043 --> 01:37:57,751
Come on quickly.

1534
01:37:57,834 --> 01:37:59,668
Aunty, but the exit
is this side.

1535
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:00,918
We are not going out.

1536
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:02,168
Open it!

1537
01:38:06,418 --> 01:38:08,501
Open! Get in.

1538
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:11,501
Come on, girls. Get in.

1539
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:14,584
Be there.

1540
01:38:17,084 --> 01:38:18,043
Pyaari, close the door.

1541
01:38:19,668 --> 01:38:21,751
Lock the door. Lock it!

1542
01:38:32,918 --> 01:38:34,209
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1543
01:38:34,668 --> 01:38:35,418
Get in!

1544
01:38:37,918 --> 01:38:40,709
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1545
01:38:41,168 --> 01:38:44,168
You guys think we cops
are morons, right?

1546
01:38:47,001 --> 01:38:48,209
But how did you manage to do this?

1547
01:38:48,293 --> 01:38:51,126
When I got the address
to your place...

1548
01:38:51,626 --> 01:38:53,668
...I had no clue
that it is your house.

1549
01:38:54,251 --> 01:38:57,668
- Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1550
01:38:57,959 --> 01:39:00,376
In crime branch we are trained to...

1551
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:04,751
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1552
01:39:05,168 --> 01:39:08,543
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1553
01:39:10,543 --> 01:39:11,709
Who else stays with her?

1554
01:39:11,918 --> 01:39:13,918
Her son and a servant.

1555
01:39:14,543 --> 01:39:15,501
How old is the son?

1556
01:39:15,751 --> 01:39:17,126
Around 25-26.

1557
01:39:17,293 --> 01:39:21,168
I was wondering what to do next
when I heard a sound.

1558
01:39:23,668 --> 01:39:26,168
Maybe God was trying
to tell me something.

1559
01:39:26,793 --> 01:39:29,793
I had heard this Azaan before.

1560
01:39:30,209 --> 01:39:31,126
But where?

1561
01:39:31,793 --> 01:39:33,168
Then I remembered.

1562
01:39:33,709 --> 01:39:35,584
But you can't do any harm to me.

1563
01:39:36,293 --> 01:39:37,168
Because I am still alive.

1564
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:39,011
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1565
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:45,668
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1566
01:39:47,251 --> 01:39:49,043
But then who will take
a risk with you?

1567
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:52,251
I began watching your house.

1568
01:39:52,668 --> 01:39:54,168
I spotted you the next day.

1569
01:39:54,793 --> 01:39:56,193
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1570
01:39:58,126 --> 01:40:00,293
But one look at your sly face...

1571
01:40:00,793 --> 01:40:02,033
...and I knew it had to be you.

1572
01:40:02,418 --> 01:40:05,418
The first thing I did was
put a GPS tracker in your car.

1573
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,126
48 hours went by...

1574
01:40:14,668 --> 01:40:17,209
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1575
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:19,251
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1576
01:40:19,543 --> 01:40:21,126
...and also the other girls.

1577
01:40:22,168 --> 01:40:25,209
Even if we did arrest you,
what could we charge you with?

1578
01:40:26,209 --> 01:40:28,793
That's when I decided that
there's no point wasting time.

1579
01:40:29,084 --> 01:40:30,793
Now you yourself
will take me to Pyaari.

1580
01:40:31,709 --> 01:40:35,001
I entered your house
but I was fully prepared.

1581
01:40:35,334 --> 01:40:37,543
I just had to make the move
at the right time.

1582
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:46,084
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1583
01:40:46,418 --> 01:40:49,584
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1584
01:40:50,876 --> 01:40:52,834
Pyaari, get the phone.

1585
01:40:54,001 --> 01:40:55,876
And what if I would have
killed you right then?

1586
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:59,501
I had to take that risk.

1587
01:41:01,251 --> 01:41:03,918
Like I said, I knew your type.

1588
01:41:04,668 --> 01:41:06,543
You wouldn't kill
me that easily.

1589
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:09,709
You would want to exploit me
like other women.

1590
01:41:11,709 --> 01:41:13,918
I must give it to you. But what now?

1591
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:16,001
Sodhi, come.

1592
01:41:17,793 --> 01:41:21,251
The police will take at
least 25 minutes to get here.

1593
01:41:21,709 --> 01:41:24,543
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1594
01:41:25,293 --> 01:41:28,834
And I am standing in
between you and your freedom.

1595
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,126
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1596
01:41:34,918 --> 01:41:36,876
Women... women...

1597
01:41:38,584 --> 01:41:40,751
Take everything personally, right?

1598
01:41:41,668 --> 01:41:42,418
Come on.

1599
01:41:43,376 --> 01:41:48,043
Let me see how far
on top a man can climb.

1600
01:41:49,126 --> 01:41:49,834
As you wish.

1601
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:12,626
Aunty!

1602
01:42:22,793 --> 01:42:24,084
Get up! Get up!

1603
01:43:01,168 --> 01:43:04,168
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1604
01:43:08,084 --> 01:43:12,376
You will me hit me a little
and then arrest me, right?

1605
01:43:15,168 --> 01:43:17,209
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1606
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:20,418
This is India.

1607
01:43:23,043 --> 01:43:25,876
Over here,
if you have the right contacts...

1608
01:43:26,126 --> 01:43:29,376
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1609
01:43:30,876 --> 01:43:32,876
This is trivial in comparison.

1610
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:36,793
So till then you
hit me and have fun.

1611
01:43:37,834 --> 01:43:39,001
Hit me, Ma'am.

1612
01:43:40,043 --> 01:43:41,543
There is nothing else you can do.

1613
01:43:42,334 --> 01:43:43,293
This is India.

1614
01:43:49,543 --> 01:43:51,668
This one thing you are right about.

1615
01:43:52,584 --> 01:43:53,543
This is India.

1616
01:43:54,168 --> 01:43:55,459
'This' is what goes on here.

1617
01:44:00,376 --> 01:44:04,209
These people sitting outside
will bury your crime?

1618
01:44:04,751 --> 01:44:08,751
They can do it only if you
reach the police station.

1619
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:13,543
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1620
01:44:13,793 --> 01:44:17,001
Here, if you don't want
to bother the court too much...

1621
01:44:17,168 --> 01:44:19,251
...issues can be settled this way.

1622
01:44:22,793 --> 01:44:23,543
Get up!

1623
01:44:27,543 --> 01:44:29,751
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1624
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:33,209
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1625
01:44:35,959 --> 01:44:36,793
Get up!

1626
01:44:46,251 --> 01:44:48,459
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1627
01:44:51,626 --> 01:44:52,709
What's your plan?

1628
01:44:55,626 --> 01:44:56,793
Are you going to murder me?

1629
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:00,418
In front of everyone?

1630
01:45:03,459 --> 01:45:04,626
This is India.

1631
01:45:05,376 --> 01:45:07,876
In India, if 50 people
take the law in their hands...

1632
01:45:07,959 --> 01:45:10,793
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1633
01:45:11,251 --> 01:45:12,959
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1634
01:45:26,501 --> 01:45:31,126
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1635
01:45:31,459 --> 01:45:36,459
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1636
01:45:46,668 --> 01:45:51,293
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1637
01:45:51,668 --> 01:45:56,543
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1638
01:45:56,793 --> 01:46:01,293
Touch my heart and I promise
you will mean the world to me

1639
01:46:01,501 --> 01:46:03,959
But if you ever mess with me

1640
01:46:04,043 --> 01:46:06,584
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1641
01:46:09,084 --> 01:46:11,876
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1642
01:46:27,084 --> 01:46:31,959
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1643
01:46:32,168 --> 01:46:36,834
I will in that same place
destroy your entire race

1644
01:46:37,168 --> 01:46:41,501
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1645
01:46:41,959 --> 01:46:44,334
But if you ever mess with me

1646
01:46:44,418 --> 01:46:47,043
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1647
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:52,251
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1648
01:47:07,293 --> 01:47:12,376
In a skirt or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1649
01:47:12,584 --> 01:47:17,543
I won't lead a life
full of fear and regret

1650
01:47:22,709 --> 01:47:27,543
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1651
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:32,543
I will break all shackles of rules
belonging to this world

1652
01:47:32,793 --> 01:47:37,376
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1653
01:47:37,543 --> 01:47:39,918
But if you ever mess with me

1654
01:47:40,043 --> 01:47:42,834
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1655
01:47:49,293 --> 01:47:52,209
Walt died on his way
to the hospital.

1656
01:47:52,709 --> 01:47:56,168
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1657
01:47:56,626 --> 01:47:59,918
He revealed everything about Walt,

1658
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:02,418
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1659
01:48:04,168 --> 01:48:06,751
First, the girls made up
Minu's face.

1660
01:48:07,168 --> 01:48:08,418
And then God did.

1661
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:10,751
Minu later suffered
a paralysis attack.

1662
01:48:15,251 --> 01:48:18,043
Taneja survived
and is now in Tihar jail.

1663
01:48:18,501 --> 01:48:21,959
His scarred face is an
amusement to most in the jail.

1664
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:31,168
Today, we could bring back
the smile on Pyaari's face.

1665
01:48:31,459 --> 01:48:34,918
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1666
01:48:35,293 --> 01:48:38,293
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scot-free...

1667
01:48:38,584 --> 01:48:39,793
must be stopped.

1668
01:48:40,168 --> 01:48:42,126
The Mardaani (Fighter)
that's hidden within...

1669
01:48:42,293 --> 01:48:45,043
has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1670
01:48:45,501 --> 01:48:47,418
The war is still on.
