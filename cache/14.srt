1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop the
evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally
thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm gonna do everything in my power

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
to change the future,
and I'm the only one

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
fast enough to keep her alive.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,648
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:02,748
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:02,749
&nbsp

29
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,783
Grodd. He's got my dad.

30
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:04,784
&nbsp

31
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:06,952
Harry's my friend. I'm not
gonna just abandon him.

32
00:00:06,962 --> 00:00:06,953
&nbsp

33
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:08,554
I'm going back to Earth-2.

34
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:08,555
&nbsp

35
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:11,490
Now I am the ruler of Gorilla City,

36
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,491
&nbsp

37
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,092
and all the gorillas will
follow anything I order.

38
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:14,093
&nbsp

39
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:15,893
Grodd the gorilla, he's
talking through Wells?

40
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:15,894
&nbsp

41
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:16,961
Yeah.

42
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:16,962
&nbsp

43
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:18,896
Who is this gorgeous intruder?

44
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:18,897
&nbsp

45
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:20,064
Her name is Gypsy.

46
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:20,065
&nbsp

47
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:21,533
She's a Collector.

48
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:21,534
&nbsp

49
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:22,900
Open a breach!

50
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:22,901
&nbsp

51
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:24,602
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

52
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:24,603
&nbsp

53
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,137
You will open the breaches,

54
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:26,138
&nbsp

55
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:31,042
and Central City will fall before Grodd.

56
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:38,216
&nbsp

57
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,949
Barry?

58
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:39,950
&nbsp

59
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,219
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

60
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,220
&nbsp

61
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,323
You're in a good mood for
6:30 in the morning.

62
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:46,324
&nbsp

63
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:47,357
Yes, I am.

64
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:47,358
&nbsp

65
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:48,425
Was I too loud?

66
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:48,426
&nbsp

67
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,425
I did make breakfast.

68
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:49,426
&nbsp

69
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:51,527
We got pancakes and waffles,

70
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:51,528
&nbsp

71
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:52,795
some French toast,

72
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:52,796
&nbsp

73
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,363
bacon and sausage, perfectly cooked.

74
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:54,364
&nbsp

75
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:56,465
And I picked up some of that

76
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:56,466
&nbsp

77
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,701
dark roast that you love so much.

78
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:58,702
&nbsp

79
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:00,803
Barry Allen, what has gotten into you?

80
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:00,804
&nbsp

81
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:03,372
Being with you makes me want
to do things like this.

82
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:03,373
&nbsp

83
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:04,574
Come here.

84
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:10,012
&nbsp

85
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:11,346
I love you.

86
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:14,783
&nbsp

87
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:17,118
I love you.

88
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:17,119
&nbsp

89
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,622
Um, so do you actually
want any of this, or...

90
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:20,623
&nbsp

91
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,457
Um, yes.

92
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:22,458
&nbsp

93
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:25,426
And some of the food too.

94
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:25,427
&nbsp

95
00:01:25,437 --> 00:01:26,594
Yeah.

96
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,397
&nbsp

97
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,731
Whoa-ho-ho-ho, nice.

98
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:37,940
&nbsp

99
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,540
What...

100
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,541
&nbsp

101
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:40,806
are you doing?

102
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:40,807
&nbsp

103
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:43,376
I'm decorating!

104
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:43,377
&nbsp

105
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:45,978
Look at this place! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

106
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:45,979
&nbsp

107
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,413
You're decorating the Speed Lab?

108
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:47,414
&nbsp

109
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:49,081
Yes, I'm decorating the Speed Lab.

110
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:49,082
&nbsp

111
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:51,351
You know, 'cause Francisco, you know,

112
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:51,352
&nbsp

113
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,052
he wouldn't let me decorate the cortex,

114
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:53,053
&nbsp

115
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:55,888
'cause I made it look
oh-so-jolly for Christmastime.

116
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:55,889
&nbsp

117
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,322
What are the balls for?

118
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:57,323
&nbsp

119
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,190
Do you know what those are? Lanterns.

120
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,191
&nbsp

121
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:01,460
You know what I always say,
a fella that can't tell

122
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,461
&nbsp

123
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,194
the difference between
balls and lanterns

124
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:03,195
&nbsp

125
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:04,963
is in trouble when the lights go out.

126
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,033
&nbsp

127
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,067
Ohhh...

128
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:09,068
&nbsp

129
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,669
You go front to back.

130
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:10,670
&nbsp

131
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,371
Toothbrushing. You go front to back?

132
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:12,372
&nbsp

133
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,972
'Cause I'm a small circles kind of guy.

134
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:13,973
&nbsp

135
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:16,106
I wonder how the other
Wells brushes his teeth.

136
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:16,107
&nbsp

137
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,208
- The murderer?
- I'm fascinated

138
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:18,209
&nbsp

139
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,711
by the subtle differences
between us, you know?

140
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:20,712
&nbsp

141
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,880
- And the not-so-subtle ones.
- Like what?

142
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:22,881
&nbsp

143
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,749
Like the fact that I'm a genius

144
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:24,750
&nbsp

145
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,250
and you're a moron.

146
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,590
&nbsp

147
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,789
Okay.

148
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:32,790
&nbsp

149
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,727
See you at the party.

You know what I got to do?
I got to take some lessons

00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:07,756
&nbsp

177
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,256
Ba-da!

178
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:09,257
&nbsp

179
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,692
- What?
- Yeah.

180
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:10,693
&nbsp

181
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:12,427
- Friend's Day.
- Friend's?

182
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:12,428
&nbsp

183
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,829
Oh, it's my Earth's equivalent

184
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:14,830
&nbsp

185
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,263
- of Valentine's Day.
- Valentine's Day.

186
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:16,264
&nbsp

187
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:17,632
And I thought, like, after, you know,

188
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:17,633
&nbsp

189
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,099
our success with the gorillas,

190
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:19,100
&nbsp

191
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,935
that we should, like,
celebrate the love.

192
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:20,936
&nbsp

193
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,569
Was all this necessary?

194
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:22,570
&nbsp

195
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,705
Yeah, Joe. Speaking of, where is your...

196
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:24,706
&nbsp

197
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:26,239
Your lady friend? 'Cause
I would like to...

198
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:26,240
&nbsp

199
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,841
No, you wouldn't like to do anything.

200
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:27,842
&nbsp

201
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:30,076
She's at work, which is
where I should be going.

202
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:30,077
&nbsp

203
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,611
Yeah, I...

204
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:31,612
&nbsp

205
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:33,380
Look what I have, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,381
&nbsp

207
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:36,015
I have your own personal
Friend's Day card.

208
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:36,016
&nbsp

209
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,617
- Wow.
- For yours truly, Ms. West.

210
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:37,618
&nbsp

211
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,719
- Thank you, H.R.
- Captain.

212
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:39,720
&nbsp

213
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,286
- Thanks, H.R.
- Leader of the ship.

214
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:41,287
&nbsp

215
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:42,755
- Thank... thank you.
- You're so welcome.

216
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:42,756
&nbsp

217
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,257
Oh, hi, Jesse "So Quick"

218
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:45,258
&nbsp

219
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:49,027
Yeah, I also made one for
your grumpy old dad.

220
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:49,028
&nbsp

221
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,096
Ah, you know what I like?

222
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:51,097
&nbsp

223
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,098
- Yo' vibe.
- Thank you.

224
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:53,099
&nbsp

225
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,533
Caitlyn.

226
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:54,534
&nbsp

227
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:57,034
Oh! I forgot the coffee!

228
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:57,035
&nbsp

229
00:03:57,045 --> 00:04:00,938
"You have sped into my
heart, Jesse Quick."

230
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:00,939
&nbsp

231
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,940
Oh, well, I guess that makes two of us.

232
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:02,941
&nbsp

233
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,243
Wow, H.R. is nothing like my dad.

234
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:05,244
&nbsp

235
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:09,046
He's so sweet and thoughtful
and understanding.

236
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:10,550
&nbsp

237
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,016
We should tell him.

238
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:12,017
&nbsp

239
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:14,117
Tell your dad about you moving here?

240
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:14,118
&nbsp

241
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,886
- Yeah.
- Um, now?

242
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:15,887
&nbsp

243
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:17,855
Yeah, I mean, H.R. said there'd
never be a perfect time.

244
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:17,856
&nbsp

245
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:20,123
Just got to rip the Band-Aid off.

246
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:20,124
&nbsp

247
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,026
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.

248
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:23,027
&nbsp

249
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,762
H.R. does make a good point.

250
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:24,763
&nbsp

251
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,329
Yeah, what's that?

252
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:26,330
&nbsp

253
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,932
It was a really big win for
the team, beating Grodd.

254
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:28,933
&nbsp

255
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,934
I mean, we stopped a gorilla
attack from happening.

256
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:31,935
&nbsp

257
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,736
Yeah, look at you, changing the future.

258
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:33,737
&nbsp

259
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,371
We're all changing the future,

260
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:35,372
&nbsp

261
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,172
one headline at a time.

262
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:37,173
&nbsp

263
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:38,941
Look, I don't know what
the future's gonna bring,

264
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:38,942
&nbsp

265
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:41,511
but I hope every day is with you.

266
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:41,512
&nbsp

267
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,400
Which is why I wanted to ask you...

268
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,482
&nbsp

269
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,781
Barry Allen,

270
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,584
&nbsp

271
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,149
will you be my friend?

272
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,150
&nbsp

273
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,144
Always.

274
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:55,357
&nbsp

275
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,427
- Hey.
- Hey.

276
00:04:58,437 --> 00:04:58,428
&nbsp

277
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,995
H.R. made this for you.

278
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,534
&nbsp

279
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:05,894
H.R. is an idiot.

280
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:07,069
&nbsp

281
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,270
So there's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

282
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,271
&nbsp

283
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:13,140
- Okay.
- So I-I'm just gonna say it.

284
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,141
&nbsp

285
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,775
I think that's wise.

286
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:14,776
&nbsp

287
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,244
I'm gonna move to Earth-1.

288
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:19,748
&nbsp

289
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,514
What?

290
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:21,515
&nbsp

291
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,150
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Why would you do that?

292
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,151
&nbsp

293
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,718
Grodd is no longer a threat.

294
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:25,719
&nbsp

295
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,491
No, it's... it's not that. Uh...

296
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:28,492
&nbsp

297
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,723
I want to be with Wally.

298
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:35,295
&nbsp

299
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,396
This whole thing has made us realize

300
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:37,397
&nbsp

301
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,665
that we have no idea what's
gonna happen, you know, and...

302
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:39,666
&nbsp

303
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:41,399
And if we're gonna go through something,

304
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:41,400
&nbsp

305
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,869
we want to go through it together.

306
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:43,870
&nbsp

307
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,125
Yeah.

308
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,106
&nbsp

309
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,534
This guy?

310
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:48,521
&nbsp

311
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,857
You like him?

312
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:50,851
&nbsp

313
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,309
Yeah.

314
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:52,310
&nbsp

315
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,569
He makes you happy?

316
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,313
&nbsp

317
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:55,413
Dad...

318
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,148
&nbsp

319
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,401
Okay.

320
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:00,151
&nbsp

321
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:01,278
That's it?

322
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:01,953
&nbsp

323
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,738
You're not gonna yell?

324
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:04,255
&nbsp

325
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:05,988
You're not gonna throw that over there?

326
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:06,485
&nbsp

327
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,524
Your happiness is what matters to me.

328
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,524
&nbsp

329
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,103
You're both adults.

330
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:11,104
&nbsp

331
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:12,980
I respect your decision.

332
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,664
&nbsp

333
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,998
Don't screw it up.

334
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,861
&nbsp

335
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,400
Okay, that was weird.

336
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:18,401
&nbsp

337
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,303
I guess that this means that
we gotta find you a place.

338
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:22,304
&nbsp

339
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:24,573
Me? More like us.

340
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,410
&nbsp

341
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,943
You know, sometimes it
seems like everybody else

342
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:28,944
&nbsp

343
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,644
gets to have their love doughnut.

344
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:30,645
&nbsp

345
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,079
Where's my love doughnut?

346
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:32,080
&nbsp

347
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,148
- Oh, love is complicated.
- Mm.

348
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:35,149
&nbsp

349
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,791
So, uh, where's Julian?

350
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:37,792
&nbsp

351
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:40,220
He's taking care of some
family matters in London.

352
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,221
&nbsp

353
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,756
Just so you know,

354
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:41,757
&nbsp

355
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,023
we are just friends.

356
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:43,024
&nbsp

357
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,992
Yeah, the friend zone. I know it well.

358
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:44,993
&nbsp

359
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:46,860
Pretty sure I have a
permanent residence here.

360
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,861
&nbsp

361
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,462
You know, maybe I should
just swallow the pill.

362
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:49,463
&nbsp

363
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:52,532
Maybe my game just ain't strong.

364
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:52,533
&nbsp

365
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:54,401
Your game is so strong!

366
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:55,937
&nbsp

367
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,236
For what it's worth,

368
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:57,237
&nbsp

369
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:58,971
I think Lisa Snart was totally into you.

370
00:06:58,981 --> 00:06:58,972
&nbsp

371
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,473
Lisa Snart.

372
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:00,474
&nbsp

373
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:02,709
Not that I would actually
let you date her.

374
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:02,710
&nbsp

375
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,243
Cisco, I promise, there is a beautiful,

376
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:05,244
&nbsp

377
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,513
intelligent woman out there
who's gonna challenge you

378
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:07,514
&nbsp

379
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,548
to be your best version of yourself.

380
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:09,549
&nbsp

381
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,683
In fact, she could be
right around the corner.

382
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,085
&nbsp

383
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:14,252
Gypsy!

384
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:32,004
&nbsp

385
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:33,404
Oof!

386
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:43,481
&nbsp

387
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,348
Who the hell is this?

388
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:52,624
&nbsp

389
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,290
Where am I?

390
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,291
&nbsp

391
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,592
Ohh...

392
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:56,593
&nbsp

393
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,627
Why am I locked up?

394
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:02,065
&nbsp

395
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:03,866
Oops.

396
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:03,867
&nbsp

397
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:06,034
My powers don't work in here.

398
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:06,035
&nbsp

399
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:07,837
Yeah, it's kind of the
point of the cell.

400
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:07,838
&nbsp

401
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:09,204
What happened?

402
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:09,205
&nbsp

403
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,006
I thought we were all on the same page.

404
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:11,007
&nbsp

405
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:13,240
I spared your life, and you
said you'd go back to Earth-19

406
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,241
&nbsp

407
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,909
and tell everyone you killed H.R.

408
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:14,910
&nbsp

409
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,945
That's exactly what I did.

410
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:16,946
&nbsp

411
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,513
I told the council you were dead.

412
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:18,514
&nbsp

413
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,047
I don't believe you.

414
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:20,048
&nbsp

415
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:22,383
I didn't come here to take you back!

416
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:22,384
&nbsp

417
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:23,985
I'm telling you!

418
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:23,986
&nbsp

419
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:25,753
Then why are you here?

420
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:25,754
&nbsp

421
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,064
I don't know.

422
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:27,591
&nbsp

423
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:31,057
The last thing I remember,
I was on Earth-2...

424
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:31,058
&nbsp

425
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,626
hunting down another breacher.

426
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:32,627
&nbsp

427
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,528
Wait, you were just on Earth-2?

428
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:34,529
&nbsp

429
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,896
Where?

430
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:35,897
&nbsp

431
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,364
In the African jungle,

432
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:37,365
&nbsp

433
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,732
where I saw...

434
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:38,733
&nbsp

435
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,333
Let me guess, a gorilla?

436
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:40,334
&nbsp

437
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:42,435
Super tall? Anger management issues?

438
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:42,436
&nbsp

439
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,004
Grodd must have taken control of her

440
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:44,005
&nbsp

441
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:45,605
and sent her here to kill us.

442
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:45,606
&nbsp

443
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,740
Yeah, but she's on a
different Earth than him,

444
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,741
&nbsp

445
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,275
and Grodd's telepathy can't
cross dimensions like that.

446
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:50,276
&nbsp

447
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:51,811
Grodd said he always thinks ahead.

448
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:51,812
&nbsp

449
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,212
Just like the Reverse-Flash.

450
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:53,213
&nbsp

451
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,380
He didn't have you to open a breach,

452
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,381
&nbsp

453
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:55,548
so he used Gypsy instead.

454
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:55,549
&nbsp

455
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,550
So that means...

456
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:57,551
&nbsp

457
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,385
Grodd's here.

458
00:08:59,395 --> 00:08:59,386
&nbsp

459
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,487
Something tells me he's not alone.

460
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:38,153
&nbsp

461
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:39,665
Any sign of him yet?

462
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:39,666
&nbsp

463
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:41,542
Not since you asked 30 seconds ago.

464
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:41,543
&nbsp

465
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,144
Okay, he's a giant gorilla,

466
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:43,145
&nbsp

467
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,307
who's probably leading an
army of giant gorillas.

468
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:45,308
&nbsp

469
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,581
- How can you not find him?
- He's probably figured out a way

470
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:47,582
&nbsp

471
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,149
- to scramble our satellites.
- Satellites.

472
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,150
&nbsp

473
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,717
We're talking about a
genius super-ape here.

474
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:50,718
&nbsp

475
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,086
And a master strategist

476
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:52,087
&nbsp

477
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,720
who successfully fooled us on my Earth.

478
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:53,721
&nbsp

479
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,457
We Wellses, we don't fool
easy, do we, hard hat?

480
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:56,458
&nbsp

481
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,158
Don't call me "hard hat".

482
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:58,159
&nbsp

483
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,427
We have to find him before
he hurts somebody else.

484
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:00,428
&nbsp

485
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:01,828
Don't worry, Barry, we will.

486
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:01,829
&nbsp

487
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,196
Every time I think we've beat him,

488
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:03,197
&nbsp

489
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:04,663
he comes back stronger, smarter,

490
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:04,664
&nbsp

491
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,499
and more dangerous.

492
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:06,500
&nbsp

493
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,225
He's evolving.

494
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:08,970
&nbsp

495
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,936
I keep trying to fight him the same way.

496
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:10,937
&nbsp

497
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,505
Okay, guys, look, we
just have to come up

498
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:12,506
&nbsp

499
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:15,425
with a different way to beat him.

500
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:15,426
&nbsp

501
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,611
What we need to do is get
ahead of him for once.

502
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:17,612
&nbsp

503
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:19,313
We can. You've seen the future.

504
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:19,314
&nbsp

505
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:20,913
You know there's an attack.

506
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:20,914
&nbsp

507
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,515
If we just figure out where
that attack happens,

508
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:22,516
&nbsp

509
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,617
we can launch a preemptive
strike against Grodd.

510
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:24,618
&nbsp

511
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:26,852
We can stop the attack
before it ever starts.

512
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:26,853
&nbsp

513
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,055
And fortunately, we have someone

514
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:29,056
&nbsp

515
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,291
who can foresee future events.

516
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:31,292
&nbsp

517
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:32,758
Before they happen.

518
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:32,759
&nbsp

519
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,327
Okay, okay, there's only one problem.

520
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:34,328
&nbsp

521
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:35,761
I can only vibe what Barry saw,

522
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:35,762
&nbsp

523
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,229
and a ticker on the side of a bus stop

524
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:37,230
&nbsp

525
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,030
doesn't give us a whole lot of info.

526
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,031
&nbsp

527
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,699
What if we widen the scope of your vibe?

528
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:40,700
&nbsp

529
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,534
Then you can see more of the future.

530
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:42,535
&nbsp

531
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,303
Yes. I can do that.

532
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:44,304
&nbsp

533
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:46,104
Just need to borrow your vibe gear.

534
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:46,105
&nbsp

535
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,939
- Harry, that's my only pair.
- I'll be careful.

536
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:47,940
&nbsp

537
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,774
- It's my only pair.
- West, come with me.

538
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:49,775
&nbsp

539
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,244
- You have an engineer's mind.
- Yeah, sure.

540
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:52,245
&nbsp

541
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,045
Happy to help.

542
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:54,046
&nbsp

543
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:55,646
We're gonna need all
the help we can get.

544
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:55,647
&nbsp

545
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,781
Can you talk to Joe, see
if he can rally CCPD?

546
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:57,782
&nbsp

547
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,450
Yeah, yeah, I'll let him know that

548
00:10:59,460 --> 00:10:59,451
&nbsp

549
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,619
an army of sentient gorillas
is about to storm the city.

550
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:01,620
&nbsp

551
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,621
- He's gonna love that.
- Yup.

552
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:03,622
&nbsp

553
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,490
What about Gypsy? She's
a really powerful meta.

554
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,491
&nbsp

555
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,759
Yeah, but how do we know she's
not a Grodd sleeper agent?

556
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:08,760
&nbsp

557
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,960
She's not. I checked her out.

558
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:09,961
&nbsp

559
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:11,128
Can you convince her to help?

560
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:11,129
&nbsp

561
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,563
Bro, she won't say no to me.

562
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:13,564
&nbsp

563
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,098
No way.

564
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:15,099
&nbsp

565
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,734
You've got three
speedsters, an ice queen,

566
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:17,735
&nbsp

567
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,370
and a guy who vibes
almost as well as I do.

568
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,371
&nbsp

569
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,938
You don't need my help to stop Grodd.

570
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:21,939
&nbsp

571
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,406
Need I remind you, you're the one

572
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:23,407
&nbsp

573
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,907
who brought Grodd here
in the first place.

574
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:24,908
&nbsp

575
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,309
Not by choice!

576
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:26,310
&nbsp

577
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,777
I was chasing a fugitive
from my world on Earth-2

578
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:28,778
&nbsp

579
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,446
when Grodd ambushed me

580
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:30,447
&nbsp

581
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,180
and turned me into his damn puppet.

582
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,181
&nbsp

583
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,416
Okay, so then this is
the perfect opportunity

584
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:34,417
&nbsp

585
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,018
for payback, right?

586
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:37,019
&nbsp

587
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,270
Don't tell me you're gonna
run away from this.

588
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,258
&nbsp

589
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:42,157
I never run.

590
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:42,158
&nbsp

591
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,759
Then stand and fight with us.

592
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,762
&nbsp

593
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,193
We need you.

594
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:47,763
&nbsp

595
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,564
You need me?

596
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:49,565
&nbsp

597
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,133
Are you trying to Luke Starkiller me?

598
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:55,904
&nbsp

599
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:58,105
What if I am?

600
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:58,106
&nbsp

601
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:00,341
Is that what it's gonna
take to get you to stay?

602
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,611
&nbsp

603
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,076
Here's a bonus, you get to spend

604
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:03,077
&nbsp

605
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,944
extra time with this face.

606
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:04,945
&nbsp

607
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:07,080
And look at this face. Come on.

608
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,081
&nbsp

609
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:09,383
Who doesn't want to get to spend
extra time with this guy?

610
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:13,821
&nbsp

611
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,989
What?

612
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:15,990
&nbsp

613
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,124
The things I saw,

614
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:18,125
&nbsp

615
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:19,759
when Grodd was in control of my mind,

616
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:19,760
&nbsp

617
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,527
the horrors in that monster's head,

618
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:21,528
&nbsp

619
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,028
I can never un-see them.

620
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:23,029
&nbsp

621
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,863
What horrors?

622
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:24,864
&nbsp

623
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:27,300
The city in ruins.

624
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:27,301
&nbsp

625
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,303
People in pain. Death everywhere.

626
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:30,304
&nbsp

627
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,271
That's what Grodd wants,

628
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:32,272
&nbsp

629
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,006
what he's planning.

630
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:34,007
&nbsp

631
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,008
I'm sorry, Cisco.

632
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:36,009
&nbsp

633
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,975
This is your fight.

634
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:37,976
&nbsp

635
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,444
Not mine.

636
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:43,215
&nbsp

637
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:44,616
Now, if you don't mind,

638
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:44,617
&nbsp

639
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:47,819
I still have a fugitive to catch, so...

640
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,889
&nbsp

641
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,691
Okay.

642
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:52,692
&nbsp

643
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:54,425
I understand.

644
00:12:54,435 --> 00:13:08,006
&nbsp

645
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,973
Take care of yourself, Cisco.

646
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,309
&nbsp

647
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,643
Admit it.

648
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:13,644
&nbsp

649
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,244
You are so into me.

650
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:23,755
&nbsp

651
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:26,155
West.

652
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:26,156
&nbsp

653
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,956
How are we coming along with that gear?

654
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:27,957
&nbsp

655
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,758
I've made all the
adjustments you asked for,

656
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:29,759
&nbsp

657
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,593
so we should be good to go.

658
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:31,594
&nbsp

659
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:32,927
Good. Thank you.

660
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:32,928
&nbsp

661
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,396
Yeah.

662
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:34,397
&nbsp

663
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:36,030
Great.

664
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,031
&nbsp

665
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,666
Um, how exactly is this gonna

666
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:37,667
&nbsp

667
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:39,934
help Cisco vibe any differently?

668
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:39,935
&nbsp

669
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,470
Ah, simple science.

670
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,471
&nbsp

671
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,938
We just broaden the overall
harmonic resonance

672
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:43,939
&nbsp

673
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,939
of Cisco's vibrational frequencies

674
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:45,940
&nbsp

675
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,509
all while focusing them on
a fixed temporal locus.

676
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:48,510
&nbsp

677
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,777
Couldn't be easier.

678
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:49,778
&nbsp

679
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,379
Yeah.

680
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:52,582
&nbsp

681
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:53,881
You know, I got to admit, Harry,

682
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:53,882
&nbsp

683
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:55,516
I was super surprised
at how cool you were

684
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:55,517
&nbsp

685
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:56,950
with Jesse staying on this Earth.

686
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:56,951
&nbsp

687
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,152
I thought, for sure, you
were gonna freak out

688
00:13:59,162 --> 00:13:59,153
&nbsp

689
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,755
and throw something

690
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:00,756
&nbsp

691
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,756
or throw someone.

692
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:02,757
&nbsp

693
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,123
Well, my daughter's happiness

694
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:04,124
&nbsp

695
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,394
is of the utmost importance to me.

696
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:07,395
&nbsp

697
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,195
And you make her happy.

698
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:09,196
&nbsp

699
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,564
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to keep it that way.

700
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:11,565
&nbsp

701
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,232
I appreciate that, West.

702
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:13,233
&nbsp

703
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:16,703
I'm sure Jesse will too, after I'm...

704
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:16,704
&nbsp

705
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,237
gone.

706
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:18,238
&nbsp

707
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:20,472
We're gonna come visit
you on Earth-2 a bunch,

708
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:20,473
&nbsp

709
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,641
so you don't have to
worry about that, Harry.

710
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:22,642
&nbsp

711
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,543
Yeah, right.

712
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:24,544
&nbsp

713
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:27,546
Uh, well, means the world to me,

714
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:27,547
&nbsp

715
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:30,816
seeing as I don't know how
much time I have left.

716
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:30,817
&nbsp

717
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,885
Wait, y-you're sick?

718
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:32,886
&nbsp

719
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:35,986
I'm not as well as I once was.

720
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:37,390
&nbsp

721
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,989
Have you seen a doctor?

722
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:38,990
&nbsp

723
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,426
Yes.

724
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:41,427
&nbsp

725
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:43,461
I have seen a doctor, West.

726
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:43,462
&nbsp

727
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:44,962
Is it serious?

728
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:48,267
&nbsp

729
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:51,101
Oh, man, Harry.

730
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:51,102
&nbsp

731
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:53,870
Man. Um...

732
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:53,871
&nbsp

733
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:57,040
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

734
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,041
&nbsp

735
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,742
Does Jesse know?

736
00:14:58,752 --> 00:14:58,743
&nbsp

737
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,311
Appreciate you keep this between... us.

738
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:01,312
&nbsp

739
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:03,480
She doesn't know, and we
wouldn't want to upset her.

740
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,219
&nbsp

741
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:11,487
Hey, SWAT's ready to
roll whenever y'all are.

742
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:11,488
&nbsp

743
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:12,988
We find Grodd yet?

744
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:12,989
&nbsp

745
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,256
We're about to.

746
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:14,257
&nbsp

747
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,925
Cisco, you ready?

748
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:15,926
&nbsp

749
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:17,993
Harry, this thing, if
it fries my brain...

750
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:17,994
&nbsp

751
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,628
"It's an improvement."

752
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:19,629
&nbsp

753
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,764
- Was that "Rocky"?
- Yeah, Burgess Meredith.

754
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:21,765
&nbsp

755
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,266
Yeah, I'm ready.

756
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:24,267
&nbsp

757
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:26,401
Word of warning. Vibing blind,

758
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:26,402
&nbsp

759
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:27,936
it's like surfing a monster wave.

760
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:27,937
&nbsp

761
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,537
You need to stay above
the temporal flow,

762
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:29,538
&nbsp

763
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:32,073
otherwise your consciousness
can get sucked under.

764
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,710
&nbsp

765
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,742
And then what happens?

766
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:34,743
&nbsp

767
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:36,177
I don't know.

768
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:36,178
&nbsp

769
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:37,979
Guess we'll find out.

770
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:37,980
&nbsp

771
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,481
Wait, what?

772
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:45,553
&nbsp

773
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,588
Where are you, Ramon? What do you see?

774
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:51,626
&nbsp

775
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:53,226
I'm at an intersection.

776
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:53,227
&nbsp

777
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,195
State and Oakhill.

778
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:55,196
&nbsp

779
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,230
I think this is where it goes down.

780
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,400
&nbsp

781
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,033
That's a block away from the bridge.

782
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,034
&nbsp

783
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,602
That leads right to the heart of town.

784
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:02,603
&nbsp

785
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,804
If those gorillas get
over that bridge...

786
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:04,805
&nbsp

787
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:06,539
They'll overrun the city in no time.

788
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:06,540
&nbsp

789
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,840
Not if we stop them first.

790
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,611
&nbsp

791
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:12,712
Eyes wide, everybody.

792
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:12,713
&nbsp

793
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,581
Grodd's army could be here
any second, all right?

794
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:15,582
&nbsp

795
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:16,883
There's no sign of them.

796
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:16,884
&nbsp

797
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,349
You sure this is the right place?

798
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:18,350
&nbsp

799
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,051
According to Cisco, this is it.

800
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:20,052
&nbsp

801
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,353
Was it the right time?

802
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:22,354
&nbsp

803
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:23,522
We're too early.

804
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:24,757
&nbsp

805
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,225
No, Flash.

806
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:27,226
&nbsp

807
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,793
Too late.

808
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:33,266
&nbsp

809
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,999
- Grodd.
- I remember,

810
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:35,000
&nbsp

811
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,100
this human is important to you.

812
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,101
&nbsp

813
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,670
Now...

814
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,671
&nbsp

815
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,138
he's all mine.

816
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:41,139
&nbsp

817
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:42,540
No! Hey!

818
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,541
&nbsp

819
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:44,241
Do not hurt him. I'm the one you want!

820
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:44,242
&nbsp

821
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,944
- Right?
- I warned you, Flash.

822
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:46,945
&nbsp

823
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,513
And now I'm here on First Earth

824
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:49,514
&nbsp

825
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:52,281
to make good on my promise.

826
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:52,282
&nbsp

827
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,751
And when I'm finished, this city

828
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:54,752
&nbsp

829
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:56,920
and all the puny humans

830
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:56,921
&nbsp

831
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,788
will die.

832
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:04,061
&nbsp

833
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,394
No!

834
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:08,965
&nbsp

835
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:10,432
Joe!

836
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:12,102
&nbsp

837
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:13,468
Are you okay?

838
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:13,469
&nbsp

839
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,836
I think so.

840
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:14,837
&nbsp

841
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,438
I don't get it.

842
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:16,439
&nbsp

843
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,473
How is attacking Detective Joe West

844
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:18,474
&nbsp

845
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,042
a part of Grodd's plan?

846
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:20,043
&nbsp

847
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:22,711
- It wasn't.
- Then what was it?

848
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:22,712
&nbsp

849
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,046
A distraction.

850
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:30,218
&nbsp

851
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:32,887
I don't care if Senator
Ford is having doubts.

852
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:32,888
&nbsp

853
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,622
If the secretary doesn't
approve that budget

854
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:34,623
&nbsp

855
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,290
first thing in the morning, we're gonna

856
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,291
&nbsp

857
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,625
have to make some serious cuts...

858
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:42,964
&nbsp

859
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,831
The hell was that?

860
00:17:44,841 --> 00:18:02,838
&nbsp

861
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,771
That damn gorilla almost
got me this time.

862
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:04,772
&nbsp

863
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:06,439
Shouldn't even have a scar.

864
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:06,440
&nbsp

865
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,707
Do you remember anything

866
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:07,708
&nbsp

867
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,031
from when Grodd was controlling you?

868
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,032
&nbsp

869
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,733
Not really. Just some flashes.

870
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:11,734
&nbsp

871
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:12,967
Flashes of what?

872
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:12,968
&nbsp

873
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,154
They were, like, these images...

874
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:15,155
&nbsp

875
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:16,954
places I've never seen before.

876
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:16,955
&nbsp

877
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:20,021
It was like I was seeing
what he was seeing.

878
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,022
&nbsp

879
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,917
Gypsy said the same thing.

880
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:22,759
&nbsp

881
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,727
Uh-oh, here we go. I know that look.

882
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:25,728
&nbsp

883
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,529
That's the "I have a genius idea" look.

884
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:27,530
&nbsp

885
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,030
A couple years back on my Earth,

886
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,031
&nbsp

887
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,432
there was a neuroscientist

888
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:30,433
&nbsp

889
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,102
that was able to achieve memory recovery

890
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,103
&nbsp

891
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,903
using transcranial magnetic
simulators on brain-damaged...

892
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:35,904
&nbsp

893
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,039
We use that here but more
as a depression treatment.

894
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:39,040
&nbsp

895
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,941
Well, in this experiment,
the neuroscientist

896
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:40,942
&nbsp

897
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,611
focused all the energy
on the occipital cortex

898
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:43,612
&nbsp

899
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,313
of the patients,
allowing them to achieve

900
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:45,314
&nbsp

901
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,948
almost full memory recollection.

902
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:47,949
&nbsp

903
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,850
So you think the
connection Grodd creates

904
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:49,851
&nbsp

905
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,985
in the brains of those he mind-controls

906
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:51,986
&nbsp

907
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,387
goes both ways?

908
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:54,388
&nbsp

909
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:55,855
Could be.

910
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:55,856
&nbsp

911
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,657
Maybe we could use Grodd's memories

912
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:57,658
&nbsp

913
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:59,926
that he left behind in Joe to
figure out what his plan is.

914
00:18:59,936 --> 00:18:59,927
&nbsp

915
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:01,461
We'd just make some TCM simulators.

916
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:01,462
&nbsp

917
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,263
- All it takes is some...
- Magnets.

918
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:03,264
&nbsp

919
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,465
Throw together some magnets,
make a helmet out of 'em.

920
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:05,466
&nbsp

921
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:07,300
Hold on. Y'all want to
put a bunch of magnets

922
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,301
&nbsp

923
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:09,135
against my skull to look into the mind

924
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:09,136
&nbsp

925
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:12,571
of a psychotic, murderous ape?

926
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:12,572
&nbsp

927
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,340
Yeah.

928
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:14,341
&nbsp

929
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,275
Fine.

930
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:16,276
&nbsp

931
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:17,610
Let's make it happen,

932
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:17,611
&nbsp

933
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,545
before Grodd tries to
kill somebody else.

934
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:26,452
&nbsp

935
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,553
It's gonna be okay.

936
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:30,690
&nbsp

937
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,056
Hey.

938
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:32,057
&nbsp

939
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,659
Is everything okay?

940
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:34,660
&nbsp

941
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,529
Just tired of seeing the
people I care about

942
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:37,530
&nbsp

943
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,096
be put in harm's way.

944
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:39,097
&nbsp

945
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,698
Yeah, but like always,

946
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:40,699
&nbsp

947
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,833
we're gonna work together
and come up with a plan.

948
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:43,834
&nbsp

949
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,702
We're gonna stop Grodd, Barry.

950
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:49,740
&nbsp

951
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,409
And then what?

952
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:52,410
&nbsp

953
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,380
We just send him back?

954
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,381
&nbsp

955
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:59,182
He's just gonna come her again.

956
00:19:59,192 --> 00:19:59,183
&nbsp

957
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,450
We have to end this once and for all.

958
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,687
&nbsp

959
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,687
Wait. What?

960
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:04,688
&nbsp

961
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,589
You want to kill Grodd?

962
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,959
&nbsp

963
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:11,561
Why not?

964
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:11,562
&nbsp

965
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:13,596
That's how their society
in Gorilla City works...

966
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:13,597
&nbsp

967
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:14,963
Kill or be killed.

968
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:14,964
&nbsp

969
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:16,598
That's why he wanted me to kill Solovar.

970
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:16,599
&nbsp

971
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,067
And you know what? I should have.

972
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:19,068
&nbsp

973
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:20,569
I showed too much mercy.

974
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:20,570
&nbsp

975
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,470
No, you did what was right, Barry,

976
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,471
&nbsp

977
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:23,738
as you always do.

978
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:23,739
&nbsp

979
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:25,740
That's what makes you a hero.

980
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,741
&nbsp

981
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:27,275
Oliver has killed.

982
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:27,276
&nbsp

983
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:28,876
He's still considered a hero.

984
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:28,877
&nbsp

985
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,779
Yeah, and he lives with the
weight of that decision

986
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:31,780
&nbsp

987
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,947
every single day.

988
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:33,948
&nbsp

989
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,817
I think that sometimes,
the only way to stop

990
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:36,818
&nbsp

991
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:38,219
bad things from happening

992
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:38,220
&nbsp

993
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,521
is to just get rid of
what's causing them.

994
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:40,522
&nbsp

995
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,756
What is this really about?

996
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:42,757
&nbsp

997
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:45,559
Grodd or what happens to me?

998
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:45,560
&nbsp

999
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,295
I kill Grodd, his attack never happens,

1000
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:48,296
&nbsp

1001
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:51,931
that changes the future, and...

1002
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:51,932
&nbsp

1003
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,400
you live, yeah.

1004
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,172
&nbsp

1005
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:01,741
Your humanity, showing mercy,

1006
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:01,742
&nbsp

1007
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:05,345
that is what separates
you from everyone else.

1008
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:05,346
&nbsp

1009
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,879
That's the reason that
everyone looks up to you.

1010
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,450
&nbsp

1011
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,683
Don't compromise who you are...

1012
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:11,684
&nbsp

1013
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,051
ever.

1014
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:13,052
&nbsp

1015
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:15,387
Losing what makes The Flash The Flash...

1016
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:15,388
&nbsp

1017
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:18,890
My life isn't worth it if
that's the cost to save me.

1018
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,797
&nbsp

1019
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:26,196
There you are.

1020
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:29,602
&nbsp

1021
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:32,002
Hey, you know your dad's
gonna be all right.

1022
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:34,440
&nbsp

1023
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,073
What's wrong?

1024
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,677
&nbsp

1025
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:40,177
Look, I've been thinking, and I...

1026
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:40,178
&nbsp

1027
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:41,611
I don't think you should stay here.

1028
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:41,612
&nbsp

1029
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,381
I think... It was a bad idea.

1030
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:44,382
&nbsp

1031
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:45,749
Um...

1032
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:45,750
&nbsp

1033
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,684
Wally, you asked me.

1034
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:47,685
&nbsp

1035
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:51,053
Yeah, and I shouldn't have.

1036
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:51,054
&nbsp

1037
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,723
I think you should go back to Earth-2...

1038
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:53,724
&nbsp

1039
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,760
spend as much time with
your dad as you can.

1040
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:56,761
&nbsp

1041
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:00,262
Spend as much time with my dad as I can?

1042
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:01,932
&nbsp

1043
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:03,965
Wally, what are you talking about?

1044
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:03,966
&nbsp

1045
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:06,769
Your dad is sick, Jesse.
He's really sick.

1046
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:06,770
&nbsp

1047
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,470
He doesn't have much time left.

1048
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,471
&nbsp

1049
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:10,439
Did he tell you that?

1050
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:10,440
&nbsp

1051
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,342
I'm so sorry.

1052
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:13,343
&nbsp

1053
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:14,876
He is...

1054
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:14,877
&nbsp

1055
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:16,511
unbelievable.

1056
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:21,384
&nbsp

1057
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:22,817
So all you have to do is concentrate

1058
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:22,818
&nbsp

1059
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:24,419
on your memories of Grodd, okay?

1060
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:24,420
&nbsp

1061
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,454
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

1062
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:28,024
&nbsp

1063
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:30,425
All right.

1064
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:30,426
&nbsp

1065
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,693
Hey, dead man.

1066
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:31,694
&nbsp

1067
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,360
- Seriously?
- Hm?

1068
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:33,361
&nbsp

1069
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,761
You told Wally you were dying?

1070
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:34,762
&nbsp

1071
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,197
- Dying?
- You're dying?

1072
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:37,198
&nbsp

1073
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,832
I didn't say I was, uh...

1074
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:38,833
&nbsp

1075
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:41,468
I-I said I didn't know how
much time I had left.

1076
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:41,469
&nbsp

1077
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:44,504
- None of us...
- Okay, what is wrong with you?

1078
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:44,505
&nbsp

1079
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:46,573
- Um...
- Is there seriously nothing

1080
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:46,574
&nbsp

1081
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,508
you won't say to get me
to stay by your side?

1082
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:48,509
&nbsp

1083
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,075
- I don't...
- Look, whatever.

1084
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:50,076
&nbsp

1085
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,911
I'm moving here, whether
you like it or not.

1086
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,616
&nbsp

1087
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:56,882
So all you have to do is concentrate

1088
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:56,883
&nbsp

1089
00:22:56,893 --> 00:22:58,317
- on your memories of Grodd.
- Yeah.

1090
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:58,318
&nbsp

1091
00:22:58,328 --> 00:22:59,918
- You ready?
- Waiting on you, dead man.

1092
00:22:59,928 --> 00:22:59,919
&nbsp

1093
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,387
Mm-hmm.

1094
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:01,388
&nbsp

1095
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:04,457
Hey, if I start to Grodd
out at any point,

1096
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:04,458
&nbsp

1097
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,124
cut the power off immediately.

1098
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:06,125
&nbsp

1099
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,959
Of course.

1100
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:07,960
&nbsp

1101
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,427
All right, Joe, you ready?

1102
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:09,428
&nbsp

1103
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,730
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

1104
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:11,731
&nbsp

1105
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,898
So here...

1106
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:13,899
&nbsp

1107
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,734
we...

1108
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:15,735
&nbsp

1109
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,068
go.

1110
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:22,809
&nbsp

1111
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,074
Joe?

1112
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:32,517
&nbsp

1113
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,551
I didn't know he could draw.

1114
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:34,552
&nbsp

1115
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,020
Well, that's the thing.
Anybody can actually draw.

1116
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,021
&nbsp

1117
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:39,055
It's just that some have
more developed visual cortex

1118
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:39,056
&nbsp

1119
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:42,124
and manual ability, as you know.

1120
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:42,125
&nbsp

1121
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:44,694
And right now, these magnets are
taking that part of his brain

1122
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:44,695
&nbsp

1123
00:23:44,705 --> 00:23:46,095
and lightin' it up.

1124
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:59,109
&nbsp

1125
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,542
Well, it worked.

1126
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:00,543
&nbsp

1127
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:02,977
Now we have a new problem.

1128
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:02,978
&nbsp

1129
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,414
We have to figure out
who the hell this is.

1130
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:10,052
&nbsp

1131
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:11,520
Good evening, General.

1132
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:11,521
&nbsp

1133
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:13,154
Color and number of the day.

1134
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:13,155
&nbsp

1135
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:15,756
Purple 246.

1136
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:15,757
&nbsp

1137
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,190
Are you all right, sir?

1138
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,129
&nbsp

1139
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:22,029
Sick.

1140
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:40,315
&nbsp

1141
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,915
_

1142
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:41,916
&nbsp

1143
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:43,950
Good.

1144
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:43,951
&nbsp

1145
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,585
General.

1146
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:50,575
&nbsp

1147
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:53,075
_

1148
00:24:53,085 --> 00:25:03,385
&nbsp

1149
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:04,693
Great.

1150
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:04,694
&nbsp

1151
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:05,827
Yo, Rocky.

1152
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:10,266
&nbsp

1153
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,642
How you doin'?

1154
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:11,643
&nbsp

1155
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,644
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

1156
00:25:14,654 --> 00:25:14,645
&nbsp

1157
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,246
No matter what I do to stop Grodd,

1158
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:16,247
&nbsp

1159
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,082
he just keeps finding
new ways to attack,

1160
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:18,083
&nbsp

1161
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,716
new ways to destroy, and I...

1162
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:20,717
&nbsp

1163
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,251
Iris doesn't think I should,

1164
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:22,252
&nbsp

1165
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,787
but the only way this
ends is if I kill him.

1166
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:24,788
&nbsp

1167
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:26,150
Kill him.

1168
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,151
&nbsp

1169
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,113
That might be the most idiotic thing

1170
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:28,114
&nbsp

1171
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:29,448
I've ever heard you say.

1172
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:29,449
&nbsp

1173
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,517
- Wait, what?
- Iris is right.

1174
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:31,518
&nbsp

1175
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:32,785
If you don't want to listen, go ahead,

1176
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:32,786
&nbsp

1177
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:33,919
keep being an idiot.

1178
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:33,920
&nbsp

1179
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,987
I don't understand.

1180
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:34,988
&nbsp

1181
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:37,755
Don't. Kill. Grodd.

1182
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:37,756
&nbsp

1183
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:39,924
Harry, you of all people
should understand.

1184
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:39,925
&nbsp

1185
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:41,826
I mean, you would have
killed to save Jesse.

1186
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:41,827
&nbsp

1187
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:43,127
You were gonna kill Zoom.

1188
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:43,128
&nbsp

1189
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:44,629
Barry, there's a thousand things

1190
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:44,630
&nbsp

1191
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,233
I've done that I'm not proud of.

1192
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:48,234
&nbsp

1193
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:51,403
Some of them recently.

1194
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:51,404
&nbsp

1195
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:54,971
Every time I do one of those things,

1196
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:54,972
&nbsp

1197
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:57,575
it makes it easier to
do it the next time.

1198
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:58,911
&nbsp

1199
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:01,812
I look at you, out there
battling the darkness,

1200
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:01,813
&nbsp

1201
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:03,447
with honor and hope, and I'm reminded

1202
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:03,448
&nbsp

1203
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,148
there's always another way,

1204
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:05,149
&nbsp

1205
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,383
always.

1206
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:06,384
&nbsp

1207
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:09,152
Killing Grodd is not your answer.

1208
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:09,153
&nbsp

1209
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:12,054
Saving one life doesn't
justify taking another.

1210
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:14,158
&nbsp

1211
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,291
Find the other way.

1212
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:15,292
&nbsp

1213
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:16,759
Guys.

1214
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:16,760
&nbsp

1215
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,628
We need you in the cortex.

1216
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:18,629
&nbsp

1217
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,096
What's up, Cisco?

1218
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:20,097
&nbsp

1219
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,198
We've got a behemoth of a problem.

1220
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,869
&nbsp

1221
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:28,337
Terrific.

1222
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:30,005
&nbsp

1223
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:32,441
So we ran our John Doe image
through every database.

1224
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:32,442
&nbsp

1225
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,476
And it was tough. I mean,
the guy's a ghost.

1226
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:34,477
&nbsp

1227
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,144
We've been calling him Jason Bourne.

1228
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:36,145
&nbsp

1229
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:37,646
But then H.R. noticed something.

1230
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:37,647
&nbsp

1231
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,514
Well, at first, it was
a real brain-twister,

1232
00:26:39,524 --> 00:26:39,515
&nbsp

1233
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:41,550
but then I remembered a quote

1234
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:41,551
&nbsp

1235
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:44,353
from a renowned poet from my
Earth, Alfred Yankovic...

1236
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:44,354
&nbsp

1237
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:45,686
Are you talking about Weird Al?

1238
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:45,687
&nbsp

1239
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,054
Why? 'Cause of the hair?

1240
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:47,055
&nbsp

1241
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,223
Get to the point already,
if you have one.

1242
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:49,224
&nbsp

1243
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:52,059
I can, hard hat. It's his hair.

1244
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:52,060
&nbsp

1245
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,194
Standard military cut.

1246
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:54,195
&nbsp

1247
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:55,529
So we ran the image through

1248
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:55,530
&nbsp

1249
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,097
the Department of Defense database,

1250
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:57,098
&nbsp

1251
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:59,600
and, as Cisco would say, "Yahtzee."

1252
00:26:59,610 --> 00:26:59,601
&nbsp

1253
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,235
I would say that.

1254
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,204
&nbsp

1255
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:05,037
Nice work, H.R.

1256
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:05,038
&nbsp

1257
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:06,406
I know.

1258
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:06,407
&nbsp

1259
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,907
DoD has him listed as

1260
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:07,908
&nbsp

1261
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,510
Air Force General Matthew McNally.

1262
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,511
&nbsp

1263
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:13,546
General Matthew McNally, and
I'll give you one guess...

1264
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:13,547
&nbsp

1265
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,682
Just guess... What he's in charge of.

1266
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:15,683
&nbsp

1267
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,484
I know you're gonna
say military weapons,

1268
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:17,485
&nbsp

1269
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:20,051
but I really hope you don't
say military weapons.

1270
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:20,052
&nbsp

1271
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,219
It's worse, Barr.

1272
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:21,220
&nbsp

1273
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,021
Nuclear missiles.

1274
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:23,022
&nbsp

1275
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,623
McNally has the highest clearance.

1276
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:24,624
&nbsp

1277
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,558
He can have a rocket in the
air in less than ten minutes.

1278
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:26,559
&nbsp

1279
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:28,126
So are the satellites
back to functional?

1280
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:28,127
&nbsp

1281
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:29,695
We ran a full diagnostic.

1282
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:29,696
&nbsp

1283
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:31,630
Any nuclear weapon that's
authorized to fire,

1284
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,631
&nbsp

1285
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:33,332
- an alarm will sound.
- Okay, good.

1286
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:35,968
&nbsp

1287
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:37,435
Does it sound like that?

1288
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:37,436
&nbsp

1289
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:38,603
That's an alarm.

1290
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:38,604
&nbsp

1291
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:40,371
Yeah, it's that alarm, H.R.

1292
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:40,372
&nbsp

1293
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:42,473
Okay.

1294
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:42,474
&nbsp

1295
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:44,375
Short-range ballistic missile

1296
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:44,376
&nbsp

1297
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:46,076
authorized to fire from Fort Reynolds.

1298
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:46,077
&nbsp

1299
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,111
How much time do we have?

1300
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:47,112
&nbsp

1301
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:48,313
Minutes.

1302
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:48,314
&nbsp

1303
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:49,580
Grodd, what have you done?

1304
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,581
&nbsp

1305
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,015
Can we stop it from here?

1306
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:51,016
&nbsp

1307
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,350
Military weapons are basically analog.

1308
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,351
&nbsp

1309
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:54,083
I mean, they still use floppy disks.

1310
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:54,084
&nbsp

1311
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:57,086
I'm going after it.

1312
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:57,087
&nbsp

1313
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,655
Guys, no, look, I appreciate it,

1314
00:27:58,665 --> 00:27:58,656
&nbsp

1315
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,089
but I need you to stay here, okay?

1316
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:00,090
&nbsp

1317
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,891
If I can't stop it,

1318
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:01,892
&nbsp

1319
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:04,027
I need you to get everybody
to safety, okay?

1320
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:08,022
&nbsp

1321
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:10,195
_

1322
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:15,506
&nbsp

1323
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:17,473
All right, I'm with the missile.

1324
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:17,474
&nbsp

1325
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,475
Barry, to access the
keypad, remove the panel

1326
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:19,476
&nbsp

1327
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:21,176
at the base of the missile vehicle.

1328
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:26,817
&nbsp

1329
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,717
All right.

1330
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,487
&nbsp

1331
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:33,087
All right, that's done. What's next?

1332
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:33,088
&nbsp

1333
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:34,589
Well, the good news is, this missile

1334
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:34,590
&nbsp

1335
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,257
has a built-in five-digit kill code.

1336
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:36,258
&nbsp

1337
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:37,792
Great. What is it?

1338
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:37,793
&nbsp

1339
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,961
That's the bad news. We don't know.

1340
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:39,962
&nbsp

1341
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,129
For real? Ah, well, then
what am I supposed to do?

1342
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:42,130
&nbsp

1343
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,931
You have to try every
combination, Barry.

1344
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:43,932
&nbsp

1345
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:45,332
It's okay, with this type of launcher,

1346
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:45,333
&nbsp

1347
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:46,567
you won't set off the nuke.

1348
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:46,568
&nbsp

1349
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:47,934
Barry, simulators are projecting

1350
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:47,935
&nbsp

1351
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,370
that hundreds of thousands will die.

1352
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,073
&nbsp

1353
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,307
Yeah, let's hope not.

1354
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:54,308
&nbsp

1355
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,442
Come on.

1356
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:57,178
&nbsp

1357
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:58,979
Five digits. How many combos is that?

1358
00:28:58,989 --> 00:28:58,980
&nbsp

1359
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,414
- I'm guessing it's about...
- Precisely 90,000,

1360
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:01,415
&nbsp

1361
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,215
which you would know
if you weren't a moron

1362
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:03,216
&nbsp

1363
00:29:03,226 --> 00:29:05,985
and you were an actual genius.

1364
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:05,986
&nbsp

1365
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,254
Two missiles are locked on target.

1366
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:08,255
&nbsp

1367
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:10,890
Guys, we need something
else. This isn't working.

1368
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,395
&nbsp

1369
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,127
Plan B, anyone?

1370
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:19,298
&nbsp

1371
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:20,632
Work!

1372
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:20,633
&nbsp

1373
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,300
How much time does he have?

1374
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,301
&nbsp

1375
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,636
15 seconds.

1376
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:24,637
&nbsp

1377
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,872
Guys, I need something!
This isn't working!

1378
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:26,873
&nbsp

1379
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,239
Something else!

1380
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:28,240
&nbsp

1381
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,608
You just got to keep going, Barry.

1382
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:29,609
&nbsp

1383
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,444
You just... just got to keep trying.

1384
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:32,445
&nbsp

1385
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:35,513
Six missiles are locked on target.

1386
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:44,055
&nbsp

1387
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:45,656
It worked.

1388
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,659
&nbsp

1389
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:48,893
It worked! We did it!

1390
00:29:48,903 --> 00:29:53,063
&nbsp

1391
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:55,264
We did it!

1392
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:58,470
&nbsp

1393
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,503
Oh, thank God.

1394
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:00,504
&nbsp

1395
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:03,005
Flash stopped the weapon.

1396
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:03,006
&nbsp

1397
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:05,608
But he can't stop us all.

1398
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:07,077
&nbsp

1399
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,711
Attack!

1400
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:14,347
&nbsp

1401
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:16,447
Found them.

1402
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:16,890
&nbsp

1403
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,457
They're right outside the city.

1404
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:20,759
&nbsp

1405
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:22,824
Heading for State and Oakhill, fast.

1406
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:22,825
&nbsp

1407
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:24,427
Which leads right into downtown.

1408
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:24,428
&nbsp

1409
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:26,246
- All right, so what do we do?
- Barry, I know we're

1410
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:26,247
&nbsp

1411
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,647
speedsters and everything, but
we are way outnumbered here.

1412
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:28,648
&nbsp

1413
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:30,049
Yeah, I mean, he's right,
how are the three of us

1414
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:30,050
&nbsp

1415
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,550
gonna take on all those gorillas?

1416
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:31,551
&nbsp

1417
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:33,018
We have to.

1418
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:33,019
&nbsp

1419
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,387
As much as I hate these gorillas,

1420
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:35,388
&nbsp

1421
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:36,788
especially Grodd, if you kill him,

1422
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:36,789
&nbsp

1423
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,556
the other ones might stand down,

1424
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:38,557
&nbsp

1425
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,192
but you might not be able to
come back from this, Barry.

1426
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:40,193
&nbsp

1427
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:42,660
- You know that, right?
- I know.

1428
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,132
&nbsp

1429
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,731
But there's another way.

1430
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:46,732
&nbsp

1431
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:48,566
It's not gonna come to that.

1432
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:48,567
&nbsp

1433
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,667
Cisco, I'm gonna need your help.

1434
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,705
&nbsp

1435
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,005
Tracked her down on Earth-2.

1436
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:54,006
&nbsp

1437
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:55,239
Breach is taken care of.

1438
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:57,276
&nbsp

1439
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:59,076
Thank you.

1440
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:01,247
&nbsp

1441
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:02,914
Risky move coming to an Earth

1442
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:02,915
&nbsp

1443
00:31:02,925 --> 00:31:05,482
where interdimensional travel
is punishable by death.

1444
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,286
&nbsp

1445
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:08,551
Especially when I'm the one

1446
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:08,552
&nbsp

1447
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:10,653
who's supposed to uphold that law.

1448
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:10,654
&nbsp

1449
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:12,055
I need to talk to you.

1450
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:12,056
&nbsp

1451
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,391
I don't do long-distance relationships.

1452
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:14,392
&nbsp

1453
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:15,926
Don't get me wrong, this is something

1454
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:15,927
&nbsp

1455
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:17,593
I'd love to talk about in more detail,

1456
00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:17,594
&nbsp

1457
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:19,629
especially if distance
is your only hesitation.

1458
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:19,630
&nbsp

1459
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,164
But I'm here to talk about Grodd.

1460
00:31:21,174 --> 00:31:21,165
&nbsp

1461
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,698
Okay, I see you don't
take no for an answer.

1462
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:23,699
&nbsp

1463
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,600
Gypsy, please.

1464
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:25,601
&nbsp

1465
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,369
He's gonna destroy my city.

1466
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:27,370
&nbsp

1467
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,171
And he's gonna hurt the people I love.

1468
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:29,172
&nbsp

1469
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:32,341
I told you before,
that's not my problem.

1470
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:32,342
&nbsp

1471
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,810
Look, just go back to Earth-1
before someone sees you

1472
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,811
&nbsp

1473
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:37,779
and I have to do something
that I don't want to.

1474
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:37,780
&nbsp

1475
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,614
You know, you told me I could
do things with my powers

1476
00:31:39,624 --> 00:31:39,615
&nbsp

1477
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,983
I'd never even imagined,
and you're right,

1478
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:41,984
&nbsp

1479
00:31:41,994 --> 00:31:43,517
'cause I'm not just
vibing people anymore.

1480
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:43,518
&nbsp

1481
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,086
I'm vibing what they feel.

1482
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,087
&nbsp

1483
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:46,354
And you know what I'm getting from you,

1484
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:46,355
&nbsp

1485
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,289
right here, right now?

1486
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:48,290
&nbsp

1487
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,925
You're more than this. You're like me.

1488
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:50,926
&nbsp

1489
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:53,627
You want to do something good.

1490
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:53,628
&nbsp

1491
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:55,263
Look, we need something to stop Grodd,

1492
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:55,264
&nbsp

1493
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:57,364
and I'm gonna need your help getting it.

1494
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:57,365
&nbsp

1495
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:00,133
Please, be the hero I
know you want to be.

1496
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:07,676
&nbsp

1497
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:09,876
Wells, how long do we have?

1498
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:09,877
&nbsp

1499
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,244
Two minutes, Barry.

1500
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:11,245
&nbsp

1501
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,980
Two minutes? Ten seconds!

1502
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:13,981
&nbsp

1503
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,781
Can you not even tell time?

1504
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:15,782
&nbsp

1505
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,316
That's what I said. Ten seconds.

1506
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:17,317
&nbsp

1507
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,685
So got any pointers on
how the three of us

1508
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:19,686
&nbsp

1509
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:23,155
are gonna save everyone and
stop a few hundred gorillas?

1510
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:23,156
&nbsp

1511
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,523
Go for the legs?

1512
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,193
&nbsp

1513
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:28,361
Just try not to get caught,

1514
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:28,362
&nbsp

1515
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,229
'cause, trust me, they won't let go.

1516
00:32:31,239 --> 00:33:15,606
&nbsp

1517
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:18,241
Well, that was not the
start we're looking for.

1518
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:19,144
&nbsp

1519
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:20,976
Because...

1520
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:20,977
&nbsp

1521
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:22,444
How long do they have to last?

1522
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:22,445
&nbsp

1523
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:23,811
Hopefully not much longer.

1524
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:39,095
&nbsp

1525
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:41,995
Your city will fall, Flash.

1526
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:41,996
&nbsp

1527
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:44,965
There's only one way to end this.

1528
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:46,335
&nbsp

1529
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,469
You kill me.

1530
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:48,470
&nbsp

1531
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,404
But you won't do that.

1532
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:50,405
&nbsp

1533
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:53,307
All you care about is mercy.

1534
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:53,308
&nbsp

1535
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,509
Yeah, you're right.

1536
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:55,510
&nbsp

1537
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,411
Except I'm not the only one
that wants to stop you.

1538
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:13,926
&nbsp

1539
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:15,727
Solovar!

1540
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:19,299
&nbsp

1541
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,933
I challenge you, Grodd!

1542
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:21,934
&nbsp

1543
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:24,836
And you will fall again!

1544
00:34:24,846 --> 00:35:31,501
&nbsp

1545
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:34,402
Good-bye, Grodd.

1546
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:34,403
&nbsp

1547
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:35,637
Stop! Stop...

1548
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:37,839
&nbsp

1549
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,673
Death isn't the way.

1550
00:35:39,683 --> 00:35:39,674
&nbsp

1551
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:42,476
He betrayed me.

1552
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:42,477
&nbsp

1553
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:46,146
I know, so leave him
here, where he's from.

1554
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:46,147
&nbsp

1555
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:49,383
We won't let him go back to
Gorilla City ever again.

1556
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:51,919
&nbsp

1557
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:54,288
Just spare his life,
like I spared yours.

1558
00:35:54,298 --> 00:36:01,095
&nbsp

1559
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:02,328
Send us home...

1560
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:02,329
&nbsp

1561
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:03,962
all of us.

1562
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:14,074
&nbsp

1563
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,273
How long is it gonna take

1564
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:15,274
&nbsp

1565
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:17,040
to put 100 gorillas through a breach?

1566
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,041
&nbsp

1567
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,642
We're gonna be here all night.
You know what I ought to do?

1568
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:18,643
&nbsp

1569
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:22,696
Whip us up some cappuccino...
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1570
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:22,697
&nbsp

1571
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:24,564
All the gorillas are back on Earth-2.

1572
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:24,565
&nbsp

1573
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:26,033
And Grodd?

1574
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:26,034
&nbsp

1575
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:28,501
I called Lyla. He's with A.R.G.U.S.

1576
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:28,502
&nbsp

1577
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:29,870
Good. I don't know about y'all,

1578
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:29,871
&nbsp

1579
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:31,805
but I don't ever need to see

1580
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:31,806
&nbsp

1581
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,406
a super-smart, telepathic gorilla again.

1582
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:34,407
&nbsp

1583
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:35,607
I'm with you.

1584
00:36:35,617 --> 00:36:35,608
&nbsp

1585
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:37,009
Not that Grodd didn't have

1586
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:37,010
&nbsp

1587
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,178
some justification for
mistrusting humans.

1588
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:39,179
&nbsp

1589
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:41,180
Whatever good was in Grodd is gone.

1590
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,181
&nbsp

1591
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,949
As far as I'm concerned,
they can throw him

1592
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:42,950
&nbsp

1593
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,450
in the same cage as King Shark.

1594
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,451
&nbsp

1595
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,719
Mm, I'd pay money to see that fight.

1596
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:46,720
&nbsp

1597
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,388
All right, well, if the city
doesn't need my help anymore,

1598
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:49,389
&nbsp

1599
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:50,922
I'm gonna head back to Earth-19.

1600
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:50,923
&nbsp

1601
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:52,224
Oh, really?

1602
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:52,225
&nbsp

1603
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:54,392
So you did all this for the city, huh?

1604
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:54,393
&nbsp

1605
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:57,128
'Cause I'm pretty sure
there's a different reason

1606
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:57,129
&nbsp

1607
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:58,529
you chose to help us.

1608
00:36:58,539 --> 00:36:58,530
&nbsp

1609
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,898
That's right, I was the only one

1610
00:36:59,908 --> 00:36:59,899
&nbsp

1611
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:01,132
who knew where Solovar was.

1612
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:01,133
&nbsp

1613
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:02,433
Oh, right, yeah.

1614
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:02,434
&nbsp

1615
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:03,501
How could I forget?

1616
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:03,502
&nbsp

1617
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,570
- Mm.
- Don't front.

1618
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:05,571
&nbsp

1619
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:07,739
You're into me.

1620
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:09,774
&nbsp

1621
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:12,409
Look, Cisco, I mean,

1622
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:12,410
&nbsp

1623
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,278
even if I was...

1624
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:19,050
&nbsp

1625
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,684
You couldn't handle me.

1626
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:24,756
&nbsp

1627
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:25,755
Bye, guys.

1628
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:25,756
&nbsp

1629
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:28,091
- Bye.
- Mm-hmm.

1630
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:28,092
&nbsp

1631
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:30,326
I'll marry that woman.

1632
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:30,327
&nbsp

1633
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:32,095
Yeah.

1634
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:32,096
&nbsp

1635
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,530
Okay, I better get this story
in before I lose my job.

1636
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:34,531
&nbsp

1637
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,299
Okay.

1638
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:36,300
&nbsp

1639
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,268
You sure you still don't
want to look into the future

1640
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:38,269
&nbsp

1641
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,869
and see what's changed?

1642
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:39,870
&nbsp

1643
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,537
No.

1644
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:41,538
&nbsp

1645
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:43,671
Think I'm done with that.

1646
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:43,672
&nbsp

1647
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:46,508
- Good.
- I'll see you at home.

1648
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:46,509
&nbsp

1649
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,776
Okay.

1650
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:47,777
&nbsp

1651
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:48,944
Hey, I'll walk out with you.

1652
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:48,945
&nbsp

1653
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:50,345
I got a date with Cecile.

1654
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:50,346
&nbsp

1655
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:52,314
Oh.

1656
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:52,315
&nbsp

1657
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:54,082
Come on, guys. Let's go find Harry.

1658
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:58,754
&nbsp

1659
00:37:58,764 --> 00:38:01,422
To review, this is my daughter.

1660
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:01,423
&nbsp

1661
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,925
There's nothing more important to me.

1662
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:03,926
&nbsp

1663
00:38:03,936 --> 00:38:05,226
So you do right by my daughter,

1664
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:05,227
&nbsp

1665
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:07,094
or there is nowhere in the multiverse

1666
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,095
&nbsp

1667
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:08,629
I won't find you.

1668
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,699
&nbsp

1669
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,033
Dad.

1670
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:12,034
&nbsp

1671
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,968
They'd have to kill me.

1672
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:18,005
&nbsp

1673
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,172
Bye.

1674
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:24,378
&nbsp

1675
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:25,611
Bye.

1676
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:25,612
&nbsp

1677
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:27,247
Bye, Jesse Quick.

1678
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:33,219
&nbsp

1679
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,220
Always another way, Flash.

1680
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,221
&nbsp

1681
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,555
Always.

1682
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:53,306
&nbsp

1683
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:54,422
Babe?

1684
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,908
&nbsp

1685
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,109
Is that Grandma Esther's noodles?

1686
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,110
&nbsp

1687
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,710
Mm-hmm.

1688
00:38:59,720 --> 00:38:59,711
&nbsp

1689
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,512
And there's mint chocolate
chip in the freezer.

1690
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:01,513
&nbsp

1691
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:04,682
And these are for you.

1692
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:09,187
&nbsp

1693
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:12,555
What is all this?

1694
00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:12,556
&nbsp

1695
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:16,026
I've been really busy recently with...

1696
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:16,027
&nbsp

1697
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,561
trying to avoid the future.

1698
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:18,562
&nbsp

1699
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:21,931
And I forgot that there's
always another way.

1700
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:23,002
&nbsp

1701
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,600
What is that?

1702
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,705
&nbsp

1703
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:29,365
Making the future...

1704
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,109
&nbsp

1705
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,311
our future.

1706
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:38,581
&nbsp

1707
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:40,883
My great-grandfather gave
this to my great-grandmother

1708
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:40,884
&nbsp

1709
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,417
after World War II.

1710
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:42,418
&nbsp

1711
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:44,452
He wanted to propose
before he was shipped out,

1712
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:44,453
&nbsp

1713
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:46,221
but he... he didn't have the money.

1714
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:46,222
&nbsp

1715
00:39:46,232 --> 00:39:47,655
And he bought this three years later

1716
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:47,656
&nbsp

1717
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,357
when he was stationed in London.

1718
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:49,358
&nbsp

1719
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:51,626
Fought his way across France,
all the way to Berlin,

1720
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:51,627
&nbsp

1721
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:53,694
and this ring...

1722
00:39:53,704 --> 00:39:53,695
&nbsp

1723
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,563
around his neck with his dog tags.

1724
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:55,564
&nbsp

1725
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:57,765
And when he got back, she was
waiting for him on the dock

1726
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:57,766
&nbsp

1727
00:39:57,776 --> 00:39:59,933
of the Brooklyn Navy Yards.

1728
00:39:59,943 --> 00:39:59,934
&nbsp

1729
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,503
He proposed on the spot.

1730
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:04,273
&nbsp

1731
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:07,941
After my mom passed away,

1732
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:07,942
&nbsp

1733
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:09,476
Joe held on to this for me...

1734
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:09,477
&nbsp

1735
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,145
until tonight.

1736
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:12,014
&nbsp

1737
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:15,681
- Barry...
- Iris West,

1738
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:15,682
&nbsp

1739
00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:17,483
will you marry me?

1740
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:24,092
&nbsp

1741
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:26,325
Inside of us, we both know
you belong with Victor.

1742
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:26,326
&nbsp

1743
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,627
You're part of his work, the
thing that keeps him going.

1744
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:28,628
&nbsp

1745
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:29,862
If that plane leaves...

1746
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:29,863
&nbsp

1747
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:31,997
Okay, I'm so confused.

1748
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:31,998
&nbsp

1749
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:35,633
Is it supposed to be about
the War of the Americas?

1750
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:35,634
&nbsp

1751
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,902
Do you not like it? 'Cause
this is my favorite movie.

1752
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:37,903
&nbsp

1753
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:41,239
No, no, I didn't say that. Um...

1754
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:41,240
&nbsp

1755
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,542
I guess we just have
more wars on my Earth.

1756
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:43,543
&nbsp

1757
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:46,978
Well, we can just watch something else.

1758
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:50,316
&nbsp

1759
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:53,750
Or we don't have to
watch anything at all.

1760
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:53,751
&nbsp

1761
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:55,186
Mm.

1762
00:40:55,196 --> 00:40:58,491
&nbsp

1763
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:01,592
You know what I could go for?

1764
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:03,196
&nbsp

1765
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:06,063
Big Belly Burger.

1766
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:06,064
&nbsp

1767
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:07,663
Wow!

1768
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:07,664
&nbsp

1769
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,664
Wow, ow.

1770
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:08,665
&nbsp

1771
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,067
Um, I'll be right back.

1772
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:11,068
&nbsp

1773
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:13,236
Thank you.

1774
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:25,766
