you just passed,

168
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,294
and Tigress told me.

169
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,296
Yeah, well, did she also
tell you that it'll
never happen again?

170
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,422
Because I'm done.

171
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,591
Teaching or being humiliated?

172
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,510
Both! I don't know
why you ever thought
I could teach that class.

173
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,304
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

174
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,432
What? You set me
up to fail? Why?

175
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,559
If you only do
what you can do,

176
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,395
you will never be
more than you are now.

177
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,315
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

178
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,151
You don't even know
who you are.

179
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,736
What do you...
Of course I do.

180
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,446
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

181
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,365
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

182
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,786
Hmm.

183
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,164
It means, you know,
just going around

184
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,540
and punching and kicking.

185
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,335
Defending the Valley!
And stuff.

186
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,920
Punching and kicking?

187
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,254
You think that is what

188
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,340
the great Master Oogway
saw for you?

189
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,302
A 500-year
prophecy fulfilled

190
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,971
so you could
spend your days
kicking butt

191
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,849
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

192
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,893
Yes?
No!

(SIGHS)

194
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,647
Oogway saw greatness
in you, Po.

195
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,732
Against my better judgment.

196
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,693
More than you can see
in yourself.

197
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,571
Incredible power awaits you.

198
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,910
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

199
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,511
Wow! What was that?

200
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,971
That was chi.

201
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,305
Wow!

202
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,807
What's chi?

203
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,645
The energy that flows
through all living things.

204
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,897
So you're saying
if I teach,

205
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,190
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

206
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,484
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

207
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,486
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

208
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,571
Oh.

209
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,158
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

210
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
Oogway sat alone in a cave

211
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,955
for 30 years
asking one question.

212

"Who am I?"

213
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,834
"Who am I?"

214
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm lucky if
I get five minutes

215
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,212
before you interrupt...
(PO GROANS)

216
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,715
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,841
Eventually.

218
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,509
After you master teaching.

219
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,846
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

220
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,973
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

turn you into you.

Turn me into me?

223
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,567
Wait a second,
that makes no...

224
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,776
Almost there, Shifu.

225
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,113
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.
