1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,568
GORDON:
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,004
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,939
I'm your new boss.

4
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,181
Sid Bunderslaw.
I'm the director

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>of physical operations.</i>

6
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,310
I've been expecting you.

7
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,179
BARNES: Garrett, Pinkney,

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,282
Josie, Martinez,
congratulations.

9
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:21,220
You are now Unit Alpha
of the GCPD Strike Force.

10
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,022
<i>Time to take down the Penguin.</i>

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,890
OSWALD: Mother...

12
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,625
You'll pay for this!

13
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,461
THEO: They die,
your mother lives.

14
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,430
I'm gonna need you
to take a crack

15
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,766
at me also--
and miss, of course.

16
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:35,034
Get down!

17
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,169
(crowd screaming)

18
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,304
If the bad guys want
to stop me running,

19
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,774
well, then I guess
I got no choice.

20
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:45,711
I will run for mayor.

21
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,180
(thunder rumbling,
sirens wailing, horns honking)

22
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,788
Thank you for the trunk,
old friend.

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,524
I'll call you when I need you.

24
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,259
I'm glad you call me a friend.

25
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,994
(scoffs)
Figure of speech.

26
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,862
But do go on.

27
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,864
I can't help feeling...

28
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,968
wouldn't I be so much more
useful to you as a friend?

29
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,271
As a colleague, an ally?

30
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,773
As opposed to the tool

31
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,708
you are at present.

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,011
Good question.

33
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,646
No.

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,518
I would be a much more
effective tool for you

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,421
if I wasn't so worried
about my mother.

36
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,290
If you let her come home,

37
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,926
I would still do your bidding.

38
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,895
Trust me, I know who's boss now.

39
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,131
(chuckles)
Lord have mercy.

40
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,501
No need to rub it in.

41
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,137
(snaps fingers)

42
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,407
Yes, sir, we all
know who's boss.

43
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,908
What do you think, Tabitha?

44
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,211
I wasn't listening.

45
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,179
You know how
I love the big macho type.

46
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,747
THEO:
Leave him alone.

47
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,583
Yeah, leave me alone.

48
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,119
Shh!

49
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,920
The answer is no,

50
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,188
old friend.

51
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,756
Off you go.

52
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,825
(grunts)

53
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,559
THEO:
Stay by the phone.

54
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,503
(sighs, shudders)

55
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,676
I wish you wouldn't
freak out the help.

56
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,545
I've got a mayoral campaign
to run.

57
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,981
I need to know your gonna handle
this part of the business.

58
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,282
I get bored.

59
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,850
I hate it when you say that.
You have plenty to do.

60
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,286
You still have
Mayor James to play with.

61
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,754
He's been here
nearly a month.

62
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,972
He's getting old fast.

63
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,189
You got Barbara
to hang out with.

64
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,893
Yeah, she's cool,
but she sleeps a lot.

65
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,561
And she's kind of crazy.

66
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,123
THEO: That's the
best part about her.

67
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,367
Galavan?

68
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,169
What the hell is going on?

69
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,304
Mr. Bunderslaw, welcome.

70
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,206
What... what do you
want with me?

71
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,175
You are the garbage man

72
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,577
for Wayne Enterprises,
correct?

73
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,846
Every nasty little thing
the company has done,

74
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,581
you know all about it.

75
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,482
No.

76
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,851
Yes, and you are gonna tell us

77
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,787
everything that you know.

78
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,156
And if I refuse?

79
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,391
(thunder rumbling)
Torture.

80
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,227
But that's for later.

81
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,263
Right now, there is something
of yours we need to borrow.

82
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,733
Sister, if you don't mind.

83
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,468
Left or right?

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,030
THEO:
Either one.

85
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,645
No...

86
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,451
(Bunderslaw screaming)

87
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:41,987
(squishing)

88
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,829
MAN: 25 and 25 boxes.

89
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,807
(snoring)

90
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,443
Hm?

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,653
(grumbling)
God...!

92
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,455
Anybody who doesn't want
to get shot,

93
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,723
raise your hand!

94
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:18,725
Whoa!

95
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,651
Get down!
(shouting)

96
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,809
A damn rocket launcher?

97
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,579
Welcome to Gotham, Cap.

98
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,019
I can fit my yearly salary
in my hands.

99
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,186
BARNES:
Don't get any ideas

100
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,421
about that cash, son.

101
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,023
Just bag it up.

102
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,291
Don't worry, sir.

103
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,959
Ideas aren't his strong suit.

104
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,328
Did some
rough calculations, sir.

105
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,562
Somewhere around
two million dollars here.

106
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:01,800
It's a strong body blow
to Penguin.

107
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,101
He'll feel it.

108
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,369
Sir?

109
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,338
They're asking for their pants.

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,639
Read 'em their rights.

111
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,875
Doesn't say squat about pants.

112
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,443
Wait.

113
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,911
Tell 'em the whoever gives up
where they got

114
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,646
the damn rocket launcher
gets to wear pants.

115
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,415
The rest can go naked,
for all I care.

116
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,250
GORDON:
Captain.

117
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,885
A word?

118
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,955
There's a place
called the Merc.

119
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,558
Sells most of the
heavy weapons in town.

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,427
They haven't been hit,

121
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,363
'cause they pay off
half the city council.

122
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,799
The Merc, uh?

123
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,168
The city council
can suck my tailpipe.

124
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,136
We're gonna hit
this Merc tomorrow.

125
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,539
Pinkney, belay that order.

126
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,942
No one gets pants.

127
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,411
We grab him up.

128
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,946
We grab him, and we hurt him

129
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,615
until he tells us where she is,
and then we hurt him more.

130
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,184
Okay, is that a good idea?

131
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,618
Do you have a better one?

132
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,554
We could get the sister.

133
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,089
And then what?

134
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,724
He's still out there,

135
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,093
and does he love his sister
as much as I love my mother?

136
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,327
I don't think so!

137
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,863
GILZEAN:
Hmm, it is a pickle.

138
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,198
Mr. Penguin, sir,

139
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,466
the cops just hit
the count house.

140
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,867
They took everything,
every dollar.

141
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,469
Ooh!

142
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,905
(gasping, grunting)

143
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,175
Did you enjoy giving me
that news?!

144
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,878
(grunting)

145
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,621
Ah!

146
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,257
Butch!
(wheezing)

147
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,526
I have an idea.

148
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,236
Hey, you.

149
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,037
Good morning.

150
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,339
How's your day look?

151
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,541
The strike force is going out
on another raid.

152
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,576
Strike force.

153
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,544
I hate that name.

154
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,346
Yeah, I'm not wild
about it myself,

155
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,281
but Barnes gets things done.

156
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,682
He can call us
what he likes.

157
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,419
All right, so you go
strike with your force,

158
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,120
then what are we doing tonight?

159
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,089
Sleep.
Uh-uh, it's date night, mister.

160
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,891
With who?

161
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,125
Morning, Ed.

162
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,160
Detective, Ms. Tompkins.

163
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,295
As you may have heard,

164
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,564
I've recently been seeing
Miss Kringle.

165
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,633
Kristen.

166
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,901
And she mentioned

167
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,370
that it might be nice to go out
with other people along,

168
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,139
so I thought, perhaps,
the two of you would enjoy

169
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,240
joining us
for dinner tonight.

170
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,162
We can't.
We'd love to.

171
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,179
Sure.

172
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,213
Yeah, yeah, no.

173
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,581
Great.
As a matter of fact,

174
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,749
I just bought some
new fondue pots.

175
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,284
Why don't we do
it at my house?

176
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,119
Excellent, excellent.

177
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,388
I'll go tell Kristen.

178
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,792
I know, I know, but it was
the decent thing to do.

179
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,360
Fondue?

180
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,922
Have you ever tried it?
It's delicious.

181
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,165
It's at your place.

182
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,667
We can't leave.

183
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,935
We're already home.

184
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,003
Trapped.
Don't be mean.

185
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,605
We'll make it fun.

186
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,777
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,580
Detective Gordon?

188
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,814
Good morning.

189
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,550
I wonder if we could, uh,
talk alone?

190
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,753
Of course.

191
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,392
Thank you for, uh, giving me
some of your valuable time.

192
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,162
Oh, not a problem.

193
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,563
(sighs)

194
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,166
That night at the gala, I...

195
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,502
I just keep going through it.

196
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,470
Me, too.

197
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,039
I've never killed a man before.

198
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,841
Fear... blood...

199
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,111
I relive that moment

200
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,981
over and over.

201
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:39,451
Do those thoughts ever go away?

202
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,853
No.

203
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,855
But over time,
they lose their power.

204
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,359
You did the right thing.

205
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,261
I guess I did.

206
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,663
I'm kind of amazed at myself.

207
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,065
You, doing the right thing,
it's what you do

208
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,834
every day.

209
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,537
That's why people speak
so highly of you.

210
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,939
You're a symbol
to the people of this city--

211
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,909
of hope, of honor.

212
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,844
That's why I'm here.

213
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,978
I would be honored...

214
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,348
if you would consider...

215
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,350
endorsing me for mayor.

216
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,286
Ah, endorsement.

217
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,521
I'm flattered, but, uh,

218
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,557
I'm afraid policemen
and politics don't mix.

219
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,525
Maybe not for the cop
on the street,

220
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,861
but you're the president
of the Policeman's Union.

221
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,230
Where you lead,
officers will follow.

222
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,065
That's more power

223
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,301
than the kind
that comes out of a gun.

224
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,902
(quiet laugh)

225
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,571
You seem like a good man,

226
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,705
but...

227
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,941
I'm afraid my answer
has to be no.

228
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,476
I don't do endorsements.

229
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,980
I know better than to push.

230
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,318
But think about it.

231
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,852
We could really
help each other.

232
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,197
Hi, Penguin.

233
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,599
What do you want?

234
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,881
Why so glum?

235
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,037
I just lost a lot of money.

236
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,339
Aww.

237
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,207
Poor sad little bread head.

238
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,610
The money is immaterial.

239
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,211
Someone must have betrayed me.

240
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,347
Someone close.

241
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,748
You don't know that, boss.

242
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,150
Oh, don't I?

243
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,352
Don't I?!

244
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,820
Whoa, chill, birdman.

245
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,789
I got a job for you.

246
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,808
What's that?

247
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,826
Addresses of places
you're gonna burn to the ground.

248
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,729
Starting tonight.

249
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,764
Arson now?

250
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,132
(chuckles)

251
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,967
Sure, fine.

252
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,402
Whatever.

253
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,071
If I can find
a trustworthy arsonist.

254
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,042
Paranoid, huh?

255
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,511
Get your head together,

256
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,380
little man, and get it done.

257
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,852
Oh, and whoever starts the fires
is gonna need this.

258
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,996
(pounding on door)

259
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,065
(cats meowing in distance)

260
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:11,770
(breaks bottle)

261
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,955
(door closes)

262
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:31,990
Nice place.

263
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,491
Whassup?

264
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,360
I need you to take me
to the Pike Brothers.

265
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,431
The firebugs from the Narrows?

266
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,999
I used to hang
with their sister, Bridgit,

267
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,068
when I was a kid.

268
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,438
Why do you need me to take you?

269
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,939
To vouch for me.

270
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,808
The Pikes are
the best arsonists in town,

271
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,876
but they're also Fish loyalists.

272
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,778
(scoffs)

273
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,181
The idiots think she's
coming back someday.

274
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,415
She might come back.

275
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,051
I was there, darlin'.

276
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,352
She might.
Whatever.

277
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,122
The Pikes hate me and Penguin,

278
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,590
for obvious reasons, but...

279
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,059
everyone knows
Fish loved you.

280
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,594
They do?

281
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,463
Your face will open doors, babe.

282
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,365
Six hundred.

283
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,800
Three-fifty.

284
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,836
(sighs)

285
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,671
Fine.

286
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,940
(sirens wailing in distance)

287
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,010
Just let me
do the talkin'.

288
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,246
You just smile
and make like we're friends.

289
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,648
Friends?

290
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,917
That's a hundred extra.

291
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,488
Chiseler.

292
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,190
So, everybody knows
she loved me?

293
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,493
That's what they say.

294
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,062
She loved me, too, once.

295
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,497
And I loved her.

296
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,232
Then you shot her.

297
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,367
(grunts)

298
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,635
It was complicated.

299
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,103
(scoffs) Got that right.

300
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,171

Hi, Bridgit.

302
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,045
Hey, Selina.

303
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,115
It's been a while.

304
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,051
Me and my pet gorilla
are here on business.

305
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,987
Your brothers home?

306
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,855
Yeah.

307
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,495
(rock music playing,
muffled, from distance)

308
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:19,998
Hey, boys.

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,367
What are you doing
with this rat, Selina?

310
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,902
He's okay.

311
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,336
I vouch for him.

312
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,738
MAN:
What do you mean, okay?

313
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,107
The bastard shot Fish.

314
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,175
It was complicated.

315
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,744
He loves her just like you do.

316
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,846

Sure.

00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,322
But right now,
he got a nice job

323

for you guys.

324

You up for it?

333
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,716
For sure.

334
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,985
We'll need more gear.
I'll hit the Merc and stock up.

Thanks.

338
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,039
(groans)

339
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,808
Hey, sis...

340
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,977
what are you, a slob?

341
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,144
We have company.

342
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,746
What do we do
when we have company?

343
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,814
We get them a glass.

344
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,976
Ding, ding, ding.
Go and do it.

345
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,158
Thank you, Bridgit.

346
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,766
(door opens, closes)
(scoffs)

347
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,573
You're gonna need this.

348
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,949
(crying softly)

349
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,957
Hey.

350
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,026
Hey.

351
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,729
Looks like rain.

352
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:37,201
Yeah, it does.

353
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,937
I don't mind it.

354
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,039
Cleans the streets anyhow.

355
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,308
That's true.

356
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,678
(thunder rumbling)

357
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,647
Anyway, um,

358
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,950
take care of yourself, Bridgit.

359
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,788
Be strong.

360
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,805
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Yeah, can we get a price check

361
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,773
on brass knuckles
in toxic green?

362
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,780
300 gets it done.

363
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,886
Uh, 10% surcharge
for soiled bills.

364
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,474
Thank you kindly.

365
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,591
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Try our Whiff-Away.

366
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,227
On sale now in Aisle Seven.

367
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,099
Welcome to Merc,
your one-stop shop

368
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,834
for machetes,
night-vision goggles,

369
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,937
and all of your personal
defense needs.

370
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,543
Huh.

371
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,846
Robbery.

372
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,950
WOMAN (over P.A.):
...mouthpiece and muzzle guard.

373
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:00,918
GORDON:
GCPD!

374
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,153
BARNES:
Everybody on the ground!

375
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,554
This is a raid!

376
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,089
Runner!

377
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,426
I got him!

378
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,537
Stop!

379
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,706
Stop right now!

380
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,781
(gunshots)

381
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,163
What the hell are you packing?

382
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,205
NYGMA: When cheese melts,
the protein matrix relaxes

383
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,573
and the fats flow
more like liquid.

384
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,076
It creates this
low-friction mouth feel,

385
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,544
which is why melted
cheese is so...

386
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,711
Ed.

387
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,346
Uh, it's delicious.

388
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,049
Mm-hmm. Yes, it is.

389
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,017
Oh... ha...

390
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,151
(laughter)

391
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,620
Oh, no! (giggles)

392
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,724
Oh, Lee, we shouldn't be eating
without Jim here.

393
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,592
I'm so sorry.

394
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,060
No, no, no, please, eat.
It's fine.

395
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,362
Oh.
There he is.

396
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,697
Hello, there.
Hey, Jim.

397
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,865
Nice to see you.

398
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,500
Sorry I'm late.

399
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,703
(sighs)

400
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,004
really sorry.

401
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,106
Long story.

402
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,676
I hope it hasn't
been going too bad.

403
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,111
You know,
it's the weirdest thing,

404
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,378
but Nygma's actually maintaining

405
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,880
this strange sort of cool.

406
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,181
No.

407
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,984
Seriously.

408
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,253
(laughter)

409
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,589
There's a lid for every pot.

410
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,424
Pardon me.

411
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,092
Since Detective Gordon is here,

412
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,527
I'd like to propose a toast.

413
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,863
Mmm!

414
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,433
The less you have,

415
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,735
the more they're worth.

416
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:58,903
To friends.

417
00:18:58,905 --> 00:18:59,937
Oh.

418
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,272
Hear, hear.

419
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,309
I can't believe he's dead.

420
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,944
Biggest job of our lives,

421
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,179
and this happens.

422
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,814
So what do we do?

423
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,349
For sure, we do the job.

424
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,050
How? We're screwed.

425
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,752
Who's our entry man now?

426
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,454
Crawling through air vents?
Climbing fire escapes?

427
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,422
We need a little skinny guy.

428
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,961
You think?

429
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,997
Hey, Bridgy...

430
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,365
you just got a promotion.

431
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,633
No.
Yes.

432
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,968
Please, you know
I don't like fire.

433
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,236
You don't like fire?

434
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,604
Fire is our bread and butter.

435
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,039
It's our family business.

436
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,475
You're don't want to let down
your family, do you?

437
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,876
You're not my family.

438
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,311
What's that?

439
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,480
We're not your family?

440
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,348
You got anybody else?
My mother...

441
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,284
Your mother was a ho,
and she's dead.

442
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,753
Who feeds you?
Who puts a roof above your head?

443
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,054
Huh? We do.

444
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,389
That's family.

445
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,990
I won't do it.

446
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,725
Oh.

447
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,527
Fine, be like that.

448
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,662
But if you're not family,

449
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,864
well, that changes things
around here, though.

450
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,165
See, I'm a decent guy.

451
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,000
I would never put family
on the street.

452
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,002
But if you're not family...

453
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,270
hell...

454
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,939
why not make a buck?

455
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,442
Yo, that's a kick-ass idea.

456
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,178
So what are you gonna do? Hm?

457
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,380
Do you want to be turned out?

458
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,049
Or do you want
to be family?

459
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,318
Which?

460
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,587
Family.

461
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:29,060
He wanted me
to endorse him for mayor.

462
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,261
Wow.

463
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,896
What did you say?

464
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,398
I said no.

465
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,933
You don't like him?

466
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,602
I do, actually.

467
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:41,172
But I know better
than to let that matter.

468
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,440
Endorsing politicians--

469
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,841
that's not me.

470
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,776
Still, he asked you.
That's very flattering.

471
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,979
You're a respected figure
in this town.

472
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,747
(sighs)

473
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,450
The way people look at you,

474
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,285
see you differently,

475
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,820
you treat it like it's a burden.

476
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,122
It could be a source of pride,
or happiness even,

477
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,358
if you let it.

478
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,093
Thank you, Doctor.

479
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,394
Same time next week?

480
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,929
(laughs gently):
Oh...

481
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,164
Don't tempt me.
I could psychoanalyze

482
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,532
the heck out of you.

483
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,501
But I'm gonna resist the urge.

484
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,572
Gee, thanks.

485
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,408
(siren wails in distance,
horns honk)

486
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,579
BRIDGIT:
Be strong, Bridgit.

487
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:24,915
Okay.

488
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,518
It's on.
JOE: Now...

489
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,619
you're gonna want
to cut yourself

490
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,181
about a foot and
a half of fuse.

491
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,527
Okay.

492
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,563
Push the wick
into the plastic explosive.

493
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:44,502
Okay.

494
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,903
Now get out the flame.

495
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,075
You got about a minute and
a half to get out of there

496
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,243
once that fuse is lit.

497
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,911
Spark it up.

498
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,382
(gasps)
It's lit.

499
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:59,383
Okay, great.

500
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,851
Sorry, there's one more
thing to do.

501
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:01,786
But it's lit!

502
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,787
Well, you'd
better haul ass.

503
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,722
Do you see a safe on your right?

504
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,157
Yeah.

505
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,726
Get to it.
Okay.

506
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,495
Okay.

507
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,197
Okay, now grab the box
at the bottom of the bag

508
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,479
and open it up.

509
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,803
Oh.

510
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:21,872
Oh, my God.

511
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,207
Grody, right?

512
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:27,178
Okay, put it to the sensor
next to the door.

513
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,483
MALE VOICE:
Welcome, Mr. Bunderslaw.

514
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,886
Okay.

515
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:36,887
It's open.

516
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,889
Now what?

517
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,291
Joe?

518
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,259
Joe, where are you?

519
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,427
(snickers)

520
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,895
Joe, what's wrong?

521
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,263
I'm just messing
with you.

522
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,799
Okay, so there should be
an old knife there. Grab it.

523
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:54,772
Okay.

524
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:55,573
Got it.

525
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,308
Okay, now...

526
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,776
scram.

527
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,087
(screams)

528
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,655
(fire alarm ringing)

529
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,361
JOE: Attagirl.
(siren wails in the distance)

530
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,362
You did good, sis.

531
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,430
Get in the van,
chop chop.

532
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,432
I burned my leg.

533
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,567
Well, "you play with fire,
you get burned," all of that.

534
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,302
We got four more
of these to do tonight,

535
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,937
so get in the damn van.

536
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,206
(sirens approaching,
horn honking)

537
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:46,490
Five locations,
all burned to the ground.

538
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,359
Yeah, Garrett?

539
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:49,627
Excuse me, sir.

540
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,629
Lab called in, said
the fires were started

541
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,764
with thermite and
high-end accelerants.

542
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,200
So we're looking for
professional arsonists.

543
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,368
Thanks.

544
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,537
And, Garrett,
nice work yesterday.

545
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:02,139
Thank you, sir.

546
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,908
Strange.

547
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,243
Why would a pro do
five jobs in one night?

548
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,411
What's the rush?

549
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,046
And what if they're not done?

550
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,516
Find a pattern to these fires.

551
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,985
Before they burn down
the whole city.

552
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,054
♪ ♪

553
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,284
♪ ♪

554
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,045
What are you doing?

555
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,380
Hi.

556
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,617
Making a suit,
so I won't get burned again.

557
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,653
Why would you
get burned again?

558
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,895
So they're making
you start the fires?

559
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,163
I guess.

560
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,698
Sit down.

561
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,966
You want a soda
or something?

562
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,602
No, I-I can't, I'm supposed
to take that to Penguin.

563
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:39,970
Oh.

564
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,105
Okay.

565
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,974
You know, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

566
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,976
(scoffs)
I'll be careful.

567
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,144
Well, careful ain't enough.

568
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,879
Look what
happened already.

569
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,348
It was exciting, Selina.

570
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,684
I actually kind of enjoyed it.

571
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,453
(scoffs)

572
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,015
Yep, you're
gonna be bacon.

573
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,994
My brother said
I did a good job.

574
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,462
It's the family business.

575
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:06,764
They're not your family.

576
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:11,335
Your mom used to
bang their old man

577
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,536
is all.

578
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,271
You don't need them.

579
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,539
You don't need anybody.

580
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,974
Look at me-- I'm free.

581
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,309
(scoffs)

582
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:23,881
I remember when I was little and
you showed up at the Narrows.

583
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:27,351
You looked for
your mom every day.

584
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,954
Snot all down
your face from crying.

585
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,956
So don't act like
you don't want a family.

586
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,691
Don't talk about my mom.

587
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,225
Who cares if you're free?

588
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,695
What good's freedom
if you're alone?

589
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,264
What good's family
if you're a slave?

590
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,867
Huh?

591
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,375
Whatever.

592
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:54,111
I don't even know
why you think I care.

593
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,217
(door closes)

594
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,292
Doesn't make any sense.

595
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,161
This is the Wayne
family crest.

596
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,030
So what?

597
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,032
Why does Galavan want
an antique knife

598
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,768
that belonged to the Waynes?

599
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,137
There's something here,

600
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,407
something to understanding
Galavan, to beating him.

601
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:27,311
Well, if you want to know about
old-time Gotham, talk to Edwige.

602
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,581
Edwige?
Yeah.

603
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,783
She runs the antique shop
in my old neighborhood.

604
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,785
Trust me.

605
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,487
She knows things.

606
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,296
OSWALD: You can pick
it up if you like.

607
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,032
That's okay.

608
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,299
Sorry.

609
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,101
I can't help you.

610
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:55,072
Edwige, I can see
that you know this knife.

611
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,542
You're scared
of this knife.

612
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,544
Why?

613
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,980
Why are you lying to me?
I'm not.

614
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:07,484
Madam, if there's one thing
I know, it's a liar.

615
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,754
Now, tell me
about this knife,

616
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,090
or I will use it.

617
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,160
(clears throat)

618
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,872
This knife has a cursed history.

619
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,878
Almost 200 years ago,
it was used in a terrible crime.

620
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:37,948
Back then...

621
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,985
five families ruled
Gotham high society.

622
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,987
<i>The Elliots, the Kanes,</i>

623
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,857
<i>the Crownes, the Dumas...</i>

624
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,595
and the most powerful
of them all-- the Waynes.

625
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,864
<i>They called Celestine Wayne</i>

626
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,600
<i>the crown jewel of Gotham.</i>

627
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,603
<i>A real beauty.</i>

628
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,138
She was promised

629
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,408
to the eldest son
of the Elliot family.

630
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,610
But there was another
who coveted her.

631
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,747
Caleb Dumas.

632
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,816
<i>One night...</i>

633
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:16,754
<i>it was during an Easter party</i>
<i>at the Wayne Manor...</i>

634
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:21,425
Celestine and Caleb
went missing.

635
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:25,896
Wayne men found them together
in an illicit embrace.

636
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,966
(Caleb and Celestine
shout in protest)

637
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:31,969
We're in love!
<i>Caleb insisted that</i>
<i>they were in love and...</i>

638
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:35,773
Celestine swore
on her mother's grave

639
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,909
that Caleb had forced
himself on her.

640
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,579
I'm innocent. Celestine!

641
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,814
I'm telling the truth!
<i>Justice, if that's</i>
<i>what it was, was swift.</i>

642
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,449
Celestine!

643
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,652
<i>Celestine's brother Jonathan</i>
<i>Wayne delivered the punishment.</i>

644
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,355
(screaming)

645
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,856
The Waynes...

646
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,325
they were mad with rage.

647
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:59,797
They seized the Dumas' holdings
and banished them socially,

648
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,532
destroyed them.

649
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,534
Caleb Dumas

650
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:06,203
went into exile overseas,

651
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:09,473
<i>to a penitential religious sect</i>

652
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,543
<i>founded by his family's</i>
<i>patron saint.</i>

653
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:17,080
Celestine died an old maid.

654
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:20,818
The Waynes forbade the press

655
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,220
from even mentioning the Dumas.

656
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:28,225
They renamed streets
and buildings.

657
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,229
The remnants
of the Dumas family

658
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,865
were forced to change
their name.

659
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:39,303
The Waynes wiped the Dumas

660
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:42,005
out of our city's history.

661
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:46,043
Those remnants
of the Dumas family...

662
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,512
to what did they change
their name?

663
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,948
Aren't you quick?

664
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:55,085
Galavan.

665
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,622
They changed their name
to Galavan.

666
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:03,460
Just like that fella
runnin' for mayor.

667
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,930
And that's why I'm scared
of this knife.

668
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:12,336
You're in deep waters,
Mr. Penguin.

669
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,040
Thank you, Edwige.

670
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,310
That is where penguins thrive.

671
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,625
You hear anything
about any fires,

672
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:35,959
you come see me,
earn yourself

673
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,729
a "get out of jail free"
card, all right?

674
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,198
You got a look
on your face.

675
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,400
It's well hidden behind
a bunch of corporate aliases,

676
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,669
but all the buildings that
burned down last night,

677
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,104
they have one landlord:

678
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,106
Wayne Enterprises.

679
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,641
Uh-huh.

680
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,676
The arsonists moved
east to west.

681
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,945
If they come out tonight
and stick to pattern,

682
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:56,647
there's one
obvious target,

683
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:59,983
an old building also owned
by Wayne Enterprises--

684
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,718
Gotham City Book Depository.

685
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,519
Yay.

686
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,520
Stakeout.

687
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,255
I'll buy the doughnuts.

688
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,723
Just no chili dogs
this time, huh?

689
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,592
I'll let Barnes
know the plan.

690
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,932
(door creaks shut)

691
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,701
(thunder rumbling)

692
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,070
Sent the knife to Galavan.

693
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,107
Your favorite, isn't it?

694
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,412
Crosswhite, 20 year.

695
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,746
(chuckles)

696
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,281
That's the stuff,
all right.

697
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,350
Have a taste.

698
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:36,019
Nah, I'm-I'm good right now.

699
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,287
But thanks.

700
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,789
Have a drink, Butch.

701
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,702
(chuckles)

702
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,904
Your conditioning is still
working nicely, hmm?

703
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:54,972
(snickers)

704
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,273
(mocking tone):
You can't refuse me.

705
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,841
(snickers)

706
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,844
You're the only man
I can truly trust right now.

707
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,213
Starting to sound
a little paranoid, boss.

708
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,216
(laughs)

709
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,218
Am I?

710
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,053
Am I going mad?

711
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,855
Mm, how could I not

712
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,591
when that fiend has
my mother in his clutches?

713
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,094
Have another drink, Butch.

714
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,968
Maybe I am going mad.

715
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,239
Or maybe I found
Galavan's weakness.

716
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,508
You did?

717
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,543
The knife, Butch.

718
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:37,080
The knife that
maimed his ancestor.

719
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:40,083
This is a blood
feud for Galavan.

720
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,819
He wants revenge
against the Waynes.

721
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,822
He's acting out of emotion.

722
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,558
And that can be manipulated.

723
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,826
Have another drink.

724
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,064
You are going to go to Galavan

725
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,833
and you're going
to tell him I went nuts

726
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,103
and that I accused you of
setting up the count shop raid.

727
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:03,907
You are in fear for your life,
and you need a job, got that?

728
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,043
Yes, boss.

729
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,045
Once you're inside
his organization,

730
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,114
you will find my mother
and rescue her.

731
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,283
Yes, boss.

732
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,885
But...

733
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,889
Galavan's a smart guy,
and that's a basic play.

734
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,124
No way is he gonna buy
I turned traitor.

735
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,660
No.

736
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:27,130
But he will buy that I think
you turned traitor.

737
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,100
He'll buy it...

738
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,469
if we sell it right.

739
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,071
Drink up.

740
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,245
How do we sell it?

741
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,614
I already sold him my paranoia.

742
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,417
But you're the closer.

743
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,686
How do we sell you?

744
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:54,424
How do we make him trust
and feel for you?

745
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,693
I wasn't sure.

746
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,228
(chuckles)

747
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,164
But then Celestine
and Caleb told me how.

748
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,967
How?

749
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,973
(screams)

750
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,846
It's the onions that
bring it together.

751
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,315
The sweetness and the
acid, am I right?

752
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,850
I hate stakeouts.

753
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,385
Mmm, half of good police
work is the ability

754
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:25,122
to sit on one's ass
when it's called for.

755
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,124
If that were true,
you'd be commissioner.

756
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,993
(laughing):
Har-dee, har-har.

757
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:33,029
Heads up.

758
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,549
All units stand by.

759
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,817
We may have something.

760
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,352
MAN:
Roger.

761
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,132
So it's all old books in
there, so this one's easy.

762
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,134
Just spread the napalm
around, spark that thing up

763
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,435
and go to town.
Zero sweat.

764
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,470
This thing scares me.

765
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,739
Yeah, it's a flamethrower,
it's meant to be scary.

766
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,774
Get suited up and
get this done.

767
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,336
We got three more
spots to hit.

768
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,592
All units converge
on our location. Now.

769
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,234
OFFICER:
Moving in.

770
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,131
GCPD!
Run!

771
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,467
Go, go, go!

772
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,136
Gray van leaving the alley.

773
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:47,737
Get back!

774
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,272
Please!

775
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,574
Get back!

776
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:51,675
Drop it!

777
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,343
Put down the weapon!

778
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,756
(flamethrower clicks)

779
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,592
Drop the weapon!
I got her!

780
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,593
Drop it.
No!

781
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,294
Garrett, no!
Let me go!

782
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,896
Let go of it!

783
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,164
No!

784
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,066
Let go of me!

785
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:19,836
(screaming)

786
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,707
Garrett!

787
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,675
I got him, I got him.

788
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,711
(screaming)

789
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:33,183
I need an ambulance!
Officer down!

790
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,386
Bridgit! Bridgit!

791
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,455
Come on, hurry!

792
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,057
Quick, follow me!

793
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,260
Where are we going?
Home.

794
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,928
(sirens approaching)

795
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,239
Thanks.

796
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,240
Any news?

797
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,308
Not yet.

798
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,877
But he's a tough kid,
I bet you he makes it.

799
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,912
Your buddy's here.

800
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,180
Can't stop pressing
the flesh.

801
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,482
Real publicity hound.

802
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,984
There's no cameras here.

803
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,826
BARNES:
Your attention, please.

804
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,594
GORDON:
Captain?

805
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,000
Luke Garrett...

806
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,869
passed away at 5:23 a.m.

807
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:26,803
Damn it.

808
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,004
MARTINEZ:
It ain't right.

809
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,040
(voice breaking):
Burned to death in an alley

810
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,775
by some weirdo.

811
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,610
He was gonna be
a great cop.

812
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:35,512
He was a great cop.

813
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,946
And we will mourn him.

814
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,549
But not now.

815
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,484
There is a cop killer
on the loose.

816
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,019
I cannot abide that.

817
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,354
We will find the person

818
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:47,223
who killed our brother, and
we will put a stop to them

819
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:50,527
using every legal method
at our disposal.

820
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,032
Excuse me.

821
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,343
Your fellow officer is dead,
I can see it in your face.

822
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,610
He is.

823
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,012
I'm sorry to hear it.

824
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,915
The bad guys in this
town are changing.

825
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,918
They're not playing
by the old rules.

826
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,187
Or any rules.

827
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,056
We need every method
at our disposal.

828
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,058
And I'm not just talking
about more guns.

829
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,595
You need to go
where you need to go,

830
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:29,399
press who you need the press and
have the city back your play.

831
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,201
Correct.

832
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:35,939
I don't know how bad
it's gonna get.

833
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,574
But if you can
give me your word...

834
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:40,610
we won't have
to face it alone...

835

A few pieces to arrange on
