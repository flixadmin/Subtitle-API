1
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
- No way!
- Yeah.

2
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
This is the Cuban spirit.

3
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,490
Dom. Dom.

4
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,976
You know I can't make a living
without my car.

5
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,558
Not my problem, bro.

6
00:02:57,513 --> 00:03:01,188
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.

7
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:02,909
Why you hookin' up my cousin's car?

8
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:07,590
He needed money, I gave it to him.
He can't pay, I take the car.

9
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:08,815
I just need a few more days.

10
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,580
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.

11
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,403
Come on. You make a deal,
you gotta live up to it.

12
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,166
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.

13
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:19,182
"Gonna" live up to it?

14
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,245
Oh, so you're one of those types.

15
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,753
You take everyone's ride,
and then ship it back to the States?

16
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:30,525
You watch your mouth.

17
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,074
Now you got a problem.

18
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,018
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

19
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:43,893
You want a car, get it the right way.

20
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,058
How?

21
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:46,757
Race for it.

22
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,031
I already own it, bro.

23
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,346
Not that car.

24
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,174
Mine.

25
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:58,120
Dom, his car is the fastest car
on the island.

26
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,151
Do you know what he has under that hood?

27
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,371
He knows it doesn't matter
what's under a hood.

28
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,330
The only thing that matters
is who's behind the wheel.

29
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,510
You think so?

30
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,954
I know so.

31
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:10,866
Then race his car.

32
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:15,627
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.

33
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,565
We race the Cuban mile.

34
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,078
Done.

35
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,773
I appreciate what you're trying to do,

36
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,531
but my car is the slowest car
on the island.

37
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,742
Was.

38
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:46,859
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...

39
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,461
If it ain't the motor, take it off.

40
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:51,503
Laughing gas?

41
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,820
Nah, Fed. This is Cuban NOS.

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,797
You guys are crazy.

43
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:58,851
What are you doing?

44
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,547
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.

45
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:05,976
Old trick that Buster used to play,
in case of emergencies.

46
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,969
You know that's way too much boost
for that engine.

47
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,214
It's gonna be fast.

48
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:11,719
It's gonna be a bomb.

49
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:14,453
Only needs to go a mile.

50
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,754
Vámonos!

51
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,912
That car belongs in the trash, bro!

52
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,656
Where are they going?

53
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,956
I don't know. Let's go!

54
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:46,243
Ghost him.

55
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,308
Sí.

56
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,558
Adiós, Toretto!

57
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,039
Okay, Buster.

58
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,253
Let's see if this works.

59
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,274
That's impossible.

60
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,555
Look out!

61
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:40,894
A deal's a deal.

62
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:43,706
You won my car.

63
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:47,273
And you earned my respect.

64
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,480
Keep your car.

65
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,456
Your respect is good enough for me.

66
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,074
Yo, cousin...

67
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,878
Sorry about your car.

68
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,448
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.

69
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,146
Your Impala? Are you serious?

70
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,942
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.

71
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,370
You make me happy.

72
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,175
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.

73
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,644
It's like it speaks to you.

74
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:32,370
You remember that guy,
the racer and his dad?

75
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,776
The one with the boat engine
under the hood?

76
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Yeah!

77
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:37,497
Yes. Of course.

78
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,434
I was looking at them, and I...

79
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:45,319
And I couldn't help but to imagine
what you'd be like if you were a dad.

80
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,752
No, no, no! I'm not pregnant.

81
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:55,402
Is that what you want?

82
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,691
It's not about what I want
or what you want.

83
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:01,953
It's about
why we haven't asked the question.

84
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,718
What?

85
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,019
You need a hand?

86
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,464
Yeah, I think I do.

87
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:36,300
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?

88
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:38,236
Probably the shut-off solenoid.

89
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:40,456
Let's see if we can get some power to it.

90
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,394
What brings you to Cuba?

91
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:48,308
The same thing
that brings everyone else to Cuba.

92
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,667
Culture, people, the beauty.

93
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,831
What brings you to Cuba?

94
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,043
Work.

95
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,722
Must be casual Friday.

96
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:00,050
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?

97
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,675
Your fuel relay is missing.

98
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:10,823
I know.

99
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,339
I love to play games.

100
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,099
I've beaten the best of 'em.

101
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:21,245
But I'm kind of in a rush,
so if you've got something to say to me...

102
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,777
Oh, this is a very different game,
that I can assure you.

103
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:29,222
This... There's something
much greater at work here.

104
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,191
This is fate.

105
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,433
I choose to make my own fate.

106
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,811
Not today.

107
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:38,608
Is this the road you take to
your apartment every morning?

108
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:41,769
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?

109
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:44,097
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your Cuban coffees?

110
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:46,431
What is it, black, no sugar?

111
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:48,698
Yeah.

112
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:51,287
I put a lot of work into
getting you here today.

113
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:53,948
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?

114
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:55,745
I want you to work for me.

115
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,296
Work for you?

116
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,854
Oh, I could've saved you
a lot of time, then.

117
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:02,917
See, I don't work for anyone.

118
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:05,339
You can't walk away from this, Dom.

119
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,027
We're gonna have this conversation,
one way or the other.

120
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:11,284
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.

121
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,189
It's cunning.

122
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:17,390
It can bring you beautiful things, and
it can also bring you moments like this.

123
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:33,777
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.

124
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,564
You're gonna betray your brothers,
abandon your code, and shatter your family.

125
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:43,230
You see, your team is about to go up
against the only thing they can't handle.

126
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,246
What's that?

127
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,447
You.

128
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,753
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

129
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:05,294
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they got.

130
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:07,612
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.

131
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:10,933
Neutralize their shooters,
and then move on to our objective.

132
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,386
There's two things
I want you to keep in mind.

133
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:15,845
Number one, I chose you for this squad

134
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,870
because you are
the most fearsome warriors on the planet.

135
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:24,709
And number two, you go out there,
you do your job, and you take 'em down.

136
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,081
Everyone. And I mean everyone.

137
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,902
Mani's and pedi's
at the mall later on today.

138
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Huh?

139
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:36,831
Monarchs!

140
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,761
I don't wanna play anymore.

141
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,159
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!

142
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,306
Final two minutes.

143
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,765
Quite the cheering section.

144
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:42,116
Oh, yeah.

145
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,612
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.

146
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,003
Except there seem to be
more moms than kids.

147
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,691
Way more moms.

148
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,675
Yeah. It's a big soccer town.

149
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,370
Let's go, girls!

150
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,158
So, your intel was spot-on.

151
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,987
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the Gulf?

152
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,685
Arms dealers from the Liberation
Front have it in Berlin.

153
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,658
Shit!

154
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,481
This thing can wipe out
an entire electrical grid in a major city.

155
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:09,258
No lights, no power. Instant Stone Age.

156
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,737
Chloe, Maya, you can't let
her run by you like that.

157
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:15,055
Let's go, let's go! Cross!
Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.

158
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,495
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?

159
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,269
Yes, I know exactly
what is at stake here, okay?

160
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,603
If the Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragons,

161
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,245
that means we lose the championship.

162
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:27,237
Which means I have 20 little girls who
are crying, and that's not a good thing.

163
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:30,060
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice-cream shops

164
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,073
and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.

165
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:33,667
Tay Tay?

166
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,019
Taylor Swift. Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?

167
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,136
Let's go, girls!

168
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,808
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.

169
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,550
All right, but I need to be clear here.

170
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,464
The US government cannot sanction
this operation in any way.

171
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:47,722
- You're on your own.
- Hey.

172
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:51,902
If this thing goes sideways, you don't just
get burned. You go to prison.

173
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,456
And there's nothing
we can do to get you out.

174
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:56,628
Let me tell you something.

175
00:18:57,016 --> 00:19:02,010
The only thing that I love more
than saving lives is my daughter.

176
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,120
So, if you don't shut up with
this government bullshit right now,

177
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,823
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons,

178
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,870
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up
and kick you right in the tay-tay.

179
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:17,913
Go Dragons!

180
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,179
Say it again.

181
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:21,735
Go Dragons!

182
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,671
Attaboy. Go Dragons.

183
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,187
Go Dragons.

184
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,668
She's open! Go, go!

185
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,230
Yes!

186
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,605
That is my daughter right there. Yes.

187
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:34,855
Yes, come here.

188
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,135
How did I do?

189
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Awesome.

190
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:38,185
Nice job, kid.

191
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,895
Daddy's gotta go to work?

192
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,347
Uh, yeah. Daddy's gotta go to work.

193
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,894
Now, you're gonna need
to get a team you can trust.

194
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,222
Oh, I already got one.

195
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:13,723
Hey, Dom.

196
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:14,748
Hey, Hobbs.

197
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:17,027
I got a job in Berlin
and I need a favor, brother.

198
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,775
No problem. I'll grab the team
and meet you in Berlin.

199
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:24,402
Thanks, man. I'll see you soon.

200
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,259
You were only supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

201
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:54,620
That was a diversion!

202
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,706
How many of the damn explosives
did you use?

203
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,851
I don't know, Tej. All of it?

204
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,808
Wait, all of it?

205
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,717
Roman, Jesus Christ.

206
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:03,605
We got more of your fan club ahead.

207
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,035
They're still on us!

208
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,169
These guys are taking this personal.

209
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,652
Roman, we just blew up their facility
and stole their EMP.

210
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,460
Other than your doctor's cold finger, I'd
say it's about as personal as it can get.

211
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,055
Phase Two!

212
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,719
Phase Two? So you just gonna
keep that to yourself?

213
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:27,498
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?

214
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,115
Yeah. Remember the airplane?

215
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,006
Everyone drove their cars out but you?

216
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,787
I told you, my engine seized up.

217
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,233
It's your balls that seized up.

218
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:35,608
Just follow my lead, okay?

219
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,358
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.

220
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:39,383
Huh?

221
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:40,975
Tej, drop it!

222
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:42,709
Bombs away.

223
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:45,559
Split, now!

224
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:50,950
Holy...

225
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:08,217
Great plan, Tej.

226
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,772
But just so you know, you missed some.

227
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,276
Oh, just wait for it.

228
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,019
Oh, shit!

229
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:30,059
I hate you, Tej!

230
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,379
Got your ass.

231
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,653
You good?

232
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:44,621
I'll see you when it's done.

233
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,824
All right, great job, team. Let's break off
and meet me at the safe house.

234
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,837
A hell of a job, brother.

235
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:09,898
When we get back to the base,
the beer's on me.

236
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,960
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?

237
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,278
Toretto, you put hands on that thing,

238
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:44,155
you're gonna have the whole world
gunning for you, including me.

239
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,913
I don't know what you're doing,
but you better think about this, Toretto.

240
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:54,671
It ain't too late to stop this.

241
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:08,362
It is now.

242
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:15,512
That sumbitch just crossed us.

243
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,495
What?

244
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:18,093
Wait a second, what are you talking about?

245
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:19,280
Dom took the EMP.

246
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,413
Bullshit.

247
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Where are you?

248
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,016
It's too late for me. Get outta here.

249
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,694
Saw that look in his eye,
and I've seen that look before.

250
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:30,598
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

251
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,775
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.

252
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:37,495
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

253
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
Burner phones, right?

254
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:39,783
Nah, scrambler.

255
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:43,073
Same number, but they got some sort of
micro-router to bury the signal path,

256
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:47,229
which means Dom is clearly communicating
with somebody that's above our pay grade.

257
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,311
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you,
but if we just look at the facts,

258
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:56,039
Dom's been having highly encrypted
conversations with some mysterious person.

259
00:25:57,714 --> 00:25:59,213
He took out Hobbs.

260
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,752
He stole an EMP. Now he's disappeared.

261
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,360
So, what are you saying?

262
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:06,736
Maybe we should consider
the fact that Hobbs is right.

263
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:08,502
Dom did go rogue.

264
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:11,135
Letty.

265
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,025
Before you judge the man,

266
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,197
remember, you're breathing right now
because he saved your life.

267
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:26,585
You just gonna let her
bump your shoulder like that?

268
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,783
I'm just saying,
that was a little aggressive.

269
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:34,268
What you gonna do, email her?

270
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:38,478
Check.

271
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:50,939
Moment, will you, fellas?

272
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:53,367
Thank you.

273
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:55,283
Well, this is an exciting new look.

274
00:26:55,308 --> 00:26:57,627
It's a little tight in the crotch,
as always.

275
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,275
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?

276
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,321
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.

277
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:05,299
All yours.

278
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,174
Mr. Nobody and I have been given
the authority to get you out of this.

279
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:11,354
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

280
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,606
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?

281
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,895
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

282
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,877
Treason, international espionage,
massive destruction of civic property.

283
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,885
You do that, we close the case.

284
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,686
And?

285
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,854
And the DSS blacklists you.
Germany loves that.

286
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,495
Officially, you will be a criminal.

287
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,360
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You need to
work on your delivery, all right?

288
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:32,738
Unofficially...

289
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,986
...you're off the books.
You come work with me.

290
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm not a criminal.

291
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:41,098
Luke, come on. Labels.

292
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,238
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.

293
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,580
I got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

294
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:50,135
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.

295
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,798
Well, there you have it.

296
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,604
Good luck in the courts, man.

297
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:58,073
What about your daughter?

298
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:04,393
You know, if you're not gonna do it for
your country, at least do it for your kid.

299
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,142
Big mistake, kid.

300
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:09,229
Hold on.

301
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,908
Luke, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.

302
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:14,025
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

303
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:16,635
Now, come on, give him a break.

304
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:18,551
Give me a break.

305
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:19,699
Luke.

306
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:23,689
Appreciate it.

307
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,549
It's good to see you, Nobody.

308
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:27,611
You, too.

309
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,924
Rule number one,

310
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,506
know your audience.

311
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:36,900
I gave you your shot. You shit the bed.

312
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,963
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

313
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:49,695
You're dead, cop. Dead!

314
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,109
I'm gonna slice
some bacon off your back, pig.

315
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,205
Well, well, well... Luke Hobbs
behind bars. Would you look at that.

316
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,265
The bent cop got his day.

317
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,976
You know, that color looks good on you.

318
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,577
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of
a lot better with your blood on it.

319
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:21,413
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.

320
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:23,515
Lawman gone bad, huh?

321
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:25,781
Such a cliché.

322
00:29:26,738 --> 00:29:28,484
Oh, well, welcome to the club.

323
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:30,850
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.

324
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,215
We ain't in no club,
we got nothing in common.

325
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,007
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.

326
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:36,554
What, you bring a shovel, did you?

327
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,406
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.

328
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:41,020
Or so I've been told.

329
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:44,890
Better get to digging.

330
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:47,202
Wanker.

331
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:51,017
Yeah.

332
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:09,659
Move.

333
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,773
Say that again.

334
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,538
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.

335
00:30:19,537 --> 00:30:21,023
I'm gonna enjoy this.

336
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,624
Welcome back, Dom.

337
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,281
Nice job out there.

338
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:27,327
You excited about tonight?

339
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,015
You're going on this?

340
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:36,375
You're with me, Dom.

341
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:47,874
Showing me your shoe collection?

342
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:48,899
Yep.

343
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:54,415
A pair for every occasion.

344
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,202
You have enough guns in here
to outfit a small army, huh?

345
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:59,671
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

346
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:06,015
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.

347
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,648
I mean, you're a man
who lives by his own rules.

348
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:11,437
Which is surprising,
because when I saw you in Cuba,

349
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:14,874
I heard about a guy who almost
killed you with a motorcycle,

350
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:17,765
and you let him keep his car?

351
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:19,843
Oh, that confused you?

352
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:21,299
Hmm.

353
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,804
'Course I could've taken his car.

354
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,139
But it's about something bigger.

355
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,148
This way...

356
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,086
I changed him.

357
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,851
That's not your responsibility.

358
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:35,601
- But it's who I am.
- Is it?

359
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:39,163
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?

360
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,253
Family.

361
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:42,359
No, it's not.

362
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:45,890
Not if you're being honest.

363
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,415
It's the 10 seconds
between start and finish,

364
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,640
when you're not thinking about anything.

365
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:55,557
No family, no obligations. Just you.

366
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,859
Being free.

367
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:04,255
I gotta tell you,

368
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,702
this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood
nonsense you've been doing recently?

369
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,288
It's bullshit. It's not you.

370
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:18,327
Be who you are.

371
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:23,788
Why live only a quarter mile at a time
when you can live your whole life that way?

372
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,312
Is that it?

373
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,421
Is that all those bloated-out muscles
will give ya?

374
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,353
All show and no go.

375
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,895
Oh, I got plenty of go.

376
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,956
You must've misplaced that

377
00:32:58,981 --> 00:33:01,320
when I kicked your arse up and down
that office of yours.

378
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,395
Yeah.

379
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:06,614
Just like you Brits,
rewriting history, huh?

380
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:10,094
All I know is, it wasn't me that was
thrown out of a four-story window.

381
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,052
Jumped.

382
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:14,192
I jumped out of a four-story window,
saving my partner's life.

383
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:18,097
'Cause where I'm from,
we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.

384
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,935
Well, that's funny,
because where I'm from,

385
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:22,239
we don't need women to run to our rescue.

386
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,731
I mean, do you really believe
you can stand in front of me...

387
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,208
...and beat me in a straight-up,
old-fashioned fist fight?

388
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:30,684
Let me tell you something.

389
00:33:30,962 --> 00:33:34,997
Me and you, one-on-one,
no one else around.

390
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:39,958
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.

391
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,403
Maybe one day we'll find out.

392
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:46,497
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.

393
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,747
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.

394
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,544
I'll get out my way.

395
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,880
The right way!

396
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,136
Hey! Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!

397
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,935
Relax. It's just a malfunction.

398
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,712
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

399
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:27,734
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

400
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,435
Hobbs!

401
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,799
I've been waiting a long time for this.

402
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,854
Keep waiting, bitch.

403
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,424
Rubber bullets. Big mistake.

404
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,932
Well, that took longer than I expected.

405
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:43,276
- Two questions.
- Yeah.

406
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,257
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

407
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:47,213
Toretto?

408
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,338
It's interesting you ask.

409
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:53,143
This is my new base. Welcome to nowhere.

410
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:55,369
It's a little sterile for you.

411
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:58,215
Listen, there's something
I wanna talk to you about after.

412
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,639
Hey, listen, guys. Thanks...

413
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:02,095
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? Handcuffs? What is this?

414
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,553
It's called abuse of power.

415
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:05,055
You told me to round them up.

416
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,315
I didn't tell you to hand...

417
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,020
Cut 'em loose.

418
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,760
Oh, man. This is embarrassing.

419
00:37:09,785 --> 00:37:11,298
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...

420
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:13,737
So, this is how you treat old friends?

421
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:17,315
Friends? We don't even really know
who the hell this guy is.

422
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:19,619
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

423
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,135
Nobody. So, then, who is he?

424
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,880
Him? He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.

425
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:25,897
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.

426
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:29,244
I've been in here for four hours,
and my ribs are showing.

427
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,698
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.

428
00:37:33,178 --> 00:37:34,791
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

429
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,408
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job,

430
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,927
you all made Interpol's
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

431
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:41,244
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.

432
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:42,895
That's all right.

433
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,905
Well, not you, Roman.

434
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,680
What do you mean?

435
00:37:45,705 --> 00:37:48,127
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

436
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:50,222
- I'm... I missed?
- Yeah.

437
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:51,963
That's impossible!

438
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:53,869
What number did they come in at?

439
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:58,198
Six, eight, nine, ten.

440
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,495
- She's 10?
- Mmm-hmm.

441
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,590
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.

442
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,333
Oh, she's definitely a 10.

443
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,433
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

444
00:38:09,562 --> 00:38:11,455
We're awaiting hard confirmation,

445
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,432
but I believe that's the cyber terrorist
known as Cipher.

446
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:19,522
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

447
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,855
Not according to our sources.

448
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,949
What does she want?

449
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:23,174
No one knows.

450
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,526
Cipher is like a digital act of God.

451
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,935
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

452
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,807
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

453
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:35,407
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

454
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:38,663
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

455
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:40,295
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.

456
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,392
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans
I've ever seen.

457
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:46,479
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

458
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,535
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...

459
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,189
Let's just say, people are scared of
the hacker group Anonymous.

460
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:55,880
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.

461
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,275
What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?

462
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,993
Probably nothing, Letty,
but I do find it interesting that,

463
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:04,871
apparently, for some reason,
she's now working with this guy.

464
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,989
He's already delivered
a fully operational EMP into her hands.

465
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:28,339
Detonate that, they can turn
any city in the world into a war zone.

466
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,074
So, then, what is it
you're suggesting we do?

467
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:32,395
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

468
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,730
Well, first, let's catch him,
and then figure out why he's turned.

469
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:38,816
So, y'all want us to track Dom.

470
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:41,105
Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

471
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,716
It's impossible.

472
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:47,105
Which is why I'm bringing in
an extra pair of hands.

473
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,935
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

474
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why

475
00:39:57,265 --> 00:40:01,790
you just put me in a room with this
tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?

476
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:06,236
What a big mouth on a small head,
coming from Prisoner 6-7-5-3.

477
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:08,397
Don't think we've forgotten everything
that you've done.

478
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:10,856
We are not teaming up with this guy.

479
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:13,441
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

480
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:17,224
I don't care about you, your crew,
or your little family.

481
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:18,815
I'm here for Cipher.

482
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,896
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?

483
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,902
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

484
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:25,425
You should get a bigger size.

485
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,364
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

486
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,098
When I said no, she went after my brother.

487
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,359
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

488
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:40,114
Former hell-raiser and current guest
at a nasty little black site prison.

489
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,321
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.

490
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:45,224
So, if I get a shot to take her down,
believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.

491
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,449
You're taking my boot right up your ass,
is what you're taking.

492
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:49,949
Guys, guys. The fastest way to
find Cipher is through Toretto.

493
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:52,495
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

494
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,964
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

495
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,878
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

496
00:40:57,903 --> 00:41:01,089
So, like it or not,
you two are gonna work together.

497
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,167
You got that?

498
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:07,316
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

499
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,074
Am I the only one seeing this?

500
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:12,144
Oh, this ought to be good.

501
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:16,389
Use God's Eye.

502
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,575
We put our lives on the line,

503
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,433
running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

504
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,027
It can find anybody, right?

505
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:25,183
Let's use it to find Dom.

506
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:28,355
Roman, that is a great idea.

507
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:31,722
Did you hear that? "Great idea."

508
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,519
No, no, no, don't tune it out. Huh?

509
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,837
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?

510
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:48,800
Got him. He's in London.

511
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,041
Yeah.

512
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:58,168
Wait. We've got a second match
in Hong Kong.

513
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:00,847
Beijing and Seoul.

514
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,269
And Tokyo.

515
00:42:04,004 --> 00:42:06,941
And just about every other major city
on the planet.

516
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:10,615
And so, God's Eye was where we started.

517
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,471
But Cipher's already created an evasion

518
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:16,569
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

519
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,363
but it was a good thought, Roman.

520
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,284
So, she's made my program obsolete.

521
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:23,698
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.

522
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:26,701
See, simple solutions aren't
gonna cut it here, slick.

523
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:30,574
Why you look at me when you say that?

524
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:33,933
Wait a second. Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.

525
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:37,394
You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

526
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:39,615
means they have to be using a FLEA relay.

527
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Watch these two.

528
00:42:40,665 --> 00:42:42,735
Which means
it has a decaying sync randomizer.

529
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,135
Which we can reverse...

530
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,292
And track it back to the originating source
and find Dom's true location.

531
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:50,949
I'm telling you, they got skills.

532
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,402
That was my idea.

533
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,575
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?

534
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,277
All right, let's try this.

535
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:08,147
It's working.

536
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:11,462
Time you wanna check your manual and
start organizing a force response.

537
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:13,855
Let's get a hold of
our international assets...

538
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,313
He's still green.

539
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:17,169
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.

540
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,868
As soon as we have Toretto's location,
I want to mobilize.

541
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:24,900
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.

542
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,462
No one respects you...

543
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,321
- Cover.
- Get away from me.

544
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:30,641
All right, they're not in China.

545
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
Or Russia.

546
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,477
Europe's clear.

547
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:38,774
But this one's not going away.

548
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:41,735
This is interesting.

549
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:44,226
Why?

550
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,352
Because that's here.

551
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:29,243
Did you all enjoy that?

552
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:33,773
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.

553
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,074
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.

554
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,752
Probably.

555
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,870
Hello, Deckard. Nice to see you again.

556
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:47,519
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.

557
00:44:47,544 --> 00:44:49,819
Your family's already replacing you.

558
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:53,792
You chose the losing team.

559
00:44:54,702 --> 00:44:57,425
I guess your brother is smarter than you.

560
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,126
Smart move, embedding God's Eye
into the mainframe.

561
00:45:34,425 --> 00:45:37,767
Irritating to make me have to come
all the way down here to get it, but...

562
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:42,428
Let's go.

563
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,295
Dom!

564
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,811
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?

565
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:39,747
Let's go.

566
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:14,387
You okay?

567
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:18,973
That wasn't him.

568
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,793
I don't know what she's got on him,

569
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:27,426
but that wasn't Dom.

570
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,479
Brian would know what to do.

571
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:31,637
No!

572
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:39,999
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.

573
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,360
I know.

574
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:56,279
Back there, was that for her, for me,
or you?

575
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:59,629
And was it even necessary?

576
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,066
Necessary?

577
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:06,435
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.

578
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,824
And I simply made one. But so did you.

579
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:11,455
You could've stopped me,
but you chose not to.

580
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,630
I wonder what Letty thought about that.

581
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,153
The problem with putting your foot on
a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.

582
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,605
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

583
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,915
Elena.

584
00:49:00,156 --> 00:49:01,225
Dom?

585
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,733
I'm sorry.

586
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,991
You shouldn't have come.

587
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,870
Nothing could have kept me away.

588
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:18,522
Now she has the three of us.

589
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,858
Do you wanna see him?

590
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:32,536
See Papa?

591
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,389
See Papa.

592
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,514
Papa.

593
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:56,090
When I realized I was pregnant,
you had just found out Letty was alive.

594
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,848
So I decided when Letty and you
got back from your honeymoon,

595
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,917
I was going to tell you.

596
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,926
But then she took us
before I had the chance.

597
00:50:13,455 --> 00:50:14,604
His name?

598
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,078
I call him Marcos.

599
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,528
But that's his middle name.

600
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,903
I thought his father should give him
his first name.

601
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:38,142
I'm sorry, Dom.

602
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,564
There's nothing to be sorry for.

603
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,884
Whatever happens,

604
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,509
just save our son.

605
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:54,626
Your son.

606
00:51:15,912 --> 00:51:17,345
Good visit?

607
00:51:19,984 --> 00:51:22,408
I know. I know what you're thinking.

608
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:28,408
I just let the guards go,
so there's only two opponents in the room.

609
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,517
Rhodes has the gun,
so you'll take him out first.

610
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:32,657
I know you.

611
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,353
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.

612
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:39,575
Maybe the two of you
can fight your way out of here.

613
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,923
So much to think about.

614
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:49,759
Let me make it easier for you.

615
00:51:56,043 --> 00:51:57,978
Do with it as you wish.

616
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,564
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?

617
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:13,133
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two
you really need to concern yourself with.

618
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,836
One, the only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

619
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:22,415
And, two, the only thing we can truly
give another person is information.

620
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,351
So, let me give you some.

621
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,126
You see these cameras in here?

622
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:30,033
The moment you make a move,

623
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:33,780
highly-paid men with weapons
will make their way into this room

624
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:36,400
with one very specific instruction.

625
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,056
It's not to save me.

626
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,391
It's to kill your son.

627
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,630
Now, that's a lot of bullets,

628
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:48,639
and it only takes one for you
to lose everything.

629
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:55,048
So, I have to ask you, because
I know family is so important to you.

630
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,611
Is that really a choice you want to make?

631
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,036
Because I'm ready if you are.

632
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,877
If I pull this trigger,
and God knows I want to,

633
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,631
if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.

634
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,473
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.

635
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:30,030
Since I'm alone, I got no choice!

636
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:40,957
I didn't think so.

637
00:54:11,822 --> 00:54:14,131
You want to see the old Dom?

638
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:17,689
Watch.

639
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,194
Bitch.

640
00:54:29,824 --> 00:54:31,624
- Don't, don't.
- Sweet dreams.

641
00:54:31,649 --> 00:54:32,772
Please!

642
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,835
Damn it.

643
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,835
She wiped it all. Took God's Eye.

644
00:54:41,364 --> 00:54:44,037
That was the one thing
we could use to find them.

645
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,679
We lost everything.

646
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,233
What do you got, Princess?

647
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,958
Finding Toretto.

648
00:54:52,432 --> 00:54:54,353
But I got a couple of minutes to spare,

649
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:57,343
if you want me to send you
to the hospital. Again.

650
00:54:58,015 --> 00:54:59,455
Yo, Rules.

651
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,375
First off, that's not my name.

652
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,378
Little Nobody.

653
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:04,483
- Don't call me that.
- Oh, that's definitely sticking.

654
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,819
Great. Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty
over there that we're gonna find Toretto.

655
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:09,655
We find Toretto together as a team.

656
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,858
And when this is all over with,

657
00:55:10,883 --> 00:55:13,309
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit
right off his face.

658
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:15,810
Wait a minute, guys,
I think Deckard's actually onto something.

659
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:19,470
How do you think Dom and Cipher
got into the country without us knowing?

660
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:21,476
Ghost flights.

661
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:24,334
I thought untraceable aircraft was
all Internet conspiracy stuff.

662
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:25,585
It's not.

663
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:31,630
Satellites and radar grids
all across the globe shift like an ocean.

664
00:55:31,655 --> 00:55:33,771
They've got channels that open and close.

665
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:37,421
And theoretically, if you know the right
people who know the right patterns...

666
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,396
You can fly right through the blind spots
completely undetected.

667
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,438
So you know where Dom is headed?

668
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,257
Yeah. New York.

669
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,869
You see there, Luke?

670
00:55:49,894 --> 00:55:52,226
You guys are gonna get along just great.

671
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:56,005
Which proves rule number two,
you never lose everything.

672
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,491
Fire up the chopper.

673
00:55:57,516 --> 00:55:59,984
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.

674
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,335
And why are we traveling like this again?

675
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,912
Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.

676
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,799
But like this?

677
00:56:34,986 --> 00:56:36,135
Look here, man.

678
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,895
Before I throw up in my mouth,
let me ask you, what are we doing here?

679
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,577
That's a good question, Roman.

680
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,028
Let me show you.

681
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,154
Welcome to our new base of operations.

682
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,437
No, seriously. What is this place?

683
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:57,015
This is heaven.

684
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:06,056
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.

685
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,510
This is where we house every vehicle
seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.

686
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:21,756
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're
gonna have a chance at catching Dom,

687
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,350
we're gonna have to be damn fast.

688
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:28,129
Figured this would help.

689
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,799
We got a tank.

690
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:39,215
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter,
V8 Duramax engine

691
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,421
with an M153 CROWS remotely
operated weapon station on top.

692
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:45,801
You didn't get this from drug dealers.

693
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:49,511
No. No, that, uh,
the United States Army lent me.

694
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:51,255
See, the Army's developing
machines like this

695
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,708
that soldiers can drive from a mile away,
so they can stay safe and alive.

696
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:58,695
But, luckily,
there's a backup driver's seat

697
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,235
for those of us that like to
get more "hands on".

698
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,296
I'm sitting here
wondering this whole time,

699
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,038
will this thing fit in valet
at Cheesecake Factory?

700
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,935
No one is getting "hands on".

701
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,905
She doesn't go on city streets.

702
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:18,312
Wow. I'm in love.

703
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,935
Again, no, no.

704
00:58:23,018 --> 00:58:26,638
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.

705
00:58:26,663 --> 00:58:30,335
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.

706
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,912
It's neon orange. The International
Space Station would see it coming.

707
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:37,655
Go choose anything less conspicuous.

708
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,352
No, no, no. Calipers are my...

709
00:58:39,377 --> 00:58:40,693
- This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.

710
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:42,595
Hey, my man, you can put that
down right there.

711
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,054
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.

712
00:58:46,874 --> 00:58:48,415
I like your beard.

713
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,192
You're Blanta. Black Santa?

714
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,421
No, I'm serious. Put it down right there.

715
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,055
What are you doing?

716
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,389
Engine's misfiring. I gotta check it out.

717
00:59:25,414 --> 00:59:27,335
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.

718
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,343
Clearly. But unless you want
the engine to seize on the job...

719
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,929
You have five minutes.

720
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,210
Five minutes.

721
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,624
I want another visual.

722
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,908
I got an ATM.

723
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,187
I don't like this.

724
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,575
I want to see Toretto.

725
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,571
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something!

726
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:30,951
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.

727
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,553
Do you know who I am?

728
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:44,062
It's why I'm here.

729
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,950
Do you know what I'm capable of?

730
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,313
It's why I'm here.

731
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:55,920
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.

732
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:59,780
I've got limited time,
so I won't take up too much of yours.

733
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,548
Oh, no.

734
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:05,466
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto.

735
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:07,672
What more could you possibly want?

736
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:10,362
To give you something back.

737
01:01:19,932 --> 01:01:21,047
Talk to me.

738
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,078
Something's not right here.

739
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,751
First time I saw my son
was behind a bulletproof glass.

740
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,515
When he reached for me,
I couldn't hold him.

741
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,979
It's the worst pain I ever felt.

742
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,039
I know you know exactly how that feels.

743
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,116
Maybe we could change that.

744
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,208
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest
something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?

745
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,339
It's why I'm here.

746
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,179
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this. Something's not right.

747
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,361
Rhodes, you close?

748
01:02:09,385 --> 01:02:10,630
Yeah.

749
01:02:11,015 --> 01:02:12,015
Go.

750
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,712
The delivery truck's moving.

751
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,964
I know.

752
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,353
"Captain Deckard Shaw...

753
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:51,407
"distinguished himself by acts of gallantry

754
01:02:51,432 --> 01:02:54,357
at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

755
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:59,215
"His bold actions saved the lives
of hostages and his teammates.

756
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,324
"Recommendation: Victoria Cross."

757
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,433
Highest honor the British
government has ever given...

758
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,372
...to a traitor.

759
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,816
Something about this whole thing
that just doesn't add up to me.

760
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,975
Well, that would be
the same kind of funny math

761
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,370
that says a DSS agent who has
a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

762
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,436
Sound familiar, huh?

763
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:29,878
You want to give me a hand?

764
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:34,135
- On three?
- Yeah.

765
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,559
One, two, three.

766
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:40,737
You know what, Twinkle Toes?

767
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,542
In another life, I bet me and you
could've done some serious damage.

768
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,919
- Yeah, we could've.
- Yeah.

769
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,789
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head
off the fender when this is all over.

770
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,255
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain,

771
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,600
when this whole thing is over,
we're gonna find a location,

772
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,721
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat,

773
01:03:59,746 --> 01:04:02,823
you're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up your ass to brush them.

774
01:04:09,635 --> 01:04:10,994
Give me God's Eye.

775
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:13,003
God's Eye, active.

776
01:04:13,028 --> 01:04:14,143
Good.

777
01:04:15,066 --> 01:04:16,776
Let's find us a Russian.

778
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:19,684
I spy with my little eye,

779
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:22,128
a Minister of Defense.

780
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:50,615
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.

781
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,755
Copy that.

782
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,547
He's in the third car.

783
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:19,517
It's a Guard Class limousine.

784
01:05:34,145 --> 01:05:35,375
Where's my team?

785
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,371
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of them yet.

786
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:40,934
They're off the grid. They're probably
just bunkered down somewhere.

787
01:05:40,959 --> 01:05:42,458
We're closing in on 'em.

788
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,275
You guys ready?

789
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,083
One thing I can guarantee, Dom,

790
01:05:47,562 --> 01:05:49,404
no one's ready for this.

791
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:52,865
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit
in a two-mile radius

792
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,495
around that motorcade now.

793
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,966
There's over a thousand of them.

794
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Hack 'em all.

795
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,065
It's zombie time.

796
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,632
I'd buckle up if I were you.

797
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,960
What are you doing?

798
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,336
Safety sensors overridden.

799
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,429
Thank you.

800
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:29,433
Hey!

801
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,844
Target the motorcade.

802
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,141
And here they come.

803
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Ouch.

804
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:10,648
Police escort down.

805
01:08:10,673 --> 01:08:12,381
Take out the lead and follow cars.

806
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:40,737
Two more down.

807
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:42,011
They're still under warranty.

808
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:11,594
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!

809
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:15,148
I don't care if you send the goddamn
Boy Scouts, just send 'em some help!

810
01:09:15,173 --> 01:09:16,550
Now, that's Dom.

811
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,896
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.

812
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,512
Perfect. Make it rain.

813
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,589
Target immobilized.

814
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,035
You're up, Dom.

815
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,856
Give me the case.

816
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:37,568
Good work, Dom.

817
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,675
Meet you at the pickup.

818
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,092
I think I know where my team's at.

819
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,112
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

820
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,156
This is on you.

821
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,273
Get out of there, Dom.

822
01:13:10,465 --> 01:13:12,385
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

823
01:13:12,498 --> 01:13:15,297
Police scanners are saying
he stole a nuclear football.

824
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,125
It's over, Toretto.

825
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,799
Get your ass outta the car now.

826
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,703
So, that's how you wanna play this?

827
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,628
Let's play.

828
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:40,304
Don't do this, Dom.

829
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,749
He's going for it!

830
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,054
- What are you doing?
- It's a trap!

831
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,755
Damn it!

832
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,873
Now I know what it feels like
to be every cop ever chasing us!

833
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:16,754
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.

834
01:14:16,779 --> 01:14:18,576
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?

835
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:21,593
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

836
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,275
I'm on him.

837
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,758
Easy. Work together.

838
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,560
Wait, wait, wait!

839
01:14:49,368 --> 01:14:50,517
Oh, sh...

840
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,513
I'll take the shortcut!

841
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,711
Look out! Watch those people!

842
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,033
Big Sexy comin' through!

843
01:15:45,732 --> 01:15:46,994
Not this time, Dom.

844
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,151
Watch the drag or the line will snap!

845
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,032
Stretch him out! Hold him!

846
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,860
He's gotta have about 2,000 horsepower
in that thing.

847
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:20,120
Try 3,000!

848
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,509
Try five.

849
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,915
Get out of there.

850
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,115
I'm working on it.

851
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,017
Stop working on it and do it.

852
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,277
No, no, no, this my Bentley!

853
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,638
No! No!

854
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,191
Get that case and run.

855
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,754
Move.

856
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,917
They thought
this was gonna be a street fight.

857
01:18:56,089 --> 01:18:57,520
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

858
01:19:00,306 --> 01:19:01,455
No!

859
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,429
Letty, stop!

860
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,626
What are you gonna do?

861
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,826
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

862
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,373
You love me.

863
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,791
And you are not gonna shoot me.

864
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,670
You should've given him the case,
'cause I won't chase you.

865
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,060
Okay.

866
01:20:06,809 --> 01:20:08,824
I will just take it from a dead girl.

867
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,233
You willing to die for it?

868
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,831
Let's go, then.

869
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,511
Anything?

870
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:56,644
They're gone.

871
01:20:57,938 --> 01:21:00,008
And DOD confirmed
it was a nuclear football.

872
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,292
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.

873
01:21:04,337 --> 01:21:07,852
I don't know what it is,
but they're building towards something.

874
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:09,380
Deckard?

875
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,240
He didn't make it.

876
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:35,634
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

877
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:39,483
When push came to shove, you were gonna
let Letty just walk away with the codes.

878
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:40,735
You got the codes!

879
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,425
Rhodes got the codes.

880
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,433
You made the choice to let her go.

881
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:49,199
And now I have to make one of my own.

882
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:04,980
They are adorable little things,
aren't they?

883
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,722
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

884
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,183
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

885
01:22:16,058 --> 01:22:17,496
Don't do this.

886
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:19,167
This is your doing.

887
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:20,360
My doing?

888
01:22:30,035 --> 01:22:31,975
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.

889
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,355
I don't want you to beg.

890
01:22:36,809 --> 01:22:38,535
I want you to learn.

891
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,160
Learn what?

892
01:22:41,273 --> 01:22:45,246
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.

893
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:53,550
But it was the wrong choice.

894
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:56,813
This is the consequence of that.

895
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,640
No!

896
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,552
No! No!

897
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,206
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

898
01:23:04,265 --> 01:23:05,800
- Save your son!
- No.

899
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,404
No!

900
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,206
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

901
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,869
Traffic cams.

902
01:23:38,925 --> 01:23:40,040
I got you.

903
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,699
I knew it.

904
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,535
I recognize that guy.

905
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,699
That's Connor Rhodes.

906
01:23:50,003 --> 01:23:52,636
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

907
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:55,081
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

908
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,674
Connor Rhodes.

909
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:59,975
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

910
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,479
It's Mose Jakande.

911
01:24:02,089 --> 01:24:04,215
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.

912
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,042
Which means that's twice that
Dom has messed up Cipher's business.

913
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,581
Everything you're feeling right now,
this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.

914
01:24:26,781 --> 01:24:30,615
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

915
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,313
to ensure continuation of the species.

916
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:38,055
When early man would
visit a watering hole,

917
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:42,589
if they didn't watch their child,
and it got snatched by a crocodile,

918
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,550
our brains would create a painful
but instructional memory,

919
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:52,777
so it would never happen again.

920
01:24:54,960 --> 01:25:00,128
This idea of "family" that is so core
with you, that rules your world,

921
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,738
it's a biological lie.

922
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,214
You don't have to accept it.

923
01:25:09,496 --> 01:25:10,597
I don't.

924
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:18,480
Did you really think you could destroy
two of my teams without any repercussions?

925
01:25:19,427 --> 01:25:22,628
I wouldn't have even looked your way
if you hadn't done that.

926
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,105
You didn't even know you had a kid.

927
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,915
You can thank me for that and
start doing the job I'm asking you to do.

928
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,655
Help you start a war.

929
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,511
Is that what you think I want?

930
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,605
That's so limited.

931
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:41,121
I didn't take that football to start a war

932
01:25:41,153 --> 01:25:43,872
any more than I took your son
to start a family.

933
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,824
Taking your son got me the codes.

934
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:51,860
The codes will get me the nukes
and the nukes will get me what I want

935
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,396
today, tomorrow, and every day after that.

936
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,925
And what's that?

937
01:26:00,177 --> 01:26:01,542
Accountability.

938
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,155
The second I fire off one of those nukes,

939
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:11,233
I put the superpowers of this world
on notice that, when they cross the line,

940
01:26:13,697 --> 01:26:16,417
I'm gonna be there
to hold them responsible.

941
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:22,238
Because the truth is, Dom,
to the world out there,

942
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,800
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.

943
01:26:34,144 --> 01:26:36,074
We've got one last job to do.

944
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,108
Cipher.

945
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,212
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.

946
01:26:53,825 --> 01:26:57,534
Because whether you value it or not,
all of this,

947
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:04,931
your plane, your security, and you,
are still on this earth because of him.

948
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,400
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher
is there's nothing to trace.

949
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,015
But now, we have Rhodes' information.

950
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,478
And we're getting snapshots of his data
before it's scrubbed off the net.

951
01:27:18,503 --> 01:27:21,434
That looks like somebody's bank account,
so why don't we just go ahead...

952
01:27:21,459 --> 01:27:22,743
It's a longitude.

953
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:26,864
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian
motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.

954
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:28,329
Go ahead and bring up the map.

955
01:27:29,264 --> 01:27:31,360
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

956
01:27:31,773 --> 01:27:34,579
Yalta, Poltava...

957
01:27:34,657 --> 01:27:36,495
It's like they just threw letters together.

958
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:37,615
Kronyurt.

959
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,834
It's Vladovin.

960
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:40,036
What are you doing here?

961
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:40,797
What?

962
01:27:40,806 --> 01:27:43,720
Told you I was gonna check in on you from
time to time to see how you were doin'.

963
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,407
By the way, not so hot.

964
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,394
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.

965
01:27:48,419 --> 01:27:51,897
That's funny. Could've sworn
there was a secret Russian naval base

966
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,895
where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.

967
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,376
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

968
01:27:56,818 --> 01:28:00,274
The base was taken over by a terror group
of military separatists about a month ago,

969
01:28:00,299 --> 01:28:01,979
and the Russians haven't taken it back yet,

970
01:28:02,004 --> 01:28:04,493
so there is a little window
of opportunity here.

971
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,931
Russian submarines. Nuclear football.

972
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,375
It sounds like everything we do,
our legs gonna be blown off.

973
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,676
It sounds like
you still number 11 on the list.

974
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:18,335
It sounds like you've changed since your
little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.

975
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:21,813
Guys, guys. Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

976
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,428
That's good thinking, champ,

977
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:26,932
except unfortunately,
the Russian Minister of Defense

978
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:29,410
got himself involved in
a little incident on US territory,

979
01:28:29,435 --> 01:28:31,911
and the two governments
aren't talking to each other for a while.

980
01:28:31,936 --> 01:28:33,695
By the time they do, it'll be too late.

981
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,517
So, any other suggestions?

982
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:38,365
Yeah. I got one.

983
01:28:39,241 --> 01:28:41,072
How about we just stop them ourselves?

984
01:28:41,097 --> 01:28:43,032
You're talking about
a Russian military base.

985
01:28:43,057 --> 01:28:44,313
Separatist.

986
01:28:44,338 --> 01:28:45,535
Whatever. It's suicide.

987
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,181
It's stopping World War III.

988
01:28:49,035 --> 01:28:50,313
What's it gonna be, rook?

989
01:28:50,744 --> 01:28:52,899
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?

990
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,110
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come
knocking on your mama's front door?

991
01:28:56,625 --> 01:29:01,594
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man,
and save the entire goddamn world?

992
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,274
You know, I think I figured it out.

993
01:29:10,299 --> 01:29:11,414
What's that?

994
01:29:11,538 --> 01:29:13,501
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

995
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,235
There are no rules.

996
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:21,735
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

997
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,376
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

998
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,960
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

999
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:27,751
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?

1000
01:29:27,776 --> 01:29:29,095
Do svidanya!

1001
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:57,009
Letty, I don't like telling you
this one bit.

1002
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,868
But the game's changed.

1003
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,375
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom,
but now, after all this,

1004
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,152
I want you to know, if I have to,

1005
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,923
I'm gonna put him down.

1006
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,626
Then you might have to take us both down.

1007
01:30:13,066 --> 01:30:14,340
I'm freezing, man.

1008
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:19,194
This ain't for me. I come from
a different kind of lifestyle, brah.

1009
01:30:21,313 --> 01:30:24,783
Ladies know me. They know
where I'm at with it.

1010
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,999
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1011
01:30:30,354 --> 01:30:32,584
Man, that's entirely too much information.

1012
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,055
I'm just sayin'.

1013
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,752
Well, one thing's for sure.

1014
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,148
Dom's gotta be either working with them
or making a trade,

1015
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:42,352
because no one would be this insane
to hit this place without a damn army.

1016
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,670
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1017
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:48,354
Speak of the devil.

1018
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:59,855
All right, Dom, you're one step closer
to that family reunion.

1019
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,173
400 meters to base.

1020
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,555
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.

1021
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:43,852
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.

1022
01:31:59,937 --> 01:32:01,052
EMP is recharging.

1023
01:32:01,076 --> 01:32:03,102
- How long?
- Sixty seconds.

1024
01:32:03,889 --> 01:32:06,696
All right, Dom, you have one pulse left
in that EMP.

1025
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,540
That sub is heavily insulated.

1026
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:11,205
You're gonna need to be
right underneath it for this thing to work.

1027
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,649
Come on.

1028
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:57,135
Yes! Two birds with one stone.

1029
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,536
We've got control of the sub.

1030
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,233
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

1031
01:33:01,258 --> 01:33:04,330
Okay, Matty,
let's take this baby for a spin.

1032
01:33:09,955 --> 01:33:11,104
Damn!

1033
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:14,295
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub
to slave its command system.

1034
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,935
What the hell is he talking about?

1035
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,532
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

1036
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,829
We can't let it get away.

1037
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,938
There's the control room.

1038
01:33:25,227 --> 01:33:27,295
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,

1039
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,276
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

1040
01:33:29,301 --> 01:33:31,009
Keep it from lowering into the water.

1041
01:33:31,034 --> 01:33:33,175
No, what we need to do
is get me on that sub.

1042
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,256
I find the weapons room
and I can pull the launch chip

1043
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,855
before she can fire any of those nukes.

1044
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,949
That is too crazy.

1045
01:33:37,974 --> 01:33:39,456
What you're saying is too dangerous.

1046
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,571
We'll do both.

1047
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,920
Knock, knock.

1048
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:13,455
Five vehicles just breached the base.

1049
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,220
They just don't give up, do they?

1050
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,852
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!

1051
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,833
Letty, let's roll!

1052
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,633
Go! Go, go, go!

1053
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:17,175
Change of plans, Dom.

1054
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,400
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.

1055
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,193
I'm done. I want my son.

1056
01:35:21,218 --> 01:35:22,571
I'll tell you when you're done.

1057
01:35:22,712 --> 01:35:24,198
Your team is in play.

1058
01:35:24,223 --> 01:35:26,578
Now, meet Rhodes and
follow my instruction.

1059
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,672
I've got you covered! Go!

1060
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,154
Move, move! Get outta here! Go, go, go!

1061
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,212
Okay. How do you like this?

1062
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:53,673
Remote link has been severed.

1063
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,033
I'll take care of this.

1064
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,376
Hi, Ramsey.

1065
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,575
She's regained control.

1066
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,946
Damn it. She's good.

1067
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:49,536
They're entering the weapons room.

1068
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,837
Oh, that's cute.

1069
01:36:57,469 --> 01:36:58,680
Pull! Pull!

1070
01:36:58,705 --> 01:37:01,060
Roman, Roman! We gotta find the chip, go!

1071
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,055
Oh, she's slick.

1072
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,837
Gonna have to do better than that, though.

1073
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,805
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.

1074
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,079
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?

1075
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,397
You're smart, but not smart enough.

1076
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:37,180
She's locked me out.

1077
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,354
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

1078
01:37:43,379 --> 01:37:45,615
I can't! 
This thing's gone into attack mode!

1079
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,899
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip!

1080
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,719
Tej, we got no idea 
what the hell we're looking for.

1081
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,172
I got it!

1082
01:37:57,118 --> 01:37:59,563
What in the hell are you guys doin'?

1083
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,535
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, okay?

1084
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,301
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go".

1085
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,279
Guidance Go, Guidance Go...

1086
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:06,296
Okay, I got somethin'.

1087
01:38:06,303 --> 01:38:07,702
- What? 
- It says...

1088
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,008
Do you understand that?

1089
01:38:39,881 --> 01:38:41,407
Wow. Nasty.

1090
01:38:52,899 --> 01:38:56,422
Hmm. Quite a show.

1091
01:38:59,502 --> 01:39:00,688
We're arming the nuke.

1092
01:39:05,997 --> 01:39:08,335
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!

1093
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,516
Roger that. We're moving out.
Disable the nukes!

1094
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,396
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.

1095
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:14,059
I don't see shit. I'm holding on!

1096
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,266
And we have a countdown.

1097
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,518
What the hell is goin' on, man?

1098
01:39:22,543 --> 01:39:25,615
We're about to launch a nuclear missile,
is what the hell is goin' on!

1099
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,977
Pull the damn chip!

1100
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,469
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!

1101
01:39:32,494 --> 01:39:33,655
What countdown?

1102
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:37,071
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.

1103
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:38,579
The countdown...

1104
01:39:38,825 --> 01:39:41,087
Let's show the world what we've got.

1105
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,157
No, no, no! Don't press that!

1106
01:39:46,759 --> 01:39:47,758
I got it.

1107
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,633
Something's wrong. It won't launch.

1108
01:39:52,948 --> 01:39:55,587
Get that sub outta there. Now!

1109
01:39:58,028 --> 01:39:59,586
Move your ass, Roman!

1110
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,855
You all right?

1111
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,600
There's nothing all right 
about any of this!

1112
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,723
Let's go!

1113
01:40:11,747 --> 01:40:13,016
What about the missiles?

1114
01:40:14,056 --> 01:40:16,047
We got the chip. No nukes for her.

1115
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:17,379
Hell, yeah.

1116
01:40:17,404 --> 01:40:18,438
Let's roll.

1117
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,993
Guys, we got company. A lot of company!

1118
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:31,175
All right, team, here's the plan.

1119
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,196
There's a sea lock
at the opening of the bay.

1120
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:34,585
We get there first and close it,

1121
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:38,969
we can stop the submarine from escaping
into open water and disappearing forever.

1122
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,439
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.

1123
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:46,290
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

1124
01:40:53,637 --> 01:40:56,204
No, no, no! This is not good!

1125
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,485
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?

1126
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,024
You lovin' that Lambo now?

1127
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:15,766
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.

1128
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:18,537
Right now, I want that sub in deep water 
where no one can find it.

1129
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,316
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.

1130
01:41:20,341 --> 01:41:21,438
Copy that.

1131
01:41:30,873 --> 01:41:32,415
Why are they shootin' at me?

1132
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,733
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange
Lamborghini, I don't know.

1133
01:41:34,758 --> 01:41:36,555
Shut up, Tej!

1134
01:41:41,793 --> 01:41:45,149
Dom... Do you really wanna 
put that car in gear?

1135
01:41:46,844 --> 01:41:47,935
Do it.

1136
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:48,960
Huh?

1137
01:41:51,586 --> 01:41:53,175
I didn't think so.

1138
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,899
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.

1139
01:41:55,924 --> 01:41:58,829
I should have taken care of this 
a long time ago.

1140
01:41:58,854 --> 01:42:01,727
Rhodes, take his team out.

1141
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,524
I'm on it.

1142
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,493
Roman, get in front of me!

1143
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,918
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?

1144
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,946
Now it's my turn.

1145
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:36,993
Yeah, baby!

1146
01:42:46,095 --> 01:42:48,370
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.

1147
01:42:50,443 --> 01:42:51,913
They're gonna flank us!

1148
01:42:56,123 --> 01:42:57,201
No, they ain't!

1149
01:43:03,165 --> 01:43:04,393
Oh, shit!

1150
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:19,775
Tej!

1151
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,701
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!

1152
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,150
I don't wanna go swimmin'! No!

1153
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:35,574
Really, Tej?

1154
01:43:38,842 --> 01:43:40,313
Oh, no, no, no!

1155
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,569
Oh, shit!

1156
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,681
Roman, grab your door!

1157
01:43:49,706 --> 01:43:50,775
Tej!

1158
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:52,175
Grab the door, Roman!

1159
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,561
- It's so cold! 
- Shit.

1160
01:43:53,586 --> 01:43:54,865
Oh, shit!

1161
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,459
- Whoo! 
- Yeah!

1162
01:44:05,217 --> 01:44:06,855
What is going on?

1163
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,076
Roman, hang on!

1164
01:44:09,467 --> 01:44:10,480
Tej!

1165
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,990
Get me off of this thing!

1166
01:44:16,248 --> 01:44:17,513
Tej!

1167
01:44:21,156 --> 01:44:22,201
Come on!

1168
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,349
All right. I've had enough of this shit!

1169
01:44:53,677 --> 01:44:55,315
Number 11, my ass!

1170
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:00,608
Yo, shrinkage!
We got a sub to catch. Get in!

1171
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:15,232
What?

1172
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:17,067
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.

1173
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,738
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

1174
01:45:19,267 --> 01:45:23,956
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.

1175
01:45:23,981 --> 01:45:25,951
I don't pick a target from a mile away.

1176
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:30,537
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1177
01:45:32,342 --> 01:45:35,076
Okay. The wife it is.

1178
01:45:53,204 --> 01:45:56,459
Nice plane. I'm gonna enjoy having this.

1179
01:45:56,857 --> 01:45:59,975
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.

1180
01:46:02,376 --> 01:46:03,855
No shit.

1181
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,795
Okay, let's go, Scarface.

1182
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:09,193
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

1183
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,443
Pull up surveillance right now.

1184
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,799
Surprise.

1185
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,436
You're supposed to be dead.

1186
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,175
We have a security breach in
the cargo hold. Take care of it now.

1187
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:52,615
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

1188
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,425
Oh, shut up. Don't be such a baby.

1189
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:02,548
Get to the pilot. He's got the second key.

1190
01:47:02,572 --> 01:47:03,629
Wait for my signal.

1191
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,319
Give Cipher my regards.

1192
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,285
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?

1193
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,075
He gave us this little thing here.

1194
01:47:22,438 --> 01:47:24,429
No, no, no. Don't touch.

1195
01:47:24,636 --> 01:47:26,295
You can track Cipher with this,

1196
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:29,366
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.

1197
01:47:29,391 --> 01:47:31,668
Fine. I've got contacts.

1198
01:47:32,536 --> 01:47:34,015
No, you're gonna take your brother.

1199
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,234
- Oh, dear... 
- Yes.

1200
01:47:39,414 --> 01:47:43,136
Toretto knows where he is. 
He's got this thing. It can see everything.

1201
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,549
It's like... It's called 
the Devil's Bum Hole or something.

1202
01:47:45,574 --> 01:47:46,775
It's called the God's Eye.

1203
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,004
Yeah, well, whatever.

1204
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:52,709
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?

1205
01:47:52,782 --> 01:47:54,129
He's a lost cause.

1206
01:47:54,933 --> 01:47:57,970
He's your brother, Decks. He's my son.

1207
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,833
He's our family.

1208
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:04,350
And our family don't die in bloody cages.

1209
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:07,492
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.

1210
01:48:07,517 --> 01:48:10,589
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

1211
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:12,055
Call yourself a brother? You're...

1212
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,355
Look, come here... Mum. Okay, okay.

1213
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,183
Every time.

1214
01:48:22,699 --> 01:48:23,655
Owen.

1215
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,874
In position.

1216
01:48:26,813 --> 01:48:27,813
Go.

1217
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:30,234
I'm in.

1218
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:50,493
I've got the package, Toretto.

1219
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,598
All 12 pounds of him.

1220
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,391
You made me miss my shot.

1221
01:49:15,416 --> 01:49:17,247
What you think you're doing?

1222
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,337
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1223
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,204
That was for Elena.

1224
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:51,158
Rhodes.

1225
01:49:51,183 --> 01:49:53,064
He's no longer with us.

1226
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,525
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1227
01:49:56,867 --> 01:50:00,655
Congratulations, Dom. 
You just killed your son.

1228
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:03,571
You're wrong. I just saved him.

1229
01:50:04,367 --> 01:50:06,962
And you just took your foot off 
the tiger's neck.

1230
01:50:15,102 --> 01:50:18,142
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.

1231
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,743
This is for your ears.

1232
01:50:25,998 --> 01:50:27,033
Good?

1233
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,669
Let's go.

1234
01:50:33,149 --> 01:50:36,300
No! Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!

1235
01:50:39,097 --> 01:50:40,655
We got another problem.

1236
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,716
That truck's got enough missiles 
to take us all out.

1237
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,880
Then don't give 'em a target.

1238
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:46,366
Everybody, get in front of us, line up,
and we'll take the hit.

1239
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,312
What? I need to switch cars right now!

1240
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,098
Roman, here comes the bad part.

1241
01:51:07,122 --> 01:51:08,047
What?

1242
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,635
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

1243
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:19,797
It's easy for you to say
when your ass ain't on fire.

1244
01:51:25,291 --> 01:51:26,406
All right, little man,

1245
01:51:26,854 --> 01:51:28,810
this might be a little scary,

1246
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,703
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

1247
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:43,383
How's the music, good?

1248
01:51:56,865 --> 01:51:58,015
They're locking on.

1249
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,519
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.

1250
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:00,596
What do we do now?

1251
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,073
We start prayin'!

1252
01:52:24,702 --> 01:52:25,702
Hell, yeah!

1253
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,674
There's Dom!

1254
01:52:43,616 --> 01:52:45,095
What, is this guy on our side now?

1255
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,323
Who the hell cares? He just saved our ass!

1256
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:52,730
Good to be riding with you again, man.

1257
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:07,551
Toretto just cleared the way for them.

1258
01:53:07,576 --> 01:53:09,055
Someone, give me something!

1259
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,175
Torpedoes are ready.

1260
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,323
Then launch them!

1261
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:25,760
Shit.

1262
01:53:29,578 --> 01:53:31,266
- Take the wheel!
- I ain't takin' shit!

1263
01:53:31,291 --> 01:53:32,690
Take the wheel!

1264
01:53:33,524 --> 01:53:34,649
Where you goin'?

1265
01:53:36,101 --> 01:53:37,375
This is crazy!

1266
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:38,594
Speed up!

1267
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:42,864
Left and back!

1268
01:53:42,888 --> 01:53:43,460
What?

1269
01:53:43,485 --> 01:53:45,715
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly!

1270
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,834
Boom, baby!

1271
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,883
Goin' for a ride.

1272
01:54:07,443 --> 01:54:08,443
Back in a sec.

1273
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:24,821
Where's that smile?

1274
01:54:25,095 --> 01:54:26,244
There it is.

1275
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:33,477
You were gonna shoot a baby?

1276
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,407
You sick bastard.

1277
01:54:37,613 --> 01:54:38,969
You're not gonna wanna see this.

1278
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:53,337
Is that you or him?

1279
01:54:56,212 --> 01:54:57,930
Him. Good.

1280
01:54:58,190 --> 01:55:01,479
The torpedoes missed. They're gonna
reach the lock before the sub does.

1281
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,698
The hell they are.

1282
01:55:05,501 --> 01:55:06,985
Get ready for this.

1283
01:55:27,055 --> 01:55:28,219
Oh, shit!

1284
01:55:28,244 --> 01:55:29,680
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

1285
01:55:40,996 --> 01:55:42,860
It's right under us! Get out the way!

1286
01:55:54,986 --> 01:55:56,055
Get us out of here!

1287
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,657
Why are you always yelling?

1288
01:56:01,696 --> 01:56:02,935
This bitch is crazy!

1289
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:03,899
Look out!

1290
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,649
That's not good.

1291
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,329
That's not good!

1292
01:56:18,485 --> 01:56:20,383
Please tell me 
there's nothing to worry about!

1293
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:21,805
We got this.

1294
01:56:34,406 --> 01:56:35,634
That's my girl.

1295
01:56:42,338 --> 01:56:44,973
The sub's too close. 
We ain't making it to the gate in time.

1296
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,507
We're just going to let it get away?

1297
01:56:46,537 --> 01:56:47,919
Not if I know Dom.

1298
01:56:53,101 --> 01:56:54,375
You lose, Dom.

1299
01:56:54,806 --> 01:56:57,001
I destroyed two of your teams.

1300
01:56:57,026 --> 01:56:59,335
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.

1301
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,477
And I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

1302
01:57:03,694 --> 01:57:06,545
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1303
01:57:07,334 --> 01:57:09,318
Now guess who I'm coming for.

1304
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:11,873
Put a heatseeker on him now.

1305
01:57:13,797 --> 01:57:14,946
Now!

1306
01:57:20,363 --> 01:57:21,363
Fire!

1307
01:57:25,511 --> 01:57:27,889
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!

1308
01:57:30,636 --> 01:57:32,959
Peel off! Head to the shore!

1309
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,928
All right. Come and get it.

1310
01:57:59,861 --> 01:58:00,976
No, no, no.

1311
01:58:02,822 --> 01:58:05,108
Dive! Dive!

1312
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:06,598
This...

1313
01:58:06,919 --> 01:58:08,498
This is for my son.

1314
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:28,980
Dom!

1315
01:59:31,616 --> 01:59:32,935
You're out of bullets, Deckard.

1316
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,733
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

1317
01:59:37,162 --> 01:59:38,512
How did you find me?

1318
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,115
You want to see the old Dom?

1319
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:44,514
Watch.

1320
01:59:47,615 --> 01:59:49,048
Resourceful.

1321
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,750
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.

1322
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:54,230
What you've put my family through.

1323
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,079
My mother.

1324
01:59:57,565 --> 01:59:59,920
I'm gonna make sure
that never happens again.

1325
02:00:00,605 --> 02:00:01,826
To anyone.

1326
02:00:02,466 --> 02:00:04,775
There is only one flaw in your plan.

1327
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,950
What's that?

1328
02:00:05,975 --> 02:00:08,250
Only one of us has a parachute.

1329
02:00:30,854 --> 02:00:32,367
Told you this would be fun.

1330
02:00:36,245 --> 02:00:37,756
Time to land, boys.

1331
02:00:48,177 --> 02:00:49,735
You know I never left you, Letty.

1332
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:50,943
I know.

1333
02:00:51,212 --> 02:00:53,487
And you know I never will.

1334
02:00:55,073 --> 02:00:56,472
I know.

1335
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,397
I have so much to tell you.

1336
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:12,963
Yeah, you do. 
And you can start with that bitch.

1337
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,733
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.

1338
02:01:22,855 --> 02:01:23,855
Hey, Dom!

1339
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,740
I'm just throwin' it out there,

1340
02:01:26,186 --> 02:01:28,015
we need to get up outta here

1341
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:31,381
'cause there's all kinda nuclearism
happening under this ice.

1342
02:01:31,406 --> 02:01:34,983
Relax. Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1343
02:01:35,142 --> 02:01:36,894
Okay. So we good, then.

1344
02:01:37,089 --> 02:01:40,001
Let me go on and 
get my young selfie levels up.

1345
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:42,615
You realize this is classified, right?

1346
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:43,993
Not today.

1347
02:01:46,105 --> 02:01:47,123
Unbelievable.

1348
02:01:47,148 --> 02:01:49,818
All right, can we get up outta here, now?
I'm freezin'!

1349
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:18,828
It's okay.

1350
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,850
Don't worry. He's gonna be here soon.

1351
02:02:22,037 --> 02:02:23,895
I get it. Y'all got a lot in common.

1352
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,114
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd... You know.

1353
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:29,028
But we got a lot in common, too, right?

1354
02:02:29,053 --> 02:02:29,895
Like what?

1355
02:02:29,926 --> 02:02:33,437
We walk in the room
and we're oozin' sex appeal.

1356
02:02:33,465 --> 02:02:35,695
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.

1357
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:38,154
I'm askin' a real question right now.

1358
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:42,255
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds

1359
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:46,029
or The Dark Knight? Huh?

1360
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:48,236
To be honest, I like both of you.

1361
02:02:51,463 --> 02:02:56,197
But just before we get into all of that,
let me ask you one question.

1362
02:02:56,338 --> 02:02:58,215
You can ask me anything.

1363
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:59,415
Anything.

1364
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,793
What's my last name?

1365
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:07,190
When you guys figure it out, then,
I guess you can let me know.

1366
02:03:07,222 --> 02:03:09,895
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1367
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,514
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.

1368
02:03:11,765 --> 02:03:13,721
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...

1369
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,195
Hey.

1370
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:16,381
Letty.

1371
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:18,326
I wanted to thank you.

1372
02:03:18,749 --> 02:03:19,936
No need.

1373
02:03:20,716 --> 02:03:21,716
Well...

1374
02:03:22,053 --> 02:03:24,951
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens,

1375
02:03:24,976 --> 02:03:28,775
but she won't be nuking any cities
anytime soon. Thanks to you guys.

1376
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,916
So, I got you a party favor.

1377
02:03:31,193 --> 02:03:32,615
This can't be good.

1378
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,154
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

1379
02:03:35,179 --> 02:03:36,737
You've got your job back.

1380
02:03:36,762 --> 02:03:38,350
That is, if you want it.

1381
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:43,475
- If I want?
- Mmm-hmm.

1382
02:03:50,535 --> 02:03:55,131
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1383
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:56,469
Wow.

1384
02:03:58,079 --> 02:04:00,035
Daddy's stayin' home.

1385
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,615
- Nobody.
- Keep in touch.

1386
02:04:08,761 --> 02:04:10,686
Ah. Hang on a second.

1387
02:04:11,017 --> 02:04:12,764
This could be interesting.

1388
02:04:18,214 --> 02:04:19,889
What made you think I'd do it?

1389
02:04:20,581 --> 02:04:21,855
Brotherhood.

1390
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,592
I saw that look you gave Cipher,
knew you wanted revenge.

1391
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,319
Glad I did it.

1392
02:04:30,757 --> 02:04:33,061
I can't believe you went to see my mother.

1393
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,412
All this fuss over you.

1394
02:04:56,597 --> 02:04:57,652
Yes.

1395
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,035
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.

1396
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,386
And now, he always will be.

1397
02:05:18,591 --> 02:05:22,869
I wanna introduce you to 
the most important person in my universe.

1398
02:05:24,449 --> 02:05:26,714
One who never gave up on me.

1399
02:05:32,779 --> 02:05:34,199
He's beautiful.

1400
02:05:35,338 --> 02:05:39,790
You've heard me say
that you never turn your back on family,

1401
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,799
and I wanna thank you all for 
never turning your back on me.

1402
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:51,952
You wanna meet them?

1403
02:05:52,694 --> 02:05:54,173
All right.

1404
02:05:55,093 --> 02:05:56,412
Everyone,

1405
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,039
meet Brian.

1406
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,548
To Brian!

1407
02:06:09,644 --> 02:06:11,575
Welcome to the family, Brian.

1408
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:14,319
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.

1409
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:17,335
We thank you for giving us family.

1410
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:21,751
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
