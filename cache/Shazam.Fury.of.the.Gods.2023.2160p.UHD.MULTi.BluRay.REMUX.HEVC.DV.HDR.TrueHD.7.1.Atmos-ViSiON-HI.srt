exactly what this all means

651
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,697
but, but he was super aggro

652
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:59,742
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

Yeah, Mary,

but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

No, she...

Yeah, can we get back on track?

669
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,535
Listen, he's yelling at me

670
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,537
and he's saying the daughters of Atlas

671
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:40,505
are coming to hunt us.

of the daughters of Atlas, obviously, yeah,

795

he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

796
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:12,098
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

but also to take powers away
from others.

So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

799

Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

800

got together and they

And they used that to take
his powers away.

804
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,859

they went after other gods...

than what I thought it was,

817

00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:29,707
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

834
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,011

encased the God Realm in some

they are so cut off anymore.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's the
wizard's staff. How did they get that?

844
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,768
So, all those statues used to be people.

845
00:39:57,801 --> 00:40:01,772
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

846
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:02,907
where Greece is at?

847

849

I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

850
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:17,553
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

854
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:23,927
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

855
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,728
You're welcome, by the way.

856
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,006
And then I had to break
it in half so Sivana didn't do

857
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,065
super bad-guy stuff with it, okay?

858
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:30,733
You broke the staff,

859
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,669
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

860

862
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,716

we'll see those two

02:01:09,377 --> 02:01:11,212
Look, we've seen what you can do.

2255
02:01:11,246 --> 02:01:12,782
And we're here to make you an offer.

2256
02:01:12,815 --> 02:01:13,883
How would you like to join

2257
02:01:13,916 --> 02:01:15,250
-the Justice...
-Yes!

2258
02:01:15,283 --> 02:01:16,652
A thousand times yes!

2259
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:18,587
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2260
02:01:18,621 --> 02:01:20,589
Well, I mean, not this exactly.

2261
02:01:20,623 --> 02:01:21,667
Like, normally, it's Wonder Woman

2262
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:22,858
in the dream, but...

2263
02:01:22,892 --> 02:01:24,460
-Ew.
-Huh?

2264
02:01:24,493 --> 02:01:26,629
Well, that was easy.

2265
02:01:26,662 --> 02:01:28,296
Welcome to the Justice Society.

2266
02:01:28,329 --> 02:01:30,331
Yeah! Aweso-- Wait, what?

2267
02:01:30,365 --> 02:01:31,600
The Justice Society?

2268
02:01:31,634 --> 02:01:32,944
Is that different than the Justice League?

2269
02:01:32,968 --> 02:01:34,704
Yes. The Justice Society

2270
02:01:34,737 --> 02:01:36,271
is different than the Justice League

2271
02:01:36,304 --> 02:01:37,940
because of how words work.

2272
02:01:37,973 --> 02:01:39,909
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2273
02:01:39,942 --> 02:01:42,343
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

2274
02:01:42,377 --> 02:01:44,345
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2275
02:01:44,379 --> 02:01:46,280
He's joking, right?

2276
02:01:46,313 --> 02:01:49,551
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

2277
02:01:49,584 --> 02:01:51,586
I'm gonna wait here, 'cause of the shoes.

2278
02:01:51,619 --> 02:01:53,621
Can you drive by and get me?

2279
02:01:53,655 --> 02:01:56,024
SHAZAM: Hey,
just a little constructive criticism.

2280
02:01:56,057 --> 02:01:57,497
It's pretty confusing that there are

2281
02:01:57,525 --> 02:01:59,527
two separate groups of superheroes

2282
02:01:59,561 --> 02:02:00,962
that are totally unaffiliated,

2283
02:02:00,995 --> 02:02:03,031
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2284
02:02:03,064 --> 02:02:05,341
Like, have you guys ever thought
about doing a rebranding of sorts?

2285
02:02:05,365 --> 02:02:08,036
'Cause just a quick search on Thesaurus.com,

2286
02:02:08,069 --> 02:02:09,938
you got so many options, man.

2287
02:02:09,971 --> 02:02:13,007
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

2288
02:02:13,041 --> 02:02:14,809
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2289
02:02:14,843 --> 02:02:16,376
These are, like, legal terms.

2290
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:19,514
(GASPS) "The Avenger Society."

2291
02:02:19,547 --> 02:02:20,915
(INHALES SHARPLY)

2292
02:02:20,949 --> 02:02:22,517
I like that, for some reason.

2293
02:02:25,385 --> 02:02:27,387

(VOICE LAUGHING)

2301
02:08:58,004 --> 02:09:02,041
MISTER MIND: Well, well, Doctor.
We meet again.

2302
02:09:02,075 --> 02:09:03,943
Where in the hell have you been?

2303
02:09:03,977 --> 02:09:07,013
MISTER MIND: To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

2304
02:09:07,046 --> 02:09:09,315
one must have patience.

2305
02:09:09,349 --> 02:09:10,917
What are you talking about?

2306
02:09:12,486 --> 02:09:14,387
It's been two goddamn years!

2307
02:09:14,421 --> 02:09:19,359
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2308
02:09:19,392 --> 02:09:20,894
A meaningless measure.

2309
02:09:20,927 --> 02:09:23,430
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2310
02:09:23,464 --> 02:09:26,866
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2311
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,867
waiting for a worm to enact some, what,

2312
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:31,303
vague plan I've been
told absolutely nothing about?

2313
02:09:31,336 --> 02:09:34,072
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

2314
02:09:34,106 --> 02:09:36,942
I do not have legs, I do not have wings,

2315
02:09:36,975 --> 02:09:40,312
I just slither around endlessly.

2316
02:09:40,345 --> 02:09:42,915
But not for long.

2317
02:09:42,948 --> 02:09:44,349
(LAUGHING)

2318
02:09:45,784 --> 02:09:47,319
Tell me everything.

2319
02:09:48,954 --> 02:09:51,023
Just one more thing I need to do.

2320
02:09:51,056 --> 02:09:53,058
What? No!

2321
02:09:54,494 --> 02:09:55,494
Oh, goddamn it!
