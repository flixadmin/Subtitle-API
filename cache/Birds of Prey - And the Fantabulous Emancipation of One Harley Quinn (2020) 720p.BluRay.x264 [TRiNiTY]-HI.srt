[Harley] <i>With the walls

Yeah?

338
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,706
I've waited a long time for this.

339

340
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,126
Oh...

341

I haven't had breakfast yet.

342
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,298
What did I do to you?

343
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,925
Are you serious?

344
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,636

That wasn't me.

349
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,943
But you dared him to do it.

350
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,588
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?

351
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,656
- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.

352
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,699
That means

353
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,536
there's no one here to stop me.

354
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,765
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

[desk sergeant sighs]

Fuck, Montoya,
you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

367
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,289
Not today, Simpson.

368
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,833
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,918
I mean, your elderly.
[laughing]

370
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,689
You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.

371
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:08,964
You wanna go there?

372
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,091
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

373
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,510
[Montoya] Cassandra Cain,
back already?

374
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,680
Thought by now you'd figure out
how not to get caught.

375
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,349
What? No comeback?

376
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,144
[coughs]

377
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,271
You all right?

378
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,190
You smell like shit.

379
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,443
[Montoya scoffs]

380
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,445
Yo, Simpson.

381
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,406
Any clean clothes in lost and found?

382
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,329
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

383
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,166
The Sionis family name is on
half the museums and schools in Gotham.

384
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,710
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

385
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,380
[Harley] <i>Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.</i>

386
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,716
<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

387
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>That's him.</i>

388
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,053
He had four people killed
alone last night.

389
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,055
If Roman Sionis is such a mastermind,

390
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,140
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

391
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,185
The Janus Corporation is
his father's company, thank you.

392
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,145
And by the way, they cut him off.

393
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,148
Where does the DA's office stand
on all this?

394
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,555
[Harley] <i>To make matters worse,</i>

395
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,360
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

396
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,779
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

397
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,447
There's a shipment coming in.

398
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,990
[Erickson] Drugs?

399
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,477
- A diamond.
- [Munroe] A diamond.

400
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,494
Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?

401
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,746
[Montoya] Listen,
I had a source at the club.

402
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,830
His driver.

403
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,100
He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.

404
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,519
And he said that he overheard something
about laser-encoding.

405
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,920
Now, I did some research.

406
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,589
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

407
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,342
You remember
the Bertinelli massacre, right?

408
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,927
[Harley]
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

409
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,845
<i>Fifteen years ago, one of the wealthiest</i>

410
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,515
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

411
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,142
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

412
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,730
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret offshore bank accounts,</i>

413
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,541
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

414
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:54,027
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

415
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

416
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,157
<i>And with it,
the only key to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

417
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,787
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.

418
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,831
That's what makes him so dangerous.

419
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,541
He's already building an army.

420
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:08,917
If he gets the diamond,

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
he'll have all the money
and connections

422
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,923
to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.

423
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,967
You said you had someone on the inside?

424
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,720
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Yes. He's... [stammering]

425
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,841
He's no longer there, but...

426
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,557
So basically, you have nothing.

427
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,143
You are trying to go after

428
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,979
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

429
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,148
and all you've got
is rumors and a hunch?

430
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,983
- [vibrating continues]
- Well, you know,

431
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,106
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

432
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,486
Isn't that right, Miss Yee?

433
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,655
Listen, if the DA is
willing to throw himself

434
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,283
out in front of this, it's fine with me.

435
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,492
Captain, no.

436
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,872
Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?

437
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,999
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

438
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,417
This is my case, okay?

439
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,184
I've been working on this
for six months.

440
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:56,214
We need something that
we can actually use, Detective.

441
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,884
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

442
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,983
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I...
- No.

443
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,226
That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?

444
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,936
Me? He gave my case away.

445
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,104
Oh, poor Renee.

446
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,124

01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,802
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

1277
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:36,971
You're suspended.

1278
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:40,224
Your badge and your gun, now.

1279
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,523
[Harley] <i>If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,</i>

<i>you know that
this is when shit gets real.</i>

1281
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:52,194
What's the point of the badge,

1282
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:56,073
when it means fuck all anyway?

1283
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,326
Right, Captain?

1284
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:04,164
<i>No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.</i>

only I had more pressing concerns.</i>

1286

And that is why you should never partake
in paying federal income taxes.

Hey, you'll ruin your nails.

1288
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:21,890
Thank you.

1289
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,018
Anyway, lesson 37.

[Bruce growling]

1292
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,272
You said they wouldn't find us.

1293
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,317
Chillax. No one knows we're here.

1294
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:34,194
[officer] Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1295
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,863
Okay. So they know.

1296
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,489
Let's scram.

1297
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:41,035
[officer] Open the door.

1298
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,412
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1299
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:44,826
Bruce, come here.
[whistles]

1300
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,473
[officer] I can hear you!
Open the door.

1301
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:48,584
What is that?

1302
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:52,046
See you in hell, Harley!

1303
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,342
- [man yelling]
- Get under the table!

1305
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:01,764
Come here! No!

[both panting]

1307
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,442
Bruce?

1308

Come here, boy. Bruce?

1309
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:21,784
Bruce?

1310
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:24,453
Bruce?

1311
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,040
This doesn't make sense.

1312
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,626
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1313
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:34,630
No one knew we were here.
No one knew we were here, except...

1314
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:36,632
Doc.

1315
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:37,800
Oh, my God. Doc?

1316
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:41,929
Doc? Where is he?

1317
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:44,556
Doc?

1318
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:48,560
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1319
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,276
No.

1320
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:58,696
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1321
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,864
You sold me out?

1322
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,992
Too many people offering me
too much money.

1323
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:08,205
I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.

1324
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,290
A really nice one.

1325
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:11,750
But, Doc,

1326
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,961
it's me.

1327
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,296
It's just business.

- You're right.
- [Cassandra] Harley?

1332
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,498
He's right.

1333
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,335
Business is business.

1334
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:58,255
I've got the kid.

1335
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:01,717
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1336
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:03,594
If I hand her over,

1337
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:06,138
I want everyone who's after me
to back off.

Fine.

You're gonna be

Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1354

Do we have to bring them back?

1355
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:07,449
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:04,389
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1440
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:06,516
You little fucking bird.

1441
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:09,769
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1442
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,733
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1443
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:18,987
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1444
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:20,906
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1445
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,115
Prove it to me.

1446
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,744
Rip open her little tummy.

1447
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:27,204
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1448
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,539
Now! Rip it open!

1449
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,834

[Harley grunting]

1454
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:54,689
Freeze!

1455
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,070
Don't fucking move.

1456
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,115
Who the fuck are you?

1457
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,332
Go get the kid.

1458
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,917
- All right.
- [gun cocks]

1459
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:16,086
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Cassandra] Back the fuck up!

1460
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:18,564
- Get away from me. All of you.
- [Lance] Put that shit down.

1461
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,799
Shoot them, kid.

1462
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:24,719
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1463
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,639
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1464
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:28,807
Okay.

1465
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:31,726
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1466
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,353
But I know that this shit stick...

1467
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:34,437
[Cassandra grunts]

1468
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:36,898
...just tried to gut me.

1469
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:38,900
And you.

1470
01:19:41,278 --> 01:19:42,779
Thought you were different.

1471
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,992
I'm sorry, kid.

1472
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:52,122
I'm just a terrible person, I guess.

1473
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:00,088
Ooh!

1474
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:02,007
Ooh, I'm back.

1475
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:05,760
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.

1476
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:08,239
This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1477
01:20:08,263 --> 01:20:11,266
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1478
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:12,851
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

1479
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:17,647
I'm not letting you sell the kid to him.

1480
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:20,817
I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.

1481
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,652
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin. Huh?

1482
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,739
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.

1483
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:27,699
Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.

1484
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,492
I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

1485
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:30,618
Whoa.

1486
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:33,580
They call me...

1487
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:34,748
Helena Bertinelli.

1488
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,291
For fuck's sake.

1489
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,460
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

1490
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:42,380
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1491

[Huntress] <i>I killed Galante.</i>

[groans]

1493
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:55,643
I killed his firing squad.

[both groan]

1495

[groans]

1497
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:10,367
And now I'm done.

1498
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,286
Bravo.

1499
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,293
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1500
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:21,544
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1501
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,799
I hate to be the one to break it to you,
sweetheart, but you are not done.

1502
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:29,010
Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?

1503
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:31,054
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1504
01:21:31,221 --> 01:21:33,556
Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.

1505
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,850
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1506
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:39,104
That diamond is our only chance
of stopping him.

1507
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,271
[Cassandra] You guys.

1508
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,774
Hey, I think you should see this.

1509
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:46,444
Oh.

1510
01:21:46,528 --> 01:21:48,113
It's Sionis.

1511
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:02,168
We're fucked.

1512
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:04,712
He bought himself an army.

1513
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:14,556
They're all here for me.

1514
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:18,184
Aren't they?

1515
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:26,609
- No.
- They're not?

1516
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:28,027
No, they're not.

1517
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:30,363
Do you know what that means?

1518
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:32,341
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1519
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:33,575
He's after all of us.

1520
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:36,244
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1521
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,831
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1522
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,834
And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.

1523
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:46,254
So, unless we all wanna die
very unpleasant deaths

1524
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:49,632
and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1525
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:52,619
we're gonna have to work together.

1526
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:55,013
With you?

1527
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,222
Yeah.

- We're gonna work together,

1529

and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

Yeah. Okay.

Sure.

Yes!

1535
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,242
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1536
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:17,327
Mmm-hmm.

1537
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,750
Will this do?

1538
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:26,336
No.

1539
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:28,129
- Not at all.

I have funded you. I've protected you.

I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

Well, now it's time to say thank you.

1550

Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.

- What? Gotta take care of the girls.

Isn't this fun? It's just
like a sleepover. [gasps]

We should order pizza. Make cosmos.

- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?

1561
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:59,637
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

I don't have rage issues.

You know, psychologically speaking,

1565
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,605
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.
