No, it's not funny at all.

FURY: Howard Stark
fished that out of the ocean

331
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,840
when he was looking for you.

332
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,040
He thought what we think.

333
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,040
The Tesseract
could be the key

334
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
to unlimited
sustainable energy.

335
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,720
That's something
the world sorely needs.

336
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Who took it from you?

337
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
He's called Loki.

338
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,880
He's not from around here.

339
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,400
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

340
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,720
if you're in.

341
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,680
The world has gotten
even stranger

342
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,200
than you already know.

343
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

344

Ten bucks says you're wrong.

345
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
There's a debriefing packet

346
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,920
waiting for you back
at your apartment.

347
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,200
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

348
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,560
that we ought
to know now?

349
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,120
You should have left it
in the ocean.

How does it feel
to be a genius?

wouldn't know,
now would I?

Well, I did do
all the heavy lifting.

390
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,400
Literally,
I lifted the heavy things.

Ant, boot.

805
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,920
(LOKI CHUCKLING)

806
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,040
It's an impressive cage.

807
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,640
Not built, I think,
for me.

808
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,080
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

809
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,480
Oh, I've heard.

810
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,640
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

811
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,320
<i>Makes play</i>
<i>he's still a man.</i>

812
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,600
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

813
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,920
<i>that you call on</i>
<i>such lost creatures</i>
<i>to defend you?</i>

814
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,440
FURY: <i>How desperate am I?</i>

815
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,480
You threaten
my world with war.

816
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,840
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

817
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,840
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

818
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,080
You have made me
very desperate.

819
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
You might not be glad
that you did.

820
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,800
Ooh.

821
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,680
It burns you
to have come so close.

822
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,840
To have the Tesseract,
to have power,

823
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,840
unlimited power.

824
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,040
And for what?

825
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,520
A warm light
for all mankind to share.

826
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,000
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

827
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,720
Well, let me know
if "real power"

828
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,360
wants a magazine
or something.

829
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,200
He really grows on you,
doesn't he?

830
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,400
Loki's gonna drag this out.

831
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,960
So, Thor, what's his play?

832
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,720
He has an army
called the Chitauri.

833
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,840
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

834
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,400
He means to lead them
against your people.

835
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,160
They will win him
the Earth,

836
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,080
in return, I suspect,
for the Tesseract.

837
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,040
An army

838
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,920
from outer space.

839
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,560
So, he's building
another portal.

840
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,080
That's what he needs
Erik Selvig for.

841
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
Selvig?

842
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,760
He's an astrophysicist.
He's a friend.

843
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,080
Loki has him under
some kind of spell,

844
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,720
along with one of ours.

845
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,520
I want to know why
Loki let us take him.

846
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,920
He's not leading
an army from here.

847
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,840
I don't think
we should be
focusing on Loki.

848
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,840
That guy's brain
is a bag full of cats.

849
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,280
You could smell
crazy on him.

850
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,280
Have care
how you speak.

851
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,960
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

852
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,480
And he is my brother.

853
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,600
He killed 80 people
in two days.

854
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,400
He's adopted.

855
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,000
I think it's about
the mechanics.

856
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,080
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

857
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,240
It's a stabilizing agent.

858
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,720
I'm just saying,
pick a weekend.

859
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
I'll fly you to Portland.

860
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,160
Keep love alive.

861
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,280
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

862
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,280
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

863
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,760
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

864
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,200
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

865
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,840
and stay open as long,
as Loki wants.

866
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,760
Raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

867
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,680
That man is playing <i>Galaga.</i>

868
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,080
He thought
we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

869
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,480
How does Fury
even see these?

870
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,560
He turns.

871
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,520
Sounds exhausting.

872
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,800
The rest
of the raw materials,

873
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,760
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

874
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,360
The only major component
he still needs

875
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,080
is a power source
of high-energy density.

876
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,520
Something to kick-start
the Cube.

877
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,720
When did you become
an expert in thermonuclear
astrophysics?

878
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Last night.

879
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,640
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

880
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,840
Am I the only one
who did the reading?

881
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,800
Does Loki need
any particular kind
of power source?

882
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,720
He would have
to heat the Cube to
120-million Kelvin

883
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,400
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

884
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,840
Unless Selvig
has figured out
how to stabilize

885
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,120
the quantum tunneling effect.

886
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
BANNER: Well,
if he could do that,

887
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,680
he could achieve
heavy ion fusion

888
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,960
at any reactor
on the planet.

889
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,600
Finally, someone
who speaks English.

890
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,760
Is that what
just happened?

891
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
It's good to meet you,
Dr. Banner.

892
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,240
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

893
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,240
And I'm a huge fan
of the way
you lose control

894
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,480
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

895
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,080
Thanks.

896
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,800
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

897
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,280
I was hoping
you might join him.

898
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,680
ROGERS: I would start
with that stick of his.

899
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,760
It may be magical,

900
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,240
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

901
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,400
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

902
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,480
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

903
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,280
to turn two
of the sharpest men I know

904
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,200
into his personal
flying monkeys.

905
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,320
Monkeys?
I do not understand.

906
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,200
I do.

907
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,080
I understood that reference.

908
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,360
Shall we play, Doctor?

909
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,280
This way, sir.

910
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,840
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

911
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,080
with Selvig's reports
of the Tesseract.

912
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,080
But it's going to take
weeks to process.

913
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,520
If we bypass
their mainframe

914
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,880
and direct route
to the Homer cluster

915
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,160
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

916
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,280
All I packed
was a toothbrush.

917
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,960
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

918
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,240
Top ten floors, all R&D.

919
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,000
You'd love it.
It's Candy Land.

920
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,760
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

921
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,480
I kind of broke Harlem.

922
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,520
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

923
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,520
No tension, no surprises.

924
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,880
(ELECTRIC DISCHARGE)
Ow!

925
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,520
ROGERS: Hey!
Nothing?

926
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
Are you nuts?

927
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,880
Jury's out.

928
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,200
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

929
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
What's your secret?

930
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,880
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

931
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,120
Is everything
a joke to you?

932
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,440
Funny things are.

933
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,360
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

934
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,640
isn't funny.

935
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
No offense, Doc.

936
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,400
It's all right,
I wouldn't have
come aboard

937
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,360
if I couldn't handle
pointy things.

938
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,080
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

939
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,880
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

940
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,480
STARK: Do you think I'm not?

941
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,440
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

942
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,280
What isn't he telling us?

943
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,200
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

944
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,120
You think Fury's
hiding something?

945
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,320
He's a spy.
Captain, he's "the" spy.

946
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,240
His secrets have secrets.

947
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,000
It's bugging him, too.
Isn't it?

948
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,080
Uh...

949
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,840
I just want to finish
my work here, and...

950
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,360
Doctor?

951
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,240
"A warm light
for all mankind."

952
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,360
Loki's jab at Fury
about the Cube.

953
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,960
I heard it.

954
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,960
I think that
was meant for you.

955
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,000
Even if Barton
didn't tell Loki
about the tower,

956
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,320
it was still
all over the news.

957
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,520
The Stark Tower?
That big, ugly

958
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,120
building in New York?

959
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,440
It's powered
by an arc reactor,

960
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,840
a self-sustaining
energy source.

961
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,440
That building
will run itself for,
what, a year?

962
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,360
It's just the prototype.

963
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,520
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

964
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,320
That's what
he's getting at.

965
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,880
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D.
bring him in

966
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,040
on the Tesseract project?

967
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,960
What are they doing
in the energy business

968
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,360
in the first place?

969
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,160
STARK: I should probably
look into that

970
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,520
once my decryption program

971
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,800
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

972
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
I'm sorry.
Did you say...

973
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

974
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,800
In a few hours,
I'll know every
dirty secret

975
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,000
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever
tried to hide.

Blueberry?

977
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,040
Yet you're confused
about why they didn't
want you around.

978
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,200
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

979
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,800
Historically,
not awesome.

980
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,200
I think Loki's trying
to wind us up.

981
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,880
This is a man
who means to start a war,

982
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,720
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

983
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,400
We have orders.
We should follow them.

984
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,480
Following's not really
my style.

988
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,880
and, B, not of use?

989
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,240
Steve, tell me none
of this smells
a little funky to you.

my dad never shut up about?

993
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,280
I'm wondering if
they shouldn't have

994
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,080
kept him on ice.
Huh.

995
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,640
The guy's not wrong
about Loki.

996
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,440
He does have
the jump on us.

997
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,360
What he's got
is an Acme dynamite kit.

998
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,240
It's going to blow up
in his face.

999
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,720
And I'm going to be there
when it does.

1000
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,200
Yeah.
I'll read all about it.

1001
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Uh-huh. Or you'll be
suiting up with
the rest of us.

a suit of armor.

1004
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,280
I'm exposed.
Like a nerve.

1005
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,120
It's a nightmare.

1006
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,960
I've got a cluster
of shrapnel trying
every second

1007
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,120
to crawl its way
into my heart.

1008

This stops it.

This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

not just armor.

1011
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,760
It's a terrible privilege.

1012
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,560
But you can control it.
Because I learned how.

1013
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,640
It's different.

That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

that the Hulk...

That's nice.

1019

It's a nice sentiment.
Saved it for what?

1020
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,720
I guess we'll find out.

Loki taking Erik Selvig.

he plans for him
once he's done.

Erik is a good man.

that we're more advanced,

Bilge snipe.

scaly, big antlers.

Well, they are repulsive.

And they trample everything
in their path.

came to Earth,

where the Tesseract is?

It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

he's the only person

There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

1067

But you figured
I'd come.

1068
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,920
After.

1069
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,160
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

1070
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,040
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

1071
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,680
And I would cooperate.

1072

I want to know
what you've done
to Agent Barton.

And once you've won,

1075

once you're
king of the mountain,

1076

01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,280
Oh...

1078
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,280
Is this love,

I, uh...

a name for myself.

1083

who I used it for, or on.

1085

I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
radar in a bad way.

1086
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,440
Agent Barton
was sent to kill me.

1087
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,960
He made a different call.

1088
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,920
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

1089
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,600
Not let you out.

1090
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,720
No, but I like this.

1091

Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

1093

to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

1094
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000

1096
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,320
It's really
not that complicated.

1097
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,640
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

1098
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,120
Can you?

1099
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,320
Can you wipe out
that much red?

<i>And they will never go away.</i>

1117
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,360
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

1118
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,680
Slowly, intimately,

1119
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,240
in every way
he knows you fear.

1120
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,520
And then he'll wake
just long enough to
see his good work,

1121
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,040
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

1122

This is my bargain,

You brought the monster.

1128
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,360
So, Banner.

1129
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,600
That's your play.

1130
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,720
What?

1131
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,360
Loki means
to unleash the Hulk.

1132
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,960
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way.

1133
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,160
Send Thor as well.

1134
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,120
Thank you

1135
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,400
for your cooperation.

1136
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,320
What are you doing,
Mr. Stark?

1137
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,920
Uh, kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1138
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,000
You're supposed
to be locating
the Tesseract.

1139
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,680
BANNER: We are.
The model's locked

1140
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,080
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1141
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,160
When we get a hit,

1142
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,360
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1143
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,600
Yeah, then you get
your Cube back.
No muss, no fuss.

1144
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,960
What is "Phase 2"?

1145
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,920
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1146
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,920
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1147
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,680
Rogers, we gathered
everything related
to the Tesseract.

1148
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,360
This does not mean
that we're making...

1149
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,480
STARK: I'm sorry, Nick.

1150
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,920
What were you lying?

1151
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,200
I was wrong, Director.

1152
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,480
The world
hasn't changed a bit.

1153
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,600
Did you know about this?

1154
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,080
You want to think about
removing yourself

1155
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,520
from this environment,
Doctor?

1156
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,880
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1157
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,160
Loki is manipulating you.

1158
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,880
And you've been
doing what, exactly?

1159
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,680
You didn't come here
because I bat my
eyelashes at you.

1160
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,880
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1161
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,320
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1162
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,040
I'd like to know
why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1163
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,320
is using the Tesseract

1164
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,920
to build weapons
of mass destruction.

1165
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,640
Because of him.

1166
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
Me?

1167
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,200
Last year,
Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1168
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,480
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1169
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,840
We learned that
not only are we not alone,

1170
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,520
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1171
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,880
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1172
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,000
But you're not
the only people out
there, are you?

1173
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,240
And you're not
the only threat.

1174
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,480
The world's filling up
with people who can't
be matched,

1175
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,320
that can't be controlled.

1176
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,480
Like you controlled the Cube?

1177
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,960
Your work with
the Tesseract

1178
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,680
is what drew Loki to it,
and his allies.

1179
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,200
It is a signal
to all the realms

1180
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,960
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1181
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,160
A higher form?

1182
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,400
You forced our hand.

1183
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,440
We had to come up
with something.

1184
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,560
A nuclear deterrent.

1185
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,720
Because that always
calms everything
right down.

1186
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,200
Remind me again
how you made
your fortune, Stark.

1187
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,560
I'm sure if he still
made weapons,

1188
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,720
Stark would be neck-deep...

1189
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,440
Hold on. How is this
now about me?

1190
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,680
I'm sorry,
isn't everything?

1191
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,720
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1192
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,720
Excuse me, did we
come to your planet
and blow stuff up?

1193
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,680
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1194
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,280
Are you boys
really that naive?

1195
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,280

potential threats.

one more wisecrack...

Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

1203
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,720

Where?
You rented my room.

just in case...

needed to kill me.

But you can't.
I know, I tried.

I got low.
I didn't see an end.

1246

So, I put a bullet
in my mouth,

spit it out.

could work together

I'm sorry.

1579

He seemed
like a good man.

1580
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,160
He was an idiot.

Why? For believing?

1582
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,120
For taking on Loki alone.

1583
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,960
He was doing his job.

He was out of his league.

FURY: <i>They surely are,</i>
<i>and the whole world knows it.</i>

2062
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:42,600
Every world knows it.

2063
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,120
<i>Was that the point</i>
<i>of all this?</i>

2064
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:46,960
<i>A statement?</i>

2065
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:51,120
FURY: <i>A promise.</i>

2066
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,360
HILL: <i>Sir,</i>
<i>how does it work now?</i>

2067
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,560
They've gone
their separate ways.

2068
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:07,600
Some, pretty extremely far.

2069
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,280
If we get into a situation
like this again,

2070
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,840
what happens then?

2071
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
They'll come back.

2072
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:16,240
HILL: Are you really
sure about that?

2073
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,320
FURY: I am.

2074
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,520
Why?

2075
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:23,400
Because we'll need them to.

2076
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:42,000
(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

2077
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,520
THE OTHER: Humans.

2078
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:23,200
They are not
the cowering wretches
we were promised.

2079
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:26,320
They stand.

2080
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:33,640
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

2081
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:43,400
To challenge them

2082
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:47,320
is to court death.
