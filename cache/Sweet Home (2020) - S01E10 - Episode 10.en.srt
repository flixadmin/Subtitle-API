1
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,827
Hyun-su, what condition are you in?

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,947
Did I win?

3
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,788
Hyun-su is okay.

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,920
That's unexpected.

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,263
Don't move.

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,522
Those things can't kill me.

7
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,476
Don't worry about that.

8
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,397
I'll find a way to kill you
when I need to.

9
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,769
Hyun-su... Are you okay?

10
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,693
Come over here quickly.

11
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,935
Come over.

12
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,781
Put that away.

13
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,504
He saved me.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,709
Think about what they did.

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,369
Hyun-su.

16
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,957
He killed his own team.

17
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,672
- Do you trust him?
- Do you trust me?

18
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,586
He's like me.

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,220
So put your guns down.

20
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,578
ORIGINAL STORYSWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:35,492
TEN

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
I did it.

23
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,172
I...

24
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,709
killed Ms. An.

25
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,845
I know you had no choice.

26
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,520
Don't give in until the end.

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,520
She would've wanted that.

28
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,714
I see how you've been.

29
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,419
What are you going to do from now on?

30
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,430
I'm going to find more that are like us.

31
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,928
When the hunt is over,

32
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,729
the hound dies.

33
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,146
It should live as a wolf.

34
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,729
Come with me.

35
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,747
Is he your friend?

36
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,671
Come here. It's okay.

37
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,417
Hyun-su. Have you seen Mr. Han?

38
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,429
No.

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,100
My T-Rex's leg is broken.

40
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,809
He said he'd fix it.

41
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,890
Do you know how to fix it?

42
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,436
No.

43
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,453
What about us?

44
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,735
Do you think we can be fixed?

45
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,584
I used to think so

46
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,582
because I thought it was a disease.

47
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,832
So I volunteered for the experiment.

48
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,551
They made every effort
to separate it from me.

49
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,465
They tried freezing, thawing,

50
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,011
sawing, piercing, and scorching.

51
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,305
What do you think happened in the end?
It never comes out!

52
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,227
Why not?

53
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,227
Because the monster isn't in me. It is me!

54
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,210
I realized then...

55
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,252
that this is an evolution!

56
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,255
That I was chosen!

57
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,892
Humans have failed.

58
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,515
Not only did they fail in experiments,

59
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,104
but they also failed
to be selected by nature.

60
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,404
Accept it.

61
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,571
Humans and we...

62
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,736
can't coexist anyway.

63
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,426
Mr. Han!

64
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,139
Hurry! Hurry over!

65
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,969
- Where are you going?
- Jeez!

66
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,389
Su-yeong, it's my friend.

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,020
It helped me.

68
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,064
No!

69
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,358
- Get out of the way!
- No!

70
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,360
- Get away.
- No!

71
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,782
- Stop!
- No!

72
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,821
- It won't attack us.
- Well, yes, but...

73
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,365
You don't know how it'll change!

74
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,198
Shoot it! It's a monster!

75
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,623
No!

76
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,914
Don't do it!

77
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,995
Damn it!

78
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,788
No!

79
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,707
Don't do it!

80
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,046
- No!
- Let's go.

81
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,489
I guess you're right.

82
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,157
Humans and monsters can't coexist.

83
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,082
It can't be helped.

84
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,418
- Don't cry.
- Get up.

85
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,340
Hey.

86
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,639
Even an outcast should be picky
when choosing friends.

87
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,902
You seem to have a lot of friends.

88
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,859
I have no such thing.

89
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,999
What is that jerk
trying to do with Hyun-su?

90
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,672
I don't know.

91
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,876
He's cooperative for now,
so provoking him won't do any good.

92
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,879
It's obvious that he's a psycho.

93
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,804
Anyway...

94
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,394
SPECIAL INFECTEE REPORT GUIDE

95
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,348
What about it?

96
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,323
What do you want to do with it?

97
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,818
It's tempting, right?

98
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,069
It's a good deal.

99
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,736
So?

100
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,535
You want to sell Hyun-su out
so we can survive?

101
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,906
- Are you crazy?
- I never said that.

102
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,577
Do you really believe this?

103
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,585
Just be your twisted self.

104
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,879
- Exactly.
- What?

105
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,633
"Safety camp" sounds ridiculous.

106
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,967
You don't know
who'll turn into a monster when,

107
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,853
so how can they secure safety?

108
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,230
When someone is sure about keeping
a promise when it's hardly possible,

109
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,860
there's a good chance it's a lie.

110
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,986
So what will you do?

111
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,991
I'll go talk to Hyun-su first.

112
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,867
No.

113
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,915
- I just want to talk...
- I don't want to.

114
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,039
Nothing you said was ever good for me.

115
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,500
Hey, Hyun-su.

116
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,012
I'm not your hound, anymore.

117
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,772
Are you going to stay here?

118
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,404
Probably.

119
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,316
Not for long, though.

120
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,114
I'll leave soon.

121
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,992
Where were you before?

122
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,912
Do you know about the research facility?

123
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,246
You probably don't want to hear it.

124
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,590
Won't you report me?

125
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,255
I'm the skeptical type.

126
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,801
You're smart.

127
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,349
As an apology to the people here,

128
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,983
I'll tell you one thing.

129
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,939
Do you know about Operation Golden Hour?

130
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,481
What is that?

131
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,190
It's the military's final operation
to solve this situation.

132
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,026
I heard it from the soldiers.

133
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,236
"If we can't distinguish
between humans and monsters,

134
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,204
and if we can't predict when and
what kinds of monsters humans will become,

135
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,496
before the military
completely loses its function,

136
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,747
we'll sweep as many areas as possible."

137
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,930
No way.

138
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,138
The military's not going to rescue anyone.

139
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,512
They're going to destroy everything.

140
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,782
Survive on your own.

141
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,070
That's the only way now.

142
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,249
I have something to tell you.

143
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,959
- All right.
- Well...

144
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,706
There.

145
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,054
Hey, gold tooth.

146
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,014
You're dead if you step out.

147
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,853
I want to finish you off right now,
but I'm holding back.

148
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,759
You don't have the guts to do that.

149
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,678
What?

150
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,635
We've been here together for a while,
but you still don't know me.

151
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,016
I'm a man of action.

152
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,614
- You're all talk.
- Come on, woman.

153
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,940
Whatever.

154
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,864
Have you seen Bom?

155
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,072
Bom?

156
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,284
No, I didn't kill anyone.
I only ran some errands.

157
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,867
I committed financial crimes.
I'm the brain.

158
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,713
I've never killed anyone.

159
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,078
Throw him out.
Something will come and eat him.

160
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,882
- Where are you, Bom?
- Ui-myeong!

161
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,509
Please tell them about me.

162
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,772
Wait, Ui-myeong...

163
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,896
- What was that?
- We used to be close.

164
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,277
- Your foot.
- Okay. I'll put it back.

165
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,739
So, the soldiers will come
when you press this, right?

166
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,662
This is unfair.

167
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,451
I told you everything, but you haven't.

168
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,202
Because I didn't trust you.

169
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,998
Do you trust me now?

170
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,750
More than the military and that man.

171
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,252
Should I be happy?

172
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,626
What's your opinion?

173
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,884
I only heard about it.

174
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,054
Your opinion is important
since you've seen it.

175
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,868
I told you

176
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,002
I wasn't sure...

177
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,919
if I could protect the kids without you.

178
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,545
But...

179
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,604
I wanted to.

180
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,894
I really wanted to.

181
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,228
I'm scared.

182
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,608
What if...

183
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,081
I turn into something hideous?

184
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm scared of that.

185
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,367
Poor things.

186
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,911
Even death couldn't get them out of here.

187
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,245
I can't die here.

188
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,389
What are you doing?

189
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,647
- Shoveling.
- I can see that.

190
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,613
Sir, you shouldn't overwork yourself.

191
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,898
This is nothing.

192
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,914
You'll end up digging a tunnel
while looking for one.

193
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,450
That'd be nice.

194
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,329
Sir, you're sick.

195
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,081
If you keep doing this, you'll...

196
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,087
I'll die?

197
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,208
Yes. That'd be all right, too.

198
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,506
You can just cover me with dirt.

199
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,569
Move away!

200
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,056
What's the matter?

201
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,569
- They were trying to leave.
- It doesn't matter.

202
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,237
If they report us, the soldiers will come.

203
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,403
We won't be here by then.

204
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,529
Because I'll leave here with you.

205
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,286
Why are you trying to go out?

206
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,533
Let them go.

207
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,242
They'll die, anyway.

208
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,616
- What the...
- Run!

209
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,474
Don't look back.

210
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,771
Okay.

211
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,976
Just a little more.

212
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,987
Hurry. Help him.

213
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,725
Damn it.

214
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,859
Byeong-il...

215
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,034
People like me die

216
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,318
when they do something
they don't usually do.

217
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,283
I told you.

218
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,833
I'm a man of action.

219
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,752
Now you know.

220
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,800
What should we do?

221
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,218
Oh, goodness.

222
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,642
Byeong-il.

223
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,097
Byeong-il.

224
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:14,193
Wake up!

225
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,533
Wake up. Byeong-il.

226
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,202
Byeong-il.

227
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,910
I should've known when you were bummed
after killing that woman.

228
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,004
Do you want to hear something funny?

229
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,844
To tell you the truth,
you didn't kill anyone.

230
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,138
Because that woman was actually me.

231
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,209
Nobody can leave.

232
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,015
GREEN HOME MANSION APARTMENT

233
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,778
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

234
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,115
- That's a monster.
- It's still Hyun-su.

235
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,728
It's still Hyun-su.

236
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,385
It's okay, Hyun-su.

237
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,758
It's okay.

238
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,506
It's not your fault.

239
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,845
It's okay, Hyun-su.

240
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,936
It's okay.

241
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,244
It's okay.

242
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,575
Hyun-su.

243
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,880
It's not your fault.

244
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,264
It's not your fault.

245
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,965
I killed a person.

246
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,234
No.

247
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,647
What you killed...

248
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,817
wasn't human.

249
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,743
I'm so scared...

250
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,499
it'll be my last memory.

251
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,764
Try to forget it.

252
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,926
Don't think about it.

253
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,231
You don't think about it either.

254
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,198
Okay.

255
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,356
I'll die?

256
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,901
Well, that's all right, too.

257
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,566
Just cover me with dirt.

258
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,047
Just cover with dirt...

259
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,414
Who is he?

260
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,911
Why am I crying?

261
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,958
My heart...

262
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,753
is breaking.

263
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,357
How is Hyun-su?

264
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,408
He doesn't remember any of it.

265
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,450
How much can he remember?

266
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,327
I'm not sure.

267
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,876
If he can't remember,

268
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,800
I want him to forget
all the bad memories, too.

269
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,505
AUGUST 25, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

270
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,944
Just go like this.

271
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,939
This is much better.

272
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,396
What?

273
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,872
Survive.

274
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,578
For yourself.

275
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,789
You just promised me.

276
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,161
And for the rest of us.

277
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,343
Yeong-su.

278
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,465
I told you not to go around alone.
I've been looking for you!

279
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,556
Go away! I hate you!

280
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,060
Why? Why do you hate me?

281
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,154
It could've been Dad!

282
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,899
It came to me because it missed me.

283
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,442
But you said it was a monster.

284
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,856
You told people to kill it!

285
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,105
It's not Dad.

286
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,819
Dad is dead.

287
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,948
Even if we sleep 10 nights, 100 nights,

288
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,245
we can never see him again.

289
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,409
No! You're stupid!

290
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,127
You're stupid, too.

291
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,706
I'm not stupid!

292
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,014
You're mean to your sister,

293
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,668
so you're super stupid.

294
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,363
If you cry like that,

295
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,570
you'll be fired as a secret agent.

296
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,406
Santa Claus won't bring you a gift...

297
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,247
A gift?

298
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,801
What's this?

299
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,260
TWO DAYS AGO

300
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,841
Are you putting an old man to work?

301
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,636
Please do this for me.

302
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,444
Do you really have to go?

303
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,285
Du-sik left it with me.

304
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,550
It's a gift for you.

305
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,508
Ta-da.

306
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,382
This is something called a medal.

307
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,810
It's an award given to a person
who protected someone well.

308
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,193
KIM YEONG-SU

309
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,610
Here.

310
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,691
You've been awarded a medal,

311
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,568
so don't fight anymore.

312
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,744
You have to look after each other, okay?

313
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,517
Grandpa, wake up.

314
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,484
DAD, MOM, KAPO

315
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,777
Grandpa.

316
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,490
Grandpa?

317
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,735
Excuse me.

318
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,213
Grandpa is not waking up.

319
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,666
Sir.

320
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,178
Grandpa, let's play.

321
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,703
Thank you.

322
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,659
Byeong-il.

323
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,499
What's this?

324
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,547
Mr. An found it in the end.

325
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,216
Now you can rest in peace.

326
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,772
It's snowing.

327
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,195
You're all surrounded.

328
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,544
Surrender the infected immediately.

329
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,626
Survivors will be transferred
to a safety camp.

330
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,960
You are completely surrounded.

331
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,465
Surrender the infected immediately.

332
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,009
Survivors will be transferred
to a safety camp.

333
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,810
Are you going somewhere?

334
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,693
Hyun-su, your hands are cold.

335
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,114
Are you cold?

336
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,827
I have to go outside.

337
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,882
It's not cold if we stay together.

338
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,299
Stay here.

339
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,972
Stay with us.

340
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,815
Shit.

341
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,869
Damn. Why is it blocked?

342
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,370
Damn it.

343
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,662
Shit.

344
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,381
I almost blew it up.

345
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,860
They seem to have weapons, sir.

346
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,707
What's going on?

347
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,468
Hurry.

348
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,238
Where are you going?

349
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,407
Hyun-su.

350
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,615
He's gone.

351
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,039
I'll go get him.

352
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,627
I'll come back.

353
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,010
Don't worry.

354
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,387
I'll come back safe.

355
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,925
You promise?

356
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,805
Yes.

357
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,244
I should've given this back.

358
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,995
It's not too late.

359
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,985
Something's moving in the building.

360
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,226
Come in quickly.

361
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,484
Eun-hyeok isn't here yet.

362
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,902
Neither is Hyun-su.

363
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,819
He promised me that he'd be back.

364
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,115
When someone is sure about keeping
a promise when it's hardly possible,

365
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,871
there's a good chance it's a lie.

366
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,332
I'll come back.

367
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,373
Don't worry.

368
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,915
I'll come back safe.

369
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,670
No. Eun-hyeok!

370
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,336
Eun-hyeok!

371
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,006
No! Let go of me!

372
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,675
No! Eun-hyeok!

373
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:29,604
Eun-hyeok! No!

374
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,345
You promised to come back!

375
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,063
Eun-hyeok!

376
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,857
Eun-hyeok!

377
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,316
Doesn't it hurt?

378
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,195
I don't know where you were hurt,
so stick these on yourself.

379
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,786
Make it obvious.

380
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,543
"I got hurt because of you.
It fucking hurts!"

381
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,835
Sorry.

382
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,798
We made things more difficult for you.

383
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,258
How did you bear it?

384
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,549
Thank you for saving us.

385
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,512
It's not your fault.

386
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,980
Live.

387
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,731
You can choose this time.

388
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,612
It makes me feel like I'm home.

389
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,119
Are you okay?

390
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:57,267
Are we going to die
wandering around here like this?

391
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,981
Don't say such an awful thing.

392
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,361
I can't die here like this.

393
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:15,905
Bom.

394
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,325
Bom. Hey, sweetie.

395
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,674
Where have you been?

396
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,923
Where have you been?

397
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,270
Bom.

398
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,493
Bom?

399
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,958
Bom?

400
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,246
Bom.

401
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,186
We found it.

402
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,676
I pushed it.

403
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,307
Oh my goodness.

404
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,063
That means you didn't push it.

405
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,614
Then don't you care
about Nam Sang-won anymore?

406
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,659
The deal isn't over yet.

407
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,552
Wait. Someone didn't get on yet.

408
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,215
We're waiting for one more person.

409
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,484
You must survive.

410
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,572
Cha Hyun-su.

411
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,568
Cha Hyun-su.

412
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,546
Long time no see.

413
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,444
