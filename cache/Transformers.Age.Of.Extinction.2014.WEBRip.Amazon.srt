345
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,754
to ask him,

346
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:53,017
to invite you both, uh,

347
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,411
over to the White House
just to powwow,

348
00:19:55,542 --> 00:20:00,155

some more specifics
about how

349
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:03,114
exactly you're hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

350
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:05,900
I've had my desk
for two years.

351
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,815
Mr. Attinger has been here

352
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,425

He runs the projects

353

for specifics.

354
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,169
That's why they're
called Black Ops.

And why we all sleep
better at night.

So, um...

will be pleased.

that the war will be over.

368
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:51,859

In case he asks,

369
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,295
I just like to have
an exact quote.

370
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,514
"War will be over soon."

00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,298

Such good news.

Sir Prime?

377
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,443
We could bop
on Air Force One.

It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and
bop back.
