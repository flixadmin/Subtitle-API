3
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,021
Listen to me.

4
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,982
OK, you win.

5
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:53,029
At least you could stop that song.
You know I hate it.

6
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,783
Why are you so quiet?

7
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,747
Say something!

8
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,119
You're there.

9
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,037
And you're looking at me.

10
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,416
Do you think you can fool me?

11
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,711
No, no, you can't fool me,

12
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,630
because I can feel your presence.

13
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,800
And your movements.

14
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,011
I can even smell you.

15
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,054
If you think...

16
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,640
If you think, son of a bitch,

17
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,476
that I'll hang myself
while you watch, you...

18
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,501
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

19
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,795
Julia, what's wrong?

20
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,007
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.

21
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,884
Take it easy, Julia.

22
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,845
Julia, are you OK?

23
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,305
- What happened?
- She fell.

24
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,683
- Call a doctor, quick!
- No, I'm OK.

25
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,977
I'm OK.

26
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,986
This is Sara. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please...

27
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,951
Do you think it's a good idea
to show up after six months?

28
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,536
I just need to know
that she is all right.

29
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,040
Sara?

30
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,127
Sara?

31
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,507
Maybe they have gone out.

32
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,967
No...

33
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,344
I know something's happened to her.

34
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,107
The power is out.

35
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,321
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- I'll look upstairs.

36
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,577
Sara?

37
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,921
Sara?

38
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,740
Isaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbors.

39
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,242
- Don't come down.
- Why?

40
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,913
What's wrong?

41
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,586
Isaac, tell me what's wrong.

42
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,672
- What's wrong?
- Julia...

43
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,175
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

44
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,147
Inspector...

45
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,816
I'm sorry about what happened.

46
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,735
No, thanks.

47
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,531
The forensics say Sara took her own life
last night, during the blackout.

48
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,784
But we need to find out why.

49
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,370
I have been informed that she suffered
a degenerative disease.

50
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,250
Yes, a progressive vision loss,
the same as my wife.

51
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,754
But Sara went blind a year ago.

52
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,090
And how did she cope with that?

53
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,302
My sister wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

54
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,596
In fact, she was...

55
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,390
She was going to have surgery, right?

56
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,728
She was waiting for a donor,
but she hoped to get her vision back.

57
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,363
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

58
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,729
All right.

59
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,401
Yes, thank you.

60
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,159
Dr Román can't come to the funeral,
and he sends his condolences.

61
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,912
He also wants to check your eyes
before you go back home.

62
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,124
Isaac, the power is back.

63
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,712
Darling, are you listening?

64
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,798
And the CD started playing.
Did you hear it?

65
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,969
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange

66
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,222
that Sara was listening
to music before...?

67
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,683
Besides, she hated that song.

68
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,394
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

69
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,314
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.

70
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,693
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

71
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,321
It's strange.
I need to know what happened.

72
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,033
- It's not good for you to get upset.
- I'm not worried about myself.

73
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:58,579
Well, I am.
Stress can turn you blind.

74
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,582
It's only happened to me
twice in five years.

75
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,627
And you've lost 20% of your vision.

76
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,097
Oh, no... Again.

77
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,199
Did you find anything?

78
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,160
Nothing, not even a candle.

79
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,289
- It's time to meet the neighbors.
- OK, hurry up.

80
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,815
Isaac?

81
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,214
Julia.

82
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,082
Excuse me.

83
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,419
Excuse me.

84
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,594
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm Blasco, her next-door neighbor.

85
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,555
I didn't know your sister very well,

86
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:26,769
but Lia loved her very much
and she wanted me to bring you this.

87
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,645
Lia?

88
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,816
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.

89
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:38,113
The poor girl is so upset she didn't
want to come out of the car.

90
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,241
Anyway...

91
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,955
Sorry... Lia would like to know
if Sara left any note.

92
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,960
- We don't know.
- I understand.

93
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,756
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.

94
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,722
Shall we continue?

95
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,183
Only a neighbor and his daughter?

96
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,105
I didn't know she was so lonely.

97
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,493
But I forgave her.

98
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,124
And I also forgave you.

99
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,841
Now I only need to forgive myself
for not being by her side.

100
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:51,103
But I did everything I could,
didn't I, Isaac?

101
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,247
The autopsy doesn't reveal
anything strange.

102
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:15,169
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.

103
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,171
OK, but...

104
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
That song...

105
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,842
And what about what happened
in the cemetery?

106
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,805
Julia, there's no evidence
of anyone being with your sister.

107
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,350
And nobody has seen or heard
anything suspicious.

108
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,689
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.

109
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,942
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.

110
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,280
Apparently, she helped your sister
when she went blind.

111
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,908
Don't be long.

112
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,582
Where does she live?

113
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,752
Follow the rope in the yard.

114
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,253
What rope?

115
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,935
I'm sure the old woman
doesn't know anything.

116
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,230
Nobody else knew apart from you.

117
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:21,193
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.

118
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,905
I'll wait for the right moment.

119
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,186
Mrs Soledad?

120
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,403
Hello?

121
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,157
Who is it?

122
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,285
It's Julia, Sara's sister.

123
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,120
I'll be right out.

124
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,921
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.

125
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,509
Hello...

126
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,723
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, I didn't know you were...

127
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,894
I am sorry too. I wanted to come
to your sister's funeral, but...

128
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,106
it took me an hour to find
a pair of matching shoes.

129
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,774
It's OK.

130
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,819
Were you a good friend of Sara?

131
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,781
Well, when she started
losing her eyesight,

132
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,828
a year ago,
we used to have long conversations.

133
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,375
But lately she hardly spoke with me.

134
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,878
She had made new friends.

135
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:07,466
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.

136
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,845
- From the Baumann Centre.
- Baumann Centre. What's that?

137
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,681
A centre for blind people,
not far from here.

138
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:21,063
One of those places where they make you
believe you can live a normal life.

139
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,901
If you can't hear, you are deaf.
If you lost an arm, you are a cripple.

140
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,862
And if you can't see, you are blind.

141
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,948
And nothing can ever be
how it used to be.

142
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,244
Mrs Soledad, where can I take a taxi?

143
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,080
Thank you.

144
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,421
Go straight ahead,
down the stairs and turn right.

145
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,653
Poor Sara.

146
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:13,156
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.

147
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,118
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.

148
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,995
None of us could stand her.

149
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,748
Don't you find it strange?

150
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,291
No.

151
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,502
We've all thought
of doing it at some time.

152
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,630
Dela...

153
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,259
Nora is right. I once thought
of slitting my wrists.

154
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,804
With candles and opera music.

155
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,598
Me too, I thought of jumping
out of the window.

156
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,810
Well, we thought about it
but didn't do it.

157
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,980
There's a reason to live.

158
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,941
Maybe Sara didn't find any.

159
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:52,529
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like
a good reason?

160
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,906
Sara had a boyfriend?

161
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,033
She told me she met a boy.

162
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,244
- Who?
- No idea.

163
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,956
They had been going out together
for a couple of months.

164
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,376
They even went to Bellavista
together for a week.

165
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,548
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.

166
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,343
Quiet!

167
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,563
How weird! Shit!

168
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,398
What is it?

169
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,026
There's someone here.

170
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,863
- I would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!

171
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,576
- I can smell her too.
- Something is moving.

172
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:44,122
- I've got her! Call security!
- I'm Sara's sister.

173
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,874
Julia?

174
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,918
Yes.

175
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:52,130
- Why were you spying on us?
- I just didn't want to interrupt.

176
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,133
- And who is he?
- Who?

177
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,552
- The man who came with you.
- I came alone.

178
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,889
There's someone else here.

179
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,850
A man, and he's right behind you.

180
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,288
Wait!

181
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,962
Who are you?

182
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,673
Turn around.

183
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,635
Turn around.

184
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,345
I said turn around!

185
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,300
No, no!

186
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,572
Isaac?

187
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,455
Isaac?

188
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,599
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.

189
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,770
What happened to you?

190
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,398
You are soaking wet.

191
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,317
It started raining
when I left Soledad's house.

192
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,487
Have you been with her all this time?

193
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,117
She invited me for tea.
I couldn't say no.

194
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:54,456
Julia, I went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.

195
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,167
Where have you been?

196
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,502
Why are you so controlling?

197
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,338
I could also ask you
what you're looking for.

198
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,135
Fine.

199
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,971
Fine.

200
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,808
Now I'm certain there was
something strange in Sara's suicide.

201
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:18,646
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.

202
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,106
Who?

203
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,278
Her boyfriend.

204
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,489
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.

205
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,656
Who told you?

206
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,201
A group of blind girls told me
at the Baumann Centre

207
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,161
and someone was spying on us.

208
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,955
- How do you know?
- Because I ran after him.

209
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,167
- You ran after him?
- Yes, I did.

210
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,919
Isaac.

211
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:45,006
- Isaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

212
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,760
Listen to me. If I have to be
a controlling husband, I will be.

213
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,137
And if I have to drag you out of here,
I will too.

214
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,099
But I won't let you have a seizure.

215
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,143
You know I would never
forgive myself.

216
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,230
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.

217
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,073
You're right.

218
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,660
But I don't feel like
going back home.

219
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:18,039
Why don't we go somewhere,
you and me, alone?

220
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,802
Where would you like to go?

221
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,664
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the coziest hotel.

222
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,800
Nice view, isn't it?

223
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,430
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. It's beautiful.

224
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,973
Thank you.

225
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,517
Julia...

226
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,937
- I'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.

227
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,152
You don't remember my sister,
a blind woman?

228
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,988
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.

229
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,740
This may sound weird,

230
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:37,076
but could you find out
the name of the man who was with her?

231
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,956
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but I don't remember any man.

232
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,291
The thing is...

233
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,377
my sister is dead,
and I need to find this man.

234
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,505
Let me see... I don't understand.

235
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,258
Her booking is not registered.

236
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,970
It's as if all the information
was deleted.

237
00:25:56,138 --> 00:26:00,600
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. It must be a computer problem.

238
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:06,272
You could try El Arlequin. It's the
restaurant we recommend to our guests.

239
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,941
Thank you.

240
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,150
Thank you.

241
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,659
Thank you.

242
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,329
I don't understand how they can
recommend this restaurant.

243
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,414
I like it.

244
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,461
It's not your style at all.

245
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,593
And that waiter
won't stop staring at you.

246
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,470
Really?

247
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,312
- It's your imagination.
- Maybe.

248
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,654
- My reading glasses...
- In your coat? How weird.

249
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,325
I'll go and get them,
and I'll go to the toilet too.

250
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,038
If he hits on you, just yell.

251
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,759
What a change!

252
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:21,973
I like it. It highlights your eyes.
By the way, I knew they were green.

253
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,436
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.

254
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,563
With her boyfriend.

255
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,189
Her boyfriend?

256
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,734
She came with a man, didn't she?

257
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,820
Yes, I think so.

258
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,074
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.

259
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,161
He was very quiet, very sad.

260
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,540
- Could you describe him?
- Sure, he was...

261
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,252
He was very plain,
like any other man.

262
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,589
But was he tall, short,
blond hair, dark hair?

263
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,802
I can't remember right now.

264
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,847
How can you remember my sister
but nothing about the man?

265
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:07,143
She drew a bit of attention
with that blindfold.

266
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,438
Blindfold?

267
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,733
She was bandaged after the operation.

268
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,448
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.

269
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,617
Hence the bet over her eye color.

270
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,911
She said she'd come
once she'd recovered,

271
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,246
and if I guessed her eye color,
I could...

272
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,124
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.

273
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,543
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.

274
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,095
I couldn't find them.

275
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,307
Let's see how I manage.

276
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,981
Is something wrong?

277
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,989
Sara was here last week.

278
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,163
Julia... what are we doing here?

279
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,668
Isaac, the waiter told me
she had her eyes bandaged.

280
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,128
Do you realize?

281
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,508
If she had the operation and had
a chance to regain her sight,

282
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,719
why would she commit suicide?

283
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,681
Tell me why.

284
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,858
Because the operation didn't work.

285
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,611
What?

286
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,322
It didn't work.

287
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,161
Dr Román told me yesterday.

288
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,295
I was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

289
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,901
That man exists.

290
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,778
Julia, Julia.

291
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,823
- Anything else I should know?
- I was only trying to protect you.

292
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,868
- From what?
- From the truth.

293
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,578
What's the truth?

294
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,875
Sara committed suicide because
she couldn't stand being blind.

295
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,260
Julia.

296
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,638
Julia.

297
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,519
Did you know she came here
with her boyfriend?

298
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,270
That doesn't prove anything.

299
00:30:56,438 --> 00:31:01,943
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?

300
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,820
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.

301
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:10,826
Maybe he left her when he found out
she'd never recover her sight.

302
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,706
That easy?

303
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,583
That easy, right?

304
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,127
- Well...
- I can't believe you're a psychologist.

305
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,421
Julia!

306
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,300
God!

307
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,139
What are you doing?

308
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,683
Julia, Julia.

309
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,601
Didn't you see the car?

310
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,318
You didn't see it, did you?

311
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,577
How many seizures have you had?

312
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:53,828
Two.

313
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,122
Shit!

314
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,166
Shit.

315
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,509
If...

316
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:14,056
- If I go blind... When I go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.

317
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,270
Not wanting it
doesn't mean it won't happen.

318
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,695
Isaac...

319
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,492
One time you told me that...

320
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,457
...when you looked into my eyes,
you could see the entire universe.

321
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,713
- I still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?

322
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,262
Close your eyes.

323
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,140
What?

324
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,309
Close your eyes.

325
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,276
Can you see me?

326
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,905
Of course I can't.

327
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,576
Then how do you know
I'm still here with you?

328
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,245
Because I can hear you.

329
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,000
What if I remain silent?

330
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,836
How do you know I'm still here?

331
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,770
I can touch you.

332
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,067
And you can smell me.

333
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,780
And kiss you.

334
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,932
Promise me that when the day comes,
we will go back to the desert.

335
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,601
What?

336
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,770
You know?

337
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:29,275
The last thing I'd like to see
is that sky, with you.

338
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,320
- Julia...
- Promise me.

339
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,031
Promise me.

340
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,493
I promise you.

341
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,247
But...

342
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,000
But you have to promise me...

343
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,546
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.

344
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,383
And that we will go and see Dr Román.

345
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,178
Tomorrow.

346
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,806
OK.

347
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:22,036
I'll bring the luggage to the car.
I'll wait for you outside.

348
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:23,537
In 15 minutes.

349
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,340
Ms Levin.

350
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,928
Ms Levin.

351
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,556
I'm really sorry for your loss.

352
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,310
My name is Créspulo.

353
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,939
I read about your sister
in the obituaries section of the newspaper.

354
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,649
Thank you.

355
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,068
I have something of hers.

356
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,490
A few hours after your sister left,

357
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,162
I found a key in her room,
under the bed.

358
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,083
I think I put it here somewhere.

359
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,927
Thank you.

360
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,108
Mr Créspulo.

361
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,277
I'm sorry.

362
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,281
Mr Créspulo...

363
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,867
My sister came here with a man,
didn't she?

364
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,452
The invisible man.

365
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,124
I beg your pardon?

366
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:56,672
Nobody remembers the man
who came with your sister, right?

367
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,468
Well...

368
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,929
That doesn't mean he is invisible.

369
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,724
There are people with no light.

370
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:11,186
Do you know what it's like to walk in
somewhere and not be noticed?

371
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,568
Or to walk on the street
and have people stumble against you?

372
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:24,825
Or to ask something for the third time
and have no one answer your question?

373
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,494
That's the man you're looking for.

374
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,081
A pause, a vacuum.

375
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,001
An absence.

376
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,796
That's why nobody remembers him.

377
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,674
Nobody except you.

378
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,972
In a way, I am also invisible.

379
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,311
It's been many years since the last time
someone remembered me.

380
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,190
This man...

381
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,193
do you know where I can find him?

382
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,740
What are you afraid of?

383
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:10,663
He parked his van in a car park
two blocks down the street.

384
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,710
There's a CCTV camera
recording 24 hours a day.

385
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,005
Thank you.

386
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,966
Wait!

387
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,509
Be careful.

388
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:29,098
The man who was with your sister
had very angry eyes.

389
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,017
He knows how to be a shadow.

390
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,563
If someone feels invisible
and is angry at the world,

391
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,732
he can be dangerous.

392
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,318
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.

393
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,947
He could sneak up on you and...

394
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,725
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?

395
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,603
- I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.

396
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,857
He's here.
And I know how to find him.

397
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,238
- No!
- What are you doing?

398
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,033
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?

399
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,660
- Calm down!
- Wait here.

400
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,954
Don't be so rude!

401
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,291
I remind you
that you made a promise last night.

402
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,001
- Enough.
- I can't take it anymore!

403
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,503
- I said don't yell at me!
- I've had it!

404
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,797
There's no mystery in Sara's death!

405
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,217
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.

406
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,055
But this shit ends
right here, right now, all right?

407
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,662
You've reached...

408
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,564
Excuse me.

409
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:46,235
Has anyone been here
asking about security videos?

410
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,655
Look... I don't want any trouble, OK?

411
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,908
That guy came, gave me some money
and I promised to keep my mouth shut.

412
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,203
He is my husband.
I've been waiting for a while.

413
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,914
Do you know which way he went out?

414
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:04,211
He left as soon as my little friend
made the copies he wanted.

415
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,046
And...

416
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,215
Was there anyone else here?

417
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,300
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

418
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,263
We can check the monitors
in case we see something.

419
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,849
What the hell?

420
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,898
I'll be right back.

421
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,697
Goddammit!

422
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,408
What's wrong?

423
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,167
Calm down. It's me.

424
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,377
Someone has switched off the power.

425
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,591
It's impossible.

426
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,427
It's impossible.

427
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,580
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.

428
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:25,459
OK, the only thing we know is that
someone stole some CCTV footage.

429
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:30,839
No, I've already told you.
It was the man who was with my sister.

430
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,967
You have to find him
before it's too late.

431
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:39,181
How can we find someone
that nobody has seen, not even you?

432
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,729
Créspulo.

433
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,905
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.

434
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,908
...the only who could recognize
the invisible man.

435
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,995
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?

436
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,497
My husband is in danger!

437
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,041
- Calm down, madam!
- Isaac!

438
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,544
Call a doctor, quick.

439
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,547
We need a doctor down here.

440
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:58,719
Isaac.

441
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,404
The process is irreversible.

442
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,281
How long do I have?

443
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,660
I don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.

444
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,747
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.

445
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,791
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

446
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,752
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?

447
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,465
No, I didn't know him.

448
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,386
Julia, I know you're going through
a hard time,

449
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,514
but you have to think about yourself.

450
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,727
So, please,
try to avoid emotional stress.

451
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,314
And don't force your eyes. OK?

452
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,912
Iván. Iván.

453
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,470
A boyfriend?

454
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:26,932
Sara never told me
about any boyfriends.

455
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,726
She didn't trust men.

456
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,937
Unlike me.

457
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,898
- Or you.
- Isaac hasn't left me, I'm sure.

458
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,026
That's what all women think.

459
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,447
I also came up with a story
when my husband left me.

460
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,576


461
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:50,163
And my son was more important
than anything else.

462
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:55,794
Then my eyes started to degenerate
and I went blind.

463
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,381


464
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:03,427
until I woke up one morning...

465
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,637
and he was gone.

466
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,848
My son was gone.

467
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,644
What kind of son abandons
a blind mother?

468
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,022
I had to come up with a story.

469
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,859
And I still keep to it.

470
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,071
Such humiliation!
I'm sorry.

471
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,207
Hello?

472
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,711
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.

473
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,547
Guests check in through a machine.

474
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:44,217
They called from the bank this morning
to inform me about a transaction

475
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,553
with your husband's credit card.

476
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:51,558
I searched the room
and found this on the bedside table.

477
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,896
Julia, there's things about your husband
you don't know.

478
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:01,359
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...

479
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,280
The doctor didn't talk to anybody
about the surgery.

480
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,409
How did your husband know?

481
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:15,707
Inspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.

482
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,256
Isaac?

483
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,302
Wait here. Don't move.

484
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,127
Isaac?

485
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,149
Hello?

486
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,362
Isaac?

487
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,327
Isaac?

488
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,841
Julia!

489
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,928
Shit! I have to get out of here.

490
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,140
Where is it? Stay calm.

491
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,185
Where is the door? Stay calm.

492
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,148
Julia? Julia?

493
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,322
Inspector! There's somebody
down here. Inspector!

494
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,952
Julia, calm down. It's me.

495
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,499
There's somebody here.

496
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,045
There's somebody here.

497
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,432
What's wrong?

498
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,059
What's wrong?

499
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,897
Turn on the torch.
I hate darkness.

500
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,693
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

501
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,378
Thank you.

502
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,091
Hi.

503
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:18,014
There's something
you should know, Julia.

504
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,434
Your husband left a letter.

505
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:26,439
We checked the handwriting
and there is no doubt it's his.

506
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,234
Listen...

507
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,155
Sara and Isaac
had been lovers for six months.

508
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,617
He apologizes in the letter.

509
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:44,124
That explains the numerous calls to her
we found on his mobile phone.

510
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,254
Did you know
they were in touch lately?

511
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,433
Think, Julia.

512
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,645
Did Isaac insist on getting the video?

513
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:10,316
Probably because he didn't want you
to see him on it.

514
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:17,323
Then he went back to the motel and
decided he couldn't live without Sara.

515
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,663
I'm sorry, but everything makes sense.

516
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,597
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

517
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,099
You just have to sign here.

518
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,816
Thank you.

519
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,672
Calm down, Julia!

520
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:19,135
Calm down. Sleep a bit more.

521
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:25,683
OK, Julia... Everything went well.

522
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,229
But we have to be careful now.

523
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,650
You eyes must be protected
from the light for two weeks.

524
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,402
And don't manipulate
the bandages yourself.

525
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,698
If you remove them too soon,
there won't be a solution.

526
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,369
But don't worry,
you will be taken care of.

527
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,329
No.

528
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,415
I'd rather go home.
I hate hospitals.

529
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,335
I know,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

530
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:57,382
- You need supervision.
- I could... go to my sister's house.

531
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,260
I know my way around it very well.

532
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,098
Julia, honestly,
I don't think it's a good idea.

533
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:09,060
Right, but if I can't see, I can't feel.

534
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:16,192
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.

535
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,572
But a care worker will visit you
every day, OK?

536
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:29,539
Julia, there's something else.

537
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,794
Your husband's body is still here.
I can take care of it if you want.

538
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,754
No.

539
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:41,467
I'd rather do it myself.

540
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:45,805
Could you keep the body
until I can see again?

541
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,808
I need to say goodbye to him.

542
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,988
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.

543
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,073
Keep walking...

544
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,243
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

545
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,998
- Careful. Don't worry.
- No problem.

546
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,922
Shall we wait here
until the care worker arrives?

547
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,883
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure. What is it?

548
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,552
I'd like to know what this key opens.

549
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,816
Whatever it is this key opens,
it's not here.

550
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,195
- Did you try every lock?
- I did.

551
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,697
Do you need anything else?

552
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,574
No, thank you.

553
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,369
- You can go.
- All right.

554
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,107
- Hello?
- Hi.

555
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:04,485
You must be Julia.
I'm Iván, the care worker.

556
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:08,614
Sorry I'm late. The traffic was bad.
I phoned you, but it got cut off.

557
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,454
I would have preferred a woman.

558
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,500
If you want to call Dr Román...
What happened to your hand?

559
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:28,217
It's just a scratch. You won't
feel anything tomorrow morning.

560
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:33,639
I will make you dinner
and clean up a bit. You stay here.

561
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,267
By the way...

562
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,688
What should I do with the glasses?

563
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,440
Throw them out.

564
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,198
While you ate,
I familiarized myself with the house.

565
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,658
Julia.

566
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,623
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. I have to go.

567
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,625
What time is it?

568
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,835
It's nine o'clock.

569
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,463
On the first days,
we lose track of time.

570
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:10,176
I'll give you a couple
of sleeping pills, just in case.

571
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,221
And also a pager.

572
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:17,183
If you want to contact me,
press this button. Give me your hand.

573
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,436
Look, here's the button.

574
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,238
Let's go.

575
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,199
- What are you doing?
- I have to put you to bed.

576
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:37,620
- Sorry, but I can do it myself.
- Are you sure?

577
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,381
Are you OK?

578
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,884
OK, you win.

579
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,137
Put me to bed and then you can go.

580
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,998
Who's there?

581
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,672
Calm down.
Calm down, darling.

582
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,341
It's me.

583
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,302
Isaac?

584
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,388
Isaac?

585
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,683
How can this be?

586
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,733
Don't say anything.

587
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,819
Thank you.

588
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,492
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.

589
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,163
- So you can see me better.
- No!

590
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,000
That's it, that's it.

591
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,129
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!

592
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:16,385
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.

593
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,892
Don't move.

594
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,061
No, stop!

595
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,648
Get off me!

596
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,353
Iván. Iván.

597
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,689
Julia, is everything OK?

598
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,526
- I think there's someone in the house.
- What?

599
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,945
In the room next door.

600
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:20,366
- Don't move. I'll call the police.
- No, Iván, Iván.

601
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,507
Are you still there?

602
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,554
You have to get me out of here
right now.

603
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:45,057
- Where are you?
- In the guest room.

604
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,977
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.

605
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,440
Find the door to your right.

606
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,110
- He's there.
- Calm down.

607
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,113
The handrail is in front of you.
Look for it.

608
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,781
OK, yes.

609
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,242
Hold onto the handrail.

610
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,412
Go down the six steps
to the first landing.

611
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,793
Then there's nine more.

612
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,797
Julia...

613
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:23,095
- I'm downstairs. What now?
- Follow the wall to the door.

614
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,313
Who are you?
Who are you?

615
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,273
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

616
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,109
Get out of the house! Quick!

617
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,129
There is no indication
that someone entered the house.

618
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,966
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.

619
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,637
Sorry, but there's nothing else
I can do.

620
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,726
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?

621
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,647
Maybe you shouldn't recover here,
considering what you've been through.

622
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,649
You don't believe me either.

623
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:22,279
I'm just saying that in your situation,
it's normal if your senses deceive you.

624
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,658
Don't open your eyes now.

625
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,578
You can let go now.

626
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,998
What's the matter?

627
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,877
My eyes could get damaged, right?

628
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:41,841
No, I only want to change the bandage,
and I took precautions.

629
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,094
I've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.

630
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,268
You know, when I was 20 years old,

631
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,521
I had a car accident
and I was blind for two months.

632
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:03,529
And like you now,
I imagined things and had nightmares.

633
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,157
And I rejected the care worker's help.

634
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,537
I couldn't stand the idea
of going blind.

635
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,212
In the end, I recovered my sight.

636
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:25,718
But during those months...

637
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,264
...I understood what it was like
to live in the dark.

638
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:36,729
That's why I became a care worker.

639
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,274
You made that up
to make me feel better.

640
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:43,986
No, no. Call the hospital
if you don't believe me.

641
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:50,159
Julia, I know you're scared,
but the only way to lose that fear

642
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,244
is to fight it.

643
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,836
What do you say?

644
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,257
Will you let me help you?

645
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,477
- What happened?
- You spilled it.

646
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:20,356
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

647
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,111
And after the glass cabinet...

648
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,305
Well, I have my ups and downs.

649
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,724
But I slept very well
the last few nights.

650
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,144
Iván has been
very patient with me all week.

651
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,355
Yes, he takes good care of me.

652
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,650
I will. I will, yes.

653
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,902
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.

654
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:12,283
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. It's a little late.

655
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,493
Why don't stay a bit longer?

656
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,830
A little while.

657
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,249
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

658
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,167
No, it's not that.

659
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,795
Never mind.

660
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,383
OK, should I make
a special dinner for two?

661
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,597
- Go and watch TV. I'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.

662
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:59,288
Aren't you drinking too much?

663
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,041
I'm celebrating.

664
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,709
What?

665
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:07,546
That in four days,

666
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,966
I will have the bandages removed
and I will see again.

667
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,720
Everything will be all right, Julia.

668
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,140
You know,

669
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:22,478
if the operation doesn't work,
I couldn't complain.

670
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,231
I have seen everything I wanted to see.

671
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:31,070
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

672
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,198
Funny!

673
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,784
How ironic that you ask me that.

674
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,619
Why?

675
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:45,125
Because I spent my whole life
looking for invisible planets.

676
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:48,504
My eyes have seen amazing things.

677
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:55,260
But nothing can compare
to the sky in the Sahara.

678
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,766
That's where I met Isaac.

679
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:06,188
We were on the same excursion
and we spent the whole night...

680
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,858
...staring at the sky.

681
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:15,239
I asked him, "Is that not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?"

682
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,409
And he said, "Yes."

683
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,458
When I turned my head,

684
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:31,213
I realized that he'd been watching me
for a while and I got nervous.

685
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,299
And I asked him...

686
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,972
..."Why aren't you watching
the universe?"

687
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,769
And he said,
"I don't have to look up to do it."

688
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:50,441
"I can see the universe in your eyes."

689
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,570
And what happened?

690
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,283
I came close.

691
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:02,161
I touched him.

692
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:06,457
And I realized that he was nervous too.

693
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,211
In that moment it was as if
we became one person.

694
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,256
And I wanted to know
if he felt the same.

695
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,675
What did he say?

696
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,386
Nothing.

697
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,599
He replied with his gaze.

698
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,392
Why?

699
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,229
Why did he look at me that way? Why?

700
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:34,693
- Do you prefer I hadn't done it?
- I don't know.

701
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:40,866
When you had the affair with Sara,
I thought it was just an indiscretion,

702
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,328
but I swear I don't know
what to think any more.

703
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,414
I don't know what to think.

704
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:53,545
Everything will be all right, Julia.

705
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,549
You promise?

706
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,220
I promise.

707
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,031
No, I can't.

708
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,283
I can't do it.

709
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,911
It's not right.

710
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,086
- Iván.
- Don't say anything.

711
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,714
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.

712
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,259
I'll call the hospital
and ask to be replaced.

713
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,177
Is that what you want?

714
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,597
And you?

715
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:56,525
OK, I'll come back tomorrow and...

716
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,362
If not, just contact me on my pager.

717
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,372
Help! Help!

718
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,167
Help!

719
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:43,048
Calm down!
I'm Blasco, the neighbor! Lia's father!

720
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,676
Call the police, please!

721
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,429
Calm down!
You need a drink.

722
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:53,266
No, no.
Call the police, please.

723
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,479
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?

724
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:01,775
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.

725
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,777
I swear, this time it's true.

726
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,738
And what did he want?
To rape you?

727
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,367
It's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.

728
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,703
I told you not to sneak up on people!

729
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,913
Go back to your bed!

730
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,749
And close the door!

731
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,085
Mr Blasco...

732
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,422
Can you call now, please?

733
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,303
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

734
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,434
How strange.
There's no line.

735
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,938
Calm down.

736
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:42,232
I'll get the mobile phone.

737
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:23,815
The mobile is out of battery.
It will take a few minutes to charge.

738
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:30,072
Sit down, sit down.

739
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,449
Sit down.

740
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,534
What do you say?

741
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:40,540
Do you want something to drink
while we wait?

742
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,628
- What do you say?
- Could I have a glass of water?

743
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:49,758
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.

744
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:10,153
Julia, where are you going?

745
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:12,614
Hey!

746
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:14,950
Hey!

747
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,829
Madam!
Where are you, madam?

748
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,831
Madam!

749
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,709
Please, pick up.

750
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,170
Iván.

751
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,256
Pick up, please.

752
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,465
Julia, what's wrong?

753
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,814
- Julia!
- Iván!

754
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:49,359
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.

755
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,862
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.

756
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:54,698
Please. Take me to your place.

757
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,118
OK.

758
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,538
OK, thanks. Bye.

759
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,584
What did they say?

760
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,880
Inspector Dimas
won't be on duty until seven.

761
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:15,594
You should get some rest
and I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

762
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,681
Julia, I won't let anyone hurt you.

763
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:22,851
You can sleep in my bed.

764
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,812
- And you?
- I have a mattress. I'll be right back.

765
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:30,275
- No, no.
- I'll be right back. You're safe here.

766
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,152
I'll be back in a minute.

767
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,586
Iván?

768
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,170
- Who are you?
- I'm Lia.

769
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,922
- Who are you?
- Lia Blasco.

770
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,966
Don't get close.
How did you find me?

771
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,427
- I followed you. I was Sara's friend.
- I said don't come close.

772
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,348
Listen, my father
has nothing to do with all this.

773
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:47,435
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.

774
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,853
I don't believe you.

775
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,607
I was the one who took the key
and have been spying on you.

776
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,651
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?

777
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,612
- What?
- Sara also had them.

778
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:02,409
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage
off and piercing her eyes with needles.

779
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,035
There's a monster on the street,

780
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,788
but no one can see him
because he hides in the darkness.

781
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,165
He made Sara go blind
and will do the same with you.

782
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,875
- Stop!
- It's him.

783
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,713
I followed him and tried the key.
And today I saw the needles again.

784
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,049
- It's him, Julia. It's the care worker.
- No.

785
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,928
Listen to me!

786
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,516
Do you really think Isaac
killed himself? He loved you.

787
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:31,062
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.

788
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,857
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.

789
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:36,568
Isaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.

790
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:40,655
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!

791
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,615
This one does.

792
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,411
He collects pictures.

793
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:50,999
His wall is covered
with pictures of you and Sara.

794
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:55,337
- He removed your eyes.
- Lia, that's enough!

795
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,921
Leave me alone!

796
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,759
What are you doing?

797
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,014
Use the key if you don't believe me.

798
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,226
The key. Where's the key?

799
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,562
- He took it.
- No, you took it.

800
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:16,524
- Why me?
- I don't know. To protect your father.

801
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:20,236
- It's him. Don't tell him I'm here.
- Lia. Lia.

802
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,450
Iván?

803
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,203
Julia, what are you doing?

804
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,663
I'm really nervous.

805
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,125
I'll make you a cup of tea.

806
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,127
It will help you relax.

807
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,464
- Iván...
- Yes?

808
01:18:40,508 --> 01:18:45,220
I can't find the key. It's the only
evidence to incriminate Blasco.

809
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,139
Did you take it?

810
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,738
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.

811
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,116
I'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.

812
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,869
I'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.

813
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,423
He's lying. He had the key.

814
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:24,092
- We have to get out of here.
- I don't want to.

815
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,846
- You don't believe me now?
- It's impossible. He is a care worker.

816
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:33,226
Shit! It's locked.

817
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:36,438
- Julia!
- Yes?

818
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:40,275
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.

819
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,531
He wants to drug you and make you blind.

820
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:47,824
What are you saying?

821
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:50,326
- Can you take this off?
- No. Why?

822
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:55,039
Then we can't get out of the window.
I need to get the key.

823
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:58,418
Get rid of him
and wait for me in the bathroom.

824
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,881
Here you go.

825
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:07,385
I'll take you to bed
and wait until you fall asleep.

826
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,018
I need to go to the bathroom.

827
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:18,146
OK.

828
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,651
Thank you.

829
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:04,692
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?

830
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,945
I don't know. I heard it too.

831
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,531
I thought something had happened to you.

832
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,701
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- I'll be right out.

833
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:21,668
Lia, please.

834
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,631
Four days left. Only four days.

835
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,302
Four days, four days.

836
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,486
Julia, I have to go down again.
Are you OK?

837
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,197
Yes, I'll be right out.

838
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:13,488
Lia.

839
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,074
Lia.

840
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:50,608
What are you doing here?

841
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,822
Why are you crying?

842
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,535
Please, answer me.

843
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:06,249
A girl called Lia came to see me.

844
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,668
Blasco's daughter.

845
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:10,962
And she made me very nervous.

846
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:15,049
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- I couldn't see anything.

847
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,762
She told me horrible things about you
and I was afraid.

848
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:22,056
About me?

849
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,727
You would never hurt me, would you?

850
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,479
No.

851
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,982
I had to...

852
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,318
I had to see your face to know it.

853
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,989
And what did you see?

854
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:46,831
Nothing. I can't see anything.

855
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,483
Are you sure you can't see anything?

856
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,369
Sometimes the eyes
take time to adjust.

857
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:41,427
The operation didn't work.

858
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,395
I'm really sorry, Julia.

859
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:59,195
Probably the girl lied to you
in order to protect her father.

860
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:05,243
Tomorrow... we'll speak with
the inspector and all this will be over.

861
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,412
No. No.

862
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:11,707
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.

863
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,419
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr Román.

864
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,632
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.

865
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,594
Dr Román?

866
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:27,765
It's Iván. Sorry to wake you
at this time of night.

867
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,601
I have a problem with Julia Levin.

868
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,481
She took the bandage off by accident.

869
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:48,828
I understand. I will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

870
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:51,289
What did he say?

871
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,417
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.

872
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:58,796
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. Román said you have to rest.

873
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:04,343
- I need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.

874
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:07,513
But if you don't do as I say,
it will be irreversible.

875
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,315
OK.

876
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,766
Why did you get up?

877
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:56,812
- The kettle was whistling.
- I'll do it. You sit down.

878
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,231
Be careful.

879
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,527
Very good.

880
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,040
This is nearly ready.

881
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,392
Here you are.

882
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,769
Thank you.

883
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:54,996
What's the matter?

884
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,211
Why are you doing all this, Iván?

885
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:10,886
What do you mean?

886
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,472
Why all this attention?

887
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,644
What do you want from me?

888
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,732
Well, Julia...

889
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,571
When...

890
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,906
When you kissed me...

891
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,620
I didn't expect it.

892
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:41,584
I didn't expect it, but don't think
I don't like you because...

893
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,044
because that's not true.

894
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,884
I only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.

895
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:53,929
And some wounds need to heal.

896
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:58,392
What I'm trying to say is...

897
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:02,063
...I want to be with you.

898
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,570
Drink your tea.

899
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,506
Did you put sugar in it?

900
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,887
I'll bring some.

901
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:04,333
Two teaspoons, right?

902
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:07,044
As usual.

903
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,511
Done?

904
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:32,361
Can you come with me, please?

905
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:39,201
- Why?
- I need your help with the freezer.

906
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:43,747
Come. Let's go. Leave this here.

907
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,442
Open the freezer.

908
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,194
Why?

909
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:15,446
Just do it.

910
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,284
Open the freezer, I said.

911
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,358
Liar.

912
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,465
Are you afraid?

913
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:31,021
You don't know what fear is!

914
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:37,361
You have no idea what fear is!

915
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:38,821
Real fear.

916
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:41,282
Fear of being ignored and rejected.

917
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,368
Look at me. Look at me!

918
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:48,080
You don't know what it's like to live
in the dark and hide in another world.

919
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:54,295
A world full of silence,
getting used to measuring your steps.

920
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,090
Always wearing
the appropriate clothes.

921
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:01,510
Making your voice one voice and none.

922
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,389
And your eyes, two eyes and none.

923
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:09,601
It takes so long that eventually
you become a shadow.

924
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:14,148
But one day you find out that
blind girls realize that you're there,

925
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:18,360
that you're breathing,
that you are still alive.

926
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:24,074
That you can offer them your eyes
for theirs, your hands for theirs...

927
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:27,536
That's why our relationship
is so perfect.

928
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:29,496
That's why...

929
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:32,833
...we have to continue this way.

930
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,883
If you are not Iván, who are you?

931
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:43,719
Where are you taking me?

932
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:47,348
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.

933
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,684
Take the bandage off, please.

934
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:53,270
Please.

935
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,106
Please, take it off.

936
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:59,568
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.

937
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:01,612
Shut up!

938
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,783
I beg you.

939
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,091
Let me see.

940
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,469
Let me see.

941
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:31,975
It's started again, right?

942
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,275
This time...

943
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:43,487
...it will be more intense.

944
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:01,338
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.

945
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:04,842
Open the door, Julia.

946
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:13,809
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

947
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,937
Open the fucking door!

948
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,981
Julia!

949
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:20,732
Julia!

950
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:22,693
Julia!

951
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:28,490
Julia!

952
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,445
Who's there?

953
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,948
Is the main door locked?

954
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,117
- Is that you, Julia? You scared me.
- Is it locked?

955
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:56,995
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?

956
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,873
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?

957
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,292
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

958
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:06,797
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.

959
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:08,924
Don't move.

960
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,926
Be quiet.

961
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:13,178
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

962
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:23,146
- It's him. He's here.
- Who?

963
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:26,316
Don't come any closer,
you son of a bitch.

964
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:30,195
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.

965
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:33,490
He made Sara go blind
and he wants to do the same to me.

966
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:37,286
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.

967
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:39,413
Soledad, call the police.

968
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:42,499
- Call the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.

969
01:38:44,002 --> 01:38:45,711


970
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,297
Is that you, son?

971
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,010
Yes.

972
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,761
I'm back home.

973
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,265
This woman says you're chasing her.

974
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,350
This woman is crazy.

975
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:05,772
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.

976
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,691
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

977
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:10,611
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.

978
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,615
- It must have been easy to hang her.
- I loved Sara.

979
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:18,410
She killed herself because she wasn't
capable of living in darkness.

980
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,412
Capable?

981
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:24,541
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.

982
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:25,876
You killed her.

983
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:30,380
- Is that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.

984
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:33,425
I said don't move.

985
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:36,845
Make the call. Make it.

986
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:05,916
I knew you'd come back.

987
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:11,588
I knew you'd realize
that you can only be happy here.

988
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:15,258
I told you that without me,
you'd be nothing.

989
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,761
Less than nothing.

990
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:20,013
Invisible.

991
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,314
Since when can you see, Mum?

992
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:34,611
But you're still my son, and I won't let
anybody take you away from me.

993
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,698
Mum, I asked you a question.

994
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,703
Since when can you see?

995
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:46,456


996
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,502
What are you doing, son? No, no.

997
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:53,380
No, no.

998
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:55,924
Calm down, Mum.

999
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:02,139
- It's me.
- Mum, calm down.

1000
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:09,312
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic
nerve without causing any pain.

1001
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:14,401
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.

1002
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:18,655
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, I have to do it.

1003
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:21,658
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.

1004
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:54,858
What are we doing here?

1005
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:00,572
I won't use it on you.

1006
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:10,624
Your optic nerve must be very damaged
by now. It won't take long.

1007
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:16,379
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

1008
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:22,594
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
I'll be by your side.

1009
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,806
I've packed your bags.

1010
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:30,310
We will go far away
and nobody will find us.

1011
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,729
We will start from scratch.

1012
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:34,481
Don't touch me!

1013
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:37,234
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.

1014
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,029
I will never love you. Never.

1015
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,906
I would die first.

1016
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:45,742
- Don't touch me!
- Is that what you want?

1017
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,829
Don't touch me!

1018
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:52,415
Let go of me!

1019
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,919
- Let go of me!
- Come on, do it!

1020
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,257
Stay with me.

1021
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:34,624
Do it. Do it.

1022
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,961
Do it! Do it!

1023
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:41,131
- Do it.
- I can't! I can't!

1024
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:47,846
Of course you can't.

1025
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:51,641
Although you don't know it...
you love me.

1026
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:55,937
Because you know that without me,
you are nothing.

1027
01:43:56,105 --> 01:43:58,607
And I am only a shadow without you.

1028
01:45:13,975 --> 01:45:16,518
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1029
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,607
- Hello?
- Inspector. It's Julia.

1030
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:23,858
Julia, it's you.

1031
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:27,737
Listen to me, because this is
the last time I'll call you.

1032
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:31,574
- Calm down.
- He's locked me in my house.

1033
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,910
- Calm down, Julia.
- He's going to kill me.

1034
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:38,498
If you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.

1035
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:41,084
- Julia, please, calm down.
- Are you listening to me?

1036
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:44,671
Inspector?

1037
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:52,971
Julia!

1038
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:01,057
Julia, police!
Cover the stairs and the hallway.

1039
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:03,059
Julia, are you there?

1040
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:06,062
It's Dimas. Can you hear me?

1041
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,773
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Shut up!

1042
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:11,901
- What's going on?
- I said shut up!

1043
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,415
Can you see him?
Can you see him, Inspector?

1044
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:29,252
Police! Put the knife down!
Put your hands above your head!

1045
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:45,101
Don't look at me.

1046
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:50,940
Don't look at me, please.

1047
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:56,529
- Don't look at me!
- Put the knife down!

1048
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:01,075
Put it down!

1049
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:05,288
What are you doing?
Put the knife down!

1050
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,998
I will go blind, won't I?

1051
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:56,339
How long do I have?

1052
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,635
You'll go blind before dawn.

1053
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:11,729
I need you to do me a favor.

1054
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,888
Can we have a moment?

1055
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:57,275
What happened to his eyes?

1056
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,904
He donated them.

1057
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:09,954
And where are they?

1058
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:12,999
Where he would have wanted.

1059
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:24,135
Isaac, why?

1060
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:29,265
My God, I miss you so much.

1061
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,773
You promised me.

1062
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:40,068
You promised me.

1063
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:26,823
You told me
that when you looked into my eyes...

1064
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,784
...you could see the entire universe.

1065
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,829
I still can.

1066
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:32,430
JULIA'S EYES
