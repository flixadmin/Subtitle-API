<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:06,144
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:09,247
<i>To the outside world, I'm</i>
<i>an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:12,216
<i>but secretly, with the help of</i>
<i>my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,686
<i>I fight crime and find</i>
<i>other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,722
<i>I hunted down the man</i> <i>who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:21,092
<i>but in doing so, I opened up</i>
<i>our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,495
<i>and I am the only one</i>
<i>fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:27,331
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,933
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,535
Zoom wants me dead.

12
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,336
The meta-humans that he's
sending from Earth-2,

13
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:33,805
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

14
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,173
I have to go.

15
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:37,542
I need you to tell me that it's okay.

16
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:39,010
- Ah!
- Barry.

17
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:44,048
Is this the face of your hero, Central City?

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,286
- Ah!
- Ah!

19
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,987
Seriously got your ass kicked.

20
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,756
I can't feel my legs.

21
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,065
All right, I got you.

22
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,367
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

23
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:11,409
I can't do it right now, all right?

24
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:14,979
- Oh, yes you can, Barry.
- No, no, no.

25
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:16,614
We've been making so much progress.

26
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:17,648
Yep, six whole steps.

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,150
Someone get me a Bozo button.

28
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,651
Hey, give yourself some credit.

29
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,220
You just broke your back.

30
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:23,788
Yeah, a normal person
would've been paralyzed

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,189
the rest of his life.

32
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,425
How long until I'm fully healed?

33
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,127
The initial MRI I took a week ago

34
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,897
showed a complete dislocation
at the T12-L1 interspace

35
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,999
of the thoracolumbar junction.

36
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,668
But this is the MRI I took this morning.

37
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,404
It's remarkable, but you're
almost completely healed.

38
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,039
I'm still having trouble breathing.

39
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,642
That's totally normal with a spinal injury.

40
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:47,111
It should clear up soon.

41
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,815
We're going to get you
back in that suit, Barry.

42
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:53,584
Real quick, trust me.

43
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,953
What are we gonna do about Zoom?

44
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,789
No sign of him since Cisco
nailed him with that tranq dart.

45
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,725
And I haven't vibed since then.

46
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:05,029
- Maybe Zoom's not coming back.
- I highly doubt that.

47
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:06,964
Which is why I'm gonna go do
something about it.

48
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,033
What do you mean, go do something about it?

49
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,436
I need access to your breach
room and your speed cannon.

50
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:13,905
Why is that?

51
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:17,341
Because, Barry, it's time to go home.

52

53
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,951
So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

54
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:28,519
and now you want to go home?

55
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,354
Sounds very familiar.

56
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,457
Again, that wasn't me.

57
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,727
I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

58
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,196
before anyone else gets killed.

59
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:39,363
How do you plan on doing that?

60
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,932
I'll think of something.

61
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,600
Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

62
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,035
No, no, you can't go through the breach.

63
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:45,169
Yeah, he can.

64
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,237
Jay taught us how to send people.

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,638
That's not what I mean.

66
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,273
Look, if you can figure out how to stop Zoom

67
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:51,809
on your Earth, you can
figure out how to do it here.

68
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,080
We need you to stay here until
we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

69
00:02:56,082 --> 00:03:00,251
What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home.

70
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:04,422
And I'm going to that with
or without your assistance.

71
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:10,161
What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go...bye.

72
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,630
Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

73
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:15,666
I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

74
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,501
Yeah, I mean, the last bright idea he had

75
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:18,603
nearly got Barry killed.

76
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,504
I know, but Jay's gone,

77
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,773
and Dr. Wells knows Zoom better than anyone,

78
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:26,410
so until Barry is back on his feet again,

79
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:29,347
we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

80
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,150
Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here,

81
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,318
then we're better off without him.

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,485
Let him go.

83
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,355
I can't do that. Not yet.

Nope, nope, my bad, that is
just an alert for me.

- Oh, it's just a reminder.

88

Oh, with who?

90
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:57,041
With the lovely Kendra Saunders,

91
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:58,509
the barista at Jitters.

92
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,311
Oh, she makes a mean latte.

93
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,380
I think we're gonna go out
for dinner and a movie,

94
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,382
and then, I don't know,
maybe some breakfast.

95
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,718
- [laughs]
- Wait, breakfast?

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,253
Why breakfast? I don't...

97
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:11,956
Yeah...

98
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,726
'Cause, you know, you go home...

00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,027
- Cisco.
- And...

100
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,362
- He's messing with you.
- Go.

Yeah, yeah, it's a... Nasty bug.

Well, I make a mean chicken
noodle soup from scratch.

No, that's sweet, I just...

00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:32,770
and guess that you're here

For all of us.

129
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,378
You don't have to worry about that anymore

We can help you save your daughter.

132
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:49,721
I know that's why you want to go home.

133
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:58,129
Look, I made a big mistake coming here.

134
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,531
and use that help to stop Zoom,
and my plan failed.

135
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,100
I don't have another plan,

136
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:06,371
except to go back home
and face Zoom myself.

137
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,139
So let's say you go back to your Earth,

138
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,841
and you fight Zoom.

139
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,476
He will kill you.

140
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,946
And then, how does that help your daughter?

141
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,749
Look, the best way to save Jesse

142
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:21,686
is for you to stay here,
and work with us as a team.

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,255
No.

144
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:26,124
Now, please leave me alone, while I discover

145
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:29,794
which one of these breaches
is gonna get me home.

146
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,629
You know, you're lucky
Cisco and Professor Stein

147
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,631
never figured out how to close
all the breaches,

148
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:37,835
'cause then you'd be stuck here.

149
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:41,239
Wait.

150
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,609
We close the breaches.

151
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,044
All of them, except one,

152
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:50,214
so Zoom only has one way
to get to this world.

153
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:56,888
- The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Exactly.

154
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,790
And then we set a trap.

155
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:03,027
It's got fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge,

156
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:07,765
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

157
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:11,536
true love, miracles, and,

158
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:14,872
it's ranked as one of the best
date movies of all time.

159
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:19,043
Well, let's see if that's true.

Uh, here, our victim.

192
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,662
His name's Dr. Jeffrey Shore.

193
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:26,370
He's a biochemistry engineer
here at Vaughan Pharmaceuticals.

This is the second dead
lab tech in two weeks.

Yeah, and like the other tech,

197
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,178
he had just stolen a serum
from their storage cooler.

198
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,180
- Really? What kind of serum?
- It's called Cortexin.

199
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,848
It's used to treat encephalopathy,

200
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,850
a blood disease in the brain.

201
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:42,286
The serum's missing, but
his colleagues found him here

202

a couple of minutes later, dead.

203

He didn't get far.

204
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:47,024
He died from blunt force trauma to the head.

205
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:49,427
Ugh, and apparently a lot of it.

Okay.

There's no such thing as a Birdman, Cisco.

Okay, like that's a stretch. In this city?

Look, I know what I vibed.

something holding him back.

Okay, hit me.

Well, the other scientist
stole a large quantity

of a racetam drug,

278
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,086
typically used to treat
patients with Vertigo.

279
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,821
Okay, so we got two stolen drugs,

one for blood disorders of the brain,

281
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,825

I still don't have my speed.

327
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:48,115
How are we supposed to save her from Grodd?

328

You may not have your legs just yet,

That's a long story, Grodd.

Um...

00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,750
The dark matter

348
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:33,187
from the particle accelerator explosion?

349
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:36,157
That's how this happened.

Keep that chin down, slugger.

359
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,072
Dad.

360
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,445
Yeah.

361
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:44,792
That was a hell of an idea
you had, bringing Henry here.

362
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:46,293
Well, he may not have his mother,

363
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:48,629
but he's got two amazing fathers.

364
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:49,797
Seemed like he needed both.

365
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,800
Hmm.

366
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:55,569
- Good girl.
- Mm.

367
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:59,874
So how did Grodd become sentient?

368
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:02,009
A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

369
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:04,078
with the military to research and awaken

370
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,815
latent mind-reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

371
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,217
And I'm guessing Grodd is
one of the test subjects?

372
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,253
Right, but then Dr. Wells
shut down the program,

373
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,021
and we all thought it was to save Grodd

374
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:17,558
from all the crazy mind-control experiments,

375
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,060
but it was really so that
Dr. Wells could use

376
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:21,462
the accelerator explosion to create

377
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,430
a 1,500-pound mind-controlling gorilla

378
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:26,200
that he could manipulate.

379
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,570
What kind of algorithm is that?

380
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:32,072
It's an algorithm meant to
extrapolate Grodd's location

381
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:35,709
from places we know he's already been.

382
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:41,348
Hello.

383
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,017
There we have it.

384
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,985
No spinal cord edema.

385
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,921
I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging.

386
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:51,458
Bone fused beautifully.
You're all good, Barry.

387
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,927
I'd give you some physical therapy,

388
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,530
but you don't need it.

389
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:57,898
I'm really glad you're here, Dad.

390
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,667
Me too.

391
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,769
You know, I tried to call,
but you can't a cell

392
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,804
in Granite Peak National Park, so...

393
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,172
Granite Peak... what are you...

394
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,941
You went camping by yourself?

395
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:09,977
Yeah, yeah, I got a tent.
I went fishing every day.

396
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:13,480
I have had my fill of
largemouth bass for a while.

397
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,049
[both chuckle]

398
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:21,121
Sometimes you just have to slow down

399
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:24,792
to get back to where you want to be.

400
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:28,162
- Yeah. Look, Dad...
- Hey, guys.

401
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,997
I think we've found them.

402
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,498
Yeah?

403
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,301
Grodd has to be in one of
these three bell towers.

404
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,769
The only reason we couldn't find him

405
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,571
on any cameras underneath the city before is

406
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:39,239
'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad

407
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:41,342
to a penthouse, like a baller.

408
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,676
Okay, so we know where he is.

409
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,144
We still don't know how to get her.

410
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,080
- We got a plan for you.
- What's the plan?

411
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,915
We use me.

412
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:50,684
[grunts]

413
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,219
That's Harry! That's the other Wells!

414
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:53,988
- Barry.
- Let him go.

415
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,690
Let him go.

416
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,058
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

417
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,727
We found another suit in the Time Vault.

418
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,328
- I thought he was dead.
- He's dead.

419
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,098
This is... this is Harrison Wells
from Earth-2.

420
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,799
- Earth-2?
- I'll explain later.

421
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,501
If we can get Harry to convince Grodd

422
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:09,770
that he's Wells, that he's his father,

423
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:13,107
maybe we can convince him to let Caitlin go.

424
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:19,146
I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

425
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:22,416
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

426
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:29,628
Looks like we're 0 for 2 on
the bell towers, huh?

427
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,182
I like to think of it more as,

428
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:33,518
now we know exactly where they are.

429
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,119
Okay, let's do this again.
Gimme your best Wells.

430
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:36,521
I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon.

431
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:38,022
- I told you...
- Look.

432
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:40,525
I just made these
anti-mind-control ear buds.

433
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,827
They could fail, and
if they do, you're toast,

434
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,662
so you're gonna need to nail it
if you want to live.

435
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:48,099
[sighs] Ramon.

- Cisco.
- Cisco.

437
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:56,307
In many ways, you've shown me
what it's like to have a son.

438
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:58,743
What?

439
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,146
Okay, let's... Let's just try it again.

440
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:05,350
This time, up the creep
factor, like, a lot more,

441
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:08,620
and make it a little more sincere.

442
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:10,088
Like you really love me,

443
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,791
but you're gonna have to kill me anyway.

444
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:16,961
Cisco.

445
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,896
In many ways,

00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:23,801
you've shown me what
it's like to have a son.

447
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:27,271
Yup, that's the one. Here you go.

Yeah, we're moving
on to the third location.

451
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,313
Copy that.

452

Now we wait.

453
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,417
So this is what it's like

454
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,387
every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

455
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,355
Uh, pretty much.

456
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,457
Only, Cisco and Caitlin are
normally the ones in here

457
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,026
and I'm the one out there.

Well, there's no reason you shouldn't be.

459
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:53,798
Iris showed me what happened.

460
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,467
With Zoom?

461
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,202
That was hard to watch.

I can only imagine what that
must have been like for you.

that their hero wasn't
good enough to stop him.

465
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:12,383
Well, that's certainly what it looked like.

466
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:13,651
Was he right?

Your body's healed, Barry,

and yet here you are,

470
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,894
feeling the shame of losing.

471
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,963
I can't stop him.

472
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:28,633
I know it. He knows it.

473
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:32,770
And now everyone in this city knows it too.

474
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:35,239
They don't believe in me anymore, Dad.

475
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,941
At my trial for your mother's death,

476
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:39,444
a lot of our family and friends
were in the courtroom.

477
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:43,648
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

478
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,817
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.

479
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:47,652
Every day, I could see it on their faces,

480
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:49,987
the moment when I lost them,

481
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:53,758
until everybody had stopped believing in me.

482
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,560
Well, that was my reality.

483
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:57,695
You know, I was gonna serve a life sentence

484
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,331
for a crime I didn't commit,
but worse than that,

485
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,966
every time I looked at someone in the eye

486
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:03,334
from that moment forward,
they were gonna believe

487
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:07,605
that I had killed the woman I loved

488
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:13,010
in front of our son.

489
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:16,414
So yeah, I do know what it's like

490
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:22,019
being destroyed.

491
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:25,256
How did you get past that?

492
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,158
I embraced it.

493
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,296
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward,

494
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:36,234
but I know that if I could survive that,

495
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:38,236
and learn to believe in myself again,

496
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:42,240
then I could survive anything.

497
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:45,143
You know what lit that belief in me, Barry?

498
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:47,979
You.

499
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,248
11-year-old you, running around,
believing in me,

500
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,584
gave me that hope.

501
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,392
And now I'm giving it back to you, son.

502
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:05,429
No more monsters can take that from us.

503
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,572
So, one of the main differences

504
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:17,475
between ape and human brains

505
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:20,511
is the white matter and
connectivity in the brain cells.

506
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:21,913
[grunts]

507
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,581
The chemicals that you were treated with

508
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,217
as an infant were meant
to overcome those differences

509
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:29,287
and cause an explosive growth of both,

510
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:30,755
similar to what humans experience

511
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:33,124
in their first few years of life.

512
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,026
Maybe these chemicals can be used

513
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,195
to duplicate that growth,
and then we won't need

514
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,363
a particle accelerator explosion.

515
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:42,533
[growls]

516
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,607
- Hey, buddy.
- [growls]

517
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,344
Easy, buddy. It's me.

518
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm back.

519
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:59,483
<i>Father, you died.</i>

520
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:02,053
No.

521
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:05,122
No, buddy, I didn't die.

522
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,458
I just went away for a while.

523
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,729
All right, that's great,
Wells, keep talking.

524
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:16,100
But now that I'm back,

525
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:20,738
we don't need Caitlin anymore, do we, buddy?

526
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,340
So you can let her go.

527
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:24,909
[growls]

528
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,912
Come on, buddy.

529
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:32,884
Let me get her out of here.

530
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:35,686
Please.

531
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:40,892
<i>Father never ask.</i> <i>Father take.</i>

532
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:42,326
Run.

533
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,629
[roars]

534
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,498
<i>Who are you?</i>

535
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:51,369
Cisco, you gotta get in there, man.

536
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:53,771
[roars]

537
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,106
Oh, Cisco, thank God.

538
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:56,741
Okay, you guys gotta get out of there.

539
00:26:56,743 --> 00:26:58,075
Harry's trapped. We can't leave him here.

540
00:26:58,077 --> 00:27:00,811
What do we do?

541
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:03,514
The drugs. The drugs that Grodd stole.

542
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:05,917
Wells... an overdose of those
drugs will shock his brain.

543
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,452
Okay, just hit him with as much as you can.

544
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:12,156
<i>You are not him!</i> <i>You are not Father!</i>

545
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:15,626
- I am father.
- [growls]

546
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:20,364
And you hit father.

547
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,934
Grodd.

548
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,574
Look at me.

549
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:34,078
- Look at me!
- [roars]

550
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:40,651
I would never leave you here alone.

551
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:44,155
Grodd, I made you a promise.

552
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:52,196
I have bigger plans for you. Remember?

553
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:57,435
One day, this city will be yours.

554
00:27:57,437 --> 00:28:00,805
I promised you.

555
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,474
I intend to honor that promise.

556
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:06,010
[growls]

557
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:08,679
[roars]

558
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:11,415
Go!

00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,585
[growls]

560
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:19,290
Come on.

561
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:32,276
- Thank you.
- Thank you for rescuing me.

562
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:35,779
Well, we're a team, right?

563
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:39,054
I'm impressed. I think we all are.

564
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:41,489
Yeah, well, we need to do
something about Grodd.

565
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:44,292
- Like what?
- Like get rid of him for good.

566
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:45,527
You want to kill him?

567
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,595
Considering how many
people he's killed, yeah.

568
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,229
This isn't Grodd's fault.

569
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,531
He's only like this because
Wells made him this way.

570
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,100
Yes, but, Catie, he kidnapped
you and you could have died.

571
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:56,303
You didn't see what I saw.

572
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:58,605
Grodd's getting smarter.

573
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,674
He's lonely and sad.

574
00:29:00,676 --> 00:29:02,209
He wan more apes like him.

575
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,977
What are you saying? He wants kids?

576
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,012
'Cause I'm pretty sure
one telepathic Grape Ape

577
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:08,715
is more than enough for this city.

578
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:10,717
I know somewhere we could send him.

579
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,486
What are you talking about?

580
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,288
When the singularity exploded
and I discovered the breach

581
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,458
in S.T.A.R. Labs, I ran similar tests

582
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,362
and discovered the same thing,
51 additional breaches.

583
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,631
The difference being
the breaches in Central City

584
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,299
are scattered all throughout the city

585
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:29,169
whereas counterparts in my world
most definitely are not.

586
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,737
And you know where they lead?

587
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:33,573
Well, I was in the process
of figuring all that out

588
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,109
when Dr. Snow so gallantly
convinced me to stay,

589
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:39,846
but if I am correct,
this breach is gonna get Grodd

590
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,315
as close to home as he's ever likely to get.

591
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:45,452
Okay, even if you're right,

592
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:49,022
how do we bait Grodd to go through it?

593
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,691
My son'll do it.

594
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:54,160
Won't you, Flash?

595
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:05,872
Grodd?

596
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:10,043
<i>Caitlin.</i>

597
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:20,186
<i>Flash.</i>

598
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,688
You want Caitlin, Grodd,

599
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,059
you're gonna have to catch me first.

600
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:28,995
[growls]

601
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:45,712
So Barry's gonna lure Grodd
in front of the breach?

602
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,681
Yep, and once he gets him to the right spot,

603
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:50,450
Cisco's gonna blast him into
Earth-2 with his thingamajig.

604
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:52,852
- [laughs] Speed cannon.
- Exactly.

605
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:55,822
Well, things have gotten
a lot more complicated

606
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:57,457
since I got out of prison.

607
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,793
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you have no idea.

608
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:02,228
Cisco, almost there. Are you ready?

609
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,730
I'm in position.

610
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,966
Now, once you turn on the speed cannon,

611
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,534
the quark matter will stabilize,

612
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,035
stretching the breach about so big,

613
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:13,206
so anywhere within this circle will suffice.

614
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:24,250
Right on time.

615
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,852
Okay, come on.

616
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:30,457
I don't have eyes on Grodd.
Does anyone see him?

Thanks, bro.

652
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:18,414
I can't believe something good
finally came from that suit.

653
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,916
First and the last time.

654
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,684
That thing still gives me the creeps.

655
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,286
We should destroy it.

656
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:25,355
Let's do that, but see if you can figure out

657
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:26,990
how to get it back in this ring first.

658
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:28,591
Might be nice to have something like that

659
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,093
instead of carrying around
a bag all the time.

660
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:33,396
I can help you with that.

661
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:34,864
What?

662
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,733
I know a thing or two
about micro-technology.

663
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:39,135
Yeah, you know a thing or two
about a lot of things.

664
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,204
Well, as long as what he knows keeps my son

665
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,707
and these good people safe,
the more you know, the better.

666
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,677
Pleasure to meet you, Harrison. Again.

667
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,146
Dr. Allen.

668
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,882
Good to see you. Cisco.

669
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,685
- Let's go.
- Take care.

670
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,854
So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth

671
00:34:57,856 --> 00:35:01,624
that we've sent Grodd, what is it exactly?

672
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:06,529
It's a refuge where gorillas
subjected to lab experiments,

673
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:11,267
like Grodd,

674
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,237
can roam freely.

675
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,438
I know it's for the best,

676
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,240
but I still feel like I betrayed him.

677
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:21,177
No, don't say that. You didn't betray him.

678
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,414
You gave him a better life.

679
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,916
I still don't understand, though, I...

680
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,252
Why do the breaches on our Earth

681
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,387
lead to different places on yours?

682
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:34,991
I don't know yet, Ramon,

683
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:37,226
but I do know we have to close them all,

684
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:38,695
and I don't know how to do that.

685
00:35:38,697 --> 00:35:40,997
You don't have to do it alone anymore.

686
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,699
Any of it.

687
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:46,669
Together, we defeated Grodd,
and if we stay that way,

688
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:48,805
we will figure out
how to close the breaches,

689
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:52,408
get Zoom, and get you your daughter back.

690
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:56,479
Thank you.

691
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:02,452
Oh, this one is definitely a keeper.

692
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,454
[laughs] Oh, yeah.

693
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:07,590
He could've done your standard
vinegar and baking soda volcano,

694
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:11,360
but no, Barry wanted to do
a molecular structure

695
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:12,995
of chocolate and nougat.

696
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:15,064
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my favorite candy bar.

697
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,232
Who does that in the sixth grade?

698
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:19,569
Why, a true science nerd.

699
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:23,139
Like father, like son, I suppose.

700
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:24,774
All right, Dad, we should get going.

701
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:26,676
Yeah. Uh, Joe, can I have...

702
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:29,612
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

703
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:32,982
Iris, thank you so much
for reaching out to me.

704
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:37,887
I am so glad you did. Me, too.

705
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:41,624
Joe, there are no words, man.

706
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:45,795
Thanks.

707
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:48,498
All right, I'm gonna swing by
my lab before I come home.

708
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,768
Which reminds me... Patty?
She's a smart girl.

709
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,036
She's not buying your
whole sick story, FYI.

710
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:55,872
- All right.
- Patty?

711
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:58,074
Would this be a new girlfriend?

712
00:36:58,076 --> 00:37:01,043
Uh, yeah, something like that, yeah.

713
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:03,546
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

714
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:05,581
Come on.

715
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,585
- Bye.
- See ya.

716
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:17,026
You okay?

717
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:20,329
[sighs] It's embarrassing.
I... I love Barry

718
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:24,967
like he's my own son, but
when I'm reminded that he isn't,

719
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:26,869
I start to wonder what it would've been like

720
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,071
if, you know...

721
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,773
Dad, you would've been just as amazing

722
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:34,777
with your own son, just like
you were with me and Barry.

723
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,859
I hear you've been spending
a lot of time up here.

724
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:53,129
[chuckles] Well, you know what they say.

725
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,765
When the CSI's away...

726
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,367
It's good to see you on your feet again.

727
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:01,270
Must've been all that canned soup you had.

728
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:06,108
Or maybe the homemade stuff Joe brought you?

729
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,978
It... yeah, I wasn't actually sick, Patty.

730
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,614
Yeah, I figured that out.

731
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,588
Why did you lie to me?

732
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,989
My dad was in town.

733
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:22,158
I needed to spend some time with him.

734
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,595
And you couldn't just tell me that?

735
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:30,433
You gotta understand, Patty,
my dad was convicted of murder.

736
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:32,735
When someone's image has been
tarnished like that,

737
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:36,072
it's hard for some people to see past it.

738
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:38,441
And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

739
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,377
No, I know, I should've
given you more credit.

740
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,447
No, you should've given
yourself more credit.

741
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,282
This isn't about your father, Barry.

742
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:49,252
This is about you.

743
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:54,056
I need to know that I can trust
you if we're gonna do this.

744
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:59,695
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

745
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:01,430
I can tell.

746
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:04,667
You cannot always be a smart ass.

I didn't know if you liked

Well, I'm allergic to chocolate,

That's a digital movie projector.
