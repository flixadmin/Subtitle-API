1
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,950
(Birds cawing)

2
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,536
(Labored breathing)

3
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:10,172
Man: How many of those fingers do you think
we could shove up his ass?

4
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,799
Locke: Depends if he's had any practice.

5
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,969
That the sort of thing
you and your sister go in for?

6
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,387
She loosened you up for us?

7
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,889
(Men laughing)

8
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,314
He's going to fall.

9
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,692
He's going to fall off his horse. Help him.

10
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,820
(Groans)

11
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,870
Jaime: Water.

12
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,333
Water. Please, water.

13
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,673
Water. Water, please. Please. Please.

14
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,216
(Men laughing)

15
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,182
If I die, you won't be getting...

16
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,684
Oh, enough.

17
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,727
Here.

18
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,112
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

19
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,738
(Men laughing)

20
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,622
(Grunts)

21
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,053
(Groans)

22
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,055
(Men continue laughing)

23
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,348
Stop!

24
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,525
Man: Far enough.

25
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,497
(Grunts)

26
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,768
Do that again and I'll
take your other hand.

27
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,024
Man 2: Come on, you.

28
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,486
(Panting)

29
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,495
Oh, lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

30
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,373
I hope we might speak in confidence.

31
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,919
Oh. Always in confidence.

32
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,421
About the events of the Blackwater.

33
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,007
Perhaps this is the wrong time?

34
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,592
Oh, no, it's a wonderful time.

35
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,887
I thought one of your little birds might

36
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,097
have knowledge of my
sister's intentions to...

37
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,974
End your life?

38
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,851
I didn't inherit littlefinger's spies

39
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,770
along with his position, I'm afraid.

40
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,315
Which is why I'm coming
to you. I need proof.

41
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,651
Proof? (Snorts) Will there be a trial?

42
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,777
I need to know.

43
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,073
I have no proof, only whispers.

44
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,533
(Grunts)

45
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,663
Before all this nastiness,

46
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,583
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

47
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,960
Do you want to hear it still?

48
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,795
I don't know. Do I?

49
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:42,175
As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of
actors through the free cities.

50
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,219
One day in myr,

51
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,932
a certain man made
my master an offer too tempting to refuse.

52
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,268
I feared the man meant to use me

53
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,687
as I'd heard some men used small boys.

54
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
But what he wanted was far worse.

55
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,236
He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,

56
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,322
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

57
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,950
With a hooked blade he sliced me,

58
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,703
root and stem, chanting all the while.

59
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,248
He burned my parts in a brazier.

60
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:18,461
The flames turned blue,
and I heard a voice answer his call.

61
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,094
I still dream of that night.

62
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,807
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.

63
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,352
I dream of the voice from the flames.

64
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,231
Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?

65
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,567
I don't know.

66
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,904
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

67
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:50,243
And ever since that day, I have hated magic
and all those who practice it.

68
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,038
But you can see why I
was eager to aid in your

69
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,916
fight against Stannis
and his red priestess.

70
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,543
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

71
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,794
Yes.

72
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,254
(Clears throat)

73
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,466
I feel the need for actual revenge against

74
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,761
the actual person who
tried to have me killed,

75
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,598
which will require
a degree of influence, which...

76
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,810
You do not possess at the moment.

77
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:22,275
But influence is
largely a matter of Patience, I have found.

78
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,236
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,

79
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,281
he threw me out of his house to die.

80
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,535
I resolved to live to spite him.

81
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,120
Ibegged.

82
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,290
I sold what parts of my
body remained to me.

83
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,626
I became an excellent thief,

84
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,296
and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters

85
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,175
are more valuable
than the contents of his purse.

86
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:52,472
Step by step,
one distasteful task after another,

87
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:58,103
I made my way from the slums of myr
to the small council chamber.

88
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,067
Influence grows like a weed.

89
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,988
I tended mine patiently

90
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,366
until its tendrils reached
from the red keep

91
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,786
all the way across to
the far side of the world,

92
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,958
where I managed
to wrap them around something very special.

93
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,838
Ugh.

94
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,089
The sorcerer.

95
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,341
(Whimpering)

96
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,845
Hello, my old friend.

97
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,140
It's been a long time.

98
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:39,978
I have no doubt
the revenge you want will be yours in time,

99
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,981
if you have the stomach for it.

100
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,900
(Muffled screams)

101
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,445
When people talk about the night's watch,

102
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,864
they never mention the shoveling.

103
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,199
Or the shit.

104
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,285
Grenn: They tell you about honor,

105
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,370
pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm,

106
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:01,833
but shoveling really is most of it.

107
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,003
And getting attacked or killed or worse.

108
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,171
And that.

109
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,424
But when you're not getting attacked or
killed, usually you're shoveling.

110
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,803
Ah, look. More shit.

111
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,725
I was starting to wonder
what to do with the rest of me day.

112
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,935
We need to get out of here.

113
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,689
When the lord commander
says we go, we go.

114
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,734
The lord commander
told us to go to the fist of the first men.

115
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,069
How'd that turn out for us?

116
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,445
He had no way of knowing.

117
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,573
We do now. We know what's out there.

118
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,910
Craster's been out here surviving.

119
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,914
So he's your
new protector now? Our good friend craster?

120
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,749
We're like the sons he never had.

121
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,168
Rast: Mormont isn't gonna save you.

122
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,421
This lummox here isn't gonna save you.

123
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:53,093
When the walkers come calling, craster will
serve us up like so many pigs.

124
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,179
If we want to live,

125
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,433
we'll have to look out for ourselves.

126
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,270
(Shushing)

127
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,356
(Footsteps approaching)

128
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,983
(Baby crying)

129
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,532
You woke him.

130
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,408
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,038
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

132
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,124
(Crying continues)

133
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,545
He's beautiful.

134
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,548
- Does he have a name?
- No.

135
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,300
Are you going to give him one?

136
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,433
- Here.
- Gilly.

137
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,602
You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

138
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,122
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

139
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,605
I don't want your stupid thimble.

140
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,567
I want to save
my baby's life. Can you do that?

141
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,652
Can you?

142
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,282
I don't have time for you.

143
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,076
I don't have time for anyone but him

144
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,912
because he doesn't have much time.

145
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,956
(Crying continues)

146
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,588
(Raven cawing)

147
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,356
You have to go after him.

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,317
How?

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,277
You know how.

150
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,911
(Grunts)

151
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,499
(Raven caws)

152
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,260
Brandon.

153
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,305
- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?

154
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,891
No climbing.

155
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,785
Mother, I need to find it.
It's here. It's calling me.

156
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,812
I want you to promise me.
No more climbing. Promise me.

157
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,564
Promise me! Promise me!

158
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,649
Mother! Mother!

159
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,876
- Promise me, bran!
- (Screams)

160
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,068
Promise me!

161
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,570
(Panting)

162
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,291
Is he very large?

163
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,335
No larger than usual, apparently.

164
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,836
And yet, they said that he was...

165
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,338
Extraordinary.

166
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,425
The most extraordinary man they've ever
had. And they've had a lot of men.

167
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,386
We're talking about the same podrick?

168
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,515
The quiet boy in
lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?

169
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,476
What did he do to them?

170
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,978
I don't know, my lord.

171
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,272
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

172
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,190
So what did they say?

173
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,360
They said it was hard to describe.

174
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,444
Huh.

175
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,783
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

176
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,954
And what did
littlefinger say about this loss of income?

177
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,998
He was too preoccupied to notice.

178
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,083
He's leaving for the eyrie soon.

179
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,043
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

180
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,046
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the

181
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,133
lady arryn and the
title that comes with her.

182
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,302
Sad, really.

183
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,721
Is that all it takes to make our friend

184
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,265
lose interest in poor sansa stark?

185
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,728
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time, as far as I know.

186
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
Hmm.

187
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,375
But I don't think he's lost interest.

188
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,525
What makes you say so?

189
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,695
His shipboard inventory.

190
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,904
(Gasps)

191
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,535
You can read.
Rare for a woman in your profession.

192
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,620
- Former profession.
- Of course.

193
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,167
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

194
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,668
Two featherbeds.

195
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,587
He's bringing two
featherbeds for the cabin.

196
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,092
Who is important enough to littlefinger

197
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,845
to merit a featherbed,
besides littlefinger?

198
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,097
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

199
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,308
He's not interested in them, my lord.

200
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,143
How do you know?

201
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,520
Because I'm one of his girls.

202
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,940
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

203
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,278
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered

204
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,156
by her brother, or rather, his dragon.

205
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,825
It ate her while her son watched.

206
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,118
(Giggles)

207
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,955
What's left of her is
buried in the crypts right down there.

208
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,878
Cersei: The ceremony
is traditionally held in the main sanctum,

209
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,048
which seats 700 comfortably.

210
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,592
Olenna: There appears
to be a good deal of room elsewhere

211
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,345
on the premises for everyone else.

212
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,390
There aren't
more than 700 people of any importance.

213
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:54,769
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly upon the 700

214
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,773
to remind them how superior
they must be to have the best seats.

215
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,693
Over there, in that urn,
the ashes of aerion Targaryen.

216
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,779
Aerion brightflame, they called him.

217
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,907
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

218
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,075
(Both laughing)

219
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,244
Joffrey: He was wrong.

220
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,248
And, of course,
there's the mad king, killed by my uncle.

221
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,334
Would you like to
see where the last targaryens are buried?

222
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,421
Are you sure lady margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

223
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,589
No, it's quite all right, your grace.

224
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,800
I'd love to see their tombs, really.

225
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,010
It's like taking a walk through history.

226
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,325
Joffrey: The tomb's just up here.

227
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,493
Margaery: This is so exciting.

228
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,994
Olenna: You were married here, your grace?

229
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,395
Cersei: Yes.

230
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,230
Must seem like only yesterday.

231
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,149
Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago.

232
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,276
Your husband was buried here as well?

233
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,529
No, he wanted his remains
returned to storm's end.

234
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,738
Such a tragedy.

235
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,116
A fairly predictable tragedy.

236
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,701
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

237
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,369
I should say not.

238
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,872
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget

239
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,416
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

240
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,837
I seem to recall he laid siege to
storm's end for the better part of a year.

241
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,966
All he laid siege to
was the banquet table in the command tent.

242
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,342
(Chuckles)

243
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,862
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

244
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,638
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

245
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,562
We mothers do what
we can to keep our sons from the grave.

246
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,606
But they do seem to yearn for it.

247
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,567
We shower them with good sense,

248
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,653
and it slides right
off, like rain off a wing.

249
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,257
And yet the world belongs to them.

250
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,449
(Scoffs)

251
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,159
A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.

252
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,368
(Margaery giggles)

253
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,582
The gods have seen fit to make it so.

254
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,377
My father didn't want them here.

255
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,465
He was going to have their bodies burned
and thrown in the Blackwater,

256
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,301
but the high septon
convinced him othennise.

257
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,844
I'm glad he did.

258
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,264
I'm sorry, your grace.

259
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,100
I know they did terrible things at the end,

260
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,978
but their ancestors built this.

261
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,943
Sometimes severity
is the price we pay for greatness.

262
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,612
(Chuckles)

263
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,405
I couldn't agree more.

264
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,745
(Crowd clamoring)

265
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,459
Shall we go and see them?

266
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,298
If you give them your love,
they will return it a thousand fold.

267
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:34,178
I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.

268
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,598
You led the defense of king's landing.

269
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,310
They adore you.

270
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,444
Open the doors.

271
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,946
(Doors opening)

272
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,323
(Crowd cheering)

273
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,705
Joffrey.

274
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,125
Wait.

275
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,169
- Man: Lady margaery!
- Woman: Lady margaery!

276
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,006
Bless you, lady margaery!

277
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,299
Woman 2: Lady margaery!

278
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,592
Woman 3: Lady margaery!

279
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,051
Woman 4: Margaery!

280
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,553
Woman 5: Long live lady margaery!

281
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,679
Man 2: King Joffrey!

282
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,930
Woman 6: King Joffrey!

283
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,640
(Crowd continues cheering)

284
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,684
Woman 7: King Joffrey!

285
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,311
Woman 8: King Joffrey!

286
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,438
Man 3: King Joffrey!

287
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,648
Man 4: Gods bless king Joffrey!

288
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,323
Theon: How far is it to deepwood motte?

289
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,116
Boy: Not far, my lord.

290
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,035
Your sister is waiting for you there.

291
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,037
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

292
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,706
I served them,
the men who were torturing you.

293
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,460
I did what they told and waited.

294
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,879
Why would you risk your life for me?

295
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,965
I grew up on saltcliffe, my lord.

296
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,135
I was only a boy when they took you away.

297
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,970
My father brought us up to the bluffs

298
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,889
so we could watch you carried off.

299
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,226
I remember the look
on my father's face when he told us,

300
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,021
"that's balon greyjoy's last living son."

301
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,608
And those are the words I heard over again

302
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,985
when I saw what they were doing to you.

303
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:17,907
Those men, they said my father
knew what they were doing to me.

304
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,993
Did he?

305
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:28,334
I don't know, my lord.
They... they never told me much.

306
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,923
(Thunder rumbling)

307
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,345
My sister's men are loyal to her.

308
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,222
We don't need to hide from them.

309
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,557
Not all those are your sister's men.

310
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,935
Some of them are loyal to your father.

311
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,189
- (Door closes)
- Theon: Hmm.

312
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,357
Boy: What is it?

313
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,275
I was just thinking howjealous I was

314
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,236
when my father told
yara to take this place.

315
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,279
What did he tell you to do?

316
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,365
(Chuckles) Raid fishing villages.

317
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,661
He didn't trust me. Thought I was a stark.

318
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,913
(Laughs) I could never be a stark.

319
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,374
Robb stark always reminded me of that.

320
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,583
He lorded it over you?

321
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,835
Didn't have to.

322
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,004
All he had to do was be.

323
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,217
Be who he was born to be.

324
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,720
His life fit him better than his clothes.

325
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,305
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

326
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,516
He's the king in the north.

327
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,851
And me...

328
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,855
My father gave me a choice and I made it.

329
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,817
I could never be a stark.

330
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:40,406
But ironborn, that's what I was born to be.

331
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,330
I paid the iron price for winterfell.

332
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,922
I murdered those boys.

333
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,802
The stark boys?

334
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,055
Never found them.

335
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,601
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

336
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:16,817
I let dagmer slit their throats
and I let him burn the bodies,

337
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,530
so I could keep winterfell

338
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,035
and make my father proud.

339
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,497
Maybe it's not too late.

340
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,043
It is.

341
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,212
(Sniffles)

342
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,721
My real father lost his
head at king's landing.

343
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,767
I made a choice,

344
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,355
and I chose wrong.

345
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,527
And now I've burned everything down.

346
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,614
Not everything, my lord.

347
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,743
She's up here.

348
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,591
- Yara.
- Shh!

349
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,260
Wait.

350
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,145
I brought him back.
He... he killed the others.

351
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,273
What? No, I didn't.

352
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,567
You can't! (Groans)

353
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,152
No! Please, stop!

354
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,363
(Theon yelping)

355
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,575
(Screams)

356
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,243
Put him back where he belongs.

357
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,080
(Screaming)

358
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,102
Eat.

359
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,691
What are you doing?

360
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm dying.

361
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,613
You can't die.

362
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:31,452
You need to live to take revenge.

363
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,746
I don't care about revenge.

364
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,664
You coward.

365
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,627
A little misfortune and you're giving up.

366
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,922
Misfor...

367
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,174
Misfortune?

368
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,634
You lost your hand.

369
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,470
My sword hand. I was that hand.

370
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,596
(Scoffs)

371
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,099
You have a taste,

372
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,936
one taste of the real world

373
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,813
where people have
important things taken from them,

374
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,733
and you whine and cry and quit.

375
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,194
You sound like a bloody woman.

376
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,138
I know what you did for me.

377
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,518
You told them tarth was full of sapphires.

378
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,693
It's called the sapphire isle
because of the blue of its water.

379
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,781
You knew that.

380
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,249
Why did you help me?

381
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,890
(Sighs)

382
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,193
You wanted to speak to me?

383
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,446
Yes, about Jaime.

384
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,198
What about him?

385
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,075
I wanted to make sure we're doing

386
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,994
everything we can to get him back.

387
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,333
When catelyn stark took Tyrion prisoner,

388
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,253
what did I do in response?

389
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,713
You started a war.

390
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:52,009
And if I would start
a war for that lecherous little stump,

391
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,262
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

392
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,638
Whatever you can.

393
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,933
Whatever I can.

394
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,198
You're still here.

395
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,657
Yes.

396
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,663
Did it ever occur to you that

397
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,165
I might be the one who deserves

398
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,750
your confidence and your trust,

399
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,210
notyoursons?

400
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,088
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

401
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:33,342
Years and years of lectures
on family and legacy... (Chuckles)

402
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:38,305
The same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations.

403
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,075
Did it ever occur to you that your daughter

404
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,727
might be the only one
listening to them, living by them?

405
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,397
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

406
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,275
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

407
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,610
(Blows)

408
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,160
All right. Contribute.

409
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,040
The tyrells are a problem.

410
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,586
The tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

411
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,923
The tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

412
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,052
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

413
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,722
She knows how to manipulate him.

414
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,226
Good. I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

415
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,480
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

416
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,151
I distrust you because
you're not as smart as you think you are.

417
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,736
You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod

418
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,447
over you and everyone else in this city.

419
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:48,333
Perhaps you should try
stopping him from doing what he likes.

420
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,256
I will.

421
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,302
Girl: Do you like it, Nana?

422
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,180
Another golden Rose. How original.

423
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,473
I eat from plates stamped with roses.

424
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,851
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

425
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,729
I have a golden Rose
painted on my chamber pot,

426
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,981
as if that makes it smell any better.

427
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,858
Roses are boring, dear.

428
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,360
"Growing strong."

429
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,614
Ha! The dullest words of any house.

430
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,618
"Winter is coming!" Now that's memorable.

431
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,704
"We do not sow." Strong. Strong.

432
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,706
Those are houses you watch out for.

433
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,877
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

434
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,546
But a golden Rose growing strong,

435
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,257
(scoffs) That strikes fear in the heart.

436
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,720
Look, little loves.

437
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,639
A spider in the garden.

438
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,435
Run along now. Grow strong.

439
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,147
My lady.

440
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,525
I wanted to personally
welcome you to king's landing.

441
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,028
The city has
been made brighter by your presence.

442
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,073
The city is made brighter by my presence?

443
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:05,118
Is that your usual line,
lord varys? Are you here to seduce me?

444
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,745
A little obvious, perhaps.

445
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:12,167
Oh, no, please.
Seduce away. It's been so long.

446
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,628
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

447
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,090
What happens when
the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?

448
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,551
A question for the philosophers.

449
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,596
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

450
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,682
- So?
- Might I sit?

451
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,561
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.

452
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,523
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

453
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,318
You've taken an interest in sansa stark.

454
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,446
Have I?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden

455
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,449
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

456
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,952
Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.

457
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,203
Is she?

458
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,579
No, not particularly.

459
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,540
But she's had an interesting childhood.

460
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,625
She has, sadly.

461
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,670
Well, forgive me for
wasting your time, then.

462
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,840
I thought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.

463
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,927
(Chuckling) Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.

464
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,888
Walk with me.

465
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:11,101
I know the walls have ears,
but apparently the shrubbery does, too.

466
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:16,982
I choose my allies carefully, and
my enemies more carefully still.

467
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,984
Which is sansa stark?

468
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,653
Neither. A babe in the woods.

469
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:22,738
I admired her father.

470
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,864
Yes.

471
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,991
Ned stark had many admirers,

472
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,037
and how many stepped fonnard
when the executioner came for his head?

473
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,457
I could not help lord stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.

474
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,000
How?

475
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,545
You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.

476
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,758
That's hardly surprising.
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

477
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,219
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

478
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,181
It almost feels
as if you're about to arrive at the point.

479
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,850
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

480
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,019
A confidant of mine has told me that

481
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,271
when he goes, sansa stark goes with him.

482
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,107
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

483
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,028
Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

484
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,531
He has acquired the
first two. How long before he has the army?

485
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,660
Perhaps you'll laugh,
but I know him better than most,

486
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,038
and this is the truth.

487
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,542
Littlefinger is one of
the most dangerous men in Westeros.

488
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:22,297
If robb stark falls,
sansa stark is the key to the north.

489
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,342
And if he marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

490
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,052
Which seems such a shame.

491
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,179
Why should a man with such a low reputation

492
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,390
steal away such a lovely bride?

493
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,644
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

494
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,605
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

495
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,607
But he would see this country burn

496
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,651
if he could be king of the ashes.

497
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,195
You are a clever man, lord varys.

498
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,783
You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.

499
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,994
One doesn't need to
be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?

500
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,591
(Clears throat)

501
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,968
I didn't mean to disturb you.

502
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,428
You haven't.

503
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,055
We'd like some privacy, please.

504
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,058
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

505
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,704
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

506
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,440
I'll ask the king to
speak with you himself.

507
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,279
What did you pray for?

508
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,655
I can't tell you.

509
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,073
Why not?

510
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,701
I'll tell you
what I prayed for in the sept this morning.

511
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,580
Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,

512
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,749
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

513
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,378
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid. And you?

514
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,298
I'm sorry, I just can't.

515
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,510
Margaery: My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

516
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,762
When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees,

517
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,182
and Alanna
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

518
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,058
"Pig face," she called me.

519
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,977
(Laughs) "Pig face"? That's ridiculous.

520
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,146
It had something to do with my nose.

521
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,191
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

522
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,775
- (Oinks)
- (Laughs)

523
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,529
So I prayed that
she'd catch a horrible skin disease.

524
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,115
A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.

525
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,283
Porridge plague?

526
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,552
Oh, you don't have it in the north?

527
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,995
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats,

528
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,873
and eventually,
your face slides off and you die in agony.

529
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,750
But that's awful.

530
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,836
(Laughs)

531
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,505
You're...

532
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,673
I believed you!

533
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,342
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.

534
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,969
Don't say that. No, you're not.

535
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,347
So what happened to Alanna?

536
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,349
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

537
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,435
and married a handsome
lord and they have darling children

538
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,187
and live in a castle by the sea.

539
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,980
It's all terribly frustrating.

540
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,651
Sansa: I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

541
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,945
You'll be married here in the capital,

542
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,780
and she'll have to come watch and

543
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,615
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

544
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,699
(Both chuckle)

545
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,913
I want us to be friends, good friends.

546
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,290
That would make me very happy.

547
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:08,046
You must see highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

548
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,049
We have a great
masquerade the night of the harvest moon.

549
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,969
You should see the
costumes. People work on them for months.

550
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,140
Uh, I don't think the queen
would let me leave king's landing.

551
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,270
The queen regent, you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

552
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,401
And if you were to marry loras,

553
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,574
your place would
be at highgarden, wouldn't it?

554
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,870
We would be sisters,
you and I. Would you like that?

555
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,846
His name was bannen.

556
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,266
He was a good man, a good ranger.

557
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,351
He came to us from...

558
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,063
Where did he come from?

559
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,898
Down white harbor way.

560
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,068
He came to us from white harbor.

561
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,113
Never failed in his duty.

562
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,283
He kept his vows the best he could.

563
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,870
He rode far, fought fiercely.

564
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,791
We shall never see his like again.

565
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,878
All: And now his watch has ended.

566
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,882
And now his watch has ended.

567
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,473
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

568
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,476
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

569
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,103
That bastard craster starved him to death.

570
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,730
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

571
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,482
Rast: You on his side?

572
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,860
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

573
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,154
We're brothers of
the night's watch, not thieves.

574
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:01,868
The day we leave,
craster will tap a barrel of our wine,

575
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,996
and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes

576
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,208
and laugh at us starving in the snow.

577
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,797
He's a bloody wildling.

578
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,803
Never knew bannen could smell so good.

579
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,733
You have one son, don't you, mormont?

580
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,737
I had my 99th.

581
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,908
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

582
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,247
And more daughters than I can count.

583
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,456
I'm glad for you.

584
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,666
Are you now?

585
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,294
Me, I'll be glad when
you and yours have gone.

586
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,422
As soon as our wounded are strong enough.

587
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,506
Ah!

588
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,467
They're as strong as they're gonna get.

589
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,221
Them that's dying, why don't you

590
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,056
cut their throats and be done with it?

591
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,855
Or leave them if you've not the
stomach, and I'll sort them myself.

592
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,939
(Chuckles)

593
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,984
Karl: Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?

594
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,905
Wait outside.

595
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,159
It's cold outside and
there's nothing to eat.

596
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,827
My wives gave you bread.

597
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,495
There's sawdust in the bread.

598
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,917
You don't like it,
you go out there and eat the snow.

599
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,593
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.

600
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,890
I told you to wait outside.

601
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,351
He's sitting there drinking our
wine, eating his fill while we die.

602
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,188
I gave you crows enough.

603
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,356
I've got to feed my women!

604
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,066
You admit you've got a hidden larder?

605
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,860
How else you make it through winter?

606
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:03,782
- Enough! Out!
- I am a godly man.

607
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,200
You're a stingy bastard!

608
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,743
Bastard?

609
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,288
(Grunts) Out with you, you little thief.

610
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,333
And you! And you!

611
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,796
Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.

612
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,302
I'll chop the hands off
the next man who calls me bastard.

613
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,027
You are a bastard.

614
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,283
A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.

615
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,202
(Yells)

616
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,914
(Gurgung)

617
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,124
(Women screaming)

618
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,210
Mormont: The gods will curse us for this.

619
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,795
By all the laws...

620
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,463
There are no laws beyond the wall.

621
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,383
Show us where he hides the food,
or you'll get the same as him.

622
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,844
Unhand her.

623
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,479
- I shall have your head for this.
- (Grunts)

624
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,686
(Yells)

625
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,439
(Men yelling)

626
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,986
(Groans)

627
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,446
(Women screaming)

628
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,797
(Gasps)

629
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,149
Quickly. Quickly.

630
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,400
Gilly: What's happening?

631
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,110
I'm not going out there.

632
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,862
No, we have to go. Now!

633
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,946
(Baby crying)

634
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,536
Gilly: Follow me. I know the best way.

635
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,290
Come on.

636
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:27,258
Run fast, piggy, and sleep well!

637
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,094
I'll be cutting your
throat one of these nights.

638
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,018
Arya: Can I take this hood off yet?

639
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,454
Thoros: I do apologize, little lady,

640
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,481
but it's better for you
if you don't see where we're going.

641
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,815
(Horse neighing)

642
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,363
Man: Halt!

643
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,955
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

644
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,960
Not easy finding molasses in wartime.

645
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,711
Gendry: I'd have some.

646
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,424
Let's go home.

647
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,568
Gendry: What is this place?

648
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,613
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

649
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,500
You look like a bunch of swineherds.

650
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,585
Anguy: Some of us were swineherds.

651
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,631
And some of us
tanners and masons. That was before.

652
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:53,678
You're still swineherds
and tanners and masons.

653
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,597
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

654
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,682
Man: No.

655
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,187
Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.

656
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,356
Beric dondarrion?

657
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,275
You've seen better days.

658
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,277
And I won't see them again.

659
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,616
Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters.

660
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,661
You lot aren't
fighting in a war, you're running from it.

661
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,997
Last I heard,
you were king Joffrey's guard dog.

662
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,711
But here you are 1,000 miles from
home. Which of us is running?

663
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,838
Untie these ropes and we'll find out.

664
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,508
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

665
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:36,679
Ned stark ordered me to execute your
brother in king Robert's name.

666
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,140
Ned stark is dead.

667
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,434
King Robert is dead.

668
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,603
My brother's alive.

669
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,188
(Spits)

670
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,899
You're fighting for ghosts.

671
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:53,071
That's what we are,
ghosts waiting for you in the dark.

672
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:58,076
You can't see us, but we see you.

673
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,206
No matter whose cloak
you wear, Lannister, stark, Baratheon,

674
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,208
you prey on the weak,

675
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,919
the brotherhood
without banners will hunt you down.

676
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,088
You found god? Is that it?

677
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,467
I've been reborn
in the light of the one true god.

678
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,178
As have we all.

679
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,847
As would any man
who's seen the things we've seen.

680
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,517
If you mean to murder
me, then get on with it.

681
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,645
You'll die soon enough, dog.

682
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,190
But it won't be murder, onlyjustice.

683
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,735
Anguy: And a kinder fate than you deserve.
Lions, you call yourselves.

684
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,030
At the mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped,

685
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,992
and babes still on the breast were
cut in two while their mothers watched.

686
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,120
I wasn't at the mummer's Ford.

687
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,705
Dump your dead children at some other door.

688
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,166
House clegane was built upon dead children.

689
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,295
I saw them lay prince aegon and
Princess rhaenys before the iron throne.

690
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:55,508
Do you take me for
my brother? Is being born clegane a crime?

691
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,093
Murder is a crime.

692
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,719
I never touched the Targaryen babes.

693
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,432
I never saw them, never smelled
them, never heard them bawling.

694
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,145
You want to cut my throat, get on with it!

695
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,023
But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.

696
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,316
You murdered mycah.

697
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:16,612
The butcher's boy. My friend.

698
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:21,492
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed. And you rode him down.

699
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,036
You slung him
over your horse like he was some deer.

700
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,581
Aye, he was a bleeder.

701
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,458
You don't deny killing this boy?

702
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,085
Hound: I was Joffrey's sworn shield.

703
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,045
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

704
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,507
I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.

705
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:40,428
Then I should have killed you.
Not my place to question princes.

706
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,974
You stand accused of murder.

707
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,268
But no one here knows the truth

708
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,604
of the charge, so it is
not for us to judge you.

709
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,398
Only the lord of light may do that now.

710
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,069
I sentence you to trial by combat.

711
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,616
So, who will it be?

712
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:07,038
Should we find out
if your fire god really loves you, priest?

713
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,458
Or you, Archer? What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?

714
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,337
Or is the little girl the bravest one here?

715
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,885
She might be.

716
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,805
But it's me you'll fight.

717
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,326
(Kraznys speaking in valyrian)

718
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,040
The master says they are untested.

719
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:57,380
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

720
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,173
There are many small cities between

721
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,050
here and there, cities ripe for sacking.

722
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,180
Should you take captives, the masters will

723
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,307
buy the healthy ones and for a good price.

724
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,106
And who knows?

725
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,359
In 10 years, some of the boys you send them

726
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,778
may be unsullied in their turn.

727
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,698
Thus, all shall prosper.

728
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,545
(People murmuring)

729
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,216
(Dragon hissing)

730
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,428
(Screeching)

731
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,660
(Screeching)

732
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,588
Is it done, then? They belong to me?

733
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,840
(Both speaking valyrian)

734
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,175
It is done.

735
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,402
- Missandei: It is done.
- (Kraznys in valyrian)

736
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,969
She holds the whip.

737
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,846
You hold the whip.

738
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,932
This bitch has her army.

739
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,108
(Screeching)

740
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,705
(In valyrian)

741
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,332
Unsumed!

742
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,214
(Screeching)

743
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,882
Fonnard march!

744
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,885
Halt!

745
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,686
Tell the bitch her beast won't come.

746
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,940
A dragon is not a slave.

747
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,903
You speak valyrian?

748
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,739
I am Daenerys stormborn
of the house Targaryen,

749
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,325
of the blood of old valyria.

750
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,870
Valyrian is my mother tongue.

751
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,000
Unsumed!

752
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,670
Slay the masters,

753
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:47,091
slay the soldiers,
slay every man who holds a whip,

754
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,759
but harm no child.

755
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,095
Strike the chains off every slave you see!

756
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,305
(Groans)

757
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,349
I am your master!

758
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,185
Kill her! Kill her!

759
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,271
Kill her!

760
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,897
Dracarys.

761
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,735
(Screaming)

762
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,154
Unsumed!

763
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:39,119
You have been slaves all your life.
Today you are free.

764
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:45,834
Any man who wishes to leave may leave,
and no one will harm him.

765
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,337
I give you my word.

766
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:55,010
Will you fight for me?
As free men?

767
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,525
(Thumping rhythmically)

768
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:00,909
(Dragon screeches)
