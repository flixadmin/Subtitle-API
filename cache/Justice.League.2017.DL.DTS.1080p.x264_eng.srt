00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:52,804
<i>- There he is!
- Shh!</i>

2
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:53,930
Oh, sorry.

3
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:57,600
<i>Superman, Superman,
can we ask you some questions?</i>

4
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,018
<i>It's for our podcast.</i>

5
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,186
<i>Well, in that case...</i>

6
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:03,106
<i>- How many people have you saved?
- |...</i>

7
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,567
<i>Never mind. Does your thing
really stand for hope?</i>

8
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,818
<i>Yes. It does.</i>

9
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,319
<i><i>But it looks like an </i>

10
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:09,821
<i>Yes. It's meant to. It's...</i>

11
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,157
<i>It's meant to wind like a river.</i>

12
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,159
<i>It comes and goes. My...</i>

13
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:20,415
<i>A man I knew used to say
hope is like your car keys.</i>

14
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,127
<i>Easy to lose, but if you dig around,
it's usually close by.</i>

15
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,087
<i>Did you ever fight a hippo?</i>

16
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,255
<i>No. Shh! That's dumb.</i>

17
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>But hippos are the most deadly.</i>

18
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,217
<i>Uh... What is, uh...</i>

19
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,219
<i>What's the best thing
about planet Earth?</i>

20
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,345
<i>Hmm...</i>

21
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,976
What are you doing?

22
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,355
Wait. No, Wait. Wait. Wait!

23
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,732
Please! Please, man. Please!

24
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,405
What do you want from me?

25
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,906
Feat

26
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,617
They can smell it.

27
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,721
What the hell?

28
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,148
What was that?

29
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,524
A scout.

30
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,818
From space?

31
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,653
<i>Like an alien army?</i>

32
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,405
<i>Alfred, are you seeing this?</i>

33
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,325
I am.
Matches the other sightings.

34
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,454
And that pattern is all over
Luthor's notes.

35
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,164
Prep the jet. We're going north tonight.

36
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,584
Good. It's time then.

37
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,005
It's 'cause they know
he's dead, right?

38
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,840
Superman.

39
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,551
He's gone.

40
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,304
<i>Where does that leave us?</i>

41
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,193
Drop your guns now!

42
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,406
Excuse me.

43
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,703
Go!

44
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,917
Move it! Move! Move!

45
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,463
Get down!

46
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,508
Line them up along the wall!

47
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,843
Keep them quiet!

48
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,348
<i>Children, stay close to me.</i>

49
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,626
Who are you?

50
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,546
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

51
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,840
Now, who are you?

52
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,427
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

53
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,554
We know that sin has brought on
this plague of aliens.

54
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,347
Why the hostages?

55
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,767
You're too late.

56
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,977
The countdown's already begun.

57
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:24,106
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

58
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,276
<i>While the world watches.</i>

59
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,654
<i>GUNMAN'. Hush!</i>

60
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,781
Shut up!

61
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,741
This is man's best hope.

62
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,826
Down with the modern world.

63
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,245
Back to the Dark Ages

64
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,165
and the safety of holy fear.

65
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,085
Quiet!

66
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,916
This would've been over quickly, but...

67
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,378
No! Don't!

68
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:49,942
I don't believe it.

69
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,443
<i>What are you?</i>

70
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,945
A believer.

71
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,859
<i>I'm asking for your help.</i>

72
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:37,448
I believe there is a stranger
who comes to this village from the sea.

73
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,867
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

74
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,785
Brings fish.

75
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,705
<i>He comes on the king tide.</i>

76
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,374
That was last night.

77
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,591
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

78
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,720
Well, this stranger doesn't come
by ship.

79
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,808
There are enemies coming from far away.

80
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,770
I need warriors.

81
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,440
<i>I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.</i>

82
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,361
Look, I'll give you 25,000
to talk to this man right now.

83
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,737
<i>Outside.</i>

84
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,679
Tell me what those three boxes are
and I'll make it 30.

85
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,101
You should get out.

86
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,811
Can you at least point me to Atlantis?

87
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,023
Arthur Curry.

88
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,241
Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

89
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,285
The Aquaman.

90
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,289
I hear you can talk to fish.

91
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,459
So let me get this straight.

92
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,171
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

93
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,215
It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

94
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,175
Oh, that shithole.

95
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,177
When the fight comes, we'll need you.

96
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,887
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

97
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,264
'Cause I don't like you coming here,

98
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,224
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

99
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,519
People from Atlantis tell me, "Do this."
Now you say, "Do that."

100
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,770
I wanna be left alone.

101
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,148
Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

102
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,649
'Cause you can just leave?

103
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,985
I help them 'cause no one else does.

104
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,904
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

105
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,991
"Strong man is strongest alone."
You ever heard that?

106
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,492
That's not a saying.

107
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,244
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

108
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,620
Yeah...

109
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,623
<i>Doesn't mean I'm wrong.</i>

110
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,459
You ever hear of Superman?

111
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,336
He died fighting next to me.

112
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,920
My point exactly.

113
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,632
What's in the three boxes?

114
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,593
It's ancient history.

115
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,802
What is it?

116
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,597
Mankind's melting the polar ice caps,
destroying the ecosystem.

117
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:07,890
They got it coming?

118
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,435
Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise.

119
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,270
How about if they boil?

120
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,356
Dressed like a bat.

121
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,067
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

122
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,867
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

123
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:38,337
So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this Aquaman?

124
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,631
Oh, I put a tracking device
in his coat,

125
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,799
but he left without it.

126
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,594
May, in fact, not have been his coat.

127
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,973
Those squares from Luthor's notes.

128
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,267
I think they must be containers
of some kind.

129
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,477
Of What?

130
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,896
I don't know. Money. Power.

131
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,607
<i>- Something worth starting a war over.
- Hmm.</i>

132
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:03,070
Well, we've had luck with one person
on the team list.

133
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,240
<i>Barry Allen of Central City.</i>

134
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,367
He's completely off the grid.

135
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,703
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

136
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,080
Disappearing act.

137
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,207
<i>But he does visit his father.</i>

138
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,502
In prison for murdering his mother.

139
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,711
Jesus.

140
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,256
<i>Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence.</i>

141
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,842
<i>But he was nine
and nobody listened to him.</i>

142
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,093
We have somebody at the prison?

143
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,178
<i>Oh, yeah. We'll find the address.</i>

144
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,682
What about, uh, Diana?

145
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,225
Well, you have her number.

146
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,394
What, you could've called her.

147
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:39,857
Oh. Perhaps I should fly to Paris
with a handwritten note.

148
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,527
"Will you be Bruce's teammate?
Check yes or no."

149
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,362
I'm only interested in her skillset.

150
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,989
I'm sure you are.

151
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,449
Can we?

152
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,869
Uh, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

153
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,996
<i>But they've got a partial match.</i>

154
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:55,831
<i>A Victor Stone.</i>

155
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,082
<i>Genius IQ,</i>

156
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:01,170
football scholarship to GCU
and deceased.

157
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,006
Figures. Fairy tales and ghost stories.

158
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,382
One misses the days

159
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:09,178
when one's biggest concerns
were exploding wind-up penguins.

160
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,846
The simple life.

161
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,892
I don't recognize this world.

162
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,852
I don't have to recognize it.

163
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,481
I just have to save it.

164
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,113
Here to see Henry Allen.

165
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,032
Sign.

166
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,079
Hurry it up, will you?

167
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,834
What, you got a problem?

168
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,337
No, there's no problem.

169
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,048
Better not be.

170
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,845
You know where to go.

171
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,774
Are those prescription?

172
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,734
Or are you just trying to look brainy?

173
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,865
Because you're
holding yourself back.

174
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,116
You're going in circles.

175
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,702
You're working three dead-end jobs,
going on four.

176
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,162
Where do you even have the time?

177
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,330
I make the time.

178
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,124
And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

179
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,709
Okay, I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

180
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,795
The investigation was botched.

181
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:25,963
Give me your hand, man.

182
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,431
I want you to listen to me, Barry,
because I mean this.

183
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,476
I want you to give all that up.

184
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,315
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

185
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,779
I am a drag on your life.

186
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,450
Please don't ever say that to me again.

187
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,702
Please?

188
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,413
You can be whatever you want to be.
You're brilliant, man.

189
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,042
Absolute best of the best.

190
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,296
I can't sit here

191
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,090
and watch you run in place
in Central City

192
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:15,053
for some old dude
who is not going anywhere.

193
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,639
- Dad, that's not true. That's not true.
- It's time.

194
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,308
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

195
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,976
I want you to make your own future.

196
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,061
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

197
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,564
<i>- Open gate.</i>

198
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,963
Lab's all yours, Howard.

199
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,924
11:30. Early night for you, Silas.

200
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,844
Yes. Early.

201
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,388
I never got to say...

202
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,601
I'm very sorry about what happened.

203
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,479
Victor was a wonderful kid.

204
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,607
Thank you.

205
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,328
<i>Victor.</i>

206
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,414
Victor, you're not stuck up here.

207
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,087
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

208
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,341
If you stay up here brooding--

209
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,425
<i>I'm processing.</i>

210
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,095
I can access everything.

211
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,930
But I can't put it all together.

212
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,975
Not yet. But if you worked with me,
if we had the change engine...

213
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,312
So you'd do to someone else
what you did to me.

214
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,480
No.

215
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,732
The box stays hidden.

216
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,735
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

217
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,613
I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

218
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,823
get it powered up and--

219
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,116
<i>Does anybody know?</i>

220
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,200
What?

221
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,952
VICTOR; At the lab.

222
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,203
Does anybody know I'm alive?

223
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,497
Uh...

224
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,291
- I didn't think you were ready for--
- To <i>what?</i>

225
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,627
For them to see the monster?

226
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,755
You are not a monster.

227
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,633
It's weird that you thought I meant me.

228
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,263
What I did...

229
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,559
I lost your mother in that accident.

230
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,477
<i>I wasn't about to...</i>

231
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,273
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

232
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,066
But you did.

233
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,320
I got a language in my head
that I don't speak.

234
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,198
It's not just digital. It's alien.

235
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,202
Every day, I wake up different.

236
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,456
Modified.

237
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,708
<i>How do you...</i>

238
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,008
Couldn't do that last night.

239
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,261
<i>Ever since we got visitors
from Krypton</i>

240
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,097
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

241
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,477
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

242
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,221
Any changes today?

243
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,931
No, my Queen.

244
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,978
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

245
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:37,399
It has slept for thousands of years
since the First Age.

246
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,150
Why did it wake at all?

247
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,870
Amazons! On your mark!

248
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,796
<i>Yes, soldiers! Fight on!</i>

249
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,339
<i>Ready!</i>

250
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,437
Steppenwolf.

251
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,150
<i>STEPPENWOLF'. Mother.</i>

252
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:24,279
Millennia in exile, searching...

253
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:28,033
At last you call me home.

254
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,160
You will not
like your welcome.

255
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,163
Oh, I think I Will.

256
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,252
<i>Steady!</i>

257
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,798
Forward!

258
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,437
Gather the legions!

259
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,022
You must seal the cage!

260
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,982
Go!

261
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,692
Flank right!

262
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,741
Yes.

263
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,534
Run.

264
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,869
Seal the gates!

265
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,143
Keep it moving.

266
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,126
Got it! Go!

267
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,304
Enough.

268
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,774
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

269
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:10,695
After the unity,
you will join my legion

270
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:14,240
and you will know the righteousness
of power.

271
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,206
You will love me.

272
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,966
You all will.

273
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,077
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

274
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:03,081
The fire has not burned for 5,000 years.

275
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,874
Men won't know what it means.

276
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,418
Men won't.

277
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,630
She Will.

278
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,769
Listen to me, Diana.

279
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,542
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

280
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,335
- Me?
- Yeah.

281
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,379
Nothing very interesting.

282
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,382
That's all you ever tell us.

283
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,718
What can I say, I'm not that exciting.

284
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,012
<i>...so-called shrine of the Amazons,</i>

285
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,891
<i>an enormous bonfire burned
right behind me</i>

286
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:07,562
<i>baffling absolutely everyone from locals
to government authorities alike.</i>

287
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,732
<i>The fire could be seen for miles on end.</i>

288
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,609
Invasion.

289
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,197
<i>On the local scene this janitor's wife
had some strong words</i>

290
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,909
<i>for the aliens she says stole her man.</i>

291
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:24,746
<i>My Howard is a good man.
He's a provider.</i>

292
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,291
<i>And these aliens are gonna
f****** probe him?</i>

293
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,668
<i>Come down to the Lakeview</i>

294
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:34,339
<i>and I'll stick a f****** probe
up your alien a**. You...</i>

295
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,550
<i>I found a little place.
By the diner.</i>

296
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,177
<i>Suits me just fine.</i>

297
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,803
I wish you'd said something.

298
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,097
<i>Oh, no.
I got behind in the payments.</i>

299
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:47,560
And you know the banks jump like
a cougar if you miss by a dime.

300
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,812
Place was too big for me, anyway.

301
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,981
Shuffling around like an old ghost.

302
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,984
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

303
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:58,821
You had enough to deal with. Don't need
to add "mother-in-law" to the list.

304
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,865
Not that I was ever...

305
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,575
<i>Hey, Lane.</i>

306
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:07,163
Who was your source, um,
the activist in that university?

307
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,082
Well, it's my source.

308
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,834
<i>I got tapped for the kidnapping story.</i>

309
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,255
There were all those student protests.
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political.

310
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,298
<i>So, who's your guy?</i>

311
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,425
Well, I'll see if she'll take your call.

312
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,178
So it's a she. Hmm.

313
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:25,848
It's not a she.

314
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,185
Sounds like you should be working
that story.

315
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,104
I'm...

316
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:33,940
I'm not ready yet.

317
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,567
I'm perfectly happy doing fluff pieces

318
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:38,528
about kitten grooming.

319
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,238
For a while.

320
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:44,325
It was, uh,
hard coming back here at all.

321
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:48,371
Well, I can hardly read the news,
anyway.

322
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,248
So much bitterness.

323
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,376
Of course I think it's all
because he's gone.

324
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,005
But I suppose a mother does.

325
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,843
But it's not like there's any less
that needs reporting.

326
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,762
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

327
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:05,930
Oh, did he?

328
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,265
Oh, yes. He did.

329
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,727
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

330
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,105
Hungriest.

331
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,858
Yeah.

332
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:22,238
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

333
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:28,161
Well, stories just made sense.

334
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,123
It was more than just a puzzle.
It was about the truth.

335
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,128
It was about seeing the engine
of the world.

336
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,630
When it still ran.

337
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,100
<i>Victor Stone. Deceased.</i>

338
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:33,810
<i>That one.</i>

339
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,938
Pretty sure that's what made
the alien go crazy.

340
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,148
<i>I'll see about rigging something
for the suit.</i>

341
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,400
<i>Won't be quick.</i>

342
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,318
Anything that can give me an edge.

343
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:57,417
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

344
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,128
Yeah, it looked expensive.

345
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:04,799
Hi.

346
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,427
A new toy?

347
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,470
Prototype troop carrier.

348
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:13,641
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

349
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:14,976
<i>Yeah.</i>

350
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,854
<i>We're gonna need more than a pilot.</i>

351
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,897
I think there's an attack coming.

352
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,399
<i>Not coming, Bruce.</i>

353
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,110
It's already here.

354
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,825
<i>They called him Steppenwolf,
the end of worlds.</i>

355
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,954
<i>He lived only to conquer.</i>

356
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,248
<i>Millions fell before his blade,</i>

357
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:41,752
<i>- or rose again as his Parademons.</i>

358
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,380
<i>Nightmare creatures who feed on fear.</i>

359
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,633
Yeah, I think I met one.

360
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,218
We didn't hit it Off.

361
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,386
Here in Gotham?

362
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:54,640
They're all over.
They're looking for his boxes?

363
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,142
The Mother Boxes.

364
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,602
Mother Boxes.

365
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,604
I guess Steppenwolf took the one
your people were guarding.

366
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,397
That leaves two more.

367
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,690
I'm impressed.

368
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,859
Don't be.
I have no idea what's in them.

369
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,861
A weapon? Some kind of power?

370
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,946
They don't contain power.

371
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:12,408
They are power.

372
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,661
<i>Carried from planet to planet,</i>

373
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,956
<i>the Mother Boxes combine
to form the unity.</i>

374
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:22,752
<i>An apocalyptic power
that not only destroys worlds,</i>

375
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,130
<i>but transforms them
into the primordial hellscape</i>

376
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,174
<i>of Steppenwolf's birth world.</i>

377
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,594
<i>We should have died.</i>

378
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,971
<i>But we formed our own unity.</i>

379
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:37,099
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

380
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:41,062
<i>all the tribes of men
fought side by side.</i>

381
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,440
<i>Warriors of legend,</i>

382
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,530
<i>allies from other worlds,</i>

383
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:55,493
<i>even the gods themselves
all acted as one.</i>

384
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,372
<i>Laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.</i>

385
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,594
<i>Some say it drove him mad.</i>

386
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,430
<i>The disgrace of his first retreat.</i>

387
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:19,183
<i>He swore our alliance would crumble.</i>

388
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,144
<i>That darkness would cover the Earth.</i>

389
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:28,693
<i>And that he would return when it did.</i>

390
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,739
<i>Left behind,</i>

391
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:37,159
<i>the Mother Boxes were too dangerous
to be kept together.</i>

392
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,498
<i>One was entrusted to the Amazons.</i>

393
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,042
<i>One to the Atlanteans.</i>

394
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:49,964
<i>Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.</i>

395
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:54,260
<i>The Box of Men was buried in secret</i>

396
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:59,056
<i>so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.</i>

397
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,813
Such harmony out of such horror.

398
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,316
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

399
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,902
Something tells me we're not getting
the band back together.

400
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,155
The Atlanteans were forced undersea,

401
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,991
and the Amazons to an island
they can never leave.

402
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,286
Well, I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

403
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,039
We tend to act like the Doomsday Clock
has a snooze button.

404
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,916
- How long until--
- Days.

405
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:27,918
At most.

406
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,631
Steppenwolf's mistake last time
was attacking us.

407
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,300
He wanted to make the Earth kneel
before he destroyed us.

408
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,219
This time he'll just go after the boxes.

409
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,806
I got a location for
one of our recruits. Barry Allen.

410
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,601
What about the other one?
Victor Stone?

411
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,061
I was hoping you would dig him up.

412
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,775
We're asking people we don't know
to risk their lives.

413
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,109
I know.

414
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,237
That's how this works.

415
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,689
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

416
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,233
You said that like it explains

417
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,819
why there's a total stranger
in my place

418
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,321
sitting in the dark
in my second favorite chair.

419
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,990
Tell me about this.

420
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:48,457
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

421
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,002
<i>Very attractive Jewish boy.</i>

422
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:55,756
<i>Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocket watch?</i>

423
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,800
<i>Or railroads?</i>

424
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,885
I know you have abilities.

425
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,138
I just don't know what they are.

426
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,932
My special skills include viola,

427
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,018
web design, fluent in sign language...

428
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,186
Gorilla sign language.

429
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:13,607
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

430
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,818
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

431
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,528
It's what they use on the space shuttle

432
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,488
to prevent it from burning up
on reentry.

433
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,074
I do very competitive ice dancing.

434
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:26,120
Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

435
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:51,729
You're the Batman?

436
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,355
So, you're fast.

437
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,941
That feels like an oversimplification.

438
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:59,653
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

439
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,363
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

440
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,282
Stop right there. I'm in.

441
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,618
- You are?
- Yeah, uh...

442
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:07,953
I need friends.

443
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:13,751
People are difficult.
They require a lot of focus. They, uh...

444
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,712
They have, like, a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

445
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,880
Like brunch!

446
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,674
Like, what is brunch?

447
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:24,345
You wait in line for an hour
for, essentially, lunch.

448
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,846
I mean...

449
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,848
I don't know.

450
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:31,560
People are a little slow.

451
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,729
I'll try to keep up.

452
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,481
Can I keep this?

453
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:38,984
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

454
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,236
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

455
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,737
I call it the Speed Force.

456
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,656
Causes me to burn
a tremendous amount of calories.

457
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,450
So I'm just a black hole of snacks.

458
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,369
I am a "snack" hole.

459
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,248
How many people
are on this special fight team?

460
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,041
Three, including you.

461
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,960
Three? Against what?

462
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,212
I'll tell you on the plane.

463
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,797
The plane?

464
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,216
What are your superpowers again?

465
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,218
I'm rich.

466
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:32,162
The program always gets twitchy
with this footage.

467
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,716
You know who we are.

468
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,972
Are you Victor Stone?

469
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:57,104
I need to speak to you.

470
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,941
No. Face-to-face.

471
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,651
I'm old-fashioned that way.

472
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:09,575
If I was going to attack you,
I would have done it by the lake.

473
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,997
Looks like you have a date, Ms. Prince.

474
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:19,376
About time somebody here did.

475
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:53,243
Face-to-face.

476
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,746
I've been doing some tracking.

477
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,377
What you're looking for
is sticking to the dead zones.

478
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,254
If it gets in front of a camera,
causes a surge...

479
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,173
I'll let you know.

480
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,383
That's not good enough.

481
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,343
Not good enough?

482
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,886
<i>For you.</i>

483
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:15,265
Look, I don't know you, and I don't know
how you got these gifts.

484
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,600
Gifts?

485
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,519
No one else can do what you do.

486
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,981
If these are gifts,

487
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,774
then why am I the one paying for them?

488
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,442
We need you, Victor.

489
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:28,278
And maybe you need us.

490
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,572
I do fine alone.

491
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,575
I told myself the same for a long time.

492
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:41,125
I lost someone I loved once.

493
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,296
I shut myself off...

494
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,382
From everyone.

495
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,677
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

496
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,349
The truth is I'm still working on it.

497
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:00,436
And if you agreed to meet me,

498
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,314
you're working on it, too.

499
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:06,817
<i>Trust me, Victor.</i>

500
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,578
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

501
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:21,165
<i>Something came down from the sky!</i>

502
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,541
<i>Cortlandt, you're cutting out.</i>

503
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:23,792
<i>Please help me!</i>

504
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,858
Whiskey.

505
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:49,860
And one for Ahab, there.

506
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,320
From the sky.

507
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,239
I... I heard a cannon.

508
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,657
To ocean's rage.

509
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:56,825
They <i>came.</i>

510
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:01,413
<i>Monsters from the sky.</i>

511
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,166
<i>Tore right through my boat.</i>

512
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,127
Monsters.

513
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:10,047
It's on him.

514
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,818
You took a hell of a hit.

515
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,403
You all right?

516
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:39,905
<i>At last.</i>

517
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,449
The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

518
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:45,827
Wait.

519
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:48,830
Please.

520
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,001
I knew her.

521
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:56,546
Well, that makes one of us.

522
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:58,340
When my parents fought in the wars

523
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:00,634
she took me in.

524
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,802
What a saint.

525
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,720
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

526
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,806
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

527
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:06,974
and never gave me another thought.

528
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,226
Your mother left you to save your life.

529
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,104
Cannot imagine how it hurt her.

530
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:13,730
What it cost her.

531
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,401
But you're not a defenseless child now.

532
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:20,904
It would have been her responsibility

533
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:23,907
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

534
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,493
Now,

535
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,620
it's yours.

536
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,583
Then I'm gonna need something from you.

537
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:35,145
<i>I see, Mother.</i>

538
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:39,775
<i>I see why you waited to summon me.</i>

539
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:45,489
<i>The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.</i>

540
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,075
<i>Amazons, Atlanteans,</i>

541
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:52,287
each stands and falls alone.

542
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:59,544
I know, Mother,
you've waited too long for the unity.

543
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:02,714
I know. But you will feed.

544
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:09,429
And my exile will come to an end.

545
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:13,642
I will take my place among the New Gods.

546
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,562
Find the last one!

547
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:21,441
Its power will cleanse this world.

548
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,694
For the unity!

549
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:27,948
<i>For Darkseid.</i>

550
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:38,834
Oh, Victor.

551
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,012
Asshole!

552
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,765
Eight kidnappings.
Six in Metropolis, two here.

553
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:56,101
All the vics work for S.T.A.R. Labs.

554
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,730
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

555
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:05,068
"Suspect was a giant bat
with huge fangs."

556
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:06,653
One of them was a little kid.

557
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,905
Scared.
Won't say a word but drew this.

558
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:11,241
- Looks like--
- I know what it looks like.

559
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,244
Come on, you think he fights criminals
for 20 years here

560
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:17,539
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

561
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:20,000
I'll talk to him tonight.

562
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:22,586
World's gone crazy, Jim.

563
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,713
Maybe he did, too.

564
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,010
Did you find the cyborg?

565
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,971
We spoke.

566
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,514
Give him time.

567
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,350
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

568
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,019
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

569
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:41,396
That's not right. Great.

570
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,482
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

571
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,816
Oh!

572
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,401
Awesome!

573
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:48,361
That's the Bat-Signal! That's your...
Oh. Shh.

574
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,197
Sorry. That's your signal.

575
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,406
That means we have to go now.

576
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,158
Yeah, that's... That's what that means.

577
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:55,744
It's so cool.

578
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,738
How many of you are there?

579
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:33,949
Not enough.

580
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,327
Eight people abducted from
or near S.T.A.R. Labs.

581
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,621
<i>Here's the potential perp.</i>

582
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,540
Parademons.

583
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,208
Okay.

584
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,335
The demons must have
caught the scent of the Mother Box.

585
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:48,129
They carried people away to find out
what they know.

586
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,923
- So the eight may still be alive.
- Nine.

587
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,595
The head of S.T.A.R. Labs
was taken as well.

588
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,847
You <i>made</i> it.

589
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,519
<i>So then, there must be a nest nearby.</i>

590
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,897
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

591
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:07,774
No pattern I can see.

592
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:09,109
The lines on the map don't converge.

593
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:10,569
On land.

594
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,154
<i>These lead back to Braxton Island
between the two cities.</i>

595
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,447
Gotham Harbor.

596
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:15,782
These are air vents.

597
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:18,159
They all lead down to the tunnel for
Metropolis Project

598
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:20,120
that was abandoned in '29.

599
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:24,374
Do you really think that...

600
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,587
Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

601
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,838
Huh? Oh.

602
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,673
That's rude.

603
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,744
- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton <i>Island.</i>

604
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:05,373
You should be directly under
the venting tower for the tunnel.

605
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,460
<i>Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.</i>

606
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:10,670
<i>It'll give you access
to the machine room.</i>

607
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,637
Define "access."

608
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,598
One at a time.
The bridge may not...

609
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:23,516
Hold.

610
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,316
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

611
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:34,027
<i>Please, just let us go.
I have a family.</i>

612
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:35,445
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

613
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,947
<i>Humans.</i>

614
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:42,410
<i>The stench of your fear
is making my soldiers hungry.</i>

615
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,371
Shall I feed them?

616
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:49,542
You've been near the Mother Box.
Her scent is on you.

617
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:52,045
Please. We have families.

618
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,547
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

619
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:56,716
<i>Please, please.</i>

620
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,219
<i>I don't need to hurt you...</i>

621
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,971
Right. Okay, yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

622
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:07,477
See, I'm afraid of bugs and, uh,
guns and obnoxiously tall people.

623
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,854
And murder. And I can't be here.

624
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:13,149
It's really cool you guys seem ready
to do battle and stuff,

625
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,819
but full transparency,
I've never done battle.

626
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,279
I've just pushed some people
and run away.

627
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:20,365
Save one.

628
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:21,533
What?

629
00:53:21,658 --> 00:53:23,076
Save one person.

630
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:25,745
Uh... Which one?

631
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:29,040
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

632
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:30,500
And then?

633
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,168
You'll know.

634
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,130
Okay.

635
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:37,090
%GRUNTS)
%GROANS)

636
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,842
Useless.

637
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,803
You then.

638
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,558
Where is my Mother Box?

639
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,978
I'll die before I tell you.

640
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:53,440
At last, one that doesn't whine.

641
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,445
But you will scream.

642
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:04,325
Dad.

643
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,244
Victor.

644
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:09,789
Ah. You were born of her.

645
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,500
A creature of chaos.

646
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,169
Not how I see it.

647
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,045
Give it time.

648
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,006
Ahh!

649
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:31,060
Amazon!

650
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,988
Okay.

651
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:44,073
Save one. Save one.

652
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,835
This one is mine.

653
00:54:57,879 --> 00:54:59,964
You overestimate yourself.

654
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:06,012
Child, my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

655
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,070
Alfred, I need the Knightcrawler.

656
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:23,905
Thought you'd never ask.

657
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,449
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

658
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,673
- Okay, you good?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

659
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,467
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

660
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,594
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

661
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:47,804
You have to keep him from it.

662
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,557
- Help people get to safety. Go!
- Promise me!

663
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,510
Finish her!

664
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,474
Sorry, <i>guys.</i>

665
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,311
I didn't bring a sword.

666
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,076
Jesus. He is tall.

667
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:38,456
Oh, fuck.

668
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:52,220
Uh...

669
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:06,526
So, you have the blood of the Old Gods
in you.

670
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,117
The Old Gods died.

671
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:24,836
No!

672
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:44,564
<i>Heads up.</i>

673
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:57,827
Thanks, Alfred,
but I'll take it from here.

674
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,079
Uh, do I know you?

675
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:19,932
Primitive beings.

676
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,272
What are we under right now?

677
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,443
Gotham Harbor.

678
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,323
You all need to move.

679
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,407
You get him out.

680
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:37,575
Diana, there's no time.

681
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:39,744
Also among my fears is drowning.

682
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:42,038
You are a distraction.

683
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:44,749
Mother is calling.

684
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,921
<i>Diana, come on!</i>

685
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:22,203
Oh, come on.

686
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:27,125
Whoa!

687
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,432
The change engine.

688
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,439
<i>Did he just bail?</i>

689
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:55,403
<i>Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.</i>

690
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,406
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

691
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:03,786
Dressed like a bat.

692
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:05,079
I dig it.

693
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,249
May be temporary.

694
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,668
So, what made you change your mind?

695
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:11,919
Steppenwolf.

696
01:01:12,962 --> 01:01:14,380
He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

697
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:17,425
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

698
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:18,801
If he doesn't already have it.

699
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,681
He doesn't have it.

700
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,814
Wow! It's like a cave.

701
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,319
Like a Batcave.

702
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,658
Barry.

703
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:27,119
My father called it
a change engine.

704
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,789
It was found by the British
during World War I.

705
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:33,167
They studied it, but they
couldn't even date it, it's so old.

706
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:37,505
It was shelved till
the night Superman died.

707
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:39,757
Then she lit up like Christmas.

708
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:40,967
They brought it to S.T.A.R. Labs

709
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:44,470
where my father recognized it
as a perpetual energy matrix.

710
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:47,640
Oh, that sounds cool.
I thought it was like a nuclear bomb.

711
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:49,934
A Mother Box destroys as it creates.

712
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:53,729
It's a cycle of life,
but a million times faster.

713
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,941
<i>My father thought it was
the key to unlimited energy.</i>

714
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:58,484
<i>New formulas.</i>

715
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,070
Cellular regeneration.

716
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,072
<i>But it's too volatile to control.</i>

717
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:04,782
He used it on you.

718
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:07,243
I was in an accident.

719
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,620
<i>Should've died.</i>

720
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:12,290
<i>My father thought
that he could use the Mother Box</i>

721
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,418
<i>to rebuild the broken parts of me
with a few cybernetic enhancements.</i>

722
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:17,586
<i>Instead, he built a living machine</i>

723
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,797
that may be stronger than its host.

724
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,090
<i>Too much.</i>

725
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:22,967
Too much life.

726
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,553
What's on your weird mind?

727
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,683
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

728
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,019
A human being can only absorb so much.

729
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,189
The Mother Box was designed
to reshape a planet.

730
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:38,566
So?

731
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:41,652
So, what if you were stronger
than a planet?

732
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:46,324
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

733
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,909
<i>If you were in a conductive field,</i>

734
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:51,162
a boost from the Mother Box--

735
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:53,456
Could bring him back to life.

736
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,045
The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic
chamber, which would be a perfect--

737
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,171
No.

738
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,756
- Diana.
- Bruce, no.

739
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:04,383
You have no idea what kind of power
you are dealing with.

740
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,052
Even if there's a fraction of a chance?

741
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:08,763
That what? That we could raise a monster
like Luthor did?

742
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,306
We have tech Luthor's never even seen.

743
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:12,141
Superman is dead.

744
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,685
We all wish he weren't.

745
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,437
We don't know what state he's in.

746
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:18,439
We know we can't bring him back.

747
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:21,192
But this is science beyond our limits.

748
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,110
And that's what science is for.
To do what's never been done.

749
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:24,320
To make life better.

750
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:25,696
Or to end it.

751
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,656
Technology is like any other power.

752
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:31,243
Without reason, without heart,
it destroys us.

753
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,080
You're risking lives.

754
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,499
Theirs and maybe countless more.

755
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:39,043
We don't have time for a control group.

756
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,878
Is it a risk? Yes. But it's necessary.

757
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:42,588
Why, because of your guilt?

758
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:46,967
Bruce, I was there.

759
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,844
You didn't kill Superman.

760
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:52,932
At some point, even you have to learn
to move on.

761
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:55,434
Steve Trevor tell you that?

762
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:11,158
Superman was a beacon to the world.

763
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,744
Why aren't you?

764
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:17,456
<i>You're an inspiration, Diana.</i>

765
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:19,417
You don't just save people,

766
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,502
you make them see their better selves.

767
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:24,130
<i>And yet, I'd never heard of you</i>

768
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:28,884
until Luthor lured you out by stealing
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

769
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:36,100
You shut yourself down for a century,
so let's not talk about me moving on.

770
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:41,147
You know that if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

771
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,107
We are not enough!

772
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,984
Each of us, in our own way,
is held back.

773
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:47,611
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is not
out there talking about ethics.

774
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,364
He's trying to burn down the world!

775
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:53,784
The way we're gonna stop him
is by using his power,

776
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,954
this power, against him.

777
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,039
I agree.

778
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:04,003
I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the Mother Box,

779
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,255
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole

780
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:08,757
<i>and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.</i>

781
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:12,011
Right, right. But we mean bring him back
in like a "Yay, he's back!" way,

782
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:16,474
not in like a <i>Pet Sematary scenario.</i>

783
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,184
You lose something when you die.

784
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,603
Even Superman.

785
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,396
Maybe not his mind.

786
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:23,939
Maybe his soul.

787
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:27,026
I'll have a contingency plan for that.

788
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:29,695
If he wakes up
and you're the first thing he sees,

789
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,822
you'll need one.

790
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,211
Well, that was fun while it didn't last.

791
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:48,005
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

792
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:50,132
I don't see why you're pushing her.

793
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:53,385
We have to boost the signal.

794
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,970
Put it through the Batmobile speakers.

795
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,347
Yeah, now you're changing the subject.

796
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:57,973
I have a contingency.

797
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,975
<i>Diana was right about the risk.</i>

798
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:02,895
If the plan goes south,
we're gonna bring in the big guns.

799
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,438
But that's not...

800
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,774
Those are very big guns.

801
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:08,108
You've got a team here.

802
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:10,736
Superman would bring this team together
better than I ever could.

803
01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:13,197
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

804
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:14,865
<i>Or what abilities you might have--</i>

805
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:16,659
He was more human than I am.

806
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:22,790
He lived in this world.

807
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:25,459
Fell in love. Had a job.

808
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:28,212
Despite all that power.

809
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,799
The world needs Superman.

810
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:37,096
And the team needs Clark.

811
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,889
And what does Clark need?

812
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,976
Maybe he's at peace.

813
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,311
He'll get over it.

814
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:58,284
You know, I could do this
a lot faster. I just...

815
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,827
ls it weird that it feels disrespectful?

818
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:09,378
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

819
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:11,005
Not really.

820
01:08:11,547 --> 01:08:14,133
- Okay, then why--
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

821
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:18,053
The stories Diana told us.
I believe them.

822
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:20,431
But we gotta stop him.

823
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:21,890
That's the plan.

824
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,184
That's the plan.

825
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,523
Okay. We're not ready for...

01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:35,487
You got struck by lightning, huh?

01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:38,866
Uh, yeah, that's the abridged version.

829
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:41,201
- And you...
- Explosion.

Woke up in a lab.

831
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,163
So we're the accidents.

832
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:47,041
Yeah, that's us.

833

-Okay.

01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:41,303
Okay.

01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:06,620
This is crazy.

01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,622
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

843
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,542

01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:09,683
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

847
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:12,561
I might be able to do it.

848
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,396
<i>I might be able to jump-start it.</i>

849
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:15,564
If I can get enough distance,

850
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:17,566
I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

851
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,485
I might be able to wake the box.

852
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,405
- If that's still what we want.
- We have to try.

853
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,995
This must be the end of the line.

854
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,455
<i>So, I'm in position.</i>

858
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:43,509
Diana's right. This is a bad idea.

What?

871
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:12,532
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

872
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:13,951
Because he's not all right.

Oh, no.

874
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:18,038

01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:24,711
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

877
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:26,922
- It's my armor's defense system.
- No!

878
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,174
It's stronger since the interface.
I can't control it.

879
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,509
- Victor, no!
- Victor!

880
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:32,427
<i>Just think
happy thoughts, Victor.</i>

<i>Go to a happier place.</i>

Kal-El, no!

883
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:57,202

<i>I got him.</i>

Remember who you are.

889
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:41,788
Tell me who you--

890
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:39,846
BATMAN; Clark.

891
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:45,811
I know you.

892
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,319
Please don't make me do this.

893
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,467
Alfred, I need the big gun--

894
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,641

01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,481
You won't let me die.

898
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:33,608
The world needs you.

899
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:40,157
But does it need you?

900
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:42,826
Tell me.

901
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,788
Do you bleed?

902
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,833
<i>Clark?</i>

903
01:17:58,633 --> 01:17:59,718
Clark.

904
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,429
Please.

905
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:22,699
Please.

01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:31,208
Please.

907
01:18:32,167 --> 01:18:33,293
Just go.

908
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:35,212
Yeah.

909
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:37,464
Let's go.

910
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,479
Yeah, something is definitely bleeding.

911
01:19:12,624 --> 01:19:13,792
The Mother Box.

912
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:17,170
<i>He has the last one.</i>

913
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:33,645
You brought us here.

914
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:36,189
You remembered.

915
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:40,485
This is home.

916
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:44,197
You smell good.

917
01:19:48,243 --> 01:19:49,536
Did I not before?

918
01:20:05,302 --> 01:20:06,303
Don't do that.

919
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,471
<i>We just got our asses
handed to us.</i>

920
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,557
And Steppenwolf has got the third box.

921
01:20:10,724 --> 01:20:12,434
<i>So we find them.</i>

922
01:20:13,018 --> 01:20:14,811
If the boxes are even close
to each other,

923
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:18,023
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

924
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:19,316
Steppenwolf's gonna
be keeping them

925
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:20,483
somewhere where they don't read.

926
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,360
No Internet, no satellite coverage.

927
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:24,696
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Not enough.

928
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,614
So, you can't find them.

929
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,533
Or maybe you don't want to.

930
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,038
Arthur.

931
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:34,706
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

932
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:37,000
Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

933
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,960
Right. 'Cause you can't control
the machine.

934
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:43,423
Uh, so, is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

935
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,052
Very hungry.

936
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:50,388
Victor.

937
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:54,017
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

938
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:56,978
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

939
01:20:57,103 --> 01:20:59,773
I promise, we will pull you back out.

940
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:06,029
Just keep the little merman away from me
while I work.

941
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,618
Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry.

942
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:15,372
When you come back, get online.
Everybody checks everybody else's work.

943
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:17,707
Listen.

944
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:21,628
I was wondering if you could
put out a, you know, a feeler.

945
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,839
Like, aquatic. You know.

946
01:21:26,091 --> 01:21:28,259
I don't know... Do you talk to fish?

947
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,472
The water does the talking.

948
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,557
Of course.

949
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:37,143
If the current comes in strange,
it might point the way.

950
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:38,395
Okay.

951
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,169
<i>Wait.</i>

952
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:05,130
Let me.

953
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,841
It's just a little out of place.

954
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:13,596
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

955
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,098
He could've killed you.

956
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:17,559
I was willing to make the trade.

957
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:21,604
And bringing in Lois Lane?

958
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:23,857
Remember what you told me
about heart in the hangar?

959
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,150
I bet you...

960
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:26,860
...thought I wasn't listening.

961
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:28,987
Thank you.

962
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:34,826
You know you can't do this forever.

963
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:36,119
I can barely do it now.

964
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:38,288
Steppenwolf.

965
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:40,039
This is the job.

966
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,249
<i>It's my job.</i>

967
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,961
And I haven't been doing it.
I've been reacting.

968
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:47,380
Not leading.

969
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:51,718
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor--

970
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:53,595
It wasn't my business. I'm sorry.

971
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:58,099
You were pushing me to lead the team,

972
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:00,435
but leaders get people killed.

973
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:04,230
I fought always

974
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:06,608
when I was needed.

975
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:11,696
But to lead, to step into the light
and to say to people,

976
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:13,406
"This is worth your life."

977
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:16,993
When it's your fault...

978
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:21,164
They're all Steve Trevor.

979
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:27,253
We make it through tonight,
you can stay in the shadows forever.

980
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:30,465
Dress up like a bat.

981
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:31,674
<i>I won't even sue.</i>

982
01:23:32,884 --> 01:23:35,261
If we get through the night.

983
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,367
Are you okay?

984
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:02,622
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

985
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:04,666
I know. It's...

986
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:09,170
I just got out of a wooden box.

987
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:13,299
What was it like?

988
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,177
Coming back?

989
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,391
<i>Fishy .</i>

990
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,686
<i>I mean, honestly,</i>

991
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,939
weird in so many ways.

992
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,692
<i>But mostly just--</i>

993
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:32,443
I wasn't strong.

994
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:37,156
<i>I didn't, um...</i>

995
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,159
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

996
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:45,748
I wasn't Lois Lane,
the dedicated reporter. I just...

997
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:48,334
It's okay.

998
01:24:51,254 --> 01:24:52,797
I'm the idiot who left.

999
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,717
But I'm back now.

1000
01:24:56,301 --> 01:24:58,136
And I'm gonna make things right.

1001
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:18,239
Ah.

1002
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,408
You called Mom.

1003
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:22,785
Of course.

1004
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,120
Thank you.

1005
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:30,752
I was hoping it was gonna take you
longer to recover.

1006
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,087
Why?

1007
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:37,425
Because now I have to send you away.

1008
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:40,637
Bruce.

1009
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:42,472
He needs you.

1010
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,725
Fate of the world, I think that's
the deal. He was pretty tense.

1011
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:49,354
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1012
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:50,563
Right.

1013
01:25:51,898 --> 01:25:53,232
But no dying.

1014
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,902
And I get the exclusive.

1015
01:25:56,611 --> 01:25:58,321
Yes, ma'am.

1016
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:35,733
Are you really you?

1017
01:26:35,817 --> 01:26:37,402
I'm really me, Ma.

1018
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:39,278
Oh!

1019
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:50,623
At last.

1020
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,128
Praise to the unity!

1021
01:26:57,714 --> 01:26:59,841
<i>The three as one!</i>

1022
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:30,705
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1023
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:41,716
ls Steppenwolf there?

1024
01:27:41,883 --> 01:27:43,593
Just a minute.

1025
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:45,595
Sorry.

1026
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:48,014
It's Pozharnov in northern Russia.

1027
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:49,515
The nuclear plant.

1028
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:51,434
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1029
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,186
Uh-huh. There have been some attempts
to resettle nearby.

1030
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:55,980
But it looks like really rough sledding.

1031
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:59,317
Who picks this place to put down roots?

1032
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,319
People that have been kicked out
of everywhere else.

1033
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,864
<i>The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.</i>

1034
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:07,533
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

1035
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,786
Transport won't fly that fast.

1036
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,622
It will for me.

1037
01:28:53,788 --> 01:28:56,874
The unity brings all three boxes
together in perfect sync.

1038
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,628
Its power builds
until it can't be contained.

1039
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:05,007
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1040
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:07,635
its energy will cascade, form a loop.

1041
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:09,470
They'll feed on each other.

1042
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,013
And that's it?
We just pull them apart?

1043
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,890
<i>No fuss, no muss.</i>

1044
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:15,476
Separating the boxes
is still gonna cause a massive surge.

1045
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:16,811
I'll have to be there.

1046
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:18,855
<i>But you guys should think about
getting clear.</i>

1047
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:20,273
We're with you till it's done.

1048
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,567
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1049
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,193
<i>And you know what?</i>

1050
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,946
I don't mind. It's an honorable end.

1051
01:29:27,947 --> 01:29:29,907
But we gotta shut Steppenwolf down.

1052
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,285
Superman's a no-show.

1053
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,328
You got no powers. No offense.

1054
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:37,164
<i>This guy might be working for the enemy,
we don't know.</i>

1055
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:39,292
You're tripping over your feet and mine.

1056
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:41,419
Oof...

1057
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:42,545
You're gorgeous.

1058
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:45,506
<i>And fierce, and strong, and... Mmm.</i>

1059
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,967
I know we went to war with the Amazons,
but that was before my time.

1060
01:29:48,134 --> 01:29:50,595
And you know what? I don't wanna die.

1061
01:29:50,887 --> 01:29:52,805
I'm young.
There's shit that I want to do.

1062
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:57,184
<i>I just feel like I didn't really
embrace the sea or the land.</i>

1063
01:29:57,351 --> 01:29:58,769
I've been a loner my whole life.

1064
01:29:58,853 --> 01:30:01,772
But being part of something
bigger like this...

1065
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:06,444
Maybe I'm scared because I'm meant to--

1066
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:20,082
I think that was beautiful.

1067
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,212
You say a word about this

1068
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:27,006
and you'll meet every piranha I know.

1069
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:32,970
I honestly didn't hear anything after,
"We're all gonna die."

1070
01:30:53,157 --> 01:30:57,161
Ah. Let them come.

1071
01:31:04,168 --> 01:31:06,545
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1072
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:08,589
<i>You get to Steppenwolf.</i>

1073
01:31:08,756 --> 01:31:10,967
Don't wait for me, just do the job.

1074
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:17,074
All right, Alfred.
Are we set for broadcast?

1075
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:20,244
Playing all your favorite hits.

1076
01:32:30,004 --> 01:32:32,673
Come on. Follow me, you damn insects.

1077
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:44,894
They're coming.

1078
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:48,147
They're all coming.

1079
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,276
<i>Ah.</i>

1080
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:54,862
We might not have thought this through.

1081
01:32:58,616 --> 01:32:59,992
He's clearing the field.

1082
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:01,660
He won't last three minutes.

1083
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:03,496
Then let's use them.

1084
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:08,459
On my lead.

1085
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,533
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1086
01:34:24,118 --> 01:34:26,036
Son of a bitch.

1087
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:30,666
Oh, snap!

1088
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:35,337
You're welcome.

1089
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:39,592
Yeah!

1090
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,093
This isn't the plan.

1091
01:34:41,177 --> 01:34:42,511
<i>No, Master Wayne.</i>

1092
01:34:43,179 --> 01:34:44,972
This is the team.

1093
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:46,599
Hey, blame the lady.

1094
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,851
We would've left you,
but she didn't ask for a vote.

1095
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:54,481
<i>So, your genius move is dying?</i>

1096
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:56,275
You really are out of your mind.

1097
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,485
I'm not the one who brought a pitchfork.

1098
01:35:00,237 --> 01:35:02,364
Yahoo!

1099
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:22,885
Ride ain't over yet.

1100
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:24,220
My man.

1101
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:11,684
<i>Is this what conquering is?</i>

1102
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,769
Hiding from the fight?

1103
01:36:13,978 --> 01:36:15,312
Oh, no.

1104
01:36:16,397 --> 01:36:17,940
You're all mine.

1105
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:25,739
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1106
01:36:25,906 --> 01:36:27,992
- You got this?
- Whoa!

1107
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:30,077
These things are gonna keep coming.

1108
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:32,162
Okay. You get technical,
I'm on bug duty.

1109
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:33,372
Let's do it.

1110
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:41,338
Yes! That was gross! Oh...

1111
01:37:01,317 --> 01:37:02,693
Thank you.

1112
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:05,404
This is...

1113
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:08,615
This is a lot.

1114
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,221
Now do you see it?

1115
01:37:51,283 --> 01:37:52,576
<i>Whatever
you're in the middle of,</i>

1116
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:54,161
<i>it's spreading for miles.</i>

1117
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:57,081
Satellites show civilians moving east.

1118
01:37:57,664 --> 01:37:59,124
They're not gonna make it.

1119
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:00,334
Barry.

1120
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:02,544
<i>I need you to take a walk.</i>

1121
01:38:09,051 --> 01:38:10,886
God, I hope this is east.

1122
01:38:56,598 --> 01:39:00,018
You're not worthy to touch Mother.

1123
01:39:00,769 --> 01:39:02,104
She's power,

1124
01:39:02,271 --> 01:39:05,774
and power is the only law.

1125
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:14,408
You're all too weak to see the truth.

1126
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:15,492
<i>Well,</i>

1127
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,371
<i>I believe in truth.</i>

1128
01:39:20,747 --> 01:39:23,250
But I'm also a big fan of justice.

1129
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,301
All right.

1130
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:38,265
Kryptonian!

1131
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:56,825
SO, how do I help?

1132
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,118
We buy him some time,

1133
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:00,496
he can stop that box
from destroying all life on Earth.

1134
01:40:01,914 --> 01:40:02,915
We hope.

1135
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:05,667
Well, I knew you didn't bring me back
'cause you liked me.

1136
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:08,545
I don't not...

1137
01:40:14,593 --> 01:40:15,969
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed--

1138
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:17,346
There's too many of them.

1139
01:40:26,271 --> 01:40:27,272
Come on.

1140
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:43,830
Okay, this is definitely east.

1141
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,421
Slowpoke.

1142
01:40:52,047 --> 01:40:53,423
Oh, it's on.

1143
01:40:53,674 --> 01:40:54,967
I'll take the ones on the right.

1144
01:40:57,678 --> 01:40:58,720
It's okay. Uh...

1145
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:01,557
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1146
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:20,951
Dostoevsky!

1147
01:41:38,302 --> 01:41:40,596
ls this guy
still bothering you?

1148
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:55,444
Superman!

1149
01:41:55,611 --> 01:41:57,154
<i>We gotta pull these things apart.</i>

1150
01:41:57,321 --> 01:41:59,781
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1151
01:42:00,574 --> 01:42:01,658
Any blowback?

1152
01:42:01,825 --> 01:42:02,993
Big time.

1153
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,620
But I think we can take it.

1154
01:42:04,786 --> 01:42:05,787
Good.

1155
01:42:06,663 --> 01:42:08,624
'Cause I really like being alive.

1156
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:10,792
So do I.

1157
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:35,233
Clark.

1158
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:43,033
I take it back.

1159
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,618
I wanna die.

1160
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,375
Man, my <i>toes hurt!</i>

1161
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:54,419
I don't even understand the physics
of how my toes hurt.

1162
01:42:56,213 --> 01:42:58,840
Children. I work with children.

1163
01:43:01,927 --> 01:43:04,805
Uh... Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1164
01:43:14,189 --> 01:43:17,859
I am the end of worlds!

1165
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:22,823
Who are you to defy me?

1166
01:43:23,865 --> 01:43:26,910
This world is my right!

1167
01:43:48,348 --> 01:43:49,975
No!

1168
01:43:50,142 --> 01:43:51,685
This cannot be.

1169
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:53,520
You recognize that smell?

1170
01:43:55,397 --> 01:43:56,440
Feat

1171
01:44:00,026 --> 01:44:01,945
No! Leave me!

1172
01:44:05,449 --> 01:44:07,659
Get off me! I command you.

1173
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,663
<i>No!</i>

1174
01:44:12,164 --> 01:44:14,207
No!

1175
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:18,128
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

1176
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:19,880
I'll kill you all!

1177
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,573
Booyah!

1178
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,433
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1179
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,019
So am l.

1180
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:17,687
Yeah.

1181
01:45:17,896 --> 01:45:19,272
Now she's glad.

1182
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:52,973
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1183
01:45:53,557 --> 01:45:56,476
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1184
01:46:05,569 --> 01:46:07,571
How did you get the house back
from the bank?

1185
01:46:08,697 --> 01:46:10,073
I bought the bank.

1186
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:13,702
The whole bank?

1187
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:16,538
It's like a reflex with me.
I don't know.

1188
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:20,917
What?

1189
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:24,379
It's actually the worst job you can get
in a crime lab.

1190
01:46:24,546 --> 01:46:27,048
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1191
01:46:27,465 --> 01:46:29,926
Yeah, I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1192
01:46:30,093 --> 01:46:31,636
This is like a "job" job?

1193
01:46:32,429 --> 01:46:33,471
"Job" job.

1194
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:38,810
Look at you go.

1195
01:46:57,037 --> 01:47:02,208
<i>Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.</i>

1196
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:07,797
<i>It is the conviction
that the light will never return.</i>

1197
01:47:07,964 --> 01:47:10,216
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1198
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,927
Must be.

1199
01:47:13,345 --> 01:47:15,013
Big round table.

1200
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,390
Six chairs, right there.

1201
01:47:18,433 --> 01:47:19,976
But room for more.

1202
01:47:22,562 --> 01:47:23,855
But room for more.

1203
01:47:25,732 --> 01:47:28,151
<i>But the light always returns</i>

1204
01:47:28,318 --> 01:47:30,195
<i>to show us things familiar.</i>

1205
01:47:31,738 --> 01:47:34,407
<i>Home, family,</i>

1206
01:47:36,201 --> 01:47:40,956
<i>and things entirely new,
or long overlooked.</i>

1207
01:47:46,252 --> 01:47:50,966
<i>It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1208
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,344
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1209
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:56,429
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1210
01:47:56,596 --> 01:47:58,306
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1211
01:47:58,473 --> 01:48:00,225
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1212
01:48:00,392 --> 01:48:03,520
<i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1213
01:48:03,687 --> 01:48:07,315
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1214
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:14,114
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1215
01:48:14,823 --> 01:48:17,659
But <i>these</i> heroes
were here the whole time

1216
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:23,581
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

1217
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:30,505
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

1218
01:48:33,091 --> 01:48:34,342
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1219
01:49:32,901 --> 01:49:35,153
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1220
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:37,280
Not at all, Barry.

1221
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:39,032
Curious myself.

1222
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:41,076
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

1223
01:49:41,201 --> 01:49:43,369
Well, it is a competition.

1224
01:49:43,536 --> 01:49:46,372
But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

1225
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:47,957
But if I win, you're off the team.

1226
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:55,298
- No...
- Oof.

1227
01:49:57,050 --> 01:49:58,551
If I Win...

1228
01:49:58,927 --> 01:50:01,679
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

1229
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:04,224
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1230
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:06,351
I feel stung by that.

1231
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:09,521
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1232
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:10,688
Deal.

1233
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:12,607
Which coast?

1234
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:15,276
Uh, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1235
01:50:16,736 --> 01:50:17,862
Which is that way.

1236
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,990
Because the sun, and it's...

1237
01:58:07,123 --> 01:58:08,291
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1238
01:58:08,457 --> 01:58:10,501
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1239
01:58:11,794 --> 01:58:12,795
<i>Luthor!</i>

1240
01:58:22,138 --> 01:58:25,433
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1241
01:58:58,257 --> 01:59:00,468
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1242
01:59:00,635 --> 01:59:02,386
Care for a glass of Goût de Diamants?

1243
01:59:02,928 --> 01:59:06,807
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1244
01:59:07,516 --> 01:59:10,728
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1245
01:59:10,853 --> 01:59:12,146
You better not
be wasting my time.

1246
01:59:12,355 --> 01:59:16,150
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1247
01:59:16,275 --> 01:59:18,944
<i>We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.</i>

1248
01:59:19,904 --> 01:59:21,280
To put it plainly,

1249
01:59:23,157 --> 01:59:26,369
shouldn't we have a league of our own?

1250
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:56,482
English - SDH
