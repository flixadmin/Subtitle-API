1
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,423
Sergio.

2
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,325
Did you stay up late
studying again?

3
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,543
Come downstairs.

4
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,496
We're waiting for you
to eat breakfast.

5
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,833
Tatiana is here.

6
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,038
Good morning.

7
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,711
Prince Hamlet.

8
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,375
May I introduce you to Tatiana?

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,580
Hello...

10
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,171
It's a pleasure.

11
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,666
Isn't she the most beautiful woman
in the world?

12
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,246
Really? I didn't know!

13
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,423
What do you do?

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,460
I'm a concert pianist.

15
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,131
Soloist of classic piano?

16
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,958
Yes, Schumann, Chopin, Bach.

17
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,331
- She has heavenly fingers.
- For piano...

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and for robbery.

19
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,038
Excuse me.

20
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,165
She's a thief and a good one.

21
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,130
Piano and jewels
are my two specialties.

22
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,248
By the way, she loves the idea
of the Bank of Spain's robbery.

23
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,790
She knows.

24
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,753
- She knows?
- Yes.

25
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,713
There are no secrets between us.

26
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,461
Actually, she likes it better
than yours at the Royal Mint.

27
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,916
Can we take a minute to talk
in private?

28
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,748
Are you crazy?

29
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,833
That may be.

30
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,376
Andrés, what's going to happen

31
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,828
once they offer a million dollar
reward for any information?

32
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,126
With a job like this,
it will surely happen.

33
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,038
- Don't go there.
- What?

34
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,745
You're insinuating that the love
of my life is going to betray me.

35
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,333
I'm not insinuating it,
I'm saying it.

36
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,496
But, okay,
let's believe in true love...

37
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,285
- Fuck!
- Let's go inside.

38
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,705
You were saying, let's believe
in true love, and I say, of course.

39
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,711
Yes, let's assume Tatiana
won't sell you out.

40
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,041
Listen to me!

41
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,415
She's a thief.

42
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,745
What if she has to choose between
ratting you out or going to jail?

43
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,423
It's so easy to talk about love
when you've never known it.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,380
I'm being objective, my perspective
isn't deformed by sentimentality.

45
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,578
Let me tell you something
about Tatiana.

46
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,036
I've traveled around Europe
opening safes with her.

47
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,075
And you know robberies are tense affairs.
There is always conflict.

48
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,746
You didn't place
the explosives right.

49
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,583
Where are the diamond bits? It's normal
to blame any mistake on the other.

50
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,746
But with her, that doesn't happen.

51
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,963
It doesn't.
It's like walking on clouds.

52
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,541
We've spent 14 hours in a stinky basement
to open a hole in the wall.

53
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,165
And we made love
as if there was no tomorrow.

54
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,630
Couples fight when they go
to Marbella on holiday,

55
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,538
we robbed Crédit Agricole and it felt
as if we were on our honeymoon.

56
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,205
You felt the same
the other four times you married.

57
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,668
That was a low blow.

58
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,130
Low and despicable, it doesn't do you
justice as a brother or a man.

59
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,958
- Good morning, Giovanni.
- Good morning.

60
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,456
Good morning.

61
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,041
You allow two monks to get to the kitchen,
and you have the plans on the walls!

62
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,995
Please, they call me
Mr. Engineer.

63
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,583
They think we're academics, not robbers.
Why are you so pessimistic?

64
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,133
How long have you known her?
Tatiana. How long?

65
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,288
Why does it matter?
Love can't be timed!

66
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,253
Love is to be lived.

67
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,583
No. You can't risk
the whole plan for a woman.

68
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,575
That's the first rule.
Andrés, the first rule.

69
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,666
The plan can't be poisoned by
an amorous relationship. Never.

70
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,710
Never.

71
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,381
It's not so difficult
to understand.

72
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,825
It's seven p.m.
We have to make a call.

73
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,075
Can you call Palermo, please?

74
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,706
Palermo. Situation?

75
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,421
We've already done ten tons.

76
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,710
It's 10,700 kilograms
turned into grains.

77
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,211
Two percent more than planned.

78
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
Breaking records, Professor.

79
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,245
Like Usain Bolt.

80
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,333
And the defenses?

81
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,206
We're still welding.
We have two for now.

82
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,791
Any news?

83
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,705
Everything's in control here.
There?

84
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,921
No complications.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Over and out.

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,330
Break into the bank.
Don't doubt it.

87
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,036
We're evaluating risks.

88
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,956
Luis, look at me.

89
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,883
I have a pill box on my nightstand
with pills of every color.

90
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,631
I feel weird if I am not
wearing pajamas.

91
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,455
For two years,
I have had erectile dysfunction

92
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,791
because of those fuckers.

93
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,245
Post-traumatic stress.

94
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,578
What you have to do is
stop coming here.

95
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,246
Go with Merche to your hometown,
rest and take care of yourself.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,710
And don't turn the fucking TV on.

97
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,831
Luis, don't make the same
mistake I did.

98
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,083
If you have to drop a 20-megaton
bomb on them, you do it!

99
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,576
Just do it!
Don't be afraid of the consequences!

100
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,418
That's better

101
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,580
than dropping small shitty bombs
every two hours.

102
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,883
Because these fuckers,

103
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,538
if you aren't forceful,
they'll shit all over you.

104
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,575
They can shit on me as long as they want,
as long as they don't reveal state secrets.

105
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,080
If we break into the bank,
Alfonso,

106
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,495
we will all end up in court.

107
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,083
Or something worse.

108
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,076
What do we do then?

109
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,875
Should we sit back and watch,
as if we were tied down?

110
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,583
If they have that advantage,
we neutralize it.

111
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,578
Do people know
what those secrets are?

112
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,245
No! Not even God knows.

113
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,876
Well, Intelligence knows
those secrets.

114
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,541
What paper is used, what stamp.

115
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,875
Wonderful.

116
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,290
Let's fabricate our own secrets.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,790
Let's contaminate the editorial offices
of all the newspapers and TV networks

118
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,575
in this country,
as the Professor would do.

119
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,206
Sierra, please, what you're...

120
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,171
Superintendents bought by drug dealers,
ministers accepting bribes,

121
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,380
orgies...

122
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,038
paid with the cooperation's funds.
All in.

123
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,245
What the fuck are you saying?
Listen to me.

124
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,883
We can't do that,
we would destroy the system's credibility.

125
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,378
Police, politics, institutions...
Everything!

126
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,288
No! The media...

127
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,535
they'll start to verify
the information.

128
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,745
And everyone will have an alibi.
Where was whatshisname? In his hometown!

129
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,133
For fuck's sake! Where else?

130
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,998
And the Minister?
In a meeting in Brussels.

131
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,713
And once the Professor,
our dear shepherd,

132
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,791
publishes the real state secrets...

133
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,500
not even God will be able
to tell the lies from the truth.

134
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,083
We would have deactivated
the ace up their sleeve.

135
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,956
And do you know
what's best of all?

136
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,001
That by the time he tries to recover,
we'll have gotten in and out of the bank.

137
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,133
That, I swear to you.

138
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,753
DAY 2

139
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,173
Are you all right?

140
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,495
My stomach hurts.

141
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,330
From being shot.

142
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,131
Here.

143
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,001
It's hard,
because of the impact.

144
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,788
Poor you.

145
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,208
And I'm constipated.

146
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,793
With this situation,
you can imagine.

147
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,711
Of course.

148
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,746
Can you pass me the coffee, please?

149
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,003
Come here.

150
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,131
Me?

151
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,291
Yes, you. Of course. Who else?
Stand up and come here.

152
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,205
Come with me.

153
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,326
I can t believe it!

154
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,286
Go, go!

155
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,955
What the fuck are you doing?

156
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,881
I'm sorry!

157
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,038
Did you try to flirt with that girl
by talking about poop?

158
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,955
I was just saying my tummy aches
because of the gases.

159
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,461
What an idiot!

160
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,290
Okay, okay. Listen to me.

161
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,915
Do you like that girl?

162
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,381
Yes.

163
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,878
- I like her very much.
- Very much.

164
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,828
Very much.
Did you think...

165
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,706
that talking about
being constipated,

166
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,421
about your fucking
bowel obstruction,

167
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,630
was a good way to seduce her?

168
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,128
Listen to me. You have to...

169
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,288
From now on,
you're a fucking hero.

170
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,995
A fucking hero.
Nothing hurts you.

171
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,083
You are going to give her
your food ration every day.

172
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,626
Every one of them.

173
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,503
And if I get cocky,
you're going stand up to me.

174
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,253
Starting now. Stand up to me.

175
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,290
Stand up to me, fuck!

176
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,205
Yes, sir!

177
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:31,995
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,961
For what I did.

179
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,785
For shooting you in the vest.
I was having a tough time.

180
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,206
Don't worry, Mr. Denver.

181
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,040
I know these things happen
during robberies.

182
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,915
It isn't easy, Miguel.
It isn't.

183
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,826
But let me tell you something.

184
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,705
I know...

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,580
that with my intelligence

186
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,251
and that roguish smile you have,
that tenderness,

187
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,791
you're going to win Amanda over.

188
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,245
Am I right?
You are much better up close.

189
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,673
Well, I do what I can,
Mr. Denver.

190
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,630
Of course.

191
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,753
Now, go to the toilet

192
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,583
and don't come out
until you're done pooping. Go.

193
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,541
Mr. Denver.

194
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,375
What's up?

195
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,828
If you're there,
I can't concentrate.

196
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,995
We interrupt this program.
The biggest secret filtration

197
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,923
has just happened
in the history of our country.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,790
This newspaper has had access
to more than 100 classified documents.

199
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,415
Spain sold cluster bombs

200
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,710
to Saddam Hussein six months
before Iraq's invasion.

201
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,291
It's one of the CNI's files.

202
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,495
A massive leak of the secrets
that were kept in the Bank of Spain.

203
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,673
- All digital media.
- Those secrets are fake.

204
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,880
They're neutralizing the best bargaining
chip we have to negotiate for Rio.

205
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,788
That's not it.

206
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,751
They're knocking down our shield.
They're going in.

207
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,673
Of course, Mr. Minister.

208
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,253
Gentlemen, we have a green light
from the prime minister.

209
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,293
Formation!

210
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,035
We're going to inject gas
at an extraordinary pressure.

211
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,705
Halothane, highly narcotic.

212
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,041
In 30 minutes,
they should all be unconscious,

213
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,995
but be ready to face
any kind of surprise.

214
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,423
Palermo, do you copy me?

215
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,790
I'm listening, Professor.

216
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,415
They're going in. I need you to gather
everyone. I repeat, they're going in.

217
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,750
When? What kind of attack?

218
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,543
I don't know yet.
Keep in contact.

219
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,535
Marseilles.

220
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,745
They're going in.
We need to know through where.

221
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Report on any kind of movement.

222
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,166
We need to get off the regional road.
Find another route.

223
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,293
In 300 meters, turn left.

224
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,788
Dirt road.

225
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,825
What's going on?

226
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,126
We passed that car 90 kilometers ago
yesterday.

227
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,206
Are you sure it's the same one?

228
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
M5354XX. It's the same!

229
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,035
Don't talk to me like that!

230
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,995
- Not now, please.
- Never!

231
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,785
The antenna, fuck!

232
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,325
Palermo! Palermo, do you copy?

233
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,960
It's stuck.
We need to get it out.

234
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,751
Start the car!

235
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,878
No!

236
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,876
Look, Dad!

237
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,078
It's the Professor!

238
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,536
Dad! It's the Professor!
The Professor!

239
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,576
And the Inspector!

240
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,170
Yes, that's right, I'm...

241
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,128
the Professor, and she's...

242
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,711
the Inspector.

243
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,631
Lisbon.

244
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,460
No zeppelins have flown
over here.

245
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,461
No.

246
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,251
What? Do you need help to get
the van out of the mud?

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,960
Come on!

248
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,541
Come on,
we can do it in a minute!

249
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,825
Come on! Come on!

250
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,416
Come on. Wait for her
to get into the van. Wait.

251
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,380
Come on, let's get into position.

252
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,578
Come on!

253
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,876
Push! Push!

254
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,788
Come on!

255
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,165
We're close!

256
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,503
Come on! Push!

257
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,040
Come on!

258
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,040
Something weird is going on.

259
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,745
I thought they were hostages.

260
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:10,923
Boy!

261
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,666
Weren't you a hostage?

262
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,038
They hired me, okay?

263
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,290
Now, everyone shut the fuck up!

264
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,036
Ladies and gentlemen,
they're coming in.

265
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,915
And we all know what that means.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,670
I would love to have more information.
Sadly, we don't.

267
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,420
So we only have one option left.

268
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,130
To use violence
as a dissuasive method.

269
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,455
What?

270
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,706
The first armored car we see,
we will fire at them,

271
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,541
so they will back down.

272
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,498
Is that what the Professor said?

273
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,333
We've lost contact with the Professor.

274
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,376
And I don't know if it's a technical
problem or something worse.

275
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,498
The thing is that we're alone.

276
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,666
And I'm in charge now.

277
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,960
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

278
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,960
We don't know
how they'll enter...

279
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,165
or if they'll use armored cars.

280
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,420
Will they lower themselves from
the ceiling or come out of the sewers?

281
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,078
Tell me.

282
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,670
Where the fuck are you going
to launch those missiles?

283
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,040
Did we lose our minds or what?

284
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,825
Guys, fuck, don't.

285
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,080
Our people are out there.

286
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,920
We got in here by throwing money.

287
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,673
Not bombs.

288
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,378
That would never be one
of the Professor's strategies.

289
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,668
He would try to buy time.

290
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,040
So Miss Trigger-Happy
now proposes to buy time. Funny.

291
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,918
Do you know what I think, Tokyo?

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,210
What do you think?

293
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,171
You know that if we use the anti-tanks,
they won't give you Rio back.

294
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,498
They will burn us with napalm.

295
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,876
What the fuck is up with you?

296
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,168
Come on. Wake up! Fuck!

297
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,415
- I'm sorry.
- No.

298
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,460
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,708
We already discussed this, Tokyo.

300
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,711
Love.

301
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,171
I'm sorry for your romance,

302
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,423
but it's time to defend ourselves.

303
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,173
Bogotá.

304
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,750
This one.

305
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,630
There's no time! Hurry up!

306
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,788
- Come on.
- Yes.

307
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,995
Stop that nonsense, girl.
Now this is the only friend you have.

308
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,956
- Where is everyone else?
- I think...

309
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,881
This needs a little more oil.

310
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,961
No, don't shoot. Please!

311
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,375
He's from the gang, yes!
He is.

312
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,668
Cincinnati is part of the gang.

313
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,630
He didn't kill me!

314
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,748
Don't kill dad!

315
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,253
- Kill policemen.
- No!

316
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,463
It's a guitar.
How do you play a guitar?

317
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,631
A guitar!

318
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:15,996
Yes.

319
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,666
Yes. It's a guitar.

320
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,130
No.

321
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,171
Listen to me.

322
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,880
What you're thinking right now,
forget it.

323
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,210
What? Do you read minds?

324
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,710
I don't need to read minds, love.

325
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,288
From the moment we came here,

326
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:43,165
you've been guilt-tripping yourself.

327
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,075
Stop that right now.

328
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,963
You were all so fucking happy.

329
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,331
Swimming in money,
and now here you are.

330
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,956
It's normal to give myself a guilt-trip
sometimes, isn't it?

331
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,291
I'm going to tell you one thing.

332
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,706
And you're going to brand it
on your pretty forehead.

333
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,828
You're a free woman.

334
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,173
You're free to go to a party,
you're free to leave an island,

335
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,920
and you're free to leave
the planet if you want.

336
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,915
Understood?

337
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,000
Do you know
who fucked it up first?

338
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,705
The Professor.

339
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,746
Yes. One doesn't need
to know you very well

340
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,043
to know you can't stand living
on a desert island.

341
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,995
What are you now?
Bin Laden?

342
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,583
Are you?
No, you're Tokyo.

343
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,536
And the second one
who fucked up was Rio.

344
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,165
He bought the phones.
He couldn't help it and he called you.

345
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,075
But do you know
what matters the most?

346
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,666
We aren't here to do you a favor.

347
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,826
Look at this big birthday cake.

348
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,126
We're here because
we're adrenaline junkies.

349
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,668
We're adrenaline junkies!

350
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,830
So stop looking at Cincinnati
as if he is an orphan.

351
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,166
No, stop that,
and let's enjoy ourselves!

352
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,000
Because this is a party.

353
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,036
Party time, sister.

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,210
Bravo!

355
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,381
Everyone to the table!

356
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,461
What the fuck is this?

357
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,251
- Artichokes.
- Artichokes?

358
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,416
There wasn't any alfalfa left?

359
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,580
Come on, the monks gave us a lot
of vegetables, so grilled vegetables!

360
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,166
And I'm a vegan, which you always ignore.
Today's my birthday, we're eating vegan.

361
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,995
I ignore it because vegans
are the new Taliban.

362
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,253
- Come on!
- Terrorists!

363
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,503
- What?
- You won't stop until we die of boredom!

364
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,793
Boredom, why?

365
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,995
Everything that's healthy is boring.

366
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,293
Nobody invites their friends over
to eat deliciously cooked artichokes.

367
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,325
Because eating artichokes...

368
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,536
isn't fun.

369
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,915
What's fun is eating lamb
with friends

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,380
or grilled piglet.

371
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,828
Or gathering 50 friends at a country
house and eat a cow.

372
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,956
That's fun.

373
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,631
I'm sorry for the cow,
but that brings people together.

374
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,918
Meat unites, cows unite
and artichokes...

375
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
divide.

376
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,580
Then, I don't know why they say,
eat healthy, eat a vegan pussy.

377
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
For you,
I can become a vegan, love.

378
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,333
Not even with a ten-foot
pole, honey.

379
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,876
Professor.

380
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,166
What probability do we have
of leaving the bank alive?

381
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,955
Right now, I would say...

382
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,963
less than 50 percent.

383
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,173
Then, I want to say something.

384
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,960
Well, I won't say it myself,
but it's practically the same.

385
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,330
<i>Missing your lips</i>

386
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,326
<i>I cried for the first time</i>

387
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,666
<i>And I cursed meeting you</i>

388
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,920
<i>Because I can't stop loving you</i>

389
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,998
<i>I wanted to make you my wife</i>

390
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,213
<i>With no love,
I searched for luck</i>

391
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,581
<i>I started to use guns</i>

392
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,376
<i>And fate brought me death</i>

393
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,211
<i>María, my life, my love</i>

394
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,416
<i>I won't ever stop</i>

395
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,670
<i>Loving you</i>

396
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,000
<i>With bullets, I lost you</i>

397
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,078
<i>You won't ever see me again</i>

398
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,825
<i>María, my life, my love</i>

399
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,916
<i>I won't ever stop</i>

400
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,920
<i>Loving you</i>

401
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,960
What happened here, Manolo?

402
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,710
As you can see,
the van is stuck in the mud.

403
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,961
Where did you get this van?

404
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,001
I borrowed it from
my cousin Antonio, from Madrid.

405
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,383
It's...

406
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,753
the Professor's.

407
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,076
What are you saying, Perico?

408
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,376
My cousin Antonio is a teacher
in Madrid.

409
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,825
Is he?

410
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,128
Juani and I are going
to Portugal in that van.

411
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,288
Seven days.

412
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,375
Please, shut up!

413
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,748
And there, we will eat cod.

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,880
This thing is huge.

415
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,035
This is like a house inside,
isn't it?

416
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,165
Yes, like a small flat.

417
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,245
- Can I go in?
- No!

418
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:03,325
Look at your boots!
They're dirtier than a cow's ass!

419
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,921
I mean your soles.
You will stain the carpet, man.

420
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,206
Don't worry, man.

421
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,830
Here, done.

422
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,246
A kitchen and all.

423
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,076
A fridge.

424
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,003
What a place!

425
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,293
It's very comfortable.

426
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,705
Teachers make a good living,
don't they.

427
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,455
I'm going to buy one like this
once I retire.

428
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,631
- Yes?
- Yes.

429
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,213
I'll get a car to get
this out of there.

430
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,711
Thanks, Paco.

431
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:08,631
At your service.

432
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,043
Push!

433
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,501
Give me a hug, Professor!

434
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,580
Tell me, Marseilles.

435
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,876
It's a tank truck.

436
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,918
They're putting tubes through
the ventilation pipes.

437
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,920
Anything else?

438
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,503
That's all.

439
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,633
Thank you.

440
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,421
Narcotic gas.
It's probably halothane.

441
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,210
I know Sierra. She's going to do what
Putin did in the Dubrovka Theater.

442
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,961
How far away are we from
the exchange point?

443
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:23,956
Twelve kilometers.

444
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,328
Hello.
Is someone here?

445
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,793
Turn up the volume.

446
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,995
To prevent a death.

447
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:55,213
As an example, should we use
harsher interrogations techniques

448
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,291
on terrorists?
What do you think?

449
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,035
Are their rights being violated?

450
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,205
The life of an innocent person
is worth more than a terrorist's.

451
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:05,881
Are you confirming then,
that the police practice torture?

452
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,998
- No, no. I'm only saying...
- Son of a bitch.

453
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,920
Can I go home already?

454
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,208
No, you can't go home.

455
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,668
Your statements are risking
everyone's safety.

456
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,040
You will stay here until you learn
to keep your mouth shut.

457
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,290
Where were you
during the previous robbery?

458
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,786
Excuse me.

459
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,415
Because I was there.

460
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,956
Facing the terrorists,
saving the lives of 19 hostages.

461
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,286
You brought me here as an expert.

462
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,921
I may be very wrong,

463
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,380
but I think you realized
you don't know shit and this is...

464
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,668
over your head.

465
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,170
Do you know what your problem is?

466
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,788
Your life is shit.

467
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,575
You talk to your followers,
they applaud you,

468
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,876
and all this attention
makes you cum, right?

469
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,288
But when you get home,
there's no one.

470
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,415
Your wife left you.

471
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,920
You live in an apartment
full of cardboard boxes.

472
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,330
You eat canned tuna,
and your sons don't want to see you.

473
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,706
And you're obsessed
with the kidnapping

474
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:18,881
because it was the only noteworthy moment
of your life, and you miss it.

475
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,628
That's why when you see a camera,
you grab onto it like a baby to a tit.

476
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,455
You couldn't be more pitiful.

477
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,375
Canned tuna, you say?

478
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,043
Actually,

479
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,878
my life is settled.

480
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,748
I go from theater to theater,
filling every seat.

481
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:45,833
I help them to improve their lives.
My book is an international bestseller.

482
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,326
And everyone...

483
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,166
absolutely everyone

484
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,630
in this country
considers me a hero.

485
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,883
Canned tuna?

486
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,075
Bold ignorance!

487
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,250
Now, if you excuse me.

488
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,420
No, friend.

489
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,375
You aren't going anywhere.

490
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,918
EMERGENCY

491
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:50,955
Connected.

492
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,830
Palermo.

493
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,456
Palermo, do you copy?

494
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,000
The toilet's ventilation pipes

495
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,253
may be the only access
they won't control with bombs.

496
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,040
They were installed
and widened 17 months ago.

497
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,081
Even so, it's a narrow passage.

498
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,713
It's 45 by 80 centimeters.

499
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,746
We will check that
the gas is taking effect.

500
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,083
Halothane's concentration,
67 percent.

501
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,751
Gentlemen, we're going in.

502
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,423
This is a high-risk mission.

503
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,790
If they control it,

504
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,075
that pipe is a damn slaughterhouse.

505
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,496
Halothane is a narcotic gas

506
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,133
that makes you fall asleep
in ten seconds

507
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,458
when its concentration
in the air is over 50 percent.

508
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:52,131
Colonel, we reached the screen.

509
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,253
It looks like
there's someone there.

510
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,920
He's not moving.

511
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,751
The police broke into the bank
the same way someone enters a nursery.

512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,670
Five elite agents

513
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,880
and 30 clips full of bullets
to achieve a simple objective.

514
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,170
To slaughter us like lambs.

515
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,673
The truth

516
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,750
is that we earned it.

517
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,883
We will do what Putin would do.

518
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,628
Shoot first...

519
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,878
and ask questions later.

520
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,668
We'll try to avoid that.

521
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,210
Understood?

522
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,211
But in case of doubt, we assume
there can be civilian victims.

523
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,713
Understood?

524
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,171
Yes, sir.

525
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,210
Understood?

526
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,831
Yes, sir!

527
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:41,631
Clear.

528
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,503
Clear.

529
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,790
Clear.

530
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,131
Hostage.

531
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,383
Hostage.

532
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:05,626
Hostage.

533
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
Get down!

534
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,128
What the hell?!

535
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,078
On the floor!
Take cover! Take cover!

536
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,376
Exit through the left, now!

537
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,461
Let's go!

538
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,083
Barricade!

539
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,038
Surviving such an operation
is impossible,

540
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,576
but by that time in our lives,

541
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:01,626
we were experts in making sure
nothing was impossible.

542
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,330
Palermo.

543
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,206
10 MINUTES BEFORE

544
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,461
Palermo, do you copy?

545
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,671
They're using narcotic gas.

546
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,918
Professor. It's Tokyo.

547
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,881
Professor,
all the entries are blocked.

548
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,708
Let's be sure
about their entry route.

549
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,171
They'll wait for the building to be filled
with gas. We have ten minutes.

550
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,711
Change of plans.

551
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,666
Retreat!

552
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,828
To confront them,
we only needed oxygen.

553
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:49,998
And to neutralize them,

554
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,583
we only needed to block their path
so they didn't have a way out.

555
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,915
Smoke!

556
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,671
How are you, Suárez?

557
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,328
Did you see the bars?
They're pretty, right?

558
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,036
It's plastic explosive RDX!

559
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,915
Exactly.

560
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,040
They're more than 40 kilograms
distributed in seven charges.

561
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,708
I imagine I don't need to explain
what would happen

562
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:32,381
if any of you dares to touch
a light beam, do I?

563
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,575
Because this is how this works,

564
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,790
the detonator is connected
to a photoelectric cell,

565
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,995
and if a charge explodes,

566
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,713
the rest of them do as well...

567
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,291
in solidarity.

568
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,205
Is your bomb expert here?

569
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:52,631
Fuck!

570
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,578
Then, I am going
to recommend that you

571
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,496
calm down

572
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,423
because you're using up
your oxygen,

573
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,210
and you will start breathing
halothane.

574
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,461
Therefore,

575
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,461
lie back,

576
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,631
curl up

577
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,628
and kiss each other
good night, boys.

578
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,666
Thirty-five minutes incommunicado.

579
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,455
We're preparing a rescue mission.

580
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,711
General, we can't do that. They'll riddle
them with bullets through the same hole.

581
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,421
We don't know what happened there.

582
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,170
We know we heard the Browning machine gun
and that there was return fire.

583
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,290
Then, nothing.

584
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,038
It's him.

585
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,038
Martínez.

586
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,038
Professor?

587
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:03,171
I guess you're wondering what happened
to Inspector Suárez and his four men.

588
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,880
What do you have to say
about it?

589
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,876
That his behavior was exemplary.

590
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,788
I would describe
the operation as...

591
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:12,916
commendable.

592
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,753
But how would I put it?

593
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,250
There were complications.

594
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:24,421
Don't worry, their health is
in perfect condition, of course.

595
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,290
Actually, we're sending you
a video right now so you can be sure.

596
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,705
Martínez!

597
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,463
I think it's better if you see it.

598
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,286
I'm Inspector Suárez,
head of the Special Operations Team.

599
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,881
We're captives.

600
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,083
But I have to say
we're being treated well.

601
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,668
I beg the authorities

602
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,580
to order a permanent ceasefire.

603
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,248
Very good! Very good!

604
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,920
What's next?

605
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,711
Come on!

606
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,498
What's next? Come on!

607
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,496
One morning...

608
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,831
I woke up.

609
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:18,998
<i>Beautiful, goodbye,
beautiful, goodbye</i>

610
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,633
<i>Beautiful, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye</i>

611
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,168
<i>One morning</i>

612
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,210
<i>I woke up</i>

613
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,211
<i>And I found an invader</i>

614
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,581
Very entertaining.

615
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,791
But he's sending it to us,

616
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,536
not to the press.

617
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,705
I deduce that
the Professor wants

618
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,541
to negotiate.

619
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,133
I see you're a real artist.

620
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,708
I'll offer you something better.

621
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,076
I'll offer you an exit.

622
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,501
The Committee against Torture

623
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,713
of the United Nations has opened
an investigation into the Cortés case.

624
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,921
It's a matter of hours

625
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,920
before they send forensic doctors
to interrogate him

626
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,380
and neither you nor the presidency
want that.

627
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,375
Son of a bitch.

628
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,793
Your only solution is
to hand over Rio.

629
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,915
I am not going to hand
a prisoner over.

630
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,630
The police doesn't hand
over thieves.

631
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,168
Yes, of course,
but there's a second reason.

632
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:21,625
Your operation made it quite obvious
that you've already decided to kill us.

633
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,671
But under custody,

634
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,460
you can't eliminate Cortés,
however...

635
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,251
inside the bank, in an escape,

636
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,793
in a chase...

637
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
you can.

638
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:41,456
I'm offering the state a better situation
than the current one.

639
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:46,208
I'm saving you from
the huge international ridicule

640
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,331
of spreading the video of your
elite commando singing Bella Ciao.

641
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,285
Hand him over.

642
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,583
We accept the exchange.

643
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:01,961
Hand him over.

644
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:16,748
I want all the hostages and GEOs.
I need to sell this as a victory.

645
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,078
I will give you 40 hostages
and your elite commando.

646
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,583
You can sell that as a victory.

647
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,288
It's eight p.m.

648
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,205
No.

649
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:30,631
I want light. We'll make
the exchange at 8 a.m.

650
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,673
I am not going to get
40 civilians out of there

651
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,460
without knowing what's going on.

652
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,713
Accepted.

653
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:48,996
Take care of it.

654
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:49,923
Of course.

655
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,250
Martínez!

656
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,126
Tokyo, they've accepted.

657
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,076
Hello.

658
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,076
Did you sleep well?

659
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,751
How long have I been asleep for?

660
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,540
Fourteen hours.

661
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:35,883
I'm very sleepy.

662
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,165
You asked for something to sleep.

663
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,875
And they gave you
an elephantine dose.

664
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,078
Don't you remember?

665
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,038
Right.

666
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,880
Come on.

667
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,788
We've to get you all dolled up.
You're going to be on TV.

668
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,455
Let's go.

669
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,131
Come on.

670
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,126
Where are you taking me?

671
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,211
To school.

672
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,671
Do you want me to make
you some cereal?

673
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,503
Are you really going
to be a mother?

674
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,293
Will you go to your son's school
to ready the kids a story?

675
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:30,998
Of course.

676
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,833
And we will bring them lollipops to bother
all those sexually frustrated mothers

677
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,876
who say candy's bad for kids.

678
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,628
Alicia.

679
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,131
Your son won't love you.

680
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,788
But you will adore me.

681
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:53,673
Let's go.

682
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,960
Are you going to tell me
where we are going?

683
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:57,961
To school.

684
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,206
HOSTAGE SWAP
AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

685
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,460
And the impossible was there.

686
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,213
We had to make a racket,

687
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,246
but everything seemed insignificant to me
when I saw Rio getting out of the car.

688
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,130
He was alive.

689
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:31,916
Disoriented...

690
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,880
and out of sorts.

691
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:37,668
But he looked so handsome.
