And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

170
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,143
And then something hit us, something...

171
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:26,021
Something big hit us!

172
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,318
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

I would never have told him
what the project really was.

But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

if we induce an episode,

805
01:37:49,578 --> 01:37:56,251
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

806
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:14,937
(BOTH GRUNTING)

807
01:38:46,927 --> 01:38:48,595
Look out!

808
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:20,711
General?

809
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:29,553
Any last words?

810
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:35,767
Hulk smash!

811
01:40:21,355 --> 01:40:23,232
(ROARING)

812
01:40:23,315 --> 01:40:24,900
BETTY: Stop!

813
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:56,431
(ROARING)

814
01:41:45,606 --> 01:41:46,982
It's okay.

815
01:41:57,117 --> 01:41:58,785
Betty.

816
01:42:07,794 --> 01:42:09,129
(GROWLING)

817
01:42:44,289 --> 01:42:46,041
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

818
01:44:00,824 --> 01:44:02,367
(HEART BEATING)

819
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:09,499
(HEART BEATING RAPIDLY)

820
01:44:26,767 --> 01:44:28,101
GENERAL: Reload.

821
01:44:35,651 --> 01:44:36,902
Reload.

822
01:44:52,918 --> 01:44:56,088
TONY: The smell of stale beer and defeat.

823
01:44:56,129 --> 01:44:57,923
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

824
01:44:57,965 --> 01:45:02,427
but that Super Soldier program
was put on ice for a reason.

825
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:05,389
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

826
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:07,850
-Stark.
-General.

827
01:45:10,185 --> 01:45:12,688
You always wear such nice suits.

828
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:14,982
Touché.

829
01:45:15,941 --> 01:45:19,653
-I hear you have an unusual problem.
-You should talk.

830
01:45:19,695 --> 01:45:21,196
You should listen.

831
01:45:23,907 --> 01:45:27,411
What if I told you
we were putting a team together?

832
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:29,037
Who's "we"?
