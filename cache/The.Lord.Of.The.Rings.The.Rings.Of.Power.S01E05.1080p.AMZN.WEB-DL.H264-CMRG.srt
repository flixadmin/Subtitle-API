1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,125
<i>I need your oath.</i>

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,958
<i>The first traces of a new ore.</i>

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,708
<i>Elrond has been
very convincing in his assurances</i>

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,125
<i>that Gil-galad bore no ill intent
when he sent him here.</i>

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,750
<i>There is something more at work.</i>

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,041
Go to Lindon. Find out what.

7
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,666
<i>You're off the Sea Guard!
All three of you!</i>

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,583
Enough!

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,625
<i>I just ruined my friends' lives,
shamed our family name.</i>

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,791
Go to the Men who have taken refuge
in the old watchtower.

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,875
<i>Deliver to them a message.</i>

12
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:39,166
That your people may live
if you forsake all claim to these lands

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,875
<i>and swear fealty to him.</i>

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,041
One day, our true king will return.

15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,375
<i>I believe the man you hold
in your dungeons is the lost heir in exile</i>

16
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,250
to the throne of the South lands.

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,500
<i>I call on you to fight with me...</i>

18
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,125
- I will serve!
- I will serve!

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,666
<i>...before Sauron
claims their lands for his own.</i>

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,125
You have lied, brought a dangerous
outsider into our midst.

21
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,083
We're going to be left behind.

22
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,666
<i>This is how we keep up
with the others.</i>

23
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,208
He helps us, and... and we help him.

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,333
My great thumb. My great thumb.

25
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,250
No. Mi... Migration.

26
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,833
Like, mi-gra-tion.

27
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,041
Means, like, to move.
What we do, Harfoots.

28
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,125
You see, we... we winter in Old Forest,

29
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:21,208
and mid-summer, we make for Norfield Glen
to snail while the snailing's good.

30
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,250
- "Snails, snails"?
- Snails, yeah.

31
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,916
And at the first blush of the oak leaves,
we head to the Grove.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,625
A whole orchard,

33
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,208
popping with bar apples, plums,

34
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,708
apricots, carrots,
you'll... you'll love it.

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:40,083
Of course, the only trouble is there's
a hundred perils between here and there.

36
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,750
"Perils"?

37
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,958
Like a danger.

38
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:51,208
You know, big folk, wolves, fog, rain,

39
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:55,750
hill-trolls, cave-trolls,
anything that'll kill ya.

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,833
"Kill"?

41
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,958
Means to make somethin' dead.

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,958
I'm peril.

43
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,750
No. No, no, you're not.

44
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,000
- It's more...
- No. Fireflies.

45
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,708
That was just an accident. It's...

46
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,333
You're not a peril.

47
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,541
You're good.

48
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,125
I'm good?

49
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:40,208
You're good. Because you're here to help.

50
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,833
Nori!

51
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,333
Oh, great. Others should be ready by now.

52
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,958
Quick sticks!

53
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,541
Let's go. Come on.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,458
I... I'm...

55
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,791
I'm good.

56
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,541
Poke me with that crutch again,

57
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,041
I'll pluck the hair off your toes
in your sleep.

58
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,333
And I'll pluck off my ears
while you're at it.

59
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,375
It'd save me listenin' to your snorin'.

60
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,791
Oh, stuff. I do not snore.

61
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, you do.

62
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,000
Come on, now.
Grove's not gonna migrate to us.

63
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:25,083
Might help us move faster
if you sang us your mam's walking song.

64
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,708
Yeah, go on, Pops, give us a warble.

65
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,875
Oh, come on, it'll do us some good.

66
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,375
<i>The sun is fast fallin'</i>

67
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,166
<i>Beneath trees of stone</i>

68
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,916
<i>The light in the tower</i>

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,041
<i>No longer my home</i>

70
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>Past eyes of pale fire</i>

71
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,333
<i>Black sand for my bed</i>

72
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,916
<i>I trade all I've known</i>

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,333
<i>For the unknown ahead</i>

74
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>Call to me
Call to me lands far away</i>

75
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:11,500
<i>For I must now wander this wandering day</i>

76
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,625
<i>Away I must wander</i>

77
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,333
<i>This wandering day</i>

78
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,125
<i>Of drink I have little</i>

79
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,041
<i>And food I have less</i>

80
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:31,000
<i>My strength tells me no
But the path demands yes</i>

81
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:37,291
<i>My legs are so short
And the way is so long</i>

82
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,375
<i>I've no rest nor comfort</i>

83
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,958
<i>No comfort, but song</i>

84
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:50,833
<i>Sing to me, sing to me
Lands far away</i>

85
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:56,750
<i>Oh, rise up and guide me
This wandering day</i>

86
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,208
<i>Please promise to find me</i>

87
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,291
<i>This wandering day</i>

88
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,291
<i>At last comes their answer</i>

89
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,083
<i>Through cold and through frost</i>

90
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:16,791
<i>That not all who wonder or wander are lost</i>

91
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,250
<i>No matter the sorrow</i>

92
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,458
<i>No matter the cost</i>

93
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,041
<i>That not all who wonder</i>

94
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:31,083
<i>Or wander are...</i>

95
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:36,166
<i>Lost</i>

96
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,208
The tunnel is complete, my lord.

97
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,208
Your arm. Show it to me.

98
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,916
How does it feel?

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,333
Like fire, Lord-father.

100
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,000
I wish you could feel it like I do.

101
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,000
For soon, it will be gone.

102
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,916
And with it, the part of me
that knew its warmth as well.

103
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,125
I shall miss it.

104
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Summon the legions. It is time.

105
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,958
Our enemy vows to attack.

106
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,791
In exchange for mercy,

107
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,583
we've been ordered to abandon this tower

108
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,833
and swear fealty to their commander.

109
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,875
I know I'm not the king you have awaited.

110
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,958
But if you choose
to stand with me and fight,

111
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,458
this tower will no longer
be a reminder of our frailty,

112
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,791
but a symbol of our strength.

113
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,625
Who will stand with me?

114
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,666
Who among you will stand and fight?

115
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,125
- Aye, let's do it.
- Aye.

116
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,916
Stand and fight?

117
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,166
Stand and fight?

118
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,166
You will die.

119
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,000
I say it'd be better to take our chances

120
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,000
bowing to the supposed enemy.

121
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,250
I have looked that enemy in the eye.

122
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,750
He's not your deliverance.

123
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,541
You think you are?

124
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,791
Elf?

125
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,458
I'll say this for our ancestors.

126
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
They lived!

127
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,125
Together, we can survive this.

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,041
Follow me, and together, we will!

129
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,708
Come on. Let's go.

130
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,916
Come on. Follow me. Come on!

131
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,000
Come on!

132
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,291
Follow me!

133
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,250
Theo!

134
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,250
It's our chance. It's our time. Come on.

135
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,375
With me. Come on, lad. Follow me, lad.

136
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,583
Right. Okay.
Give me a hand, will ya?

137
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,166
Higher. Higher!

138
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,333
Enough for that run, lads.

139
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,666
Ferry it out now.

140
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,166
- Father.
- Isildur.

141
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,583
May we speak?

142
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,625
Why wasn't I chosen for the expedition?

143
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,333
- Thought you were going west.
- Not anymore.

144
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,791
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

145
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,791
And what is that? In your words.

146
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,083
I don't have words for it.

147
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
That's why I'm trying so hard to find it.

148
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,125
Why I'm asking for your help.

149
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,625
Wish I could provide it.

150
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,125
But we've far more volunteers
than we could ever hope to accommodate.

151
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,458
Half the city wants a spot on those boats.

152
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,625
Slip me to the front of the line.

153
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,750
What are your qualifications?

154
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,333
- "Qualifications"?
- Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

155
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,958
- You know I'm twice the sailor...
- Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

156
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,291
What about the Queen's Guard?
Merchant's Guild?

157
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,666
- This is about uniform.
- Horseman's Guild?

158
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,750
You're being absurd.

159
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,750
While you were feigning fidelity
to the traditions of this isle,

160
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,791
these men were living them.

161
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,125
Finding ways to contribute. To serve.

162
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,458
Something of which
you evidently care little.

163
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,541
I care. I'm ready to serve.

164
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,750
Nothing would make me prouder.

165
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,291
But you had your chance.

166
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,750
And you made your choice.

167
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,750
Risk Númenorean lives

168
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,875
for some grimy Southlander
and a warmongering Elf?

169
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,041
Consul Pharazôn!

170
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,666
Why are you sending
our kinsmen off to die?

171
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,666
Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

172
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,958
- Pharazôn!
- Come with me.

173
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,833
Forgive me for not sending word
to you sooner. Been a trying week.

174
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,333
Why didn't he stop this?

175
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,666
- He's loyal to her. Rightly or...
- Wrongly.

176
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,625
There are many who feel as you do.

177
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,791
Not enough to sway him yet,
but given the right push...

178
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,000
Then it must be you.
He will listen to you.

179
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,500
When I speak, his ears close up.

180
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,625
So speak louder.

181
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,041
Oi, Southlander.

182
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,375
You have visitors.

183
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,333
And where did the enemy head next?

184
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,125
Further south, I should think.
Towards the watchtower of Ostirith.

185
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,833
I'll inform the Sea Guard.

186
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,708
My thanks, Lord Halbrand.

187
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm certain your fellowship will prove
just as invaluable once we make landfall.

188
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,333
"Landfall?"

189
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,791
Galadriel informed us of your aspiration
to unite your people.

190
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,250
Did she now?

191
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,250
I trust she was not speaking in haste?

192
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,958
As a matter of fact,
it was my intention...

193
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,458
My companion is merely feeling
the weight of his task.

194
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,958
I have no doubt, come time,
he will do his part.

195
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,583
Given that I've staked my name upon it,
I should hope so.

196
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,750
Queen Regent, your father
has requested your presence in the tower.

197
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,416
"Galadriel informed us."

198
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,750
I wondered how the queen knew
to waylay me at her father's bedside.

199
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,458
It never occurred to me
you'd hand me over for a guild crest.

200
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,291
You used me.
After I all but begged you to let me be.

201
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,458
I have just convinced Númenor
to send five ships

202
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,375
and 500 men to aid your people

203
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,958
and place a crown upon your head.

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,333
Many might assume you used me.

205
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,083
Find another head to crown.

206
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,375
I don't like it here.

207
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,125
Oh, it's okay, Dil. It's just the trees.

208
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,083
What madness made them go this way?

209
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,833
Rock foot Pass must be blocked in.

210
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,333
Won't get any easier in the dark.
Keep movin'.

211
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,166
"Easier in the dark."

212
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,333
Wolves.

213
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,000
Why don't you tell me
what's really goin' on?

214
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:23,875
These woods have never been
this bare this time of year.

215
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,416
It's as plain as lip fungus.

216
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,791
He is responsible, isn't he?
The big fella.

217
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,083
What precisely do you expect me
to do about it?

218
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,416
What you ought
to have done at the camp.

219
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,125
Take their wheels and leave them!

220
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,166
What's it gonna take?

221
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,666
Make a widow of somebody?

222
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,333
Or an orphan?

223
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,791
People are gettin' hungry.

224
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,000
Stay close.

225
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,875
Hmm.

226
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:07,083
Oh, this is very strange.
Most peculiar.

227
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,500
Most peculiar.

228
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,583
Oh!

229
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,000
- You nearly caused my heart to burst.
- Malva.

230
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,666
- We saw footprints.
- In the mud.

231
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,125
- Lots of 'em!
- One at a time, please!

232
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,416
Run!

233
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,666
Come on! Run!

234
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,250
Nori!

235
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,708
Nori! Nori!

236
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,458
Nori, get away from there!

237
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,541
Nori! Nori!

238
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,625
No! It'll get you!

239
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,416
Hold your ground, Ontamo.

240
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,458
Make your father proud.

241
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,333
Their strokes fall like the Stone-giants
of the North Moors.

242
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,166
And yet?

243
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,625
They are untested against this foe.

244
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,958
Perhaps the Elf would be willing to offer
some instructions?

245
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,500
There are many ways
to kill an Orc.

246
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,125
But for you,
I will keep it strong and simple.

247
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,458
Stab, twist, gut.

248
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,416
Come at me.

249
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,625
We will see who can score flesh.

250
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:02,541
Anyone that does, I will promote...

251
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,541
To lieutenant.

252
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,166
Swordsmanship is about balance,
rather than strength.

253
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,166
Fight with your feet. Not your arms.

254
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,708
The Elf is fighting a soldier
in the square.

255
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,416
Don't plant roots.

256
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,833
Keep moving.

257
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,916
Never trust brute force to best an Orc.

258
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,125
It's often easiest to outmaneuver them.

259
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,875
Well done, Lieutenant.

260
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,416
Never known a smith's aide
who could do that.

261
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,791
<i>It's not too late to stop this.</i>

262
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,666
Your cousin may hold the scepter,
but it's you the people follow.

263
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,166
- With their help you could...
- Could what?

264
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,333
Assert your influence.

265
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,708
Sometimes the folly of youth is enough
to make an old man weep.

266
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:18,375
Is it folly to try and stop a war?

267
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,791
It's folly to kick against the current.

268
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,916
You see, the tide may rise
and drown a man,

269
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,833
or fall and sweep him out to sea.

270
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:32,875
The trick of mastering the current
is to know which way it will turn next.

271
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,333
You all but single-handedly
prevented our last king

272
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,166
from dragging us back to the old ways.

273
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,333
Don't tell me you couldn't
sway Míriel's mind now.

274
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:42,583
And what makes you think Míriel's mind
and my own are not as one on this?

275
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,791
Because my father would sooner die
than take orders from an Elf.

276
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,708
"Orders from an Elf"?

277
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:21,291
When all this has ended,
Elves will take orders from us.

278
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,583
Now, my cousin can go to war
for Galadriel if she wishes.

279
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,208
I go to war for Númenor.

280
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,500
How could this be for Númenor?

281
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,916
Have you learned nothing?

282
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,958
Soon, we will save
the low men of Middle-earth,

283
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,333
lift them up, and give them
the king they've long awaited.

284
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,833
A king who will be forever in our debt.

285
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,333
Now, contemplate, if you can,
how that might benefit us.

286
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,541
Ores, forests, trades, tribute...

287
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,958
I wouldn't dare stop that.
Not for all the salt in the sea.

288
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,416
And neither should you.

289
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,208
The kingdom!

290
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:16,041
- The kingdom is in danger. I must...
- The danger has passed, Father.

291
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,541
We are doing now
what you always believed we must.

292
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,958
We're restoring our connection
with the Elves.

293
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,166
I'm going to Middle-earth.

294
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,958
Míriel?

295
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,083
Yes, Father.

296
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,000
It's me.

297
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:53,791
Don't go to Middle-earth.

298
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,125
All that awaits you there is...

299
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,833
What, Father? What awaits me?

300
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,625
Darkness.

301
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,750
Can you believe it?

302
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,500
Everyone's talkin'
about what you did.

303
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,625
Never seen 'em take a shine
to an outsider like this before.

304
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,625
Brought you some beeswax.

305
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,708
Slather some on that paw,
should help with the tenderness.

306
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,250
Hey.

307
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,041
Stop. Please.

308
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,458
<i>To an enduring union
between our two great peoples,</i>

309
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,458
Khazad and Noldor.

310
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,666
- To the union.
- To the union.

311
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,708
Before our wines ascend,

312
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:29,083
Lord Durin, I should like to commend you.

313
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,166
Khazad-dûm has been called the quietest
of Dwarven kingdoms,

314
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,041
but in recent months,
your furnaces are said to be burning

315
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,583
as bright as the eyes of Aulë himself.

316
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:42,875
Your mines delving ever deeper.

317
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,708
To what do you credit
this new invigoration?

318
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,625
I might ask the same of Lindon.

319
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,833
Shipping off its warriors,
expandin' its cities.

320
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,500
Bit sudden for Elves, no?

321
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,333
Typically takes you people weeks
just to decide to take a sh...

322
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,791
If I may...

323
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,083
The hand of time crawls
so slowly for our kind.

324
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:15,250
We often overlook the years of effort
we perceive as taking but a moment.

325
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,166
In so doing, I would not wish
to offend our guest.

326
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,500
I would think our Dwarven friend
far too stout of heart

327
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,416
to be offended by an honest inquiry.

328
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,541
I have an honest inquiry for you.

329
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:34,250
From where did you procure the table?

330
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,916
Why do you ask?

331
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,583
This stone grows only at certain depths.

332
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So rarely do our resonators
locate a deposit.

333
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,625
We consider each to be a precious gift.

334
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:55,833
We reserve its use
for the most sacred purposes.

335
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,291
Monuments or tombs,

336
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,541
to our honored dead.

337
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,916
Please forgive our sacrilege, Lord Durin.

338
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:22,458
We shall have to send it home with you,
so it can be treated with proper respect.

339
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:30,125
It's good to know there's still
some honor left among the Elves.

340
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,250
Your Grace.

341
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,166
To the union of our two peoples, then.

342
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,416
To the union.

343
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:51,375
Your loyalty to the Dwarf is admirable.

344
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:55,166
Loyalty to a friend
ought to be expected.

345
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,958
Regardless of his race.

346
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,250
Does it justify lying to your king?

347
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,375
I wonder, High King, if it is in fact you
who has been lying to me.

348
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,958
I went to Khazad-dûm with a proposal
of friendship, but in truth,

349
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,666
you sought something far more tangible,
didn't you?

350
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,000
Are you familiar with
<i>The Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir?</i>

351
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,833
Recount it for me, please.

352
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,833
An obscure legend regarded by most
to be a apocryphal.

353
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:30,166
Recount it, Elrond <i>Peredhel.</i>

354
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,958
It speaks of a battle,

355
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,000
high among the peaks
of the Misty Mountains.

356
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:43,750
Not over honor or duty. But over a tree.

357
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,083
Within which some claim
was hidden the last of the lost Silmarils.

358
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,458
<i>On one side,
fought an Elven warrior,</i>

359
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,208
<i>with a heart as pure as Manwë,</i>

360
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,041
<i>who poured all of his light
into the tree to protect it.</i>

361
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:12,416
<i>On the other, a Balrog of Morgoth,</i>

362
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,875
<i>who channeled all his hatred
into the tree to destroy it.</i>

363
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:20,875
<i>Amidst their duel unending,
lightning ensnared the tree...</i>

364
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,791
<i>Forging of their conflict, a power...</i>

365
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:32,875
A power as pure and light as good.

366
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,958
As strong and unyielding as evil.

367
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,958
They say it seeped down the roots
into the mountain depths,

368
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:44,041
where for centuries now, it has waited.

369
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,583
Durin was right.

370
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,000
Then you admit the Dwarves did find it.

371
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,166
The ore containing the light
of the lost Silmaril.

372
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,083
I admit only this.

373
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,041
I promised Durin never
to reveal his people's secrets.

374
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,916
And what if keeping
your promise to his people

375
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,500
meant ensuring the doom of your own?

376
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:42,875
We first took notice of it
just prior to Galadriel's return.

377
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,750
We hoped that by sending her away,

378
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:48,541
and so bringing an end
to the last vestiges of war,

379
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,833
we might arrest the decay.

380
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,750
But despite our every effort,

381
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,750
our decline has only quickened.

382
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,958
The blight upon this tree
is but an outer manifestation

383
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,583
of an inner reality.

384
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,583
That the light of the Eldar,

385
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,083
our light, is fading.

386
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,458
Who else knows about this?

387
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,458
Precious few.

388
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:22,750
I ask again, and for the last time,

389
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,750
did the Dwarves find the ore or not?

390
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,500
I swore an oath to Durin.

391
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:42,166
To some, that may now hold little weight.

392
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,125
But in my esteem,

393
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,708
it is by such things
our very souls are bound.

394
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,833
I do not intend to let mine slip away
on the basis of mere hope.

395
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:02,500
Hope is never mere, Elrond...

396
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,500
even when it is meager.

397
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:09,041
When all other senses sleep,

398
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:13,416
the eye of hope is first to awaken,
last to shut.

399
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:19,000
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth now,

400
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:24,458
the armies of darkness will march
over the face of the earth.

401
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:25,791
It will be the end,

402
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:30,000
not just of our people, but all peoples.

403
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,583
If the hope of preventing
that is not reason enough

404
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,125
to make you reconsider your oath,

405
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,125
I suggest you find another.

406
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:10,666
<i>What was the land immortal hands</i>

407
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,000
<i>Rose up from Sundering Sea?</i>

408
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,416
<i>Land of the gift, land of the star</i>

409
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,916
<i>To shine eternally?</i>

410
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,458
<i>'Twas Númenor Fair Númenor</i>

411
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,875
<i>Bright isle filled with grace...</i>

412
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,083
I said it won't be dangerous.

413
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,041
I wager it'll all be over
by the time I get off the boat.

414
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,500
Just don't tell my father.

415
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,500
He keeps crowing to everyone with ears,
his future son-in-law's a war hero.

416
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,166
Sing! Come on, sing.

417
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,958
You remember the words, don't you?

418
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,000
After hearing you squawk them all night,
I fear I'll never forget them.

419
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,541
Perhaps Isildur will sing with you.

420
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,708
<i>Oh, bless our every breath...</i>

421
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,083
This should be interesting.

422
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,875
<i>Make our great land to ever stand</i>

423
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,125
<i>Our swords to conquer death</i>

424
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,083
- The answer's no.
- I haven't said anything yet.

425
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,375
I've known you 15 years.

426
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,291
You think I don't know
what you're here to say?

427
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,208
- It's actually 16, but I mean...
- Ontamo.

428
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,750
Right. What have I come to say?

429
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,458
A fairly lavish apology,
which Ontamo, of course,

430
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,875
would've accepted instantly,

431
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,000
but I wouldn't have.

432
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,583
And do you know why?

433
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,625
You're only apologizing because you think
now that I've been promoted,

434
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,541
I can get you on the expedition.

435
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,416
- Can you?
- Right.

436
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,166
I'd just like to say,
I wouldn't have accepted instantly.

437
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,166
- But I am glad that you apologized.
- No, he didn't.

438
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,541
I did!

439
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:44,625
But I'll gladly do it again.
I'm sorry I started the fight.

440
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,458
Now please bring me with you.

441
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,833
No.

442
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,333
What'll it take
to make this right?

443
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,875
Fine, you get a free hit.

444
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,375
Jaw, gut, your choice. One hit.

445
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,083
Three.

446
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,708
Uh, two.

447
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,541
Actually...

448
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,250
That felt like three.

449
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,250
So, you'll bring me on the ship?

450
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:27,208
Isildur, you're my oldest friend.

451
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:32,000
And if you want to know the truth,
you're probably still my best, but...

452
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,583
- What?
- Ontamo, please.

453
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,000
I can't, in good conscience, stake my name

454
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,166
recommending you for a duty
that you might well decide to abandon.

455
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,375
- It'll be different this time.
- Hmm.

456
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,875
One day, I hope it will be.

457
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,333
One day, I hope you find something

458
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,750
that you would be willing
to sacrifice anything for.

459
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,333
I'll take care of Berek for you.
I promise.

460
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,083
Berek's going?

461
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,833
The horse master recruited him.

462
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,750
Sorry, Isil. The sea is always right.

463
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:00,000
Are you stowing away?

464
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,875
Are you about to burn the boat?

465
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:12,875
Get out of here this moment.
I won't let anyone know I saw you.

466
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,208
- Hand me the lantern.
- Don't.

467
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,875
Give it.

468
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,416
Gather every hand. Hurry!

469
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,541
Get them out. Quickly.

470
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,625
Get them out! Isildur?

471
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,500
Isildur?

472
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,708
What happened?

473
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:15,833
He was in a fishing boat.
A cask must've gone up.

474
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,833
A cask?

475
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,916
He saved my life.

476
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,583
He could've just left,
but he saved my life.

477
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:25,916
Captain!

478
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,333
We have reason
to suspect a passing brigand,

479
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,333
but we've yet to identify him.

480
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,000
We're fortunate we didn't lose
the rest of the ships as well.

481
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:54,833
This was clearly an attempt
to kindle your doubts, Queen Regent.

482
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:58,208
- Do not let it.
- I'm forced to disagree with the Elf.

483
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,708
Perhaps we did act in haste.

484
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:03,250
A kingdom should be led. Not dragged.

485
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,125
I recommend we delay the voyage

486
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,916
until we've had time enough
to win more hearts to your cause.

487
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Our enemy grows stronger every day.
Perhaps every hour we hesitate.

488
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,375
Remember why you chose this path.
Remember your faith.

489
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,583
Do you think I could forget?

490
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:22,541
- We still have three ships.
- And your father's blessing.

491
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,958
What of Lord Halbrand?

492
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,291
He awaits our departure.

493
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,791
I'm sure he does.

494
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,041
Shall I tell the Sea Guard to stand down?

495
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:48,458
This council will reconvene at first light
to make a final decision.

496
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,833
See to it Lord Halbrand attends.

497
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,125
What have you been
able to ascertain?

498
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,000
Elrond, forgive me.

499
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,875
Forgive you?

500
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,333
That I did not tell you sooner.

501
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,458
You knew.

502
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,583
I begged him to allow you
into our confidence from the start,

503
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,750
but the High King forbade it.

504
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,125
And this... this<i> mithril...</i>

505
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,000
It is our only salvation?

506
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:35,125
Elrond, I have tested it
under every duress.

507
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,000
Nothing diminishes its light.

508
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:44,458
We believe if we can secure
vast quantities of it quickly,

509
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:49,958
enough to saturate every last Elf
in the light of the Valar once more...

510
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,958
Then, yes.

511
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,250
Yes. It very well could be.

512
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,500
I am sorry.

513
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,333
That the High King deceived me?

514
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,750
Or that now our people are doomed
unless I break an oath?

515
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,958
And betray a friend?

516
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:29,250
I was there, Elrond,
the night your father set sail.

517
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:37,291
A mortal man, who believed
he could convince the very Gods

518
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,916
to come to war in our aid.

519
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:46,208
I heard your mother
pleading with him not to go,

520
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:50,125
asking him, imploring him, why,
why must it be him?

521
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,125
And do you know what he said?

522
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,125
Because he was
the only one who could do it.

523
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,791
I was wrong to use you.

524
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:28,291
For that, I'm sorry.

525
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,541
Tomorrow, the queen
will call you to audience.

526
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,791
Your voice at that meeting may well decide
whether this mission stands or falls.

527
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,791
- Help me.
- I think I've helped you quite enough.

528
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,083
Then help yourself.

529
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,750
Stop fighting me, and together,
let us fight them.

530
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:53,750
Not so long ago, men like me
were fighting alongside them.

531
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,500
Men like you. Not you, yourself.

532
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,166
You're wrong.

533
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:11,750
You don't know what I did
before I ended up on that raft.

534
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,416
<i>You don't know how I survived.</i>

535
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,875
<i>How we all survived.</i>

536
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,458
And when these people discover it,
they will cast me out.

537
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,666
So will you.

538
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:48,666
Sometimes to find the light,
we must first touch the darkness.

539
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,208
What do you know of darkness?

540
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,083
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

541
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,583
Who is it you lost?

542
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,833
My brother.

543
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,750
What happened to him?

544
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,458
He was killed.

545
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:10,791
In a place of darkness and despair.

546
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,583
By servants of Sauron.
Is that enough for you?

547
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,166
So this is about vengeance?

548
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,625
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking seawater.

549
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,250
Then what is it? Why do you keep fighting?

550
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,416
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

551
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,625
The least you can do is tell me why.

552
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,166
Why do you keep fighting?

553
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,000
Because I cannot stop.

554
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:49,375
The company I led mutinied against me.

555
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,958
My closest friend conspired
with the king to exile me.

556
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,375
And each of them acted as they did...

557
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:06,666
Because I believe
they could no longer distinguish me...

558
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,208
from the evil I was fighting.

559
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:17,416
I'm sorry.

560
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:22,250
For your brother.

561
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:24,708
For all of it.

562
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm sorry.

563
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,875
Your sorrow cannot ease my pain.

564
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:35,166
And nor will a hammer and tongs
ease yours.

565
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,416
There is no peace
to be found for you here.

566
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,000
And nor for me.

567
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,500
No lasting peace in any path,

568
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,916
but that which lies across the sea.

569
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:50,583
I have fought for centuries,
seeking to earn mine.

570
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,083
This is how you earn yours.

571
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,333
Long have I awaited this day.

572
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:20,500
The day your kind would return at last,

573
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:26,000
lift us up from the muck and the filth,

574
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:30,958
to take our rightful place at your side.

575
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:36,666
I pledge my undying service to you.

576
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:43,250
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

577
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,958
You are Sauron, are you not?

578
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,583
Hey, hey... Wait...

579
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,833
I'll serve you, then. Whoever you are.

580
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:40,041
Only blood can bind.

581
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:49,875
Waldreg?

582
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,583
Waldreg...

583
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:03,875
Waldreg, no.

584
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,416
No.

585
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,875
No.

586
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:11,833
No.

587
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,166
No.

588
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,166
No!

589
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,416
Lift your aim next time.

590
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,583
And don't be so afraid of the string.

591
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,083
Why bother trying to teach me?

592
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,666
Because it took me over 200 years

593
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,416
to develop the bravery
that's keeping me standing here tonight.

594
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,666
You found it in only 14.

595
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,583
And we're going to need it
in the fight to come.

596
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,041
All my life,
your kind has watched us.

597
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,875
Counting every whisper.

598
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,833
Every kitchen knife too sharp.

599
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:54,666
We're all about to be buried
in this tower.

600
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,541
So why be buried with us?

601
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:01,250
Because in counting the whispers
and the knives,

602
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:04,958
I've come to know the voices
and the hands of those behind them.

603
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,750
Half of us just left.

604
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:10,666
But half stayed.

605
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,208
Including you.

606
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,333
So lift your aim.

607
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:41,083
There's something you don't know.

608
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,083
I've seen this before.

609
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:40,250
It is a key.

610
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:46,875
Conjured by some forgotten craft
of the enemy, to enslave your ancestors.

611
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,500
A key to what?

612
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,291
I do not know.

613
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,166
The enemy commander
spoke of becoming a god.

614
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,916
Of giving the Orcs a home in these lands.

615
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:02,583
But whatever his design,
this much is certain.

616
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:08,291
Our enemy knows your son
has what he needs to enact it.

617
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,666
How long?

618
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,375
Days.

619
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,458
Maybe hours.

620
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,125
We can survive this, Bronwyn.

621
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:31,208
There is a way.

622
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:33,958
There must be.

623
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,083
There is one.

624
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:44,041
No! Bow to the enemy,
and you take away everything.

625
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,625
From your son, and his sons after him.

626
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:53,333
Your people have worked an entire age
to earn back their virtue.

627
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:57,166
Would you undo it all
in just one moment of despair?

628
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,083
There must be another way.

629
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,666
Name it. I beg you.

630
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,208
See?

631
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,708
You were right to watch us.

632
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,458
Because we are destined for the darkness.

633
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,666
It's how we survive.

634
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,416
Perhaps it's who we are.

635
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:29,833
Who we will always be.

636
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,375
There's far more at stake here
than just our lives.

637
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:40,666
When Morgoth was at war,
whole continents sank.

638
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,416
Who is to say what horrors
this might unleash,

639
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,166
should our enemy obtain it?

640
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,250
What power do we have to stop him?

641
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,791
Look around. It's over.

642
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,666
- Not yet.
- Soon enough.

643
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,958
And when they march upon us,
this tower will fall.

644
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,041
<i>Nampat!</i>

645
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,166
<i>Nampat!</i>

646
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,416
<i>Nampat!</i>

647
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:27,458
<i>Nampat!</i>

648
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:31,500
<i>Nampat!</i>

649
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,125
<i>Nampat!</i>

650
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:02,000
You made it up, didn't you?

651
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,750
Disa's been wanting a new table
for years, so...

652
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,083
Ah, come on, it's not that heavy.

653
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:17,166
It is not the weight of the table
that burdens me.

654
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,625
So why don't you come out with it?

655
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,125
Because a burden shared
may either be halved or doubled.

656
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,291
Depending on the heart that receives it.

657
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:28,750
Aulë's beard!
Enough with the quail sauce.

658
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,791
Give me the meat, and give it to me raw.

659
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,958
I have not been truthful with you, Durin.

660
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:44,791
I did not come to Khazad-dûm
for friendship, but ambition.

661
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,791
I did not know it.

662
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,916
But I came for<i> mithril.</i>

663
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,291
Why?

664
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,416
Without it,

665
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,916
my kind must either abandon these shores
by spring, or perish.

666
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:11,041
Perish?

667
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,166
Perish how?

668
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:21,833
Our immortal souls
will dwindle into nothing,

669
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,166
slowly diminishing,

670
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,833
until we are but shadows,

671
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,916
swept away by the tides of time.

672
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,000
Forever.

673
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:54,708
So the fate of the entire Elven race
is in my hands?

674
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,416
So it would appear.

675
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,333
Say that again.

676
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:11,333
The fate of the entire Elven race
is in your hands.

677
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,458
Whose hands?

678
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,166
Yours.

679
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,541
Hmm.

680
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:43,541
Fetch your feathery shirts.
Let's start walking.

681
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:46,000
- Durin...
- Don't thank me yet.

682
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,833
Thank me after we find a way
to convince my father.

683
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:51,125
Now can we please get moving?

684
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,041
It's a long journey back.

685
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,083
And all this sunlight is startin'
to give me a sour stomach.

686
01:01:56,708 --> 01:02:00,291
Under one condition.
Tell Disa the table's from me.

687
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:02,125
Don't push your luck, Elf.

688
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:25,666
Lord Halbrand,
the Queen Regent summons you.

689
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,250
Look whose father
secured him a post. Again.

690
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,208
I earned mine. Same as you.

691
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:43,500
Soldier.

692
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,333
Report to the horse master.

693
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:51,208
Thought I was in cavalry.

694
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,625
You are.

695
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,208
Stable sweep.

696
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:17,625
Soldiers!

697
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,000
Clear the lines!

698
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,166
Square the sail!

699
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,250
We head nor'-east.

700
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,208
For Middle-earth.

701
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,000
Yes!

702
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:13,750
<i>The sun is fast falling</i>

703
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,708
<i>Beneath trees of stone</i>

704
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:20,083
<i>The light in the tower</i>

705
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:23,291
<i>No longer my home</i>

706
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,083
<i>Past eyes of pale fire</i>

707
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:29,250
<i>Black sand for my bed</i>

708
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,875
<i>I trade all I've known</i>

709
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:36,125
<i>For the unknown ahead</i>

710
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,875
<i>Call to me
Call to me lands far away</i>

711
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:47,625
<i>For I must now wander this wandering day</i>

712
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:50,458
<i>Away I must wander</i>

713
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:54,166
<i>This wandering day</i>

714
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,416
<i>Of drink I have little</i>

715
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,625
<i>And food I have less</i>

716
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:06,250
<i>My strength tells me no
But the path demands yes</i>

717
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:12,125
<i>My legs are so short
And the way is so long</i>

718
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:15,166
<i>I've no rest nor comfort</i>

719
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:19,000
<i>No comfort, but song</i>

720
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:25,666
<i>Sing to me, sing to me
Lands far away</i>

721
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:31,250
<i>Oh, rise up and guide me
This wandering day</i>

722
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:34,166
<i>Please promise to find me</i>

723
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,958
<i>This wandering day</i>

724
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,750
<i>At last comes their answer</i>

725
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:44,833
<i>Through cold and through frost</i>

726
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:50,708
<i>That not all who wonder or wander are lost</i>

727
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,583
<i>No matter the sorrow</i>

728
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,666
<i>No matter the cost</i>

729
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,666
<i>That not all who wonder</i>

730
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:03,833
<i>Or wander are...</i>

731
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:09,708
<i>Lost</i>
