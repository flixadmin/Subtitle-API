00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,702
Previously on
<i>"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,871
Astra, this place,
it's twisted you.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,372
It's made me more like you.

4
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,341
<i>When you took on
the wand's power,</i>

5
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,843
you also took on its charge.

6
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:12,979
Oh, Fairy Godmother.

7
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,315
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from hell.

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,717
Gary, you dick!

9
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,685
I have created a simple app.

10
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,487
<i>You will be able to share
monster sightings.</i>

11
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,788
"In exchange for this service,

12
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,790
"the user agrees to forfeit
their eternal soul

13
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,158
to the demon Neron."

14
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,660
He may be planning
a monster attack.

15
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:29,028
Get every single one
of those monsters

16
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:30,363
<i>out of the Time Bureau.</i>

17
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,797
It's a bloody jailbreak!

18
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,767
No!

19
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,102
What kind of egg is that?

20
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,505
<i>- It's a dragon egg.</i>
- My name is Zari.

21
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,014
Whoopsie.
Hey!

22
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,483
You haven't happened to see
an ogre wandering around

23
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,952
about yay high, likes to grunt,
drink beer?

24
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,253
Ask Rory.

25
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,125
Ogre wins again.

26
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,594
Cheating bastard.
No one outdrinks Mick Rory.

27
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,263
Hey, fellas.

28
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:06,632
Sorry to break up all the fun,
but, uh, technically,

29
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,568
I wasn't supposed to allow any
magical creatures

30
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,869
out of the lab, so...

31
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,807
On second thought, why don't
you two finish up here?

32
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,376
And I'll go, uh,
track down the Minotaur.

33
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:18,844
<i>♪ Whiskey woman... ♪</i>

34
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,746
You're not a horrible mother.

35
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,515
You just have a lot
on your mind.

36
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,551
I left our dragon egg in
the care of nine-year-old me.

37
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,653
Has anybody seen Gary?

38
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,755
Wait, what did you just say?
I was distracted.

39
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,857
I just found out the Eyes app
is stealing peoples' souls,

40
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,226
and then baby me comes home,
and I-I...

41
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,195
You two need to grab
that egg before it hatches.

42
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,464
We can't risk Ne-ray getting
his hands on a baby dragon.

43
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,899
It's already bad enough
that he has Charlie.

44
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,100
- Okay.
- Fair.

45
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,638
Get up.

46
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:46,872
Time's a-wasting.

47
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,809
There are souls just waiting
to be sold.

48
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,611
You're off your rocker,
you old nag.

49
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,380
This here shape-shifter
don't take requests.

50
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:58,017
Shape-shifter?
Is that all you think you are?

51
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:01,487
You may have your human friends
fooled, dearie,

52
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:05,424
but you and I both know what
you're truly capable of.

53
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,560
- You don't know me!
- Don't I?

54
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,997
The shape your wearing,
though lovely, is a costume.

55
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:14,667
It's not who you really are.

56
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,336
You aren't meant to hide,
my pet.

57
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:21,807
You are meant to show humans
their greatest fears.

58
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,409
And lucky for you,

59
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:27,847
helping monsters fulfill
their potential...

60
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,682
is what I do.

Yes!

63
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,828
Ah!

64
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,265
Damn it, Gary.

65
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,402
Oh, excuse me, hey.
Hi.

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,203
Excuse me, sir.

67
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,306
Hi, pardon me, I just,
um... I don't belong here.

68
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,776
No?
And I'm a...

69
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,079
I'm a Fairy Godmother sent
to find John Constantine!

70
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,382
Ooh.
Ooh.

71
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,387
Really?

72
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,889
What, are the King and Queen
of hell

73
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,290
making their grand debut?

74
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,426
Not our debut, dearie.

75
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,495
No, no, no.
Stop.

76
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,730
What are you doing?

77
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,565
As much as I'd like to
pontificate

78
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,100
about my grander plan...

79
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,769
I've taught him better
than that.

80
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,775
Huh.

81
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,177
Who the hell are you?

82
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,146
Really?
The dress doesn't sell it?

83
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,582
You didn't tell me you had
a Fairy Godmother, John.

84
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,350
Not his, Gary's.

85
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,319
And I thought I was the one
being tortured.

86
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,122
Look, Princess, we got rules
here in hell.

87
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,657
All right?
You can't just...

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,860
Let's go.

89
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,161
What are you doing?

90
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,996
Going to find Ray,
same way I found you.

91
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,299
The only difference
is Ray doesn't have a body.

92
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,468
So let's go find his soul.

93
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:59,405
His soul token,
that's the currency in hell.

94
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:01,140
While a soul is being tortured,

95
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,943
then its token is traded
around town like money.

96
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,711
As long as you have it,
then you'll always

97
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,812
have access to the soul.

98
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,882
But since Neron is
still topside,

99
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:14,386
then his token's likely
locked in his vault.

100
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,455
Then let's go find it.

101
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,493
- Why isn't this working?
- I'm sorry, love.

102
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,128
You can't just go
poofing yourself

103
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,829
into the vaults of hell.

104
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:26,265
We'll have to find someone
to help us break in.

105
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,505
And I think I know
just the person.

106
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,408
I don't see her.

107
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,711
How do you know what
nine-year-old me looks like?

108
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,847
I'm just looking for
the coolest kid in school.

109
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,582
Yeah, there's a lot
I haven't told you

110
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,984
about my childhood.

111
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,454
There, that's the spot where
kids used to gang up on me

112
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:51,624
and say, "Zari, Zari,
why your clothes so sorry?"

113
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,259
Aww.

114
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,428
I would have said, "Zari, Zari,
you smell like calamari."

115
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,831
Bullying is bad.

116
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,199
All right, let's break this up

117
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,700
and find out where I stashed
the egg.

118
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,703
- He's so cool.
- Oh, look how cute he is.

119
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,839
- I want a dragon.
- He's so adorable.

120
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:07,840
Come here.

121
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,809
I want to take him home with me.

122
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,244
Oh, my God, he hatched.

123
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,048
And I brought him to school.

124
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:17,449
Okay, so we got
to get him before...

125
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,751
Whoa, wait.
Look.

126
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,519
Mithra, dance.

127
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,822
So cool.

128
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,060
- Awesome, Zari.
- Thank you.

129
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,094
Mm.

130
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,197
Come on.

131
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,399
What's going on, children?

132
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,468
It's okay.
He's my pet, Mithra.

133
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,537
I named him after the...
Run, children.

134
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,939
It's a monster!

135
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,147
Wait, Zari.
Zari, wait!

136
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:49,715
Wait.

137
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,684
Don't hurt him.

138
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,858
Oh, my God, I lost him again.

139
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,296
<i>Captain, I've located Neron.</i>

140
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,865
<i>Now live to Capitol Hill,</i>

141
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,867
<i>where the Palmer X CEO
is testifying</i>

142
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,235
<i>before the Senate subcommittee.</i>

143
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,769
<i>Look, I know Senator Wellington</i>

144
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,472
doesn't believe that it's
up to the private sector

145
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,309
to intervene in such
a unprecedented crisis.

146
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,178
But I should mention,
not a single one

147
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:22,581
of my subscribers has been
harmed in a monster attack.

148
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,550
Senator, do you care to respond?

149
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,421
This bloke is just trying
to scare folks

150
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,092
into downloading his evil,
soul-sucking app.

151
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,129
There ain't no such thing
as monst...

152
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,067
This isn't me!

153
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,736
I'm not doing this!

154
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,043
Like I said, they could be
hiding anywhere...

155
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,245
and only you can stop them.

156
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,437
Wait, it might be Charlie.

157
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,572
Well, who am
I supposed to shoot?

158
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,646
There.

159
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:34,429
Damn pigs!
I'm trying to help you out!

160
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:47,542
Stay there.

161
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:50,978
We got to go!

162
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,147
Come on.

163
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:59,420
Let her go.
She served her purpose.

164
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:16,971
Astra Logue.
Name's Neron.

165
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,840
I hear good things about you.

166
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,142
Now that I'm taking over
for your former employers, I...

167
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,944
Give it a rest, John.

168
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,278
You think I can't see

169
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:26,681
through your cheap little
parlor trick?

170
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,285
How'd you get out of
the torture pits anyway?

171
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:36,858
Nice sparkles.

172
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,860
Nice shoulder pads.

173
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,394
What do you want, John?

174
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:41,896
And please tell me
you're not here to make

175
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:44,565
some sad, sappy plea for me
to remember who I really am.

176
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:48,903
I know exactly who you are.
You're someone I can work with.

177
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,272
Now, the Triumvirate,
they were too short-sighted

178
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:54,876
to take my deal, and now they
are roasting rats for supper.

179
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:56,344
But you're smarter
than that, Astra.

180
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,447
All I need is access to
one measly soul,

181
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:02,250
and in exchange,
I'll go kill Neron,

182
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:04,652
and your boys will be back
on top.

183
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:09,190
This soul you're after...
must be pretty special.

184
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,825
He is.

185
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:16,564
I was special to you,
too, John... once.

186
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,634
And yet, you left me down here
to rot all those years.

187
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:22,136
- Astra, you can't...
- I'm over it.

188
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,905
I made the best of
a bad situation,

189
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:25,573
and guess what.

190
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:26,774
I flourished.

191
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,110
Down here, I had prospects

192
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:32,280
until Neron wiped his ass
with them.

193
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:35,583
So do we have a deal?

194
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:42,356
Let's go rob the King.

195
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,125
<i>Today's attack
at the U.S. Capitol</i>

196
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:45,993
<i>has sparked worldwide panic
and paranoia</i>

197
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:47,562
<i>over the threat
of magical creatures.</i>

198
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,263
Enough, Gideon.

199
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:50,665
Where is Neron in all of this?

200
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,767
Why isn't he responding to
his magical-creature alerts?

201
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:55,269
What alerts? All the
creatures are here on the ship.

202
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,737
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

203
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,739
Neron's shown the world that
anyone can be a monster.

204
00:09:58,808 --> 00:09:59,807
People are turning on
each other.

205
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:00,942
Everyone's terrified.

206
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,443
I thought Neron wanted
to collect souls.

207
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,245
How does hacking the app
only to let it fail

208
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:05,813
get him what he wants?

209
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,616
It's not about souls anymore.
It's something worse.

210
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:10,218
Well, they didn't share
their endgame,

211
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:11,652
but from what I could
figure out,

212
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,187
they don't give a "fa"
about ruling hell.

213
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,522
It's actually fear that
they're after.

214
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:15,656
Why?

215
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:18,359
Fear is power.
It's energy.

216
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,961
And thanks to me,
they have a wallop of it

217
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,195
to muck about with.

218
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,730
<i>That might explain the strange</i>

219
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,399
<i>meteorological event
forming over Washington, D.C.</i>

220
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,201
Right above the Time Bureau.

221
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,437
Gideon, do you have a visual?

222
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,976
You're welcome, world.

223
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,948
The air is thick with
human fear.

224
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,285
The hour of our coronation
draws near, my pet.

225
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:47,788
It's time to send your message
to your legions below.

226
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,657
The bank's right around
the corner.

227
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:56,197
What's happening?

228
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,132
<i>Denizens of hell,</i>

229
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:01,369
<i>for far too long, we have been
forced to live like insects</i>

230
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,371
<i>underneath the Earth.</i>

231
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,773
<i>Soon, a door will open.</i>

232
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:09,243
<i>Look to the sky
and await my signal.</i>

233
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:12,980
<i>With me as your king,
we will make Earth hell again.</i>

234
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:17,351
So that's been his play
all along.

235
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,453
We best keep moving, loves,

236
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,956
before all hell literally
breaks loose.

237
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:34,430
Stay calm, they smell fear.

238
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:37,366
What if fear is
my natural scent?

239
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,540
Good afternoon, everyone.

240
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:47,009
We have your favorites.

241
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:48,977
I know it's
a bit crowded in here,

242
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:50,846
but we're making the best of it.

243
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:53,348
Anybody want a sammy whammy?

244
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,820
Put that in your whammy,
you dick.

245
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,456
Okay, uh...

246
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:01,523
Bon appétit.

247
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,931
They are savages.

248
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,732
Oh, calm down, Gary.

249
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:13,302
The longer we keep the
magical creatures locked up,

250
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,004
the more they're gonna act like
actual monsters.

251
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:19,274
They are monsters, you twit,
and so are you.

252
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:20,576
We all are.

253
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:23,445
How are we supposed to defeat
fear itself?

254
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:25,614
I mean, people afraid of Metas,

255
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:28,584
magical creatures afraid
of people, and...

256
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,853
Monsters hated by everyone.

257
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:34,923
Not everyone.
Gideon, play the...

258
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,291
<i>The "dancing dragon sneeze"
video.</i>

259
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,259
Yep, that.

260
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,961
<i>Mithra, dance.</i>

261
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,295
- What is this?
- Wicksty.

262
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:47,202
Aww.

263
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,705
Yeah, this innocent moment
where kids aren't afraid,

264
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,707
it's resonating with people.

265
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:54,543
They don't see a monster,
they see something amazing.

266
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:55,711
So do I.

267
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,145
Me on that playground
surrounded by people

268
00:12:57,214 --> 00:13:00,215
who want to be my friend...

269
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:01,783
Even if it was just for a day,

270
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:05,354
that little baby dragon
changed my world.

271
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,422
You sound like
my dad's pitch for...

272
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:11,226
HeyWorld!

273
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,761
Oh, my God, guys, that's it.

274
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,196
What?
What's... what?

275
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:16,064
My dad had a dream to build
a theme park

276
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,634
that people would come to see
because of magic.

277
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,168
That's what the world needs
right now,

278
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:22,271
a place for people to come
and see the wonder

279
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:23,906
of these creatures in person.

280
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:25,741
What, so they can just
shoot us all in one place?

281
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:26,942
That's bloody brilliant, that.

282
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,811
No, so they can see creatures

283
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,714
the way that you helped us
see creatures, Charlie.

284
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:36,418
Not as monsters,
but as misfits just trying to

285
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:37,953
find their place.

286
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:40,055
Look, if we can learn
that lesson,

287
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:41,924
then so can the rest of
the world.

288
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:45,694
We just need to bring people
and creatures together.

289
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:49,064
Think of it like
a magical version of Woodstock.

290
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,666
"If we build it"...

291
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,301
"They will come."

292
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,102
How long until we can get it
up and running?

293
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,939
Uh, if Mikey T and the boys
work weekends...

294
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,574
Quick math in my head...

295
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:01,243
Two, maybe three years.

296
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:02,678
Oh.

297
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,153
He's not a coin.

298
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,389
- Observant.
- No flesh bags, just souls.

299
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,492
That's why they call it
the Soul Exchange.

300
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,028
Oh, right, then.
I'll be on me way, then.

301
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:23,732
This is John Constantine.

302
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,934
Oh, and me without
my autograph book.

303
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:26,969
No worries, love.

304
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:28,103
Next time, yeah?

305
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:30,138
Look, if you would like
to convert

306
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:31,506
his soul into cash, you need...

307
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,342
Maybe you don't get it.

308
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,111
Neron owns the marker
on his soul,

309
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,481
and Neron wants to torture him
as soon as he gets here.

310
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,584
But, hey, if you want to tell
the new boss why

311
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:45,954
his prized victim isn't waiting
in his vault...

312
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:50,292
This way.

313
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:54,196
Not so rough.

314
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,798
FYI, there's no bathroom
in here,

315
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,033
and I'm not feeding him.

316
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:00,435
I'm a bank teller, not a zoo...

317
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,708
Pretty cool for a grown woman
wearing taffeta and a tiara.

318
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,677
How does this work?

319
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:11,847
We find a coin?
There are thousands.

320
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:14,082
Some of history's worst.

321
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,451
Yeah, I'd wager he's keeping
it somewhere special.

322
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,953
Hey, what are you doing?

323
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:19,588
What?

324
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,056
Revolution's in the air,

325
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,091
I've got to look out for
number one.

326
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,294
You were a golden opportunity
to bankroll my future.

327
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,196
I took it.

328
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:35,871
What about Bridget's diary?

329
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,339
If we put it in Nate's hands,

330
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:39,307
he could just dream us up
a theme park.

331
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,444
Z, you are a genius.
The...

332
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:45,514
Ugh.
It's in the Time Bureau.

333
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:47,349
It's okay, so we just break in,

334
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:48,550
but it's not gonna be easy.

335
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:50,218
Even if it isn't demon central,

336
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,353
the vault that it's being
held in

337
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:52,621
is practically impenetrable.

338
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,423
Oh, it's penetrable.

339
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,792
Oh, my God.

340
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,627
I love you, Rory.
Mmhmm.

341
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,228
Give it back when you're done.

342
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,597
Buck and Garima's sexual
odyssey is far from over.

343
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,099
All right, team.

344
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:06,268
Nate, you have a theme park
to dream up.

345
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:09,104
Gary, help Mona "Pretty Woman"
our creatures into something

346
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,372
a little more kid friendly.

347
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,307
And the rest of us,

348
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,276
it's time to come up
with a marketing plan

349
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:17,212
for the happiest place
on the planet.

350
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,384
<i>Miss Tomaz,
your simulation program</i>

351
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:23,652
<i>has detected a change</i>

352
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,220
<i>in your presently
predicted future.</i>

353
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:26,855
Good change or bad change?

354
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:29,691
<i>In one potential 2042,
building HeyWorld</i>

355
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,394
<i>leads to an era of
understanding and tolerance.</i>

356
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:35,697
<i>The Anti-Meta-Human Act
of 2029 never passes,</i>

357
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,132
<i>your parents live out
their lives</i>

358
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,767
<i>peacefully in Seattle.</i>

359
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:41,603
<i>The future as you know it

360
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:47,809
My parents.
They're, uh...

361
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:53,115
That means a piece of this
crazy plan actually works.

362
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,050
This is great news, right?

363
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:00,122
God, I've been running that
stupid program for so long,

364
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,125
I'd given up hope of it
actually working.

365
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:07,362
If this works,
my brother survives...

366
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,564
I never steal his totem back
from A.R.G.U.S.,

367
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,133
I never join the Legends.

368
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:15,403
Last two years wouldn't
have happened.

369
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:21,476
Who knows where I'll be
or who I'll be?

370
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,311
You'll be you.

371
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:26,681
Because while we're at HeyWorld,

372
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,351
you'll be here on the ship
in the temporal zone,

373
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:30,852
and you'll be safe.

374
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,088
Sara, I can't...
I can't sit this one out.

375
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:35,390
Look, I'm not gonna lose
another Legend.

376
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:38,126
And who said we're not
putting you to work?

377
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:39,694
Look, we need to make sure
what happens at HeyWorld

378
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:41,129
is seen globally.

379
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,598
I can use the Eyes app
as a backdoor

380
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,433
into the phones that
downloaded it.

381
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:46,835
Thank you.

382
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:01,349
I found it, I found it...
Ray's coin.

383
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,886
So long, then, John boy,
for now.

384
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:06,721
Whoa, hold on a minute.

385
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,225
Our deal was for his soul,
not a bleeding coin.

386
00:18:10,294 --> 00:18:13,195
Fine, a promise is a promise.

387
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,417
What are they doing to him
in there?

388
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,885
Prepare yourself, love.

389
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:39,287
What's behind this door,
it won't be pretty.

390
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:40,989
Down there, they twist
a man's soul

391
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:42,557
until he's no longer human.

392
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,725
And what they've done to
the big man,

393
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:45,060
he might not even be...

394
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:46,394
Ray!

395
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,029
Ray?

396
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:49,865
Nora, John,
we're just about to start

397
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,666
another game of Giant Jenga.

398
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:52,701
You got to meet my old friend...

399
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,035
Well, technically,
my new friend.

400
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,370
We used to be mortal enemies.

401
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,805
Oh, hi, guys.

402
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,307
Well, you're just in time
for the next round.

403
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,880
<i>When the world needs heroes,</i>

404
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,793
<i>they answer the call.</i>

405
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,250
We'll be at HeyWorld,

406
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,754
the new adventure capital
of eastern Maryland...

407
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,790
Where we will hit fun
in the bull's-eye.

408
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,960
And we'll give your children
a flash...

409
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,612
of excitement.

410
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,816
And... cut.

411
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:25,184
Whoo!

412
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:26,619
- That was good, guys.
- That was a good take.

413
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:27,886
It felt good.
That was a great take.

414
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:30,089
Guys, I feel like that
would have worked

415
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:31,991
a little bit better with
the real Trinity.

416
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,961
Yeah, well, I asked,
and they said hard pass.

417
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,196
We should have done a crossover.

418
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:38,530
Yeah.

419
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,832
Well, who needs the Trinity
anyway, right?

420
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,734
I mean, the Legends are
super enough.

421
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,169
But HeyWorld isn't
a superhero park.

422
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:46,305
Promising them something
and giving them something else

423
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,973
feels... I don't know...
Wrong, doesn't it?

424
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,042
People aren't going to go
to a park

425
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,011
filled with things
they're terrified of.

426
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,081
People need franchise
superheroes to feel safe,

427
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,417
so that's how we're gonna
get them in the door.

428
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,889
Okay, everyone,
let's just go around the room

429
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,859
one by one and say what talent
you can contribute

430
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:09,561
to the HeyWorld revue.

431
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,497
Oh, Minotaur,
let's start with you.

432
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,565
I-I hear you like guitar.

433
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:15,534
Don't tell her nothing,
bull face.

434
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,537
- Let us out of here.
- We can't do that, Mr. Ogre.

435
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,072
It's not safe out there.

436
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,774
Well, we ain't helping you,

437
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:25,277
what, with you moving us around
from one prison to another.

438
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:27,846
So why should we trust you?

439
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:29,448
Listen up, if you lot
don't want to go back

440
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:31,817
to a real prison,
then this is your chance.

441
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:35,120
This is your chance to change
the way that humans see you.

442
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:38,190
Show them that just because
you look scary...

443
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:45,964
Doesn't mean you are scary.

444
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,033
That's right, Wolfie.

445
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:50,836
Look, I know how infuriating
humans can be.

446
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,204
They have a hard time

447
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:53,772
seeing past their own noses,
don't they?

448
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:56,742
But they can change...

449
00:20:56,811 --> 00:20:59,178
if you help them to look deeper.

450
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:01,080
And if they see the amount
of good that

451
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:02,348
you lot are capable of,

452
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,883
then maybe...
Maybe they'll believe in you

453
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:06,485
even when you doubt yourself.

454
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:09,955
Now, I know that there's more
to all of you

455
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,390
than meets the eye.

456
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,892
Like you, Ogre.

457
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:17,196
My name is Frederic.
But what's the point?

458
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:20,532
Every time I try to show
a human who I really am,

459
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,301
they run away or try to kill me.

460
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,336
And that must really hurt
your feelings.

461
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,105
Yeah, it does.

462
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:27,973
All I ever wanted to do
was sing.

463
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:31,043
Well, it looks like we found
ourselves a double act.

464
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,745
Now, who else has
a hidden talent?

465
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,682
Brilliant.

466
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,150
Beautiful.

467
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:39,852
I think we've got ourselves
a show.

468
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,088
Wait, what are you doing here?

469
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,156
Are you dead?

470
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:45,324
Oh, please tell me
you're not dead.

471
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:46,592
What are you doing in
that dress?

472
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,726
Not that I don't like it, but...

473
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:48,994
Mmm.

474
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,664
Wow.

475
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,032
Oh!
Idiot!

476
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,068
What were you thinking
selling your soul to a demon?

477
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:57,903
You... Ray...

478
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:00,272
You doomed the whole planet!

479
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:01,440
Look, I didn't have a choice.

480
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:02,641
He was gonna kill Nate.

481
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,642
It was the only way I could
make sure

482
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:04,676
my best friend would be safe.

483
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:07,279
So that was the deal you made...

484
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:08,614
His life for your body.

485
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:11,450
Oh, Raymondo, you sweet, dumb

486
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,752
son of a softie.

487
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:15,020
Yeah, right?

488
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,889
What a guy!

489
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:21,226
I was sent here to torture him,
but then we got to talking.

490
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:23,462
Oh, it got really deep, man.

491
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:25,130
It really did.

492
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,233
What were we even fighting
about all those years ago?

493
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,768
Your compulsion for
world domination

494
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:31,470
and inability
to accept rejection.

495
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,774
Ah, translation...
It was about a girl.

496
00:22:35,843 --> 00:22:37,042
A girl?
What girl?

497
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:38,410
It doesn't matter.
We should go.

498
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:41,513
Wait.
Something's happening.

499
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:43,081
I think I fulfilled Gary's wish.

500
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,349
Ray, take my hand.

501
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,018
John.

502
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:47,986
Oh, all right.
Ciao for now.

503
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,856
Say hi to the Legends for me,
will you?

504
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,330
Oh, I love those groovy guys.

505
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,968
Jenga time!

506
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,904
Oh, almost forgot...
Extra hot sauce

507
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:09,241
for the chupacabra.

508
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,176
What in the hell?

509
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:12,744
More like "out of it," mate.

510
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:15,414
It worked! It worked!
You got Constantine.

511
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,882
All right, okay.
Be cool, just be cool.

512
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,317
Simmer down, simmer down,
sunshine.

513
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:19,451
Where's Ray?

514
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,353
He was just here.
He...

515
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:25,224
Yeah, that's the only way
he can travel

516
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,692
as long as Neron's using
his body.

517
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,962
Fairy Godmother, I wish for Ray

518
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,296
to get his body back.

519
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:33,432
Oh, um...

520
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:36,368
All magic has its limitations...

521
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:38,136
You know, stroke of midnight
and all that.

522
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:39,538
But don't worry...

523
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:42,641
I'm sure the Legends have
something up their sleeves.

524
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,977
This isn't playtime, you twits.

525
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:47,746
Neron is using fear
to open up the gates of hell.

526
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:49,515
Well, that's why we have
to fight fear

527
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,083
with something wonderful.

528
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:52,851
We have to show the world that
these magical creatures

529
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,553
are just that... they're magical.

530
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:57,256
And everyone else
is on board with this?

531
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,591
- Yeah.
- Yeah, pretty much.

532
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,093
- Bloody hell.
- All right, great.

533
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,129
Well, now that you're all
on board, we have work to do.

534
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:06,865
There is another way.

535
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,500
Whilst in hell, we learned that

536
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,402
Neron's possession of Ray's body

537
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:12,771
is contingent on Nate
not being killed.

538
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,741
Is that why Ner-Ray

539
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,776
didn't strangle me when he had
the chance?

540
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:18,844
Yeah.

541
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:21,547
A demon is only as good
as his word.

542
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:22,714
If Neron breaks that deal,

543
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,082
he'll be ejected from
Ray's body.

544
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:25,617
I could kill him.

545
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:30,122
And once I do, all the souls
he's nabbed will be released.

546
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,258
And all Neron has to do
is, uh...

547
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:36,328
Me?

548
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,832
No, absolutely not.

549
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:44,670
Look, there is no Plan B,
only Plan A, got it?

550
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:47,372
Yeah, got it.

551
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,209
Look, I meant what
I said earlier.

552
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:53,145
I am not losing another Legend.

553
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:54,947
So forget what you heard
back there,

554
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:58,750
because we are all-in
on HeyWorld.

555
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:01,286
Now, I believe in you,
and if I'm not mistaken,

556
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:03,956
someone has a theme park
to build.

557
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:05,157
Yeah.

558
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:12,164
I can't believe it all
comes down to this.

559
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:14,166
After years of anxiety of
whether or not

560
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:17,202
I could live up to
my dad's expectations,

561
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:20,305
I'm about to bring
his crazy dream to life...

562
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:23,041
knowing what it could cost me.

563
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,077
Nate, I'm not going anywhere.

564
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,187
You got this.

565
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,756
Okay.

566
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:41,259
Let's do this.

567
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,604
I'm standing in front of
HeyWorld,

568
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,973
a new superhero-inspired
theme park

569
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,177
that seems to have sprung up
overnight like magic.

570
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,082
Welcome to HeyWorld,

571
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,018
the happiest place on the globe.

572
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,986
Hey, kid, welcome to HeyWorld.

573
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,988
Try the churros and not just
because the real money

574
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,391
is in the concessions,
they're also delicious.

575
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,630
Z, um...

576
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,200
<i>you and your mom are here.</i>

577
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,702
I see them... I mean us.

578
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,038
All right, stream's up.
You look great, by the way.

579
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,307
Oh, thank you for noticing.
I showered.

580
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,109
How's
the clickety-clackety-hackety

581
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,610
coming along?

582
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,012
Once Ava hits "record,"
this will stream out to about,

583
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,781
you know,
3 billion people or so.

584
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,249
No pressure.

585
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,552
Come one, come all

586
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,556
to our thrilling
stage spectacular...

587
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:12,129
"Superheroes versus Monsters."

588
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,064
Okay, you got
the choreography down?

589
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,999
Everyone, follow her lead.

590
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,400
Um... Ooh!

591
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,270
Baba Yaga, remember, those kids
are audience members,

592
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,571
not appetizers.

593
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,174
Mike, watch your language
out there, right?

594
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,642
We don't want those wankers

595
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,745
from Standards and Practices
up our you-know-whats.

596
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,214
Everyone, they're gonna love
you guys.

597
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,317
All right, gang, it's showtime.

598
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,660
Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't call them heroes,

599
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,395
call them Legends.

600
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:48,865
Now, let's see what daring do

601
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:52,869
the Legends of Tomorrow
get into... today.

602
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,011
And that'll teach those bad guys

603
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,280
that crime doesn't pay.

604
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,715
<i>Thanks for the assist,
Green Arrow.</i>

605
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,651
<i>See you later, Supergirl.</i>

606
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,953
Whoa!
Do you see that?

607
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,522
That's the Flash,
and he wants to hang out.

608
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,791
Should we got hang out?

609
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,832
Break a leg, guys.

610
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,601
Wait a second!
Shh.

611
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,804
I think that I hear something.

612
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,307
Monsters.

613
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,808
What do you think, White Canary?

614
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:32,909
Should we show 'em what we got?

615
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,711
Wait, hold on.

616
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,448
What if, instead of showing 'em
what we got,

617
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:43,086
we ask them what they have?

618
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,654
Hmm?

619
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,190
You mean get to know them?

620
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,993
What if, getting to know
them, we realize

621
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,430
that we have nothing to fear.

622
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,366
Minotaur, your passion is music.

623
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,935
Why don't you show us
what you got?

624
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,939
They said this was
a superhero show.

625
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,908
These brats don't respect art.

626
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,646
Hey, hey!
I think we're losing them.

627
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,418
What was that?

628
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,764
Bloody hell, I know that sound.

629
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,939
Finally, a real-life dragon.

630
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,782
Oh, no, is that...

631
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,783
Wicksty?

632
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,622
Now, this is a show.

633
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,261
You really thought
you could stop us?

634
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,196
These fools you brought here

635
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,266
will only serve our hellish end.

636
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,469
Everyone remain calm!

637
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,506
This is all just, uh,
a part of the show.

638
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,913
Damn it, Gary.

639
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,449
Now I'm powerless.

640
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,786
Enough...
Filling your heads with this

641
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,055
silly, little morality play.

642
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,958
Now all of you will
bear witness to the birth

643
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,693
of a new era.

644
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,162
She wants these people scared.

645
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,997
They'll open up the portal
right here.

646
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,373
This way.
Go, go!

647
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,208
We got to get that staff.

648
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,983
We got to get these kids
out of here, go!

649
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,519
Follow them!

650
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,575
Everybody, go back inside.

651
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,876
Back inside!

652
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,397
It's all right.
It's all right.

653
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,839
Burn her.

654
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,841
Burn them all.

655
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,890
Stop!

656
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,391
Stop.

657
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,297
Burn the child.
Do it now.

658
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,733
Kid, you got to run.

659
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,735
Mithra, dance.

660
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,656
No!

661
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,458
Tabitha!

662
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,668
Mithra, wait.

663
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,761
Rise, my demon brethren.

664
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,866
The door is open!
Rise!

665
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,636
Oh, it's gonna take more than
a musical number to stop this.

666
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:41,136
Neron! This fight is
between me and you,

667
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:43,605
so let's settle it
once and for all.

668
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,109
Gladly.

669
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:56,719
I've already won.
Killing you is just a bonus.

670
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,455
You may take me, Neron,

671
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:02,157
but the Legends will always win.

672
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:04,860
Ha.

673
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:14,303
What's happening?

674
00:34:14,372 --> 00:34:15,904
Looks like the deal's off, mate.

675
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,112
No.

676
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:30,018
Nate?
No.

677
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:31,553
Gideon, take us to HeyWorld.

678
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:34,089
<i>I must advise against
that course of action.</i>

679
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:36,392
<i>The change to your future
is still in progress.</i>

680
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,060
<i>If you leave the temporal zone,</i>

681
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:41,130
<i>your current memories
won't be safe.</i>

682
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,401
You didn't.

683
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,703
I'm sorry, love.
It was his choice.

684
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:59,281
- Finish it off, John.
- Gladly.

685
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:17,065
Come on, Ray.

686
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:20,369
Raymond Palmer, I return
your soul to your body.

687
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,209
What happened to me?
Where am I?

688
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:29,011
I'm in HeyWorld?

689
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:32,147
Everybody's here.

690
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:36,452
No, Nate.
No.

691
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,120
No!
Ray, Ray.

692
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:40,355
- No, no, no.
- Ray, I'm so sorry.

693
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:42,925
Nate, hey.

694
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:44,827
- You can't be here.
- Come on.

695
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,529
Hey.
Nate, you can't be dead.

696
00:35:47,598 --> 00:35:50,132
Come on.
Hey, come on, come on.

697
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,467
Come on, you can't be...

698
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:53,001
Bring him back to life, weasel!

699
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,971
Oh, I wish I could, Rory,
but that requires magic

700
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,673
beyond my means, mate.

701
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:17,826
Not a bad show if you ask me.

702
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,263
Dad.

703
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:23,298
Hello, Nate.

704
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:26,435
I missed you so much, Dad.

705
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,039
I haven't been far.

706
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,410
Oh, I guess, um...

707
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,546
I guess it sucks...

708
00:36:37,615 --> 00:36:40,048
Dying before you're ready, huh?

709
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,084
- Sure does.
- Yeah.

710
00:36:42,152 --> 00:36:44,119
Believe me, I went through
all the emotions...

711
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:46,855
I mean, anger, worry...

712
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,423
I had so many regrets,
I almost missed

713
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:50,893
my ticket to the happy place.

714
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,094
What changed?

715
00:36:52,162 --> 00:36:53,562
I had faith.

716
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:54,963
You're saying
there's actually a...

717
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:56,231
In you, Nate.

718
00:36:58,202 --> 00:37:01,136
And I was right
to believe that my boy

719
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:04,239
and all his freaky buddies
would see this thing through.

720
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,610
But you know
the only thing missing

721
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:12,714
from that big show of yours?

722
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:14,850
Music.

723
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,854

Do I have something on my face?

00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,274
Did you just sing?

729
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,709
James Taylor?

730
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:42,311
I don't sing.

731
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,051
I think someone from beyond
is trying to help us out.

732
00:37:51,755 --> 00:37:54,690
You got to be kidding me.

If fear can be energy,
it only stands to reason

746
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,125
that love can be energy, too.

747
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:35,097
Everyone, if you want to see
Nate up and kicking,

748
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,899
he needs to hear your voices
right now!

749
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:40,736
We need everyone to hold hands.

750
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:43,405
And we mean everyone.

751
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:46,608
- Are we really doing this?
- Couldn't hurt.

752
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:47,909
Didn't they do this last year?

753

We're part of
the circle this time.

754

755
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:56,151

No.
No, no, no, no.

771
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,112
You're not in the temporal zone.

772
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:59,181
We changed history.
We changed everything.

773
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,882
I couldn't let you die.

774
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:04,486
No.

775
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:11,093
Dude, you just came back
to life.

776
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:14,529
Something's wrong.

777
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,498
Um, there was more pelvis
in that hug than usual.

778
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,367
It's all good, Nate dog.
Love you, too, bro.

779
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:22,738
Yeah, my bad, bro.

780
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:25,607
It just feels like... feels like
something's missing.

781
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:29,144
Ray.
Aw, buddy.

782
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,481
I can't believe you went
all the to hell

783
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:33,915
to stop Neron from killing me.

784
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,617
You would have done
the same thing.

785
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,519
I kind of just did.

786
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:38,954
Yeah, you did.

787
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,388
Ah!

788
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:43,191
All right, Time Bros...

789
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,528
- Oh, and Time Ladies.
- And Time Monsters.

790
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:48,697
And Gary?

791
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:51,867
As I was saying, Legends...

792
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:54,002
our work here is done.

793
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:58,507
Gideon, fire up the ship.
It's time to hit it.

794
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:09,151
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

795
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:13,622
Whoa.

796
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,992
These are some truly
serious sinners.

797
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,694
Cut down too soon, all of them.

798
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:23,031
It's a real shame when
someone doesn't get to...

799
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,634
fulfill their destiny.

800
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:27,235
Don't you think?

801
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:42,784
Everyone deserves a second act.
