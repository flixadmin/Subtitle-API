1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,207
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham:

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,569
I've been sober for a year.
That doesn't erase the things that I did.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,210
But I still care about you.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,131
Dear Jim, I thought I could be
strong and brave for you.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,367
But I can't.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,966
I'm going away for a while
to get myself together.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,284
Trust me and I'll trust you.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,842
In the meantime, each of your tariffs
will increase 25 percent.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,769
Reach out to Saviano and Turski.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,161
They're worried about ending up
like Bannion.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,402
The old man is herding his sheep
toward me.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,721
Arrogant clown!

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,844
Try to take me down!
You do not know where the edge is.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,606
Arkham Asylum?
Security guard for nutjobs?

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,131
- It's that or quit.
- So quit.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,284
That's what they want me to do.
Falcone, the mayor.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,762
I'm not going to stop, Harvey.
I'm gonna get them.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,765
If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly
What I command...

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,049
...I’ll rack thee with old cramps...

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,564
...fill all thy bones with aches...

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,330
...make thee roar,
that beasts shall tremble at thy din.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,971
No, pray thee!

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,481
I must obey.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,405
His art is of such power.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,408
Such power.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,201
"It would control my dam's god."

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,521
It would control my dam's god Setebos...

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,650
...and make a vassal of him.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,049
So slave, hence!

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,645
Hence.

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,929
<i>Full fathom five my father lies</i>

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,325
<i>Of his bones are coral made</i>

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,048
<i>Those are pearls that were his eyes</i>

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,881
<i>Nothing of him that doth fade</i>

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,409
<i>But doth suffer a sea-change</i>

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,209
<i>Into something rich and strange</i>

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,887
Get back.

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,804
Get back.

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,367
Stay down.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,648
This is the fourth inmate outburst in as
many weeks as you've been stationed here.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,770
I understand this is punishment duty
for you...

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,446
...but I expect professional standards,
nonetheless.

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,731
This is unacceptable, Gordon.
Unacceptable.

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,770
It was my fault, Mr. Lang.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,445
The play was too upsetting.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,762
We'll stick to comedies from now on,
I think.

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,127
Thank you, Nurse Duncan.
It's director...

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,169
...or Dr. Lang as you prefer.

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,963
Recreational activities are not
pertinent to this conversation.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,163
Officer Gordon is responsible
for security on this wing...

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,051
...a task which he seems
unable to manage.

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,649
What have you to say about
this, Gordon?

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,928
This man needs medical attention.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,686
I'd see to him myself, but there's rules.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,081
I dispense meds, not treatment.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,691
He needs a doctor.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,844
Very well.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,570
I'll send one in.

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,204
Any more incidents and I'll have you
placed on the remedial duty roster.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,847
Think you can't fall any further?

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,691
Think again.

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,727
How is he?

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,564
He's fine. Will be.

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,247
And you?

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,011
I'm good. Few bruises.

66
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,601
What?

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,805
You're the famous detective Jim Gordon,
aren't you?

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,481
That's my name,
I'm not sure about famous.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,130
Notorious then?

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,611
Nearer the mark.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,401
Who are you?

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,091
Leslie Thompkins.

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,765
Doctor Thompkins.

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,087
You work here?

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,571
I'm not an inmate.

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,282
I haven't seen you
on infirmary duty before.

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,286
I work in the female ward. I come over
here when they're short-handed.

78
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,846
All the girls are talking about you.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,250
Brave detective brought low
by fighting City Hall.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,566
Ah. They say that, do they?

81
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,570
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of your situation.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,486
It's okay.

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,046
Personally, I think what you're doing
is admirable.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,361
I'm guarding lunatics.

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,806
No, you're not quitting.

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,490
Not yet.

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,447
Who are you?

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,889
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to blurt all that
out like I did. It's none of my business.

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,408
Dr. Thompkins, you sure
this inmate is going to be okay?

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,281
He's fine.
He's just sleeping off his meds.

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,726
I'm trying.

92
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,881
Get a room, you guys.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,006
I should go.
It was nice to meet you, Jim.

94
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,645
Likewise.

95
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,449
Ivy?

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,769
How are you doing?

97
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,447
I'm good. I'm good.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,530
You look sick, like you need a doctor.

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,365
No doctor. Never ever again.

100
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,483
I'm fine, I'm just resting.

101
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,167
I got a place we can go, Ivy.

102
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,407
I'm shivery, is all.

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,887
Okay.

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,805
They're gone.

105
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,607
It's safe.

106
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,881
Sure?

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,769
Sure. Sure.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,005
We'll only stay until you feel better.

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,322
Come and lay down on the couch there.

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,202
What if the real people come home?

111
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,842
There's dust on everything and, heh,
something smells rotten.

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,170
Nobody's coming.

113
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,566
Whose place is this, anyways?

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,690
How come you ask so many questions, Ivy?
I'm trying to help you.

115
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,844
Now, lie down and I'll get you a blanket.

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,965
Morning, gentlemen.

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,724
Have you considered my proposition?

118
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,248
- Uh, yeah, no.
- No?

119
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,767
We already pay enough.
Don Maroni set the rates last year.

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,922
And now I'm raising the prices.

121
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,691
Inflation is a bitch.

122
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,605
- Maroni said--
- Maroni, Maroni.

123
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,162
You're beginning to irk me.

124
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,209
You're talking to me, The Penguin.

125
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,161
You're a penguin, so what?
I called the cops on you.

126
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,371
It's The Penguin...

127
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,205
...and that was a very naive call
to make.

128
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,488
Hello, we own the cops on the waterfront.

129
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,688
Tell that to the cops, buddy.

130
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,330
Boys...

131
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,448
...why the frowns?

132
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,371
Jones?

133
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,122
Jones?

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,489
Hey, Frogman.

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,931
Hey.

136
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,610
Hey.

137
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,850
These are electrode wounds.

138
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,443
This man was given a crude,
invasive kind of electroshock therapy.

139
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,889
Metal needles were inserted into the brain,
electricity was applied to his frontal lobes.

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,127
What for?

141
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,001
It's used to modify aberrant behavior, but
in this case too much voltage was used...

142
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,924
...and his brain is completely fried.

143
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,321
Another under your watch, Gordon?

144
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,125
How did this happen?

145
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,524
You rushed into opening and now you're
running this place with skeleton staff...

146
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,566
...and zero surveillance in an unsafe
and unsecure 200-year-old maze.

147
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,529
Excellent excuses.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,206
That's the nature of municipal operations.

149
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,081
You inherit problems and you use the
resources at hand to do what you can.

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,882
Well, our resources don't stretch far enough
to cover a criminal assault investigation.

151
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,280
We should call the GCPD.

152
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,171
Look, this is an in-house medical issue.

153
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,644
Is he still breathing?

154
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,402
Well, yes, but he is
effectively brain dead.

155
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,641
But...

156
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,131
...he's still breathing...

157
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,602
...unaided-
For all official purposes, well...

158
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,485
...he's still alive.

159
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,683
Keep him comfortable, doctor.

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,769
Officer Gordon...

161
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,282
...I want you to find out which one of our
charming inmates did this.

162
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,089
I want a report on my desk, Friday.

163
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,205
Another day, another dollar.

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,407
Really?

165
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,642
This is rather unusual and sinister,
isn't it?

166
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,525
Yes.

167
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,842
So who are we looking for?

168
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,163
What does it take to pull this off?

169
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,211
Uh, some basic knowledge
of human anatomy.

170
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,806
Um, basic electrical skills.

171
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,570
Circuit boards and wiring.

172
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,841
Is that all?

173
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,610
And the door keys, of course.

174
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,451
The door keys. Right.

175
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,921
No, man, I got my keys right here.

176
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,048
Look at me, Steven.

177
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,044
Look at me.

178
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,565
Tell me the truth.

179
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,122
Why you picking on me? There's five
other guards with keys to this wing.

180
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,245
True, and you're the only one who looks
and smells like a hunted animal.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,924
Look, Steven,
whoever fried Frogman had keys.

182
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,925
Now, we've searched
all of the inmates' cells. No keys.

183
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,323
But I know they're out there
and I need to know where.

184
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,763
I'm backed up against a wall.
And I'm starting to lose my patience.

185
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,291
Do you understand?

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,926
That fight...

187
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,486
...during the play...

188
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,847
...right after I noticed my keys were gone.

189
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,083
You lose equipment, that's a big deal.
They'd dock me a week's pay.

190
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,720
- So I tracked down a spare set.
- Who took the keys?

191
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,167
I don't know.
Anyone could have taken them.

192
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,845
Walk away.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,365
- Sorry--
- Walk away!

194
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,482
And then he raises our taxes,
after his money blows up.

195
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,371
Killed Bannion like he was nobody.
I'll say it.

196
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,925
...I wish something would happen to old man
Falcone before he comes after one of us.

197
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,367
- That's where this is going.
- Slow down.

198
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,082
Now, let's imagine-- God forbid anything happened to Falcone.
- -just for kicks.

199
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,686
Who would take over then?

200
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,888
Who'd take over? I do.

201
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,371
You?

202
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,527
Now, that never occurred to me.

203
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,406
What never occurred?

204
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,568
I'm next in line, seniority.

205
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,410
That's the way the system works.

206
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,006
That's how the system used to work,
back in the day.

207
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,810
It's a new dawn, new city.

208
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,487
I would believe we would need
some fresh thinking at the top.

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,881
And who is the fresh thinker
you got in mind?

210
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,565
Let me guess.

211
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,041
Who?

212
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,328
Her. She's talking about her.

213
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,451
Oh. Really?

214
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,962
You don't think I could run the family?

215
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,044
I don't know, why not?
Women's lib and all that.

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,806
But fair play, Jimmy is next in line.

217
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,929
Well, there's no need to argue.

218
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,162
This is all hypotheticals anyhow.

219
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,603
We're just talking, right?

220
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,644
Inmate 5075, Jack Gruber.

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,445
Inmate Gruber, did you take
Officer Wenger's keys?

222
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,645
You're looking into the sad demise
of the Frogman.

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,281
Frogman disrupted your play last night.

224
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,883
You didn't like him very much, did you?

225
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,241
I had no opinion of him.

226
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,848
He was called the Frogman
because he believed a giant bullfrog...

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,083
...lived inside his abdomen,
controlling his thoughts.

228
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,324
He was already dead.
I don't waste psychic energy on the dead.

229
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,689
Rape, murder.
You're no stranger to violence, Gruber.

230
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,804
Your psych evals say
you're a grade A sociopath.

231
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,962
Why should I take your word
for anything?

232
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,004
You shouldn't believe
everything you read, Jim.

233
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,526
May I call you Jim?

234
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,886
Did you take the keys?

235
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,283
Please. Search my cell
if you do not find me trustworthy.

236
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,525
But no, Jim, I did not take anyone's keys.

237
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,361
Thank you.

238
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,807
Guard.

239
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,044
Did you take officer Wenger's keys?

240
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,926
No.

241
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,405
Hey, hey!

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,004
Settle down.

243
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,170
Settle down!

244
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,000
Did you take officer--

245
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,326
Do you have the keys?

246
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,001
- Keys?
- Yes, keys.

247
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,650
Did you take the guard's keys?

248
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,961
No.

249
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,565
Am I in trouble?

250
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,083
No, Aaron, not unless
you're lying to me.

251
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,611
Lying?

252
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,087
Aaron never lies, Mr. Gordon.

253
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,810
He doesn't have the concept.

254
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,803
Poor, peaceful soul that he is.

255
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,768
He killed his family with an ax.

256
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,210
Isn't that what you did, Aaron?

257
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,127
Never harmed a fly before or since.

258
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,125
I said "Sorry."

259
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,606
Okay, Aaron, you're free to go.
Thank you.

260
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,841
Guard.

261
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,330
You saw how that went.

262
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,249
Saviano is the problem.

263
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,085
Now, on his own,
Janacek I can turn him around.

264
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,483
And the junior capos will follow him,
but that Saviano...

265
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,963
We gotta deal with him before
we make our move on Maroni.

266
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,368
Let me talk to Saviano on my own.

267
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,130
Me and Jimmy go way back.

268
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,802
That's true, you do go way back.

269
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,841
What would you tell him?

270
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,729
I'd say you're the best candidate.

271
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,927
He knows that.

272
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,283
He just can't admit it to your face.
Too proud.

273
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,800
Okay, then.

274
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,560
Talk to him.

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,245
Will do.

276
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,447
Butch.

277
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,964
You're not turning on me, are you?

278
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,451
No!

279
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,804
What kind of question is that?

280
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,089
Why would you joke
about something like that?

281
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,004
I'm just asking.

282
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,524
A girl gets insecure once in a while.

283
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,287
Royston, what are you doing
out of your cell?

284
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,249
Hey, cut it out!

285
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,527
Full fathom five thy father lies,
of his bones are coral made.

286
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,124
Ah, hell!

287
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,003
Royston. Is that your name?

288
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,845
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.

289
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,331
Fascinating.

290
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,002
Poor man can walk and talk but
all he remembers are lines from the play.

291
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,926
Same electroshock technique as Frogman
but with less drastic results.

292
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,845
Looks like whoever is doing this
is improving their methods.

293
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,164
Or maybe their process is so haphazard they
don't know what kind of outcome they'll get.

294
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,330
One man ends up a vegetable...

295
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,802
...while the other
recites Shakespeare on a loop.

296
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,366
I don't understand what an inmate gains
from scrambling up another inmate.

297
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,526
You should stay on the female wing a while.
There's no reason to put yourself in danger.

298
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,361
I'm perfectly capable of protecting myself.
Besides, my patients need me.

299
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,602
There's going to be some
drama around here.

300
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,207
Missing keys made me focus on inmates,
but I think it's a misdirection.

301
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,922
I think I should be focusing on the staff.

302
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,686
Oh, I see.

303
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,528
There will be some drama.

304
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,966
But wait, I'm staff.

305
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,201
What if it's me?

306
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,885
- No, it's not you.
- How can you tell?

307
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,849
- You're not the type.
- Cop skills?

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,843
You can read people.

309
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,725
Some people.

310
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,681
A staff member? That's absurd.

311
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,769
- It was an inmate.
- I don't think so.

312
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,962
Your job is to oversee inmate security.

313
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,169
You're not authorized to conduct
an investigation of the staff.

314
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,810
Whoa!

315
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,769
You're trying to force my hand.

316
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,924
- You want me to call the police.
- No.

317
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,601
I already called them.

318
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,482
Barbara, you need to wake up.

319
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,290
Good morning.

320
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,010
I got you coffee.

321
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,890
Extra sweet.

322
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,531
You always remember.

323
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,326
Yeah.

324
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,445
Have you spoken to Jim recently?

325
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,926
Why would I?

326
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,731
Renee, you don't have to be jealous
of Jim.

327
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,845
I'm over him.

328
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,485
This was a mistake.

329
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,841
What was?

330
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,404
This. Us.

331
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,006
I should have never let it
go on for this long.

332
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,611
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,044
Oh, I see.

334
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,321
Barbara.

335
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,201
No, I mean--
No, you are absolutely right.

336
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,521
This was a mistake.

337
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,001
This has been a really
long process for me...

338
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,322
...and I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

339
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,371
I wanted this to be good
but I can't fall back now.

340
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,443
The drinking, the drugs.

341
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,324
We are toxic together, you and me.

342
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,211
Please, Renee, stop.
There's no need to say another word.

343
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm sorry that I interfered
with your process.

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,561
You need help I can't give you right now.
Let me call Jim for you, please.

345
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,370
No. Where's my purse?

346
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,525
You don't need to go. Stay here, take
time to get yourself together. I'll go.

347
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,762
I am perfectly together, thank you.

348
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,570
I am just toxic, that's all.

349
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,166
- Now where is my damn purse?
- Barbara, stop!

350
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,731
Calm down, please, all right?

351
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,688
I'll go. Please.

352
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,169
Fine.

353
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,370
Do what you want, go.

354
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,328
- I'm sorry.
- Just go.

355
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,005
Hey, pal.

356
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,921
In a cowslip's bell I lie.

357
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,249
There I crouch when owls do cry.

358
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,687
All right. I can dig that.

359
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,520
- Detective.
- Jim! Ha, ha! Partner!

360
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,883
Let me take a good look at you.
Lord have mercy, you're screwed.

361
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,451
- Excuse me!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,610
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.
Freaky as advertised.

363
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,366
Nobody of authority called on you, sir.

364
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,971
This is not a police matter.

365
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,249
You must be Director Dr. Lang.
See, I beg to differ.

366
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,002
This is third degree assault,
at the very least.

367
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,843
A friend of yours, is it?

368
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,521
Egregious insubordination.

369
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,922
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

370
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,576
This is the end of your career
in law enforcement, count on it.

371
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,570
Whoa, take it easy, hot shot.
Officer Gordon did the right thing.

372
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,936
Why wouldn't he call the police?

373
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,089
Anyone would think
you want to keep this business quiet.

374
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,010
Gerry-- It is Gerry, isn't it?

375
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,640
Now, did you do this terrible thing, Gerry?

376
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,807
That doesn't even merit a reply.

377
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,444
No, I did not do this terrible thing.

378
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,560
But you have the skill though, as a doctor.
You could do it lickity split.

379
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,887
- Now, why would I do this?
- Why would anyone?

380
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,610
Exactly, Officer Gordon.

381
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,016
Gerry, I think we'll have to
take you down to the precinct.

382
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,726
You're raising a lot of questions that need
clearing up in a more formal setting.

383
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,530
- But you can't do this.
- Shh, shh, shh.

384
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,048
As of this moment this is
an official GCPD investigation.

385
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,766
You, sir, will cooperate or face arrest.

386
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,208
Officer Gordon, would you mind
going through the, uh, staff records...

387
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,601
...while I take Gerry here
downtown for a chat?

388
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,807
Will do, detective.

389
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,407
Sir.

390
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,641
Jimmy.

391
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,450
Butch.

392
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,167
Good to see you.

393
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,606
Come on.

394
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,324
Like Old times, huh?

395
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,531
All we need is a bottle of applejack.
Ha, ha.

396
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,250
What happened, man?

397
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,686
In my head, we're still kids
chasing girls in Harlow Park.

398
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,410
Caught a couple of hot ones, huh?

399
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,005
Especially me. Ha, ha.

400
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,328
Thanks for meeting with me.

401
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,329
What did you tell your boss lady?

402
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,486
I suggested I reach out to you,
she agreed.

403
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,688
Talk some sense into me?

404
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,087
It's a "new dawn." What the--?

405
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,044
Yeah, like that.

406
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,891
She's not wrong, you know.

407
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,205
City's changing.

408
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,925
You really want Falcone's job?

409
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,360
Since we were kids
I love you like a brother.

410
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,921
I love you too, always, you know that.

411
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,923
I do. I do.

412
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,605
That's why I trust you...

413
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,762
...and that's why I say to you with love.

414
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,206
Fish is doomed.

415
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,250
There's no way she gets the chair.
It ain't gonna happen.

416
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,562
She's a smart cookie,
but she's overreaching.

417
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,281
I mean, Butch, without you
and your crew, what's she got?

418
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,771
Very little.

419
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,327
Everybody knows it, you know it.

420
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,249
Maybe.

421
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,081
What's it gonna take
to make you make a move?

422
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,688
- What are you offering?
- Name it.

423
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,202
Drop Fish, come over to us.

424
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,806
The club, all the businesses attached...

425
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,246
...they're yours.

426
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,761
That's day one. A welcome bonus.

427
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,170
What else do you want?

428
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,800
That's a good question.

429
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,881
Let me think it over.

430
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,451
Yeah.

431
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,248
Hey, brother.

432
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,568
Don't think too long, huh?

433
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,440
Detective Bullock!

434
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,491
Wait here.

435
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,368
Ha, ha. Penguin...

436
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,050
...it's good to see you.

437
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,407
- What are you guys doing?
- Old friend.

438
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,291
Thank goodness you're here.

439
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,209
There's been some silly mistake.

440
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,971
Looks like it. Unless you irritated
someone important.

441
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,485
You didn't do that, did you?

442
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,721
Me?

443
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,041
Of course not.

444
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,844
Are you sure?

445
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,043
Examine your soul, Penguin.

446
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,281
Wait!

447
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,890
Don't go.
Please, sir, I beg of you.

448
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,608
My patron, Don Maroni, is obviously
unaware of my predicament.

449
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,489
A simple phone call would resolve things,
I'm sure.

450
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,888
But see, I like having you here.

451
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,521
I can sit at my desk and look at you.

452
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,285
It's soothing...

453
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,130
...like a bonsai tree.

454
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,489
What's a bonsai tree?

455
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,761
So...

456
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,283
...did you see our friend?

457
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,847
I saw him.

458
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,331
And?

459
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,251
Enh. I'm working him.

460
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,050
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

461
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,683
So give him a little time.

462
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,849
Time, hmm?

463
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,770
Okay.

464
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,924
He can have time.

465
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,329
I'm optimistic.

466
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,329
Good.

467
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,607
All right, doctor,
pretend I'm an ignoramus.

468
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,603
It shouldn't be too hard.

469
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,525
Explain to me this whole
electric needle business.

470
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,923
When a real doctor like you does it,
what's it supposed to do?

471
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,847
Electroshock therapy is a common procedure
for mood and behavior alteration.

472
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,048
- Like mind control?
- Of a sort.

473
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,761
Blue Sky experimentation on humans
is considered unethical.

474
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,730
- So we know very little of the hard science.
- Okay.

475
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,680
But skilled surgeons can elicit
very specific responses.

476
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,451
- Uh-huh.
- But those inmates...

477
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,329
...weren't treated by a skilled surgeon.

478
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,561
You sure about that?

479
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,166
There are no skilled surgeons
amongst the inmates.

480
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,727
- Or the staff.
- You're a skilled surgeon.

481
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,648
We've been over this.
I haven't opened a body since med school.

482
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,005
I'm just messing with you.

483
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,367
I don't think you're the man behind this.

484
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,488
No, you're not the type to break rules.

485
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,369
Too scared of authority.

486
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,409
But you're hiding something.
What is it?

487
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,643
- Well, everybody is hiding something.
- Don't play tag.

488
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,209
You're right, detective.

489
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,850
I am afraid of authority.

490
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,966
And the things I'm hiding,
I'll never tell you.

491
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,407
- Sounds heavy.
- Heavy? Yes.

492
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,410
And if you know what's good for you,
you won't dig deeper.

493
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,370
All right.
I don't want to hit any power lines.

494
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,764
You don't have to tell me twice no digging,
unless, of course, it had something to do...

495
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,002
...with the case at hand.
- Nothing.

496
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,645
Oh.

497
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,769
Great, thank you.

498
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,651
Oh, you poor thing.

499
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,081
You look so pale. Any joy?

500
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,248
Not so far.
The files seem to be incomplete.

501
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,041
I wonder if there's more in the basement.

502
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,047
Blueprint says
there's a records office there?

503
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,728
Oh, the basement's closed off.

504
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,560
Unsafe chemicals.
Nobody's been there for 10 years.

505
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,885
You know the way down there?

506
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,486
All right, suppose you had to pick out
one member of your staff...

507
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,290
...as the culprit. Who would it be?

508
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,326
- It wasn't a staff member.
- Whatever, first face that pops to your mind.

509
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,450
Nobody. They're good people,
I know them well.

510
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,001
They've all been with me
for more than five years.

511
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,929
We all came to Arkham together.

512
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,523
Wait. Hold that. You just saw someone.
Who was it?

513
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,649
- No, she couldn't.
- She?

514
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,727
Who?

515
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,441
What's that?

516
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,648
Everybody's in their cell.

517
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,290
Dorothy?

518
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,248
Jim, hi. What's up?

519
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,121
Hi, Leslie.

520
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,006
We're going on an adventure
to the basement.

521
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,851
Oh, well, that sounds fun.

522
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,566
- Can I come?
- No.

523
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,611
- But--
- Dr. Thompkins, what did I tell you earlier?

524
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,886
You should go home.

525
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,641
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

526
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,606
Go home.

527
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,847
I don't under--

528
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,807
You Okay?

529
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,041
I'm fine.

530
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,043
Find the main entry guard...

531
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,569
...tell him to lock down, then get out, quick.
- Hit lockdown, get out. Will do.

532
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,401
- Yeah.
<i>- Jim, listen!</i>

533
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,484
- Dorothy Duncan is an inmate.
- I know. Get over here now.

534
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,211
Leslie!

535
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Guard! Guard, help!

536
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,530
Dr. Thompkins!

537
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,684
- Jim. Behind you!
- Unh!

538
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,441
Men! Men!

539
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,326
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

540
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,690
Go back in your cells right now.

541
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,889
You hear me? That's an order!

542
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,042
- Remember, I'm a vegan. No butter.
- Yeah, yeah.

543
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,731
Hi.

544
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,961
Is this--?

545
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,800
Is Jim Gordon there?

546
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,441
Yes, he is.

547
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,683
But I'm sorry,
Jim's kind of busy right now.

548
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,523
Can I take a message?

549
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,567
No.

550
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,730
No, that's okay.

551
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,647
I--

552
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,771
Who is this?

553
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,922
<i>I 'm a friend of Jim's.</i>

554
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,286
Who's that?

555
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,410
Go to hell.

556
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,970
M.E.'s got her in the morgue.

557
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,885
When Dorothy Duncan was a 16 year-old
nursing student...

558
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,247
...she killed five kids with poison candy.

559
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,683
For homework, she said.
She's spent over half her life at Arkham.

560
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,365
When the asylum closed,
it was chaos.

561
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,921
Must have stayed
in the basement until it reopened.

562
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,805
Forensics is sweeping the basement,
looking for her lair.

563
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,531
Poor soul. What was she trying to do?

564
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,570
Who knows? Maybe she was
trying to cure her own madness.

565
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,449
She was crazy. Enough said.

566
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,171
It's good to see you, Jim.

567
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,329
And you got a win, huh?

568
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,883
- Still fighting. Nice work.
- Don't think my boss will see it that way.

569
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,122
He's working for
the king of cheese-grinders.

570
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,250
It's a crying shame, cap.
We need to get him back on the job.

571
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
You know I'd bring you back here
in a second.

572
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
If I could.

573
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,007
I know. It's all good, captain.

574
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,049
You do look spiffy in the uniform.

575
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,041
- Yeah, if spiffy means dorky.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

576
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,763
How about a drink for old time's sake?

577
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,521
Sounds good.

578
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,607
Penguin.

579
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,447
Hi.

580
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,647
Sir.

581
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,646
Don Maroni.

582
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,849
- Thank heavens you're here.
- You look kind of frowsty.

583
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,320
Forgive me.

584
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,089
I've had nothing but a moist towelette
since yesterday morning.

585
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,083
A very sad picture.

586
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,291
You know why you're in there?

587
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,608
- I have no idea--
- Rhetorical question.

588
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,440
You're in there because I put you in there.

589
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,091
But Don Maroni, why?

590
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,645
What did I do?

591
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,882
Do you know what hubris is?

592
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,571
Do you know?

593
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,131
Sorry.

594
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,686
I thought that was another
rhetorical question.

595
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,285
Yes, I do.

596
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,566
Hubris. It's when--

597
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,805
It's when limping little chicken-butt
second bananas think they're hot stuff.

598
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,242
- Sir--
- When dumbass underlings...

599
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,846
...raise taxes without asking me first.

600
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,203
- Yes, sir.
- On fishermen.

601
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,840
You raised taxes on fishermen.

602
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,408
They're out there in the freaking ocean
risking their lives for us...

603
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,609
...and you raise their taxes
without asking me?

604
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,927
That's hubris, my friend.

605
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,283
I'm sorry, Don Maroni.

606
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,807
Deeply sorry.

607
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,409
I will never do it again.

608
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,920
All right, then.

609
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,404
Hey, you. Let my friends out.

610
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,922
- Excuse me?
- What, am I talking Hungarian?

611
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,286
Open the cage, mook.

612
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,448
Holy mother, you stink.

613
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,528
Let this be a lesson to you, yes?

614
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,966
Yes, sir.

615
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,608
You're a smart monkey.

616
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,683
But you're a monkey.

617
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,891
And I'm the Zookeeper.

618
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,245
Oh, you're all right.

619
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,766
Captain, you should see this.

620
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,967
Look here.

621
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,120
Dorothy Duncan.

622
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,203
Electrode wounds. Both sides.

623
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,727
Same gauge as the others.
About a month old.

624
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,484
They were hidden by her hair.

625
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,042
This is crazy.
How could she do this to herself?

626
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,282
She couldn't. Not humanly possible.

627
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,488
Which means
she was just another victim.

628
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,563
- She couldn't...
- Oh, crap.

629
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,121
Hey, Aaron.

630
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,525
What's up?

631
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,004
Hey, where'd you get those--

632
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,207
Hey!

633
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,046
Well done, Aaron.

634
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,889
Exactly like I told you.

635
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,681
Now, you are my best work so far.

636
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,609
Hello, Dr. Lang.

637
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,805
Lang?

638
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,042
- Lang!
- They're gone.

639
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,804
Get an ambulance. Go!

640
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,327
Not staff--

641
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,482
Don't speak. Just breathe.

642
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,762
- Breathe!
- Gruber.

643
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,971
<i>Dear Officer Gordon:</i>

644
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,164
<i>Sorry I had to run.</i>

645
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,325
<i>I very much wanted to enjoy a proper chat
with you before I left...</i>

646
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,244

647

sad creatures for a while now.</i>

648
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,203
<i>Electricity is an amazing thing.</i>

649
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,044
<i>It can work wonders.</i>

650
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,409
<i>Nurse Dorothy was an early success.</i>

651
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,605
<i>This last time,
I think I finally got one just right.</i>

652
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,489
<i>Bravo to me.</i>

653
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,563
<i>But time to go.</i>

654
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,883
<i>It was nice to meet you, Jim.</i>

655
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,441
<i>I hope to see you around.</i>

656
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,602
<i>All the best, Jack Gruber.</i>

657
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,250
Barbara?

658
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,045
Barbara?

659
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,049
<i>In the still of the night</i>

660
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,363
<i>I held you</i>

661
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,000
<i>Held you tight</i>

662
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,564
- How you doing?
- Well.

663
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,803
- You?
- Tip-top. Always.

664
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,327
So what's the deal, brother? Are you in?

665
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,526
Yeah.

666
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,447
- I'm in.
- That's my boy!

667
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,525
Name your terms.

668
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,685
Remember when we were 14?
We stole all that meat from Satriani's?

669
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,844
Yeah, I do.
It was like 50 pounds of pork and whatnot.

670
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,365
Never seen my mom so happy.

671
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,965
Ha, ha. Yeah.

672
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,331
Thing is, when I was sharing it out...

673
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,331
...it was 15 pounds
of prime angus beefsteaks in there.

674
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,965
I kept it all for myself.

675
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,405
Didn't give you any.

676
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,444
Gave you all the cheap cuts.

677
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,405
I never knew that.

678
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,883
Yeah, it's been bugging me ever since.

679
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,721
Hey, we're talking a long time ago.

680
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,409
I wanna say I'm sorry.

681
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,450
I apologize
for cheating you out of your beefsteak.

682
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,603
- Forget about it.
- No.

683
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,371
No. Brothers don't do that.

684
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,726
Why did I do that?

685
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,083
Hey, forget about it. It's okay.

686
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,924
Apology accepted.

687
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,160
Thank you.
