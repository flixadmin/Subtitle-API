1
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,743
Come in close.

2
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,370
Closer.

3
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,249
Because the more you think you see,

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,752
the easier it'll be to fool you.

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,297
Because what is seeing?

6
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,384
You're looking, but what you're really
doing is filtering, interpreting,

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,428
searching for meaning.

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,681
My job?

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,769
To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,

10
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,732
and use it against you.

11
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,073
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,657
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,159
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,869
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,748
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,041
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,125
Okay.

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,962
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,048
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,966
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,551
No.

22
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,845
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,972
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,516
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,142
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,793
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,045
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,550
And...

29
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,303
If you can get this bill from me,
you can have it.

30
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,347
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,058
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,647
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,108
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,734
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,944
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,987
Don't tell me.

37
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,155
Of course.

38
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,240
Beach. Cocktails.

39
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,825
Florida?

40
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,451
Look, it was a business trip.

41
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,620
I mean, it is a kind of business.

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,582
Maybe the oldest business.

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,916
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

44
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,543
She can't move, Mack.

45
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,044
You're thinking of a woman's name.

46
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,588
A, B, C,

47
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,922
D, E, F, G,

48
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,132
H, I, J...

49
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,050
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,343
Who's Janet?

51
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,180
You know Janet?

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,556
It's not your best friend, is it?

53
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,559
- Your sister?
- No, please.

54
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,895
Her sister? Oh, my God.

55
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,980
You weren't away on business.

56
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,940
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

57
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,233
Your wife's sister!

58
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,527
Okay, we need to move over here,

59
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,405
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

60
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,157
You want this to go away?

61
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,576
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

62
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,453
Come on, get it out.

63
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,954
Do you shake down everybody like this?

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,748
No, only the special few.

65
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,000
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

66
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,002
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

67
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,086
You're a stick-up artist.

68
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,880
Yeah. Of course.

69
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,966
Okay, and sleep!

70
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,010
Now, when I snap my fingers,

71
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,553
you won't remember any of this.

72
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,846
And you, Warren Beatty,

73
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,933
every time you see or even think of Janet,

74
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,727
you're gonna picture me naked.

75
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,937
And that's not a pretty sight.

76
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,021
Yeah.

77
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,273
And... You're wide awake!

78
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,695
Well, we did the best we could,

79
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,114
but some people just aren't to be hypnotized.

80
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,492
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

81
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,285
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

82
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,620
Look after her.

83
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,455
Just have to hit an ATM first.

84
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,306
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

85
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,517
and I will give $100

86
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,103
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

87
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,480
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,

88
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,648
right here in Brooklyn.

89
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,941
Check it out.

90
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,028
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,614
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

92
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,044
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

93
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,796
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

94
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,507
Look at this!
Looks like we got a spoon and a stem.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,009
I've got other tricks.

96
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,511
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

97
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,804
You said you would.

98
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,139
Nice wallet.

99
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,390
You have a very good eye, sir.

100
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,516
Thanks.

101
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,691
Wallet.

102
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,360
My wallet. My watch!

103
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,074
Stop that guy!

104
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

105
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,327
He's got my wallet!

106
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,963
Okay, Los Angeles,
are we ready to end this thing?

107
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,381
Yeah!

108
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,467
When that timer hits zero,

109
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,927
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

110
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,763
will fall from above.

111
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,515
A lady has to have handcuffs.
Right, girls?

112
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,560
One, two, three!

113
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,162
Yeah!

114
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,218
Help! Stop it!

115
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,053
She's serious! She can't get out!

116
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,848
Go get some help!

117
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,058
Help, dude!

118
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,895
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

119
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:21,565
Come on! This is bullshit!
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,028
Yes!

121
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,490
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,534
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,952
Close the door.
Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,370
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,166
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,834
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,169
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,670
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,341
I'll give you a hint.
It involved bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,594
- How much?
- 50 bucks.

131
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,762
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

132
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,972
Is it always a seven?

133
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,599
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

134
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,559
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

135
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,102
I'll see what I can do.

136
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,104
Magic man!

137
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,856
I love your shampoo.

138
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,860
- Hold up.
- What?

139
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,821
You need to leave.

140
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,947
Are you kidding me?

141
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,116
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

142
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,411
Is this what you do?
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

143
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,705
45 East Evan Street.

144
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,415
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

145
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,917
You don't have my number.

146
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm magic. I'll find it.
Have a good night.

147
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,712
Oh, you are such an asshole.

148
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:27,738
I'm going to go with her.

149
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,156
Go. I got your back.
I'll be right here.

150
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:31,701
Go ahead!

151
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,327
That's on you, Fuller.

152
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:52,972
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

153
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:05,192
Daniel?

154
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,486
Hey!

155
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,655
Henley.

156
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,033
Danny? Hey.

157
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,786
You got a card, huh?

158
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,123
No, no, no, it's good for you. Congratulations.
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

159
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,541
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

160
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,002
You wait out here. I will come back
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

161
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,879
Hey, Danny!
I'm not your assistant anymore.

162
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,380
Nice hair.

163
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,299
So, actually,
what have you been up to?

164
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,468
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

165
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,304
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

166
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,223
You have a website. That's good.
Good for you. Get the word out.

167
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,436
Okay.

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,731
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

169
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,400
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

170
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,651
Yeah. Excuse me.

171
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,570
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

172
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,239
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

173
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,866
Helen? No, no.

174
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,242
Henley.

175
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,744
It's on your coffee cup.

176
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,329
Thanks for keeping me honest.

177
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,415
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.
It was just an observation.

178
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,086
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,337
Thank you.

180
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,090
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,425
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,344
Very nice.
I know who you are and I just want to say that

183
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,428
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,596
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,182
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,268
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you

187
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,020
are a control freak.

188
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,355
I'm sorry, have we met before?

189
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,898
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

190
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,024
You are a control freak.

191
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,317
Well, I take that as a compliment.

192
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,569
Only he would take it as a compliment.

193
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,947
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

194
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,242
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

195
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,535
A couple? No, no.

196
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,702
We were never a couple.

197
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,538
He used to saw me in half.

198
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,831
She was a very good assistant.

199
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,957
But I was too fat for Danny.

200
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,709
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

201
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,711
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

202
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,463
No one could fit through there.
No one.

203
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,840
Rebecca fit through.

204
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,591
Rebecca fit for years.

205
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,385
Do you know how hard it is to stay

206
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,303
in those tiny little costumes?

207
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,389
No. I'm the main attraction.

208
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,516
Okay.
So he never made you feel special.

209
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,603
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

210
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,021
That's a really nice story.

211
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,690
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

212
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,275
No way.

213
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,069
J. Daniel Atlas?

214
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,613
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

215
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,990
You're like...

216
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,449
I idolize you. Seriously.

217
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,951
From a true fan.
It's so nice to meet you.

218
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,494
I'm Jack, by the way.

219
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,163
Question. Did you get one of these?

220
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,039
Yeah. Death.

221
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,208
The High Priestess.

222
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,418
I'm the Lover.

223
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,586
Three minutes.

224
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,713
Hermit.

225
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,549
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

226
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,092
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

227
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,803
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

228
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,315
What is this place?

229
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,305
Thought my apartment was nasty.

230
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,106
Man, it's freezing in here.

231
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:13,817
What's that?

232
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,235
I don't know.

233
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,490
What's it say?

234
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,284
Now you don't.

235
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:26,413
A rose by any other name...

236
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:33,003
Guys, what's happening?

237
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,507
Look at that.

238
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,640
It's gas!

239
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,934
Relax. Just dry ice.

240
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,727
Cool.

241
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,063
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

242
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:52,773
Hang on. Hang on.

243
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:58,987
I got nothin'.

244
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,906
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

245
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,991
I'm just trying to create the space for wisdom.

246
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,203
Okay, so you're like Buddha,
if he wasn't so enlightened.

247
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:07,663
And you're like Jesus,

248
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,290
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

249
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,627
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

250
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:14,837
No. Wait, did you?

251
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,213
I wish.

252
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,966
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

253
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:20,968
Oh, great.

254
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,074
Electricity is out.

255
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,743
Well, let's check.

256
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,262
Blueprints.

257
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,431
They're incredible.

258
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,267
Who do you think did this?

259
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,519
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

260
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,106
It's a show.

261
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,377
Merritt McKinney,

262
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,422
Daniel Atlas,

263
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,050
Henley Reeves,

264
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,762
Jack Wilder.

265
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,475
Arthur Tressler and the MGM Grand
proudly presents

266
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,313
The Four Horsemen.

267
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,982
Thank you.

268
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,485
Tonight we would like to try something

269
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,987
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

270
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,741
For our final trick,
we're gonna do something never before

271
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,826
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

272
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,163
Or any stage for that matter.

273
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,457
Ladies and gentlemen,

274
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,835
tonight

275
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,505
we are going to rob a bank.

276
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,601
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

277
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,022
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

278
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,696
One, two, three!

279
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,667
Sorry, sir. There's absolutely no recording
allowed during the performance.

280
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,335
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

281
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,753
Let me just put this away.

282
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,213
Actually, I need to take that.

283
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,173
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

284
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,551
Okay.

285
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,764
Okay, okay.

286
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,891
Now, please, please, settle down.

287
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,436
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

288
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,690
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

289
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,567
So we'll choose one at random then.

290
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,696
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

291
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,739
Thank you, Merritt.

292
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,616
We are looking at row number 5.

293
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,701
Where is that?

294
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,745
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

295
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,206
Lucky number 13.

296
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,041
B-5-13. Where are you?

297
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,879
Sir, please, stand up.
Ah, there you are. Hi.

298
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,301
Could you just confirm for me that this
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

299
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,343
Yes.

300
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,429
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

301
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,889
your name and the name of your bank?

302
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,266
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

303
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,895
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

304
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,229
French. Okay.

305
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,898
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

306
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,317
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

307
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,360
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

308
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,737
Could you please come up to the stage

309
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,155
and we'll rob your bank.

310
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,115
And while he does that...

311
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,535
There is someone here tonight
without whom we would just be

312
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,747
four magicians working the circuit,
trying to get...

313
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,332
Well, actually, trying to get here.

314
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,335
You probably know this man,
if not from one of the many, many

315
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,502
companies he puts his name on.

316
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:12,215
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

317
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,258
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

318
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,261
The only man here with
the Queen's cell phone number.

319
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,223
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

320
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,392
I want to say that when we came
to Mr. Tressler,

321
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,188
we promised that, as a unit, we could become
the biggest name in magic.

322
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,814
So we wanted to say, thank you.

323
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,733
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

324
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,735
we made sure we put your name on top.

325
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:37,198
If you turn out to be as good
as you think you are, dear girl,

326
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,325
that won't be necessary much longer.

327
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,826
We haven't done our closer yet.

328
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,078
Why don't you watch it

329
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,371
and then you can decide for yourself.

330
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,706
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

331
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
Thank you.
And, of course, once again,

332
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,502
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

333
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,214
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

334
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,926
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

335
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:03,182
You will need to wear this, as it will allow you
to literally fold through space and time

336
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,601
to your bank in the...

337
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,811
8th?

338
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,938
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

339
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:13,109
Now, once you are there, we will be able
to speak with you through this helmet.

340
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,944
Now if...

341
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,821
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

342
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,782
It has the added attraction of being
very stylish.

343
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:23,327
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

344
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,788
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

345
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,498
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

346
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,127
Thank you. Thank you very much.

347
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,420
Mais oui. Mais oui.

348
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,838
But before you go anywhere,

349
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,090
could you please, pick a card, any card.

350
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,174
Not that card.

351
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,928
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

352
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,471
Okay. This one?

353
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,640
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

354
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,477
Okay, great.
Now if you could just sign your name there.

355
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,980
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

356
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,732
- That's good.
- Thanks.

357
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,984
Put it in your pocket.

358
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,737
And now for one tiny detail.

359
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,717
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

360
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,844
And I'll step off of it.
Bonne chance.

361
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,139
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

362
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:29,894
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

363
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,145
One,

364
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,271
two...

365
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,397
Three.

366
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,902
What the fuck?

367
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,695
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

368
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,739
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

369
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,948
Etienne?

370
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,576
I liked that little French guy.

371
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,786
Where did he go?

372
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,296
Wait, there he is.

373
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,634
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

374
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,761
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

375
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,056
- Etienne? Are you okay?
- Yes.

376
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,517
Perfect. What do you see in there?

377
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,603
Money.

378
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,105
Is this real?

379
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,774
Yes. Looks like three million or so
Euros' worth.

380
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:20,736
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

381
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,323
I want you to take the card that you signed
out of your pocket.

382
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,617
And I want you to take the ticket stub
from tonight's show

383
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,994
and I want you to put it right there
in the middle of the money.

384
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,291
Now drop it.

385
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:49,432
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

386
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,808
Don't press it just yet.

387
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:55,604
That button activates an air duct
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

388
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,148
Okay, good. Now you can press it.

389
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:00,860
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

390
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,350
Wait a second.

391
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,656
Oh, merde.

392
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,906
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

393
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,532
We are The Four Horsemen.

394
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,035
- And good night!
- Good night!

395
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,049
Hold up here.

396
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,717
Dylan Rhodes.

397
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,513
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

398
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,056
Did you say magicians?

399
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,891
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

400
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,351
Where are you now?

401
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,436
I'm at Aria.
I'm heading up there to grab 'em now.

402
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,567
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

403
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,069
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

404
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,237
Uno minuto.

405
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,239
Let's go. Get 'em up.

406
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,740
Put the book down.

407
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,575
Okay. You got me.

408
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,202
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

409
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,539
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

410
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,082
Let's go.

411
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,768
Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

412
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,896
I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.

413
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,358
I'm a month, two tops,
away from blowing this whole thing open.

414
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,610
- Get Turkelson.
- He's in Atlantic City.

415
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,488
What about Cowan? Look at him.
He's just sitting there on his ass.

416
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:52,823
Hilarious, Rhodes.

417
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,408
I love you.

418
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,784
Asshole.

419
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,411
I don't have time for this magic crap.

420
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,164
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

421
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,332
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

422
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,000
Actually, 3.2.

423
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,380
Who is she?

424
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,673
Who are you?

425
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,926
Alma Dray from Interpol.
I'll be working the investigation with you.

426
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,178
You gotta be kidding me.

427
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,097
It's bad enough they got me chasing down
David Copperfield and Friends.

428
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,392
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

429
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,686
I look forward to working
with you too, Agent Rhodes.

430
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,773
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

431
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,983
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

432
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,986
Oh, you did?
You spoke to my witness before me?

433
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,198
Your witness?
I thought you didn't want the case.

434
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,991
Besides, he's useless.

435
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,743
Oh, really? Why is that?

436
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:40,120
Because he believes their magic was real.

437
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,374
Oh, he believes the magic was real?
You're right, he probably is useless.

438
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,502
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him too?

439
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,170
Thank you.

440
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,299
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

441
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,718
I tried to give the money back,
but they won't take it.

442
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,429
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

443
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,680
I did.

444
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,057
Fine. Fantastic. You did.

445
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,726
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

446
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,229
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

447
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,773
With the teleportation helmet.

448
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,441
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

449
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,235
He was hypnotized during the show.

450
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:13,404
I told you, he's useless.

451
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,281
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done
with this other bullshit.

452
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:20,786
Hey!

453
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,663
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

454
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,164
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

455
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,667
I guess that bullshit was the trigger word.

456
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,878
Okay. Hey, hey. Écoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

457
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,046
You're not in the Philharmonic.

458
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,757
- How do you say stop in French?
- Stop.

459
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,967
Tell him to stop.

460
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:39,346
No, I can't.
You just have to let him finish his movement.

461
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,306
Okay, I need a time-out.

462
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,933
Too many French people in one room.

463
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,560
Agent Rhodes!

464
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,229
I'm ordered by my bosses to provide a report.

465
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,399
And until we have one, I'm here, like it or not.

466
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,276
So we can work together,

467
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,530
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

468
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,781
It's up to you.

469
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,786
I'm not finished.

470
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:06,748
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

471
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,917
And I do not handle jet lag well.

472
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,756
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

473
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,967
I promise you, you will lose.

474
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,181
Fine. So which one of these idiots
do you want to talk to first?

475
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,307
Him?

476
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,022
Dylan, for the record,

477
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,316
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

478
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Okay.

479
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,278
That is to say, that it's not a science.
It's more for entertainment.

480
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:37,362
All right.

481
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,824
Just don't believe everything the guy says.
That's all.

482
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:46,622
Please convey my deepest apologies
to your colleague out there.

483
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,166
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

484
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,334
I was out of line.

485
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,668
Tranny Tuesday?

486
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,545
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

487
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,380
Or might not have, if you believe

488
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,799
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

489
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:02,554
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI
of men wearing dresses?

490
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:06,975
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

491
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,563
I'm just having fun.

492
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,024
Was this your card? No.

493
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,400
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

494
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,485
and I respect that.

495
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,445
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

496
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,571
but I understand protocol.

497
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,906
Okay, okay.

498
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:23,700
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

499
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,203
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

500
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,454
Oh, yes. That would be...

501
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,039
What do the kids call it these days?

502
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,290
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

503
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,209
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

504
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,504
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

505
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,006
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

506
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,176
It says here you are a mentalist.

507
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,346
What exactly is mentalism?

508
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,516
Tricks, mostly, some science.

509
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,520
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

510
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,982
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

511
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,318
Voices in my head.

512
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,238
Says here you were fairly famous at one point.

513
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,533
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

514
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,244
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

515
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,329
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

516
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,874
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

517
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,334
Did your research, did you?

518
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,211
IRS audit. Back taxes.

519
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,549
You've had a long hard slog back
into the limelight, haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

520
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:25,429
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

521
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,639
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

522
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,849
put on the magical helmet...

523
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,933
Listen to me.

524
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,519
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

525
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,812
Which makes you an accomplice.

526
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:36,315
So if you wanna walk out of here today,
I'd suggest you start...

527
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,984
Now you listen to me, unless you think
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

528
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,402
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

529
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,737
then we have a show to perform.

530
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,406
And you, Agent Rhodes,
have a drawing board to get back to.

531
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,949
Is this your first date?

532
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,076
What?

533
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:52,039
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

534
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,667
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

535
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,419
And before you get involved,

536
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,089
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

537
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:06,136
And I know the first one is that
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

538
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,013
You should have said something to him.

539
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,140
This is a weird way for you to find out.

540
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,225
You are literally begging to be arrested.
You know that?

541
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,645
If it means you would actually do it,
then, yeah. But you won't.

542
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,357
Because if you did, it means that you,
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

543
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,943
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

544
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,613
The press would have a field day.

545
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,490
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

546
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,242
And you guys would look like idiots
even more then you already are.

547
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,286
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

548
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,623
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

549
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,124
nothing up your sleeve.

550
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,292
And you know it.

551
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,131
Don't draw him in and then dump him
because abandonment is a big area for him.

552
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,633
Mommy?

553
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,718
Daddy.

554
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,261
You have big daddy issues.

555
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,138
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

556
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,475
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

557
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,435
Me? I'll take a tenner.

558
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,814
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous...

559
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,066
I'll still take a tenner.

560
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,819
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

561
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,987
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

562
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,489
And you know who put them there?

563
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,491
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

564
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,578
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

565
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,498
than you can maintain that phony arrogance.

566
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:21,503
And the instant that you even show
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

567
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,838
I'll be there.

568
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:24,589
I will be all over you like...

569
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,841
Like white on rice?

570
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,676
Sorry. That's unfair.

571
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,011
Let me warn you. I want you to follow.

572
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,596
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

573
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,349
we will always be one step, three steps,
seven steps ahead of you.

574
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,559
And just when you think you're catching up,

575
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,977
that's when we'll be right behind you.

576
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,603
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

577
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,771
exactly where I want you to be.

578
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,941
So come close. Get all over me
because the closer you think you are,

579
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:44,359
the less you'll actually see.

580
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,986
I'm gonna nail you...

581
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,700
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

582
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:01,877
Shit!

583
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,962
First rule of magic.

584
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,048
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

585
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:31,948
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

586
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,075
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

587
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,161
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

588
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,163
- What changed?
- I met them.

589
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,247
Hey. Guys.

590
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,750
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

591
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,251
Most of it was just filler.

592
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,003
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

593
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:48,131
But guess who was sitting there in the back,
filming the whole damn thing?

594
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,257
I don't know.

595
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,801
Thaddeus Bradley.

596
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,430
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

597
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,515
No.

598
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,767
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

599
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,852
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

600
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,020
Get him on the phone.

601
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:04,981
- I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.
- Good.

602
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,818
Mr. Bradley started as a magician.

603
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,611
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

604
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,072
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

605
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:16,284
The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion.

606
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,787
That's a man who loves his work.

607
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,040
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

608
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,960
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

609
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:26,586
I will take one.

610
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:37,681
That's incredible. That's amazing.

611
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,475
Red dye, palmed.

612
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,228
Is that how Jesus did it?
That's incredible.

613
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,646
I'm sorry.
Can I just take a minute here?

614
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,023
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

615
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,318
Do you know how many people
went to see magic performed live

616
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,987
in the last half decade?

617
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,321
About 1.6 million.

618
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,741
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

619
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,118
Five million.

620
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,244
Right, so it's about the money.

621
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,829
Well, the money is only there

622
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,207
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

623
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,587
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

624
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,340
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost though, to this game?

625
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,925
Cost?

626
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,302
I don't know. Careers.

627
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,511
Lives.

628
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,806
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

629
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,100
I'm sorry, who?

630
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,685
Lionel Shrike.

631
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:28,064
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

632
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,943
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

633
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,530
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

634
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,950
He was shackled inside a safe,
and dropped into the river.

635
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,160
But he never resurfaced.

636
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,495
You mean he died?

637
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,372
I didn't kill him.

638
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,710
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

639
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:51,004
You do realize this is a game?

640
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,881
Believe me, it's not a game.

641
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,132
It is a game.

642
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:55,967
You're the game. You're being played.

643
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,429
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

644
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,306
I mean, come on.

645
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,390
You got me.

646
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,725
If you really want to know

647
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:07,604
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

648
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,648
my special comes out next month.

649
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,857
Or I could just bring you in

650
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,401
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

651
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,028
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

652
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,198
you actually don't know how they did it.

653
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,327
Showmanship and theatrics.

654
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:24,663
When a magician waves his hand and says,

655
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,581
this is where the magic is happening.

656
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,042
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

657
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:32,504
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

658
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,006
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

659
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,675
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

660
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:39,552
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

661
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,054
But don't take my word for it.

662
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:43,223
How about a trip to Paris?

663
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,726
Hermia, the teleportation helmet,
please, darling?

664
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,687
You're joking, right?

665
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:50,689
You wanna know how they did it or not?

666
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:53,858
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

667
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,569
Step right up.

668
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,155
There you go.

669
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,827
Now we just pull this down all safe and snug.

670
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,539
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

671
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,252
And when you're ready to go to Paris,
just say the magic word.

672
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
Blow me?

673
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,423
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

674
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,685
Bonjour.

675
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,896
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

676
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,315
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

677
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,151
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

678
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,902
My fun.

679
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,280
What?

680
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,823
Nothing.

681
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,493
- So they got a vault set.
- Yes.

682
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,413
And it's the exact replica
of the little French guy's bank.

683
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,041
- So he's a plant.
- He was a dupe, not a plant.

684
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,501
They chose him.
They knew which seat he was in.

685
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,545
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

686
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:59,507
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

687
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,634
They let them think they picked the seat.

688
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:03,344
We'll choose one at random then.

689
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,472
Actually, they were
just palming the ball

690
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,265
with the seat number they wanted.

691
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,809
We are looking at row number 5.

692
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,227
Henley, could I please have a seat number?

693
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,562
Lucky number 13.

694
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,689
Could you just confirm that
this is, in fact, your seat?

695
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,066
He was selected.

696
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,026
They programmed his mind

697
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,236
- to make him go to Las Vegas.
- Viva Las Vegas.

698
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,574
And then they kept reinforcing it,
until he did.

699
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,993
They trailed him.

700
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,203
They studied him.

701
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,038
Nothing was left to chance.

702
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,374
I got his measurements.

703
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,794
He had no idea
he was their target.

704
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,921
And they simply activated him in Vegas.

705
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,464
When I snap my fingers...

706
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,008
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

707
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,301
But how did they know
what bank was his?

708
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,886
- You're kidding.
- Really?

709
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,555
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

710
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,099
Yes.

711
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:50,391
Like this.

712
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,854
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

713
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,441
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

714
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,568
You ready?

715
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,861
Yes.

716
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,155
Credit card.

717
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,325
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

718
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,494
they left in the vault in Paris.

719
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,578
Very good.

720
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,163
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

721
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:15,333
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

722
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,210
You said they didn't steal the money.

723
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:20,338
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.
I said they didn't rob the bank.

724
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,218
My guess is that they targeted
a shipment of freshly minted money

725
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:28,763
headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.

726
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,434
Which, of course, is just as hard to break into.

727
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,187
Unless you're already inside.

728
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,376
And despite what the banks
would have you believe,

729
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,671
the men who drive these trucks
are not exactly mental giants.

730
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,924
For our Horsemen...

731
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,260
it was almost too easy.

732
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,726
Hey, boys.

733
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,152
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

734
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,529
Flash paper.

735
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:30,992
Magicians use it all the time.

736
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,000
Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

737
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,671
Oh, merde.

738
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,758
Two days ago,
no one heard of these guys,

739
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,344
but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.

740
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,930
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

741
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,849
Give your audience $3 million.

742
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,351
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

743
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:57,644
Best finale ever.

744
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,187
They're gonna be
the first magicians in history

745
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,271
to get laid.

746
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,690
Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

747
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,859
- put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

748
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,362
I always do. It's lawyer first,

749
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,364
- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.

750
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,865
Yes. Then the children.

751
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,452
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

752
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,703
And what's that?

753
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,873
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

754
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:24,003
Unrequited and misguided,
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

755
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,798
Consequently, you're very tightly...

756
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,549
How should I put it?

757
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,009
Corked.

758
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,135
Oh, I am?

759
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,806
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

760
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,392
and strictly in the vein of helping a sister out,

761
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:42,313
I invite you to think of me
as your own personal corkscrew.

762
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:43,648
Thanks.

763
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,401
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

764
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,653
Cheap and meaningless, maybe, but...

765
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,405
not time-consuming.

766
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,160
We should be getting there
a few minutes early.

767
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,328
So, sit back, relax.

768
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,832
We should be in the Big Easy soon.
Appreciate you flying with us today.

769
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,376
So, what's in it for Tressler,
besides the money?

770
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,585
Ego.

771
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,672
Okay, pick your card.

772
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,050
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

773
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,885
No, don't tell me.

774
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,721
- Okay.
- Okay.

775
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,264
Thaddeus was there that night.

776
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,766
He knows exactly how they pulled it off.
What about him?

777
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,976
What are you saying?

778
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,228
You think they could be working together.

779
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,855
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

780
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,816
were a bunch of street magicians
a year ago with no resources.

781
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:31,070
So, how do they go from doing that to this
without some kind of outside help?

782
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,322
Is this your card?

783
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,949
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

784
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:37,618
Nice shuffle.

785
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,705
You know, this is hard.
According to this book,

786
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,792
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

787
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,920
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

788
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,256
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

789
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,633
Or specifically those guys?

790
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,928
I could care less about magicians in general.

791
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,931
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

792
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,099
Exploit them how?

793
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,517
Try again.

794
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,645
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

795
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,482
Their need to believe in something
that's unexplainable

796
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,443
in order to make their lives more bearable.

797
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,320
I see it as a strength.

798
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,280
My life is happier when I believe that.

799
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,741
Is this your card?

800
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,701
Yeah.

801
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,953
Yeah?

802
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,455
- Yeah.
- Cool.

803
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:28,211
That smile on your face. Is it real?

804
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,545
Maybe.

805
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,590
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

806
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,092
Do you feel exploited?

807
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,387
Or did you have maybe a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

808
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:40,932
Guy goes to the doctor.

809
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,226
Doctor says, sir, you're gonna
have to stop masturbating.

810
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,310
He says, why?

811
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,728
He says, so I can finish the examination.

812
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,938
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

813
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,606
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

814
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,316
Hey, guys.

815
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,818
We got a show to prepare for.

816
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,112
Do we now?

817
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,405
No, no, no, don't do that.

818
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,656
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

819
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,074
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

820
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,742
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

821
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,035
I know all of your little tricks.

822
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,453
That what they are to you? Tricks?

823
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,247
Yes, it's gimmicks. It's Barnum statements.

824
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,040
It's reading the eyes. Body language.
I get it.

825
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,792
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

826
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,627
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

827
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,838
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

828
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,423
No.

829
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,175
- Do me.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

830
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,427
Okay.

831
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,553
Even better.

832
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,637
- Art.
- Yeah.

833
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:22,473
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,
when I want to be.

834
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,600
Just stay with me, okay?

835
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,311
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

836
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,397
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

837
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,401
You had a dog. A real tough dog.
A brutish breed. Like a real...

838
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,570
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

839
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,322
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

840
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,492
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

841
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,287
Sorry.

842
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,496
Wait, let me try one.

843
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,706
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

844
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,874
Come on, give me one more time.
One more time.

845
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,542
He can do way better than that.

846
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:50,626
Let's do family.

847
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,921
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

848
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,674
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

849
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,553
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

850
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:04,807
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

851
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,642
Okay.
You know what? I got nothin'.

852
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:07,810
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

853
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,814
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

854
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,609
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?
That was your childhood?

855
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,069
I certainly hope tonight's show
is gonna be better than this.

856
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,655
Don't worry. Just you wait.

857
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,331
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

858
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,582
What, are you kidding me?

859
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,292
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

860
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:33,169
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

861
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,505
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

862
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,675
Hey, hey! There you are.

863
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,386
What, the French girl doing a little
sightseeing while she's in New Orleans?

864
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,680
No. In fact, here, speaking French

865
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,474
is actually an asset.

866
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,100
Do you see that woman up there?

867
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:50,102
That's Marie Claire.

868
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,563
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

869
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,900
You're welcome.

870
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,610
Yeah.

871
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,278
We got a place.

872
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,323
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

873
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,408
I'm just trying to understand how they think.

874
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,702
You think I'm playing in their hands, do you?

875
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,664
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

876
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,290
This what? This magic?

877
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,710
Lionel Shrike.

878
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,297
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

879
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,509
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

880
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,969
They saw the tree in half.

881
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,304
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

882
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,098
is the card with the signature.

883
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,266
How did he do that?

884
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,769
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

885
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,604
Excusez-moi.

886
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,649
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

887
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,150
No, but I do have some good news.

888
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,361
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

889
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:42,071
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

890
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,364
What tracking bracelets?

891
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,450
He has every member of his crew
wearing a tracking bracelet.

892
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,744
Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.

893
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,955
- So as long as Atlas is tracking them...
- Next.

894
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,833
Our boys can track Atlas
from right here in the mobile command unit.

895
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,751
Okay, call me
if you get any movement.

896
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,211
Copy that.

897
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,472
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

898
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,519
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

899
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:17,398
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

900
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,527
And I watch the people make a wish
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

901
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,405
Then throw the key into the Seine.

902
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:30,745
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

903
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:36,417
Watching the key sink into the water
and their secret is locked away forever.

904
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:41,589
Real and, at the same time, magical.

905
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,929
So,

906
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:53,476
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

907
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:56,228
Yeah.

908
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,570
There is a legend
of a secret order

909
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:06,530
born in ancient Egypt called

910
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,074
The Eye.

911
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:14,622
It is said they perfected sleight of hand
to steal food from the Pharaohs

912
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,457
and give it to the slaves.

913
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:17,875
Their purpose?

914
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,171
Using magic and illusion
to even the scales of justice.

915
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:27,385
Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?

916
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:32,515
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

917
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:37,603
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

918
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,605
get the better of them?

919
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,655
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

920
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:52,243
Either you have a cease-and-desist,
which you don't, or you should leave.

921
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:56,122
If I want something to cease or desist,

922
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,541
it does.

923
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,625
Take five.

924
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,086
According to your potential backers,

925
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,756
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

926
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,591
from your best special.

927
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,469
I have here a check

928
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,472
for 3.5 million.

929
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,640
To walk away?

930
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:18,436
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

931
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,357
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

932
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,069
You're in this to ride them up.

933
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,530
I'm in it to ride them down.

934
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,908
I take it that we do not have a deal.

935
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:38,747
And therein lies our conflict.

936
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,419
Let me be blunt.

937
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:48,299
My bank account is much,
much bigger than yours.

938
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,343
And my lawyers are much stronger.

939
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,763
And they will manacle you

940
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,683
with so many injunctions.

941
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:03,105
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching
everything that you own drain away

942
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,317
in front of your greedy little eyes.

943
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,819
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

944
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,697
And I'm still here.

945
00:49:11,781 --> 00:49:16,285
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

946
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:21,499
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

947
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,959
the ride down, which you mentioned,

948
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:29,006
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

949
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,718
Oops. You shouldn't have done that.

950
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,763
According to superstition,

951
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,891
one who uses a doll to enact one's own wrath,

952
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,562
is likely to bring that very wrath unto himself.

953
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:45,898
Isn't that funny?

954
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,567
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

955
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,703
Do me a favor.

956
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:03,874
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

957
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,959
Stay out of my head, you perv.

958
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,754
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

959
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,881
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

960
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,841
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

961
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,511
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

962
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,180
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

963
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,431
And on demand.

964
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,975
That's not gonna happen.

965
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,518
Oh, no?

966
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,604
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

967
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:31,110
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

968
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,654
Make any magician's wish come true.

969
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:35,155
You've come a long way,

970
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,074
much further
than anyone would have expected

971
00:50:37,158 --> 00:50:39,159
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

972
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:43,414
If by has-been you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

973
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,917
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

974
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,169
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

975
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:50,921
By all means.

976
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:56,594
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

977
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,597
He wants to be a great magician someday.

978
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,515
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

979
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,686
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

980
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,356
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

981
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,984
Tell me. Am I getting close?

982
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,656
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

983
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,160
Okay. Name a card.

984
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,828
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

985
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,121
Okay.

986
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,796
It's up your left sleeve.

987
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,423
Is it?

988
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:36,258
No. No, I don't see it up there.

989
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,054
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

990
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,890
Yeah.

991
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:51,357
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

992
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,651
Break a leg.

993
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,778
Hey, you break something too.

994
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,031
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Savoy management welcomes you

995
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:03,452
to tonight's special performance,
The Four Horsemen, Act Two.

996
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,621
Unlike traditional performances,

997
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,041
The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,
call your friends,

998
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,086
upload, stream, and tweet the show freely.

999
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,714
Thank you.
The show will begin in a few minutes.

1000
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,178
Nice watch.

1001
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,682
It's a family heirloom.

1002
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:30,521
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1003
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,439
- Who?
- Shrike.

1004
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:34,483
So, when he was 14,

1005
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,902
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1006
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,280
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1007
00:52:40,573 --> 00:52:43,200
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1008
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:44,451
And?

1009
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,622
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1010
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,836
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,
and presto!

1011
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,295
The card is in the tree.

1012
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,339
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1013
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,049
The card was in the tree.

1014
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:03,137
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1015
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:06,098
The point is, the trick was not to look closely.

1016
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:10,936
It was to look so far
that you see 20 years into the past.

1017
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,981
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1018
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,316
What are you suggesting?

1019
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,488
Arthur Tressler presents

1020
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,990
Jack Wilder,

1021
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,283
Henley Reeves,

1022
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,826
Merritt McKinney,

1023
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,578
and Daniel Atlas.

1024
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,496
The Four Horsemen.

1025
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,295
Thank you. Before we begin,

1026
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,422
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1027
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,966
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1028
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,760
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1029
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:48,557
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1030
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,771
Yeah, Agent Rhodes
has personally vowed to nail us.

1031
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:58,358
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1032
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,323
What is magic?

1033
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,201
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1034
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,537
So I want you to look.

1035
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,915
Look as closely as possible.

1036
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,294
Because the tricks you are about to see
may not seem connected.

1037
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:19,296
But we assure you, they are.

1038
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,050
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1039
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:27,054
Or is it one giant illusion?

1040
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,898
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1041
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:39,942
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1042
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,152
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1043
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:46,490
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1044
00:54:46,699 --> 00:54:48,826
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1045
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,703
and put her inside this mystery box.

1046
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:55,207
There are two pencils out there.
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1047
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,667
- Here!
- Yeah!

1048
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,169
And now, you will say the magic word.

1049
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,504
Abracadabra.

1050
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,632
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand
for no reason. And then...

1051
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:06,176
Fluffy has magically vanished
before your very eyes.

1052
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,181
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,
you're about to.

1053
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:12,432
And sleep.

1054
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,352
Down, down. Sleep, sleep. Completely sleep.

1055
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,020
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1056
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,316
And now we are gonna debunk
a few magic myths this evening.

1057
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,444
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1058
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,406
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1059
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,991
As has the mirror

1060
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,535
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1061
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:33,787
When you hear the word freeze

1062
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,581
you are all football players.

1063
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:39,209
And your job is to tackle,

1064
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,711
dismantle,

1065
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,087
crush,

1066
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,631
tear limb from limb,

1067
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,758
the quarterback.

1068
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,597
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1069
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,683
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1070
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,481
You will know who the quarterback is.

1071
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:05,110
He will be the one saying that word.

1072
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,320
Freeze.

1073
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,957
Three, two, one...

1074
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,169
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

1075
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,796
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

1076
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,007
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

1077
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:28,592
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

1078
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:30,552
Where is Section B?

1079
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,096
Okay. There.
It's gonna be one of you guys. Get ready.

1080
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,931
I don't know why everybody's happy.

1081
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,058
It's only them.

1082
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,684
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

1083
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,277
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1084
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,654
Kill the quarterback!

1085
00:56:48,946 --> 00:56:50,572
Get on back to your seats.

1086
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,783
I got a feeling I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1087
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,775
I guess you have lost some weight.

1088
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,834
At the intermission,

1089
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,253
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1090
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,838
and seal it in an envelope.

1091
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,382
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.
Everyone take 'em out.

1092
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:56,722
Now, everybody, shout out your name.
All at once. Go.

1093
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,474
Shout 'em out.

1094
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,979
Clement? Frannick?

1095
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:06,106
- Yeah! Up here!
- Way up there.

1096
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:08,275
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1097
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,609
That's me!

1098
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,279
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1099
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,615
Josepha Hickey?

1100
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,742
That's me!

1101
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,745
Josepha, I want you to focus on your balance,

1102
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,913
and count from one to ten out loud.

1103
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,790
One, two, three, four, five...

1104
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,125
Stop.

1105
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,460
Is the first digit 5?

1106
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,044
Yes.

1107
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,421
Do it again. This time, faster.

1108
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,964
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1109
00:58:31,048 --> 00:58:32,132
Stop.

1110
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,342
Six. Again.

1111
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,427
One, two...

1112
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:39,473
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1113
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,975
Yeah. That's what I got.

1114
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,270
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1115
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,521
Okay, Dina,

1116
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,441
1,

1117
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,067
4,

1118
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,778
7,

1119
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,197
- 7.
- Yeah.

1120
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,075
You think it is.
But in fact, you too are wrong.

1121
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,327
Clement...

1122
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:03,497
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1123
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,501
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1124
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,172
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1125
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,258
Focus on your number.

1126
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,599
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1127
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,893
Oh, this is strange.

1128
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,480
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1129
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,524
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1130
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,567
about what you think is in your account.

1131
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,569
Okay, you can sit down now.

1132
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,113
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

1133
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,158
This evening would not be possible

1134
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,329
if it weren't for our great benefactor
Arthur Tressler.

1135
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,915
Big applause! Big applause!

1136
00:59:47,124 --> 00:59:49,584
Art, actually, why don't you come up on stage
for the finale?

1137
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,461
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1138
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,463
There he goes. Okay, good.

1139
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,714
Are we on red?

1140
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,716
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1141
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,385
All right, no one leaves the theater.
No one.

1142
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,511
There he goes.

1143
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,347
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1144
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,391
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1145
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:10,146
Now, Art, I took a guess.
North of 140. Am I right?

1146
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,942
That's 140 million, by the way.

1147
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,572
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1148
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:21,741
How can he be right about his balance
and everyone else be wrong?

1149
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:25,203
I think possibly because he too is wrong.

1150
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,789
Everybody, take out your paper.

1151
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:32,419
And using the flashlight under your seat,
start to warm up that paper.

1152
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,755
I think your correct balance begins to appear.

1153
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:42,721
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1154
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,972
Yes.

1155
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,647
Look.

1156
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,149
What's going on there, Daniel?

1157
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:59,779
Wait. This is weird.
A second ago, it said $144,579,651.

1158
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,864
But now...

1159
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,492
Now it says $70,000 less.

1160
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,206
- Josepha, can you stand up?
- Yes.

1161
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,917
Now, what is your new number?

1162
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,963
$70,562 now in my account.

1163
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:25,805
Is it possible that Josepha's balance went up
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1164
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,642
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1165
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:29,851
Is it?

1166
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,480
It is.

1167
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:36,983
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1168
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,194
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1169
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:43,198
$281,477.

1170
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,828
We have a confession to make.

1171
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,039
She's right. We lied about something.

1172
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:52,791
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1173
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,335
All of you have one thing in common.

1174
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,796
Everyone in this room was a victim

1175
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,674
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1176
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,343
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1177
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:05,887
- Your businesses.
- Your loved ones.

1178
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:09,182
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1179
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,976
Tressler Insurance.

1180
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,520
You were abandoned.

1181
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,688
You were loopholed...

1182
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,981
out of your settlements.

1183
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,985
This is all for show. Correct?

1184
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,444
All meaning we're doing it onstage

1185
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,737
in front of a paying audience?

1186
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,531
Then, yes, it's for show.

1187
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,325
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1188
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,327
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1189
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:32,539
Everybody, look at your cell phones
right now! Everybody!

1190
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,506
Is this for real?

1191
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,882
I don't know.

1192
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:44,259
Is this happening?

1193
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,011
I don't know! I can't tell!

1194
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:48,888
Hey! Did you do this?

1195
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,349
How could we, Art?

1196
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,726
We don't have your password.

1197
01:02:52,893 --> 01:02:56,187
We'd need access to information
we could never get our hands on.

1198
01:02:56,397 --> 01:03:00,108
Ah, yes, security questions, for instance, like,
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1199
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,776
or the name of your first pet.

1200
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:03,695
Where would we get that information, Art?

1201
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,697
You certainly would never tell us.

1202
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:10,702
We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.

1203
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:14,372
Do not let them get away.

1204
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,458
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1205
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,758
You got hell to pay!

1206
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,762
Stop!

1207
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,264
Stop! Nobody move!

1208
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:34,309
Freeze!

1209
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,102
Quarterback!

1210
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,399
We are The Four Horsemen.

1211
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,525
Good night.

1212
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,164
Get 'em off me!

1213
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,500
Get off! Get off me!

1214
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,303
Get off me!

1215
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,772
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1216
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:29,531
Quarterback!

1217
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:33,827
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater
and bring the tracker.

1218
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,663
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1219
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,914
Give me the tracker.

1220
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,374
Let's go.

1221
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:44,712
FBI! Clear!

1222
01:04:45,422 --> 01:04:46,422
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1223
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:47,674
What have you got?

1224
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,342
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1225
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:52,470
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1226
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,890
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1227
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,262
Hey! Move!

1228
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,930
Move! Move!

1229
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,101
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1230
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:42,187
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1231
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,063
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1232
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,202
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1233
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:03,958
Damn! Where are you?

1234
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,680
Excuse me.

1235
01:06:23,979 --> 01:06:25,605
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1236
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,192
Stop!

1237
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,408
What are you doing?

1238
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:42,413
He's going in Napoleon House.

1239
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,210
Move! Move!

1240
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,212
Move out of the way!

1241
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Hey!

1242
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:52,715
Move!

1243
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,261
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1244
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,681
No! No! No!

1245
01:07:01,558 --> 01:07:02,725
Freeze!

1246
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,019
Lower your weapons!

1247
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,439
What? I'm tracking myself!

1248
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,900
The Horsemen left egg on the face
of what they call

1249
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:16,280
the alphabet agencies, calling into question
the efficacy of the FBI's task force

1250
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,033
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,

1251
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,620
Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,
who was publicly ridiculed,

1252
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,581
and even tackled at tonight's performance.

1253
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,208
Talk about a fumble.

1254
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,252
This is quickly becoming a national story,

1255
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,130
as The Horsemen have now seemingly
pulled off the impossible

1256
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,507
for the second time in as many days.

1257
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:38,094
Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen
seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...

1258
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,429
Hey.

1259
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,266
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a drink.

1260
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,770
I came to get you.

1261
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,230
I'm worried about you.

1262
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:51,149
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1263
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,693
- Atlas. You had him.
- He didn't have a weapon.

1264
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:55,069
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1265
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,989
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1266
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,615
Didn't you?

1267
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,202
A pretty French girl shows up out of the blue,
acts like she's my partner

1268
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,996
- and then she lets the bad guy go?
- Let go of my arm.

1269
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,748
Who exactly are you anyway?

1270
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,002
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1271
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,091
Not bad.

1272
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:20,094
What is this?

1273
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,599
What's the Eye of Horus?

1274
01:08:24,808 --> 01:08:27,894
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1275
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,521
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1276
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:32,690
Find your way back yourself.

1277
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:40,198
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1278
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,625
Sir.

1279
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:51,876
Thank you.

1280
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,671
What is your role with them?

1281
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:56,839
Role?

1282
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,758
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1283
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:00,760
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1284
01:09:00,844 --> 01:09:04,055
If it makes you feel any better,
this wasn't about you.

1285
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:07,600
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1286
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:10,728
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1287
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:13,314
Played out on a global scale.

1288
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,652
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1289
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,988
The distraction,
while they set up the real trick.

1290
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,368
I was a $140-million distraction?

1291
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,370
Yes.

1292
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:32,208
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1293
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,210
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1294
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,628
- You know...
- I can destroy you.

1295
01:09:35,712 --> 01:09:37,380
Yes, I do know.

1296
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:38,881
Well, you won't.

1297
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:41,592
And you won't destroy them.

1298
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:46,848
Whatever this grand trick is,
it was designed a long time ago.

1299
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:51,602
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1300
01:09:52,437 --> 01:09:56,983
So I suggest you sit back
and enjoy your front row seat.

1301
01:09:57,442 --> 01:10:00,111
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1302
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,363
Whatever you stand to make...

1303
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:08,035
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1304
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:09,579
And destroy them.

1305
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:12,039
I stand to make five million.

1306
01:10:12,749 --> 01:10:14,000
Am I flinching?

1307
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,712
No, you're not.

1308
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:39,752
Hey.

1309
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:43,297
I'm sorry for your arm.

1310
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,966
No. I'm sorry.

1311
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,301
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1312
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:51,889
I'm at a loss.

1313
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:59,230
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1314
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:02,608
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1315
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:07,613
So what's this all about?

1316
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:10,950
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1317
01:12:11,034 --> 01:12:13,703
The Eye are the keepers of real magic

1318
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:16,664
and the protectors of those who practice it.

1319
01:12:16,748 --> 01:12:18,708
Candidates for initiations

1320
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,919
must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience.

1321
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:26,173
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1322
01:12:26,591 --> 01:12:28,175
May I?

1323
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:34,015
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1324
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:37,768
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

1325
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,061
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1326
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:44,150
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1327
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,569
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1328
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,154
It's probably just a myth.

1329
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,241
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1330
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,910
- You don't say?
- No.

1331
01:12:56,288 --> 01:13:00,916
I believe that some things are only discovered

1332
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:05,379
if you take certain leaps.

1333
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:13,888
Well, I gotta get to...

1334
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,514
Yeah. Yeah.

1335
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,767
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1336
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,643
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1337
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,482
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1338
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,942
Shit.

1339
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,653
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1340
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,698
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1341
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:37,495
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1342
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,871
A bug.

1343
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:42,792
Someone has heard every call, read every text.

1344
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:44,210
That's how they were able to stay ahead of us.

1345
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,086
God damn it!

1346
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,339
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1347
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,841
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1348
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:53,052
Picture's up.

1349
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,262
Okay, fast forward.

1350
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,098
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1351
01:13:57,891 --> 01:13:59,683
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1352
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,602
Play it through.

1353
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,022
Ah! Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1354
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,274
There. That's where he took my phone.

1355
01:14:08,568 --> 01:14:09,860
Is that thing transmitting?

1356
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,362
Only when you're making a call
or sending a text.

1357
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,488
Plus I removed the bug.

1358
01:14:12,572 --> 01:14:14,115
All right.
Put it back in and turn on the phone.

1359
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:16,158
They don't know that we know about the bug.

1360
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,369
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1361
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:20,538
We need to keep it that way.
Understand?

1362
01:14:20,997 --> 01:14:22,289
Find my real phone and track it.

1363
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:25,418
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1364
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,002
Good.

1365
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,172
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.
They got power? Cut it.

1366
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:33,759
They got phones, electricity, water?
Cut it.

1367
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,720
Squeeze 'em out.
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1368
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,389
And get me an airplane!

1369
01:14:41,184 --> 01:14:42,268
The firewall's down.

1370
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:43,811
- Do they know about this?
- They who?

1371
01:14:43,895 --> 01:14:45,813
They, them, whoever we're working for.

1372
01:14:45,897 --> 01:14:49,525
Who are we working for?
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1373
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:51,819
- Stop being paranoid.
- It really does happen.

1374
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:53,737
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1375
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,406
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1376
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,782
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1377
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,659
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about wanting

1378
01:14:58,743 --> 01:14:59,743
to be treated like an adult.

1379
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,203
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1380
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,414
Stick to the plan.
Stay here and burn it all.

1381
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:17,678
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1382
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:18,846
I don't know what you would do
anywhere else.

1383
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,724
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1384
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,851
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1385
01:15:23,935 --> 01:15:26,312
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1386
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:28,355
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1387
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,566
Hey, guys. They're here.

1388
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,361
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1389
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:35,779
- No.
- What?

1390
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,323
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1391
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:38,616
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1392
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,910
- She stays.
- What? What?

1393
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,203
Stay in the car.

1394
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:45,664
Let's go.

1395
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:52,505
Okay. Let's do it.

1396
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:57,801
FBI!

1397
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,390
Ladies first.

1398
01:16:03,975 --> 01:16:05,267
Don't move!

1399
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,691
Tell me.

1400
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:14,360
Is my money being well-spent?

1401
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:16,904
Exceedingly well.

1402
01:16:18,698 --> 01:16:20,199
Now you tell me,

1403
01:16:20,992 --> 01:16:22,326
how do you like your Horsemen?

1404
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,787
Fricasseed or fried?

1405
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:25,913
Shredded.

1406
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,707
I'll tell the chef.

1407
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:45,284
Freeze!

1408
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,626
Dylan!

1409
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:55,586
Hold on!

1410
01:17:57,922 --> 01:17:58,964
Oh, you little...

1411
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,470
Come here!

1412
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:08,140
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1413
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:10,351
- You little shit!
- You little shit!

1414
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,728
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1415
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:15,147
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1416
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:17,274
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1417
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,860
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1418
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:21,862
Hey!

1419
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:24,865
Come here!

1420
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,022
Come here!

1421
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:58,816
All right, whoa, hold on, hold on!

1422
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:02,569
- Really?
- Yup.

1423
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:07,741
Oh, you...

1424
01:19:11,162 --> 01:19:12,621
You little...

1425
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:30,097
Shit!

1426
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:49,533
Shit!

1427
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:51,952
Give me that!

1428
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,772
All units, cover the north exit now!

1429
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:20,939
Clear on Evan.

1430
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,025
Block every possible exit.

1431
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,276
Hey! Get back... Shit.

1432
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:28,155
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1433
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:29,239
What?

1434
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,993
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

1435
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,621
In Jack's bowl are ping pong balls
with section numbers.

1436
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,831
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

1437
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,416
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

1438
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,376
Where is Section B?

1439
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:43,921
Okay. There.
It's gonna be one of you guys. Get ready.

1440
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,756
I don't know why everybody's happy.

1441
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,882
It's only them.

1442
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,509
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

1443
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,554
Stop! Stop!

1444
01:21:08,696 --> 01:21:09,738
Hey!

1445
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:40,519
Good. Follow him!

1446
01:21:40,603 --> 01:21:42,688
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1447
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:44,106
I didn't have tactical command.

1448
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,525
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1449
01:21:46,609 --> 01:21:48,193
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

1450
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,362
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1451
01:21:50,446 --> 01:21:52,030
No!

1452
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:54,324
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1453
01:22:01,749 --> 01:22:04,293
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1454
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:06,211
I don't know.
She just took some guy's car.

1455
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:07,754
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1456
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:08,880
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1457
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,424
Let's go.

1458
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:36,992
There he is!

1459
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:49,796
Move!

1460
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:55,218
Left!

1461
01:22:57,513 --> 01:22:59,056
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1462
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:01,183
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1463
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,310
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

1464
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:05,479
We're coming
to you live above the FDR,

1465
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:08,482
where NYPD and federal agents,
as you now see,

1466
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:11,902
are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,
following a black sedan.

1467
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,033
Fuller, where are you?

1468
01:23:18,534 --> 01:23:20,202
Right here.
Trying to catch up to you now.

1469
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,412
We're now trying
to get you a better shot.

1470
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,041
Come on!

1471
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,425
Sorry.

1472
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:44,851
It looks like they're turning
onto the 59th Street Bridge.

1473
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:51,024
As soon as we have them within range,
we will bring you those pictures live.

1474
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:57,239
Good. Just stay with him.

1475
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:05,872
Go, go, go!

1476
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:11,420
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1477
01:24:15,007 --> 01:24:16,091
Get over!

1478
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:20,679
Oh, shit!

1479
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,245
Come here!

1480
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:47,956
Get back! Get back!

1481
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,751
Dylan, let's go, man!

1482
01:24:50,918 --> 01:24:51,960
Come on, you...

1483
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,505
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1484
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,925
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!
Let's go! Leave him!

1485
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,140
- The paper!
- Dylan!

1486
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,309
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1487
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,669
Today,
the unfolding story of a popular

1488
01:25:34,837 --> 01:25:36,880
and controversial group of magicians,

1489
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:38,965
who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,

1490
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:42,385
took a dark turn
when a police action that began in Chinatown

1491
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,264
developed into a dramatic, high-speed chase
across the 59th Street Bridge,

1492
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,309
which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,

1493
01:25:49,393 --> 01:25:51,686
one of the so-called Four Horsemen.

1494
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:56,983
The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.

1495
01:26:01,864 --> 01:26:04,407
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1496
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:05,700
So they know what it is?

1497
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,536
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1498
01:26:07,703 --> 01:26:09,246
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1499
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:10,497
Let's go.

1500
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,415
You're gonna wanna take this first though.

1501
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,458
What's that?

1502
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,252
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1503
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:17,379
Rhodes.

1504
01:26:17,713 --> 01:26:19,297
You do understand the function

1505
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,550
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1506
01:26:21,884 --> 01:26:24,553
Yeah, she's there to distract them
while he sets up the trick.

1507
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:25,953
I'm going to go with her.

1508
01:26:26,163 --> 01:26:27,371
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1509
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:29,915
Go ahead!

1510
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,542
That's on you, Fuller.

1511
01:26:47,184 --> 01:26:51,187
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1512
01:27:02,366 --> 01:27:03,407
Daniel?

1513
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:06,845
You'd be right
if you weren't so wrong.

1514
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:08,972
While you're watching the magician,

1515
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,225
that lovely innocent is actually
pulling the strings.

1516
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,395
Don't you find it peculiar that Interpol
would send you

1517
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:18,982
a first timer off the desk to be your assistant?

1518
01:27:19,483 --> 01:27:21,651
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1519
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:23,945
She was assigned to the case.

1520
01:27:24,947 --> 01:27:26,323
Luck of the draw.

1521
01:27:26,782 --> 01:27:29,826
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1522
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:33,580
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1523
01:27:33,664 --> 01:27:34,831
What's in it for you?

1524
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:36,833
Just trying to even the game.

1525
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:40,962
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1526
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:45,967
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1527
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:50,847
Hey.

1528
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:52,390
We got a problem.

1529
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:54,643
Here's the safe.

1530
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:57,520
No, no, no. Hey. What's he doing here?

1531
01:27:57,688 --> 01:27:59,147
Giving us our first solid lead.

1532
01:27:59,231 --> 01:28:02,317
We've been investigating a private security
contractor called Elkhorn

1533
01:28:02,401 --> 01:28:04,069
- for the last five years.
- And?

1534
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:06,279
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1535
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,865
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1536
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:11,451
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1537
01:28:11,535 --> 01:28:14,037
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1538
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:16,122
The magician
who died on the bridge...

1539
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:19,834
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1540
01:28:20,127 --> 01:28:22,462
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1541
01:28:22,546 --> 01:28:24,297
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1542
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,548
How did they get the file?

1543
01:28:27,009 --> 01:28:30,011
This is the part you're gonna find
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1544
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:34,933
They patched to my server after they accessed
your mobile command center in New Orleans

1545
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:36,601
with codes they got from your phone.

1546
01:28:38,729 --> 01:28:40,563
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1547
01:28:41,023 --> 01:28:43,483
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1548
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:45,568
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1549
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:48,530
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1550
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:51,866
Boss, he's taking over?

1551
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,910
Let's go, gentlemen.

1552
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:56,746
Hey.

1553
01:28:56,872 --> 01:28:58,748
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1554
01:28:58,833 --> 01:28:59,958
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1555
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:02,419
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1556
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,587
People say I'm hard to read.
That's an American expression.

1557
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:05,922
Do you understand it?

1558
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,090
Yes.

1559
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:09,217
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1560
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:13,221
If I find out that you are anything other than
who you say you are, I swear...

1561
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:15,056
And we French also have an expression.

1562
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,518
Faith can move mountains.

1563
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:22,355
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1564
01:29:22,565 --> 01:29:24,566
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1565
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:27,360
I just got my ass handed to me.

1566
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:28,987
I am losing this case.

1567
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:32,407
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1568
01:29:38,622 --> 01:29:40,832
More than anything in his life,

1569
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:46,337
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1570
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:47,797
And I can't say he achieved it,

1571
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:51,801
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1572
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:55,930
But the point is... Sorry.

1573
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:57,474
The point is...

1574
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:03,772
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

1575
01:30:03,856 --> 01:30:06,357
We've started something bigger than all of us.

1576
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:08,276
We have to finish it.

1577
01:30:17,369 --> 01:30:18,453
Approaching the warehouse.

1578
01:30:18,621 --> 01:30:21,164
Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.

1579
01:30:21,415 --> 01:30:22,665
We are going for the vault.

1580
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,423
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1581
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:35,595
What is this?

1582
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:36,971
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1583
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:38,932
We just moved it while you were outside.

1584
01:30:39,099 --> 01:30:40,266
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1585
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,392
I never said that.

1586
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:44,437
Sir, you got a phone call
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1587
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:46,689
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1588
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:47,315
What happened?

1589
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:49,859
What happened? You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1590
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,319
No!

1591
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:58,701
Jesus Christ.

1592
01:30:58,869 --> 01:31:01,871
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1593
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:03,790
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1594
01:31:03,874 --> 01:31:06,042
- Where's the safe?
- His team is loading the truck.

1595
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,048
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1596
01:31:13,592 --> 01:31:14,759
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1597
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:17,178
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1598
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,439
What the hell's going on? We got our orders.

1599
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:30,024
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1600
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:35,697
Okay. Here's what I want.

1601
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:38,366
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1602
01:31:38,742 --> 01:31:41,869
So we stay with it.
We follow it all the way to... Where's it going?

1603
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:43,204
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1604
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:46,416
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1605
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,709
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1606
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:49,794
You two are with me.

1607
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:03,558
Guys...

1608
01:32:04,643 --> 01:32:07,061
Look. Office just called with this.

1609
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:09,188
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1610
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:13,234
The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...

1611
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,111
We cannot quit now.

1612
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:19,282
We've started something bigger than all of us.
We have to finish it.

1613
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:22,201
Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,

1614
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:24,078
5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.

1615
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:26,706
Their show is in a half an hour.
It's exactly where we're headed.

1616
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,208
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1617
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:31,210
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1618
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:33,921
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1619
01:32:36,508 --> 01:32:38,676
A stunning
turnout here in 5 Pointz

1620
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:42,055
as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.

1621
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:44,057
The Horsemen have
invited us to their final round

1622
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:46,309
of their three-act face-off with the FBI.

1623
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:50,188
What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.

1624
01:33:01,533 --> 01:33:03,743
All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.

1625
01:33:03,827 --> 01:33:04,827
Copy that.

1626
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:23,179
Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1627
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:24,889
Go, for us.

1628
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:27,517
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1629
01:33:27,726 --> 01:33:28,851
It's a woman.

1630
01:33:33,023 --> 01:33:34,399
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1631
01:33:35,984 --> 01:33:37,485
What the hell's going on?

1632
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:40,863
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1633
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:41,989
Put your guns down.

1634
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:44,951
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1635
01:33:45,035 --> 01:33:48,246
Are you kidding?
I'm following them, just like you are.

1636
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:51,499
I'm not following anybody anymore.
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1637
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:53,209
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1638
01:33:53,544 --> 01:33:55,211
Your ass is mine.

1639
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:57,046
You guys are still idiots.

1640
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,382
- Yeah?
- This happens to be the former

1641
01:33:59,466 --> 01:34:01,551
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1642
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,053
It's where I did my first show.

1643
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:07,056
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1644
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:08,516
why not open it?

1645
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:10,518
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1646
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:14,605
would you mind reenacting your look
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1647
01:34:14,857 --> 01:34:16,941
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1648
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:19,402
Open the safe.

1649
01:34:19,486 --> 01:34:20,528
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1650
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:26,242
What the hell?

1651
01:34:28,787 --> 01:34:29,871
What?

1652
01:34:30,122 --> 01:34:33,583
Give me that. No. No!

1653
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,297
What is this?

1654
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:41,299
Get back!

1655
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,975
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1656
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:54,103
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1657
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:58,649
Once again, misdirection.

1658
01:35:05,616 --> 01:35:07,116
The show is starting. Move out!

1659
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:09,786
The question I'd be asking now,
Agent Rhodes is...

1660
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:12,455
What happened to the real one?

1661
01:35:33,101 --> 01:35:34,852
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1662
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:36,479
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1663
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,816
FBI! Give me a path!

1664
01:35:40,442 --> 01:35:42,026
Clear out! Clear out!

1665
01:35:42,277 --> 01:35:43,653
What is magic?

1666
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:45,530
Magic is deception.

1667
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:49,158
But deception designed to delight,
to entertain, to inspire.

1668
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,702
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1669
01:35:52,162 --> 01:35:53,287
It is about belief.

1670
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:54,372
Faith.

1671
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:55,456
Trust.

1672
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:00,837
Without those qualities,

1673
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:04,382
magic, as an art form, would no longer exist.

1674
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:09,095
But what happens if these qualities
are not used for their higher purpose?

1675
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:11,848
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1676
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:14,141
For personal gain or for greed.

1677
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,310
Then it's no longer magic.

1678
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:17,478
It's crime.

1679
01:36:17,688 --> 01:36:23,818
So tonight, for our final act,
you're gonna help us set a few things right.

1680
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:28,906
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1681
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:30,324
I don't know.

1682
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:32,577
Showtime.

1683
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:38,749
Look!

1684
01:36:43,046 --> 01:36:44,964
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1685
01:36:45,048 --> 01:36:46,382
Go, go, go!

1686
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:48,384
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1687
01:36:49,845 --> 01:36:50,803
What are you doing here?

1688
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:53,431
They're going in the wrong direction
and you know it.

1689
01:36:53,765 --> 01:36:55,975
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1690
01:36:56,059 --> 01:36:59,395
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1691
01:37:00,355 --> 01:37:01,397
Wait.

1692
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:03,524
Yeah?

1693
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:08,112
As our, let's call it, year of living dangerously

1694
01:37:08,196 --> 01:37:11,741
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1695
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:16,537
I'd like to express a sentiment
to you about our relationship.

1696
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:17,663
Okay.

1697
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:21,500
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a...

1698
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:25,254
dick.

1699
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:26,714
And?

1700
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:30,384
No, that's it.

1701
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:31,594
That's very nice.

1702
01:37:31,678 --> 01:37:33,095
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1703
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:34,764
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1704
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,515
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1705
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,642
Oh, you!

1706
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,022
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1707
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:46,150
We're on our own.
Our instructions run out after the show.

1708
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:50,488
Even if there is no Eye,
if we were completely played and we spend

1709
01:37:50,572 --> 01:37:55,076
the next 20 years in jail, then,
I just want to say that...

1710
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:57,703
I know. Me too.

1711
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,998
Little too sentimental for me.

1712
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:09,006
There they are!

1713
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:14,720
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1714
01:38:14,888 --> 01:38:15,888
Grab 'em!

1715
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:21,936
Get up!

1716
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:23,562
What the hell?

1717
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:28,526
Ah, shit!

1718
01:38:37,744 --> 01:38:39,245
Hello, New York!

1719
01:38:47,462 --> 01:38:49,338
Thank you for the magic.

1720
01:38:49,589 --> 01:38:53,801
And thank you for being such
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1721
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:58,097
Unfortunately, like all good things,
it must come to an end.

1722
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:02,977
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1723
01:39:03,395 --> 01:39:04,937
By saying goodbye.

1724
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:09,483
All we wanted was to
bring the world to a magic show.

1725
01:39:09,568 --> 01:39:12,111
And thereby bring a little magic
back to the world.

1726
01:39:16,491 --> 01:39:17,616
Clear the way!

1727
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:30,629
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1728
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:33,466
But it's time for us to disappear.

1729
01:39:33,675 --> 01:39:35,009
Good night, New York.

1730
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,635
And thank you for believing in us.

1731
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,473
Stop!

1732
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:44,977
Freeze!

1733
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:47,021
No!

1734
01:40:04,664 --> 01:40:05,956
God damn it!

1735
01:40:34,569 --> 01:40:35,778
I'm sorry.

1736
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:38,531
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1737
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:43,619
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1738
01:40:45,914 --> 01:40:47,665
So I guess this is it.

1739
01:40:49,584 --> 01:40:50,751
Is it?

1740
01:41:16,736 --> 01:41:18,028
Dylan!

1741
01:41:18,446 --> 01:41:20,698
Dylan! Dylan!

1742
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:22,032
Hey.

1743
01:41:23,451 --> 01:41:25,369
- You see that?
- What?

1744
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,416
Where's the real money?

1745
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:50,603
You're under arrest!
Hands in the air! Now!

1746
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:57,860
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

1747
01:41:57,986 --> 01:41:59,361
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

1748
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,531
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

1749
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:06,452
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

1750
01:42:06,536 --> 01:42:10,414
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

1751
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:14,043
This other guy, Maximillian...

1752
01:42:14,252 --> 01:42:17,254
I am not interested
in a history lesson on magic at this moment.

1753
01:43:06,262 --> 01:43:07,388
I've been framed.

1754
01:43:08,723 --> 01:43:11,266
- I'm sure you were.
- Yeah, but I can prove it.

1755
01:43:11,601 --> 01:43:12,893
I always do.

1756
01:43:13,269 --> 01:43:15,229
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1757
01:43:15,313 --> 01:43:17,815
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1758
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:20,234
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1759
01:43:20,443 --> 01:43:22,903
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1760
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:24,113
Sure.

1761
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:30,869
All right.

1762
01:43:31,913 --> 01:43:33,539
I got information to trade.

1763
01:43:33,623 --> 01:43:34,748
I believe that's how it's done.

1764
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,458
If it's of some value.

1765
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:42,297
These bars give a man time to think.

1766
01:43:43,466 --> 01:43:46,760
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1767
01:43:47,429 --> 01:43:49,513
Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?

1768
01:43:50,473 --> 01:43:52,307
The box was never empty.

1769
01:43:54,686 --> 01:43:55,853
The room wasn't either.

1770
01:43:57,272 --> 01:43:59,648
After gaining access to the warehouse,

1771
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:01,942
The Horsemen left the real safe

1772
01:44:02,027 --> 01:44:06,989
and transformed the whole room
into a giant rabbit box.

1773
01:44:08,616 --> 01:44:13,454
You go charging in there,
thinking the safe was already gone.

1774
01:44:13,663 --> 01:44:14,663
Hey!

1775
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:16,040
Hey! Stop!

1776
01:44:16,249 --> 01:44:17,499
Missing the trick. Again.

1777
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:20,753
Which was to make you think
the safe had already been stolen,

1778
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:22,921
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1779
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:26,425
Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,

1780
01:44:26,634 --> 01:44:29,219
someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1781
01:44:47,739 --> 01:44:48,906
Who?

1782
01:44:50,325 --> 01:44:51,825
Jack Wilder.

1783
01:44:52,577 --> 01:44:53,911
Holy shit.

1784
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,497
No. No way. He died right in front of my eyes.

1785
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,374
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1786
01:45:06,716 --> 01:45:08,008
It's locked.

1787
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:10,010
Weren't you listening?

1788
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:11,553
Nothing's ever locked.

1789
01:45:12,972 --> 01:45:15,557
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1790
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:17,601
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1791
01:45:17,685 --> 01:45:20,062
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1792
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:25,442
Led you to the bridge.

1793
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:29,321
Where the other Horsemen were waiting
with an identical replacement car.

1794
01:45:30,323 --> 01:45:32,407
It only took a split second
for you to lose contact with it

1795
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,492
and make the switch.

1796
01:45:55,807 --> 01:45:58,809
When you crawled
into that burning car,

1797
01:45:59,185 --> 01:46:01,186
quite heroically, I might add,

1798
01:46:03,064 --> 01:46:05,149
you almost died trying to rescue

1799
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:08,235
what I assume was a cadaver
from the morgue.

1800
01:46:09,737 --> 01:46:13,407
Why go through such an elaborate
and dangerous plan

1801
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:16,493
- just to frame one guy?
- I don't know.

1802
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:18,579
They never kept any of the money they took.

1803
01:46:18,663 --> 01:46:21,039
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1804
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:23,709
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1805
01:46:23,793 --> 01:46:25,669
- No. Not really.
- What?

1806
01:46:25,753 --> 01:46:30,090
I finally got a chance to really look into
Lionel Shrike.

1807
01:46:30,508 --> 01:46:33,343
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1808
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:37,806
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1809
01:46:38,057 --> 01:46:39,266
Tressler Insurance.

1810
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:43,437
The bank that carried the note?

1811
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,064
Credit Republican of Paris.

1812
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:47,733
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1813
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,652
What do you make of that?

1814
01:46:50,862 --> 01:46:52,821
A sucker is born every minute.

1815
01:46:53,781 --> 01:46:59,036
What if all this was just leading up to us
getting mugged in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1816
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,288
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1817
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,291
- We just have to find...
- That?

1818
01:47:06,836 --> 01:47:08,587
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1819
01:47:09,339 --> 01:47:11,340
And the card encased in glass.

1820
01:47:13,384 --> 01:47:14,843
What do we do now?

1821
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:33,111
Oh, nice!

1822
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:50,545
So, here's my new theory.

1823
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,341
The legend is that the Eye is everywhere.

1824
01:47:55,009 --> 01:47:56,176
Waiting

1825
01:47:56,552 --> 01:48:00,347
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1826
01:48:01,307 --> 01:48:03,058
from the mediocre ones.

1827
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,060
Maybe that was you.

1828
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:08,021
Deep down inside you wanted nothing more

1829
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:10,482
than to be part of the Eye,
but you were never invited.

1830
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:13,902
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1831
01:48:14,445 --> 01:48:15,904
You pissed them off.

1832
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:20,659
The Eye isn't real.

1833
01:48:20,743 --> 01:48:23,829
Okay, then explain then.
Who's behind all this.

1834
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:25,872
Somebody with an obsession.

1835
01:48:25,957 --> 01:48:27,124
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1836
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:30,377
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1837
01:48:30,461 --> 01:48:34,673
Somebody so prepared to lose
that they wouldn't even be a suspect

1838
01:48:34,757 --> 01:48:35,799
until the trick was done.

1839
01:48:35,883 --> 01:48:38,593
I don't want a profile. I need a name.
Who? Who?

1840
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:40,387
I don't know who.

1841
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:44,349
But they had to have access to the warehouse
to plant the mirrors.

1842
01:48:45,768 --> 01:48:49,688
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1843
01:48:49,772 --> 01:48:53,025
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1844
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:55,444
Almost as if they were on the in...

1845
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:10,042
The inside.

1846
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,723
You.

1847
01:49:27,977 --> 01:49:29,144
Why?

1848
01:49:29,812 --> 01:49:31,938
That is the question, isn't it?

1849
01:49:32,982 --> 01:49:34,066
You're right.

1850
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:39,571
I can't tell you how long I've waited
to see the look on your face.

1851
01:49:42,033 --> 01:49:43,367
Who are you?

1852
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:45,994
What do you want from me?

1853
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:48,372
What do I want?

1854
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:51,708
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1855
01:49:51,793 --> 01:49:55,796
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1856
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:59,591
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1857
01:50:00,134 --> 01:50:02,552
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1858
01:50:02,637 --> 01:50:04,971
when you were always two steps behind.

1859
01:50:10,019 --> 01:50:11,144
Dylan?

1860
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:13,230
Wait a minute.

1861
01:50:14,273 --> 01:50:16,191
Dylan! How did this happen?

1862
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:25,742
Dylan!

1863
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:26,910
Why?

1864
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:28,370
Why?

1865
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:34,751
Oh, my God.

1866
01:50:35,795 --> 01:50:38,964
I did not see that coming.
That's impossible!

1867
01:50:39,048 --> 01:50:40,090
No way.

1868
01:50:40,174 --> 01:50:42,592
That was actually pretty good.

1869
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,052
Thank you.

1870
01:50:44,512 --> 01:50:46,805
When I said,
always be the smartest guy in the room.

1871
01:50:46,889 --> 01:50:47,848
We were in agreement.

1872
01:50:47,932 --> 01:50:48,974
Okay. Right.

1873
01:50:49,642 --> 01:50:50,642
Henley.

1874
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:53,103
I've never seen her speechless.

1875
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:54,938
I take that as a huge compliment.

1876
01:50:55,648 --> 01:50:58,316
Hey, man, I'm so sorry for kicking your ass.
Really.

1877
01:50:59,152 --> 01:51:04,364
Hey, listen, for the record,
I have always been a 100% believer.

1878
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:07,701
And the amount of energy I have expended
to keep these infidels on point...

1879
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:11,037
Merritt, you're in.

1880
01:51:11,873 --> 01:51:12,914
God bless.

1881
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,082
Come.

1882
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:20,213
The real magic is taking four strong solo acts
and making them all work together.

1883
01:51:20,298 --> 01:51:22,466
And that's exactly what you did.

1884
01:51:23,885 --> 01:51:24,926
So welcome.

1885
01:51:28,264 --> 01:51:30,348
Welcome to the Eye.

1886
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,000
It was all connected.

1887
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:43,255
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

1888
01:52:45,424 --> 01:52:46,550
Bonjour.

1889
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:49,511
Bonjour.

1890
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,976
And Elkhorn?
What's the connection to Shrike?

1891
01:52:58,563 --> 01:53:04,109
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.
They used cheap steel.

1892
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:06,736
They cut corners.

1893
01:53:07,071 --> 01:53:10,198
When he got to the bottom of the river,
the safe warped.

1894
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:11,658
And he was trapped.

1895
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:14,911
He was your father.

1896
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:20,166
The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.

1897
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:26,214
When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.

1898
01:53:28,509 --> 01:53:33,638
So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.

1899
01:53:34,807 --> 01:53:37,475
I have never let his watch stop since then.

1900
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,686
And from that moment on,

1901
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:42,355
I created a persona.

1902
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:44,858
I planned. I worked out every detail.

1903
01:53:44,942 --> 01:53:48,236
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

1904
01:53:48,696 --> 01:53:49,863
was you.

1905
01:53:51,532 --> 01:53:54,492
And I know that the logical conclusion for you

1906
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:57,704
is to take this case to its resolution.

1907
01:53:57,788 --> 01:54:00,874
And for you to turn me in.

1908
01:54:05,963 --> 01:54:07,047
Yeah.

1909
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:12,844
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

1910
01:54:14,221 --> 01:54:15,555
And you also know

1911
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:20,727
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

1912
01:54:27,234 --> 01:54:28,943
One more secret to lock away.

1913
01:54:41,082 --> 01:54:42,082
Come here!

1914
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:44,793
Get back! Get back!

1915
01:54:46,253 --> 01:54:47,587
Dylan, let's go, man!

1916
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:48,797
Come on, you...

1917
01:54:50,257 --> 01:54:52,342
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1918
01:54:52,426 --> 01:54:55,762
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!
Let's go! Leave him!

1919
01:55:00,601 --> 01:55:01,976
- The paper!
- Dylan!

1920
01:55:02,228 --> 01:55:04,145
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1921
01:56:53,088 --> 01:56:54,964
Please, stop, stop, stop.

1922
01:56:55,382 --> 01:56:59,052
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

1923
01:57:00,054 --> 01:57:01,554
Oh, thank God.

1924
01:57:03,474 --> 01:57:05,558
Where are we?

1925
01:57:05,643 --> 01:57:08,061
Great, another shit hole.

1926
01:57:08,145 --> 01:57:10,104
Okay, feeling it.

1927
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:14,359
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

1928
01:57:15,402 --> 01:57:17,237
Check out this place.

1929
01:57:17,321 --> 01:57:18,655
Where'd you bring us?

1930
01:57:18,781 --> 01:57:20,156
Was there no landfill where we were?

1931
01:57:20,241 --> 01:57:22,075
This place is awesome.

1932
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:25,328
- Is this our new gear?
- There'd better not be, like,

1933
01:57:25,412 --> 01:57:27,372
matching jumpsuits in there.
You know I don't wear spandex.

1934
01:57:27,456 --> 01:57:28,581
It's locked.

1935
01:57:28,749 --> 01:57:29,833
Guys, the cards.

1936
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:31,125
What card?

1937
01:57:31,252 --> 01:57:32,460
What do you mean, what card?

1938
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:37,590
Okay.
