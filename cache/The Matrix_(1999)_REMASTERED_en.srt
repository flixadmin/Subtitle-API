1
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,761
<i>- Is everything in place?
- You weren't suppose to relieve me.</i>

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

3
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,708
<i>You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.</i>

4
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:02,948
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand that?</i>

5
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,522
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,732
<i>Do you?</i>

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,734
<i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

8
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,611
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

9
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,947
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

10
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,782
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,034
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

12
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,827
<i>I better go.</i>

13
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,575
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

14
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,202
Do it! Do it now!

15
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,226
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

16
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,272
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

17
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,232
I'm just doing my job.

18
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:35,279
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

19
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,240
The orders were for your protection.

20
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,952
I think we can handle one little girl.

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,834
I sent two units!

22
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,669
They're bringing her down now!

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,048
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

24
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,203
Shit.

25
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,208
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

26
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,085
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

27
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,575
<i>There's no time.
You're gonna have to get to another exit.</i>

28
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,131
- Are there any agents?
- Yes.

29
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,508
Goddamn it.

30
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,301
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

31
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,929
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

32
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,972
<i>You can make it.</i>

33
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,891
- All right.
<i>- Go.</i>

34
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,079
That's impossible.

35
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,074
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

36
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,951
Get up.

37
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,332
She got out.

38
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,917
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,337
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

40
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,256
We have the name of their next target.

41
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,174
The name is Neo.

42
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,971
We'll need a search running.

43
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,181
It has already begun.

44
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,154
What?

45
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,411
What the hell?

46
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,004
"Follow the white rabbit."

47
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,017
Who is it?

48
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,560
It's Choi.

49
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,525
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,241
You're two hours late.

51
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,577
I know. It's her fault.

52
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,828
You got the money?

53
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,123
Two grand.

54
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,125
Hold on.

55
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,186
Hallelujah.

56
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:42,928
You're my savior, man.

57
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:46,068
- My own personal Jesus Christ.
- You get caught using that...

58
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:49,148
Yeah, I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

59
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,030
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

60
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,324
You look a little whiter than usual.

61
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,619
My computer, it...

62
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:05,548
You ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

63
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:08,848
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

64
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,341
It's the only way to fly.

65
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,958
Look, it just sounds to me like,
you know, you need to unplug, man.

66
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,472
You know, get some R and R?

67
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,643
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

68
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,855
Definitely.

69
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,191
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

70
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,943
Come on.

71
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,821
It'll be fun. I promise.

72
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,829
Yeah.

73
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,498
Sure. I'll go.

74
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,194
Hello, Neo.

75
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,696
How do you know that name?

76
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,240
I know a lot about you.

77
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,202
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

78
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,370
Trinity.

79
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,165
The Trinity?

80
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,334
That cracked the lRS D-base?

81
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,044
That was a long time ago.

82
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,213
- Jesus.
- What?

83
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,465
I just thought...

84
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,384
you were a guy.

85
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,094
Most guys do.

86
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,515
That was you on my computer.

87
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,225
How did you do that?

88
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,603
Right now, all I can tell you...

89
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,772
is that you're in danger.

90
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,650
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

91
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,902
They're watching you, Neo.

92
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,905
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

93
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,244
I know why you're here, Neo.

94
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,996
I know what you've been doing.

95
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,123
I know why you hardly sleep...

96
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,544
why you live alone and why,
night after night...

97
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,129
you sit at your computer.

98
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,841
You're looking for him.

99
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,636
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

100
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,264
And when he found me...

101
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,976
he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

102
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,645
I was looking for an answer.

103
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,399
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

104
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,735
It's the question
that brought you here.

105
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,197
You know the question...

106
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,949
just as I did.

107
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,119
What is the Matrix?

108
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,830
The answer is out there, Neo.

109
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,499
It's looking for you.

110
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,960
And it will find you...

111
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,254
if you want it to.

112
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,012
Shit.

113
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,388
Shit, shit.

114
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,484
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

115
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,780
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

116
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,491
Obviously, you are mistaken.

117
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,331
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

118
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,959
because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

119
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,839
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

120
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,303
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

121
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,058
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

122
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,269
or you choose to find another job.

123
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,480
Do I make myself clear?

124
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,149
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

125
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,492
Thomas Anderson?

126
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,162
Yeah, that's me.

127
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,164
Okay.

128
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,338
Great.

129
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,924
Have a nice day.

130
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,440
Hello?

131
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,069
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

132
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,073
- Morpheus.
<i>- Yes.</i>

133
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,325
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

134
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,745
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.</i>

135
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,165
<i>But unfortunately, you and l
have run out of time.</i>

136
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,128
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.</i>

137
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,713
Who's coming for me?

138
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,048
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

139
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,800
What? Right now?

140
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,594
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

141
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,347
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

142
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,974
<i>The elevator.</i>

143
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,647
- Oh, shit!
<i>- Yes.</i>

144
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,403
What do they want?

145
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,393
<i>I don't know.</i>

146
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,906
<i>If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.</i>

147
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,116
How?

148
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,494
<i>I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

149
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,372
- Okay.
<i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

150
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,627
- But what if the y--
<i>- Go. Now.</i>

151
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,762
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

152
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,730
<i>When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...</i>

153
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,940
<i>to the office
at the end of the hall.</i>

154
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,568
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

155
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,988
<i>Go. Now.</i>

156
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,923
<i>Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.</i>

157
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,969
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

158
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,056
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

159
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,851
<i>Open it.</i>

160
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,479
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

161
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,315
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

162
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,943
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

163
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,988
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

164
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,450
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

165
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,789
This is insane!

166
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,834
Why is this happening to me?

167
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,752
What'd I do?

168
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

169
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,924
I'm gonna die.

170
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,768
Shit!

171
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,165
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,921
I can't do this.

173
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,602
Shit.

174
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,697
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

175
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,660
It seems that you've been living...

176
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,037
two lives.

177
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,958
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

178
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,544
program writer for
a respectable software company.

179
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,882
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

180
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,592
And you...

181
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,806
help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

182
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,436
The other life is lived in computers...

183
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,690
where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

184
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,736
and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

185
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,990
One of these lives...

186
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,075
has a future.

187
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,411
And one of them does not.

188
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,960
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

189
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,296
You're here...

190
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,881
because we need your help.

191
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,513
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

192
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,557
individual.

193
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,520
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

194
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,525
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

195
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,194
He is considered by many authorities...

196
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,489
to be the most dangerous man alive.

197
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,410
My colleagues...

198
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,788
believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

199
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,500
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

200
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,296
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

201
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,798
give you a fresh start.

202
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,218
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

203
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,972
in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

204
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah.

205
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,978
That sounds like a really good deal.

206
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,357
But I got a better one.

207
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,108
How about...

208
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,527
I give you the finger...

209
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,115
and you give me my phone call.

210
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,161
Mr. Anderson...

211
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,375
you disappoint me.

212
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,252
You can't scare me
with this Gestapo crap.

213
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,879
I know my rights.

214
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,631
I want my phone call.

215
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,384
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

216
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,677
what good is a phone call...

217
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,515
if you're unable to speak?

218
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,509
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

219
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,178
whether you want to or not.

220
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,865
<i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

221
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:10,411
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

222
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,497
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

223
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,749
<i>you would probably be dead.</i>

224
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,462
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

225
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:24,550
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

226
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,762
<i>looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

227
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,514
<i>looking for you.</i>

228
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,226
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

229
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,063
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

230
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,491
Get in.

231
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,587
What's this?

232
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,382
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

233
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,801
- From what?
- From you.

234
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,804
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

235
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,138
Stop the car.

236
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,894
Listen, coppertop.

237
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,146
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

238
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,024
Right now, there's only one rule:

239
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,651
Our way...

240
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,069
or the highway.

241
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,702
Fine.

242
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,039
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

243
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,251
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

244
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,211
You know that road.

245
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,839
You know exactly where it ends.

246
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,302
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

247
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,026
Apoc, lights.

248
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,697
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

249
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:14,168
- What is that thing?
- Think you're bugged.

250
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,085
Try and relax.

251
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,637
Come on.

252
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,389
It's on the move.

253
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,392
Come on, you shit.

254
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,480
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

255
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,731
Clear!

256
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,450
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

257
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,527
This is it.

258
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,324
Let me give you one piece of advice.

259
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,952
Be honest.

260
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,747
He knows more than you can imagine.

261
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,799
At last.

262
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,427
Welcome, Neo.

263
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,555
As you no doubt have guessed...

264
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,056
I am Morpheus.

265
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,684
It's an honor to meet you.

266
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,185
No...

267
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,062
the honor is mine.

268
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,482
Please, come. Sit.

269
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,207
I imagine...

270
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,377
that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

271
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,506
tumbling down the rabbit hole?

272
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,425
You could say that.

273
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,970
I can see it in your eyes.

274
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,849
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

275
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,351
because he's expecting to wake up.

276
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,355
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

277
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,442
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

278
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,693
No.

279
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,153
Why not?

280
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,198
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

281
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,619
I know exactly what you mean.

282
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,292
Let me tell you why you're here.

283
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,878
You know something.

284
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,047
What you know,
you can't explain.

285
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,132
But you feel it.

286
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,635
You felt it your entire life:

287
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,389
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

288
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,100
Like a splinter in your mind...

289
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,228
driving you mad.

290
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,898
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

291
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,277
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

292
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,447
The Matrix?

293
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,618
Do you want to know...

294
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,079
what it is?

295
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,333
The Matrix is everywhere.

296
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,293
It is all around us.

297
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,504
Even now, in this very room.

298
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,549
You can see it when you
look out your window...

299
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,134
or when you turn on your television.

300
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,096
You can feel it when you go to work...

301
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,307
when you go to church...

302
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,810
when you pay your taxes.

303
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,856
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

304
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,691
to blind you from the truth.

305
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,152
What truth?

306
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,950
That you are a slave.

307
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,745
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

308
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:31,667
born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

309
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,252
A prison...

310
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,628
for your mind.

311
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,971
Unfortunately, no one can be...

312
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,682
told what the Matrix is.

313
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,021
You have to see it for yourself.

314
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,824
This is your last chance.

315
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,410
After this, there is no turning back.

316
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,329
You take the blue pill...

317
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,707
the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

318
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,751
whatever you want to believe.

319
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,336
You take the red pill...

320
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,546
you stay in Wonderland...

321
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,758
and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

322
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,852
Remember...

323
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,731
all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

324
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,372
Follow me.

325
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,584
Apoc, are we on-line?

326
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,211
Almost.

327
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,591
Time is always against us.

328
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,468
Please take a seat there.

329
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,363
You did all this?

330
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,494
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

331
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,874
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

332
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,459
What does that mean?

333
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,212
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

334
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,880
because Kansas...

335
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,173
is going bye-bye.

336
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,463
Did you ...?

337
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,561
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

338
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,607
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

339
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,359
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

340
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,403
and the real world?

341
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,198
This can't be.

342
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,407
Be what?

343
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,618
Be real?

344
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,998
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

345
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,208
Still nothing.

346
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,001
It's cold.

347
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,628
It's cold!

348
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,175
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

349
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,346
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

350
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,056
Targeting almost there.

351
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,769
He's going into arrest.

352
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,522
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

353
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,866
Welcome...

354
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,119
to the real world.

355
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,372
We've done it, Trinity.

356
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,165
We found him.

357
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,210
- I hope you're right.
- You don't have to hope.

358
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,379
I know it.

359
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,593
Am I dead?

360
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,263
Far from it.

361
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,653
He still needs a lot of work.

362
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,281
What are you doing?

363
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,742
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

364
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,869
Why do my eyes hurt?

365
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,455
You've never used them before.

366
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,251
Rest, Neo.

367
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,170
The answers are coming.

368
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,329
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

369
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,039
What is this place?

370
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,959
More important than "what" is "when."

371
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,502
"When"?

372
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,754
You believe it's the year 1999...

373
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,257
when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

374
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,136
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

375
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,012
because we honestly don't know.

376
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,349
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

377
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,352
Come with me.
See for yourself.

378
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,646
This is my ship.

379
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,858
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.
It's a hovercraft.

380
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,446
This is the main deck.

381
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,453
This is the core...

382
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,709
where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

383
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,257
Most of my crew you already know.

384
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,680
This is Apoc...

385
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,807
Switch...

386
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,560
- and Cypher.
- Hi.

387
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,522
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

388
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,817
The little one behind you is Mouse.

389
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,408
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

390
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,660
Trinity.

391
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,266
Try to relax.

392
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,981
This will feel a little weird.

393
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,328
This...

394
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,205
is the Construct.

395
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,749
It's our loading program.

396
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,460
We can load anything, from clothing...

397
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,087
to equipment...

398
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,713
weapons...

399
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,174
training simulations...

400
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,094
anything we need.

401
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,307
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

402
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,518
Is it really so hard to believe?

403
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,646
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

404
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,941
Your hair has changed.

405
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,653
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

406
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,990
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

407
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,997
This isn't real?

408
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,790
What is "real"?

409
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,418
How do you define "real"?

410
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,628
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

411
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,298
what you can smell, taste and see...

412
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,427
then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

413
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,017
This is the world that you know.

414
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,479
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

415
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,194
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

416
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,696
that we call the Matrix.

417
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,037
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

418
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,164
This is the world...

419
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,207
as it exists today.

420
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,223
Welcome to "the desert...

421
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,684
of the real."

422
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,440
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

423
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:29,744
But what we know for certain is that at
some point in the early 21st century...

424
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:32,989
all of mankind was united
in celebration.

425
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,994
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

426
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,913
Al.

427
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,332
You mean artificial intelligence.

428
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,003
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

429
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,299
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

430
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,928
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

431
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:58,968
At the time, they were
dependent on solar power...

432
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,352
and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

433
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,189
without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

434
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,319
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

435
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,991
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

436
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,624
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

437
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:29,003
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

438
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,091
Combined with a form of fusion...

439
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:38,263
the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

440
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,062
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

441
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,566
where human beings
are no longer born.

442
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,110
We are grown.

443
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,744
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

444
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,663
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

445
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,624
watched them liquefy the dead...

446
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:10,211
so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

447
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:15,008
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

448
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,178
I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

449
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,599
What is the Matrix?

450
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,851
Control.

451
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,606
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

452
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,485
built to keep us under control...

453
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,822
in order to change a human being...

454
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,616
into this.

455
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,118
No.

456
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,330
I don't believe it.

457
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,915
It's not possible.

458
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,086
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

459
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,630
Stop!

460
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,381
Let me out!

461
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,009
Let me out! I want out!

462
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,639
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

463
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,557
Get this thing out of me!

464
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,852
Don't touch me!

465
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,729
Stay away from me!

466
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:15,318
I don't believe it.

467
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,612
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

468
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,072
Just breathe.

469
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,259
I can't go back, can I?

470
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,511
No.

471
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,555
But if you could...

472
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,890
would you really want to?

473
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,769
I owe you an apology.

474
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,729
We have a rule.

475
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,441
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

476
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,693
It's dangerous.

477
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,112
The mind has trouble letting go.

478
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,656
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

479
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,784
I did what I did because...

480
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,953
I had to.

481
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,465
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

482
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,761
who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

483
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,056
to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

484
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,270
It was he who freed the first of us...

485
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,772
taught us the truth.

486
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,319
As long as the Matrix exists...

487
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,738
the human race will never be free.

488
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,493
After he died...

489
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,955
the Oracle prophesied his return...

490
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,709
and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

491
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,628
end the war...

492
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,242
bring freedom to our people.

493
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:04,177
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

494
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,095
looking for him.

495
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,600
I did what I did because...

496
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,354
I believe that search is over.

497
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,860
Get some rest.

498
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,279
You're going to need it.

499
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,033
For what?

500
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,287
Your training.

501
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,307
Morning. Did you sleep?

502
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,393
You will tonight.

503
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,311
I guarantee it.

504
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,731
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

505
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,609
- You don't have any --
- Holes? Nope.

506
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,204
Me and my brother, Dozer...

507
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:07,467
we're both 100% pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.

508
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,700
Born free right here...

509
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,576
in the real world.

510
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,495
Genuine child of Zion.

511
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,790
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

512
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,542
Zion's where the party would be.

513
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,252
It's a city?

514
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,672
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

515
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,508
Where is it?

516
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,680
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

517
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,183
You live long enough,
you might see it.

518
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:41,274
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

519
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,276
if Morpheus is right and all.

520
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,529
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

521
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,197
if you are...

522
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,284
it's a very exciting time.

523
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:55,038
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

524
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,878
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

525
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,340
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

526
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,134
How about...

527
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,471
combat training?

528
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,978
"Jujitsu"?

529
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,522
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

530
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,077
Holy shit!

531
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,662
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

532
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,289
How about some more?

533
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,832
Hell, yes.

534
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,960
Hell, yeah.

535
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,224
How is he?

536
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,643
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

537
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,239
I know kung fu.

538
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,908
Show me.

539
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,453
This is a sparring program...

540
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,498
similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

541
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,084
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

542
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,796
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

543
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,840
Some of them can be bent.

544
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,509
Others can be broken.

545
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,136
Understand?

546
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,263
Then hit me...

547
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:36,973
if you can.

548
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,013
Good!

549
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,931
Adaptation.

550
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,433
Improvisation.

551
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,059
But your weakness...

552
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,686
is not your technique.

553
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,737
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

554
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,185
How did I beat you?

555
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,859
You're too fast.

556
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,736
Do you believe that...

557
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,614
my being stronger or faster...

558
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,535
has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

559
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,374
You think you're breathing air?

560
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,097
Again!

561
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,986
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

562
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,447
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

563
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,370
What are you waiting for?

564
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,581
You're faster than this.

565
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,002
Don't think you are.

566
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,920
Know you are.

567
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,100
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

568
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,779
I don't believe it.

569
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,449
I know what you're trying to do.

570
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,286
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

571
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,705
But I can only show you the door.

572
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,124
You have to walk through it.

573
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,629
Tank, load the jump program.

574
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,935
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

575
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,646
doubt and disbelief.

576
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,525
Free your mind.

577
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,418
Okey-dokey.

578
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,671
Free my mind.

579
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,256
What if he makes it?

580
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,217
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

581
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,012
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

582
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,681
Come on.

583
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,099
All right.

584
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,601
No problem. Free my mind.

585
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,188
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

586
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,251
What does that mean?

587
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,462
It doesn't mean anything.

588
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,631
Everybody falls the first time.

589
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,383
Right, Trin?

590
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,698
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

591
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,204
If you're killed in the Matrix...

592
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,413
you die here?

593
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,500
The body cannot live without the mind.

594
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,367
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

595
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,289
There is something about him,
isn't there?

596
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,542
Don't tell me you're a believer now?

597
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,752
I keep wondering...

598
00:56:21,788 --> 00:56:25,673
if Morpheus is so sure, why
doesn't he take him to see the Oracle?

599
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,510
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

600
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,854
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

601
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,899
That system is our enemy.

602
00:56:44,108 --> 00:56:47,088
When you're inside, you look
around, what do you see?

603
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,906
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

604
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,951
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

605
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,688
But until we do, these people are
still a part of that system...

606
00:56:57,728 --> 00:56:59,458
and that makes them our enemy.

607
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,918
You have to understand...

608
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:04,288
most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

609
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,130
And many of them are so inert...

610
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,799
so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

611
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,760
that they will fight to protect it.

612
00:57:13,258 --> 00:57:15,028
Were you listening to me, Neo?

613
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,028
Or looking at the woman in the red dress?

614
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,934
- I was...
- Look again.

615
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,270
Freeze it.

616
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,858
This...

617
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,528
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

618
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:35,159
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

619
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,203
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

620
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,540
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

621
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,587
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

622
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,341
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

623
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,009
is potentially an agent.

624
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,803
Inside the Matrix...

625
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,097
they are everyone...

626
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,141
and they are no one.

627
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,519
We have survived by hiding from
them, by running from them...

628
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,396
but they are the gatekeepers.

629
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,364
They are guarding all the doors.
They are holding all the keys.

630
00:58:07,388 --> 00:58:10,694
Which means that sooner or later,
someone is going to have to fight them.

631
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,071
Someone?

632
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,822
I won't lie to you, Neo.

633
00:58:14,278 --> 00:58:16,628
Every single man or woman
who has stood their ground...

634
00:58:16,668 --> 00:58:18,828
everyone who has fought an agent has died.

635
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,747
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

636
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,998
Why?

637
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,542
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

638
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,380
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

639
00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:32,944
Yet their strength and their speed
are still based in a world...

640
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,374
that is built on rules.

641
00:58:34,398 --> 00:58:35,636
Because of that...

642
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:39,264
they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

643
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,437
What are you telling me?

644
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,606
That I can dodge bullets?

645
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,984
No, Neo.

646
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,405
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

647
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,615
you won't have to.

648
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,954
<i>We got trouble.</i>

649
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,350
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

650
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,896
Shit.

651
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,024
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

652
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,445
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

653
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,904
Search and destroy.

654
00:59:37,238 --> 00:59:39,028
Set her down right over there.

655
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,180
How are we doing, Tank?

656
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,064
Power off-line.

657
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,525
EMP armed...

658
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,611
- and ready.
- EMP?

659
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,780
Electromagnetic pulse.

660
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,908
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

661
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,368
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

662
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,294
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

663
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,671
Sewers.

664
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,591
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

665
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:40,148
Now these sewers are
all that's left of them.

666
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,595
Quiet.

667
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,637
Neo.

668
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,641
You scared the bejesus out of me.

669
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,644
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

670
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,398
Is that ...?

671
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,233
The Matrix?

672
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,609
Yeah.

673
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,573
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

674
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,909
The image translators work
for the construct program.

675
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,580
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

676
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,791
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

677
01:01:53,038 --> 01:01:56,048
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

678
01:01:56,728 --> 01:01:58,648
Hey, do you...

679
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,382
want a drink?

680
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,675
Sure.

681
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,680
You know...

682
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,141
I know what you're thinking.

683
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,476
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

684
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,147
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

685
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,068
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

686
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,374
Good shit, huh?

687
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,918
Dozer makes it.

688
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,544
It's good for two things:

689
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,881
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

690
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,092
So can I ask you something?

691
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,722
Did he tell you why he did it?

692
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,185
Why you're here?

693
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,607
Jesus!

694
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,735
What a mind job.

695
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,948
So you're here to save the world.

696
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,534
What do you say
to something like that?

697
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,083
A little piece of advice.

698
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,294
You see an agent...

699
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,922
you do what we do:

700
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,799
Run.

701
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,884
You run your ass off.

702
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,851
Thanks for the drink.

703
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:40,732
Sweet dreams.

704
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,156
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

705
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,950
You know...

706
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,829
I know this steak doesn't exist.

707
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,582
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

708
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,919
the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

709
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,337
juicy...

710
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,339
and delicious.

711
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,510
After nine years...

712
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,096
you know what I realize?

713
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,147
Ignorance is bliss.

714
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,029
Then we have a deal.

715
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,450
I don't want to remember nothing.

716
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,202
Nothing. You understand?

717
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,083
And I want to be rich.

718
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,129
You know, someone important.

719
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,757
Like an actor.

720
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,094
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

721
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,806
Okay.

722
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,601
You get my body
back in a power plant...

723
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,728
reinsert me into the Matrix...

724
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,480
I'll get you what you want.

725
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,732
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

726
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,151
No. I told you, I don't know them.

727
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,114
I can get you the man who does.

728
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,658
Morpheus.

729
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,214
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

730
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:31,343
If you close your eyes, it almost
feels like you're eating runny eggs.

731
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,261
Or a bowl of snot.

732
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,388
You know what it really reminds me of?

733
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,559
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

734
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,874
No, but technically,
neither did you.

735
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:44,189
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

736
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,816
Because you have to wonder now...

737
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:49,319
how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

738
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,987
Maybe they got it wrong.

739
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,449
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

740
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,743
oatmeal or tuna fish.

741
01:05:57,118 --> 01:05:58,844
That makes you wonder about
a lot of things though.

742
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:00,234
You take chicken, for example.

743
01:06:00,258 --> 01:06:02,434
Maybe they couldn't figure out what
to make chicken taste like.

744
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,501
Which is why chicken tastes
like everything.

745
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,033
- And maybe they couldn't figure out...
- Shut up, Mouse.

746
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,631
It's a single-celled protein...

747
01:06:09,668 --> 01:06:12,926
combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

748
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,427
Everything the body needs.

749
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,556
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

750
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,395
So, I understand that you've run
through the agent training program.

751
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,481
You know, I wrote that program.

752
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,066
Here it comes.

753
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,277
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

754
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,697
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

755
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,783
She, um. Well, she doesn't
talk very much but...

756
01:06:37,028 --> 01:06:38,588
but, if you'd like to meet her...

757
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,048
I can arrange a much more personal milieu.

758
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,622
The digital pimp hard at work.

759
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,125
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

760
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,253
To deny our own impulses...

761
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,631
is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

762
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,926
Dozer, when you're done...

763
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,776
bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

764
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,638
We're going in.

765
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,765
I'm taking Neo to see her.

766
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,937
See who?

767
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,190
The Oracle.

768
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,238
Everyone please observe...

769
01:07:15,568 --> 01:07:18,588
the "fasten seat belt" and "no
smoking" signs have been turned on.

770
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,162
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

771
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,604
We're in.

772
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,412
We'll be back in an hour.

773
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,179
Unbelievable...

774
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,764
isn't it?

775
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,186
- God!
- What?

776
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,230
I used to eat there.

777
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,109
Really good noodles.

778
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,408
I have these memories from my life.

779
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,537
None of them happened.

780
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,497
What does that mean?

781
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,958
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

782
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,085
But an oracle can?

783
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,753
That's different.

784
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,718
Did you go to her?

785
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,429
Yes.

786
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,306
What did she tell you?

787
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,060
She told me...

788
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,271
What?

789
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,401
We're here.

790
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,070
Neo, come with me.

791
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,468
So is this the same oracle
that made...

792
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:42,886
the prophecy?

793
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:47,474
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

794
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,934
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

795
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,564
And she knows what? Everything?

796
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,526
She would say she knows enough.

797
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:01,446
And she's never wrong.

798
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,826
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

799
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,745
She is a guide, Neo.

800
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,997
She can help you to find the path.

801
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:12,749
She helped you?

802
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,501
Yes.

803
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,586
What did she tell you?

804
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,257
That I would find the One.

805
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,523
I told you I can only
show you the door.

806
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,317
You have to walk through it.

807
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,197
Hello, Neo.

808
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,116
You're right on time.

809
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,836
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

810
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,093
These are the other Potentials.

811
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,886
You can wait here.

812
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,263
Do not try and bend the spoon.

813
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,765
That's impossible.

814
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:57,604
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

815
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,522
What truth?

816
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,441
There is no spoon.

817
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,361
There is no spoon?

818
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:10,074
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

819
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,592
The Oracle will you see now.

820
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,854
I know you're Neo.

821
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,648
Be right with you.

822
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,068
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

823
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,657
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

824
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,868
Almost done.

825
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,997
Smell good, don't they?

826
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,500
Yeah.

827
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,585
I'd ask you to sit down...

828
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:05,213
but you're not going to anyway.

829
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,591
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

830
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,887
That vase.

831
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:14,889
I'm sorry.

832
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,016
I said, don't worry about it.

833
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,144
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

834
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:21,804
How did you know?

835
01:13:21,828 --> 01:13:23,828
..

836
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,819
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

837
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:31,114
would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

838
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,829
You're cuter than I thought.

839
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,126
I can see why she likes you.

840
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,086
Who?

841
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:47,171
Not too bright, though.

842
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,553
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

843
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,848
So...

844
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:59,183
what do you think?

845
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,770
Do you think you are the One?

846
01:14:04,728 --> 01:14:06,108
Honestly, I don't know.

847
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,612
You know what that means?

848
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,614
It's Latin.

849
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,199
Means, "Know thyself."

850
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,620
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

851
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,709
Being the One is just
like being in love.

852
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:28,296
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

853
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,672
through and through.

854
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,050
Balls to bones.

855
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:35,428
Well...

856
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,474
I'd better have a look at you.

857
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,310
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

858
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,368
Okay...

859
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:03,956
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but"...

860
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,583
Then you say:

861
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,460
But what?

862
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:11,673
But, you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

863
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:16,052
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

864
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,681
You got the gift...

865
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,892
but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

866
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:28,606
What?

867
01:15:28,638 --> 01:15:31,734
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

868
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,570
That's the way these things go.

869
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:38,032
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

870
01:15:38,688 --> 01:15:40,028
He, uh...

871
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,204
He almost had me convinced.

872
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,580
I know.

873
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,251
Poor Morpheus.

874
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,756
Without him, we're lost.

875
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,468
What do you mean, "without him"?

876
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,391
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

877
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:08,354
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

878
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,233
And no one, not you, not even me...

879
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:14,736
can convince him otherwise.

880
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,488
He believes it so blindly...

881
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:22,118
that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

882
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,494
What?

883
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,330
You're going to
have to make a choice.

884
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,543
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

885
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:33,921
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

886
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,633
One of you is going to die.

887
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,014
Which one will be up to you.

888
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,309
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

889
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,227
You have a good soul.

890
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,023
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

891
01:16:53,328 --> 01:16:54,578
Now...

892
01:16:55,148 --> 01:16:56,548
Don't worry about it.

893
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,280
As soon as you
step outside that door...

894
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,657
you'll start feeling better.

895
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:06,162
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

896
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,749
You're in control of your own life.

897
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:11,876
Remember?

898
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:14,754
Here...

899
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,174
take a cookie.

900
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:22,053
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

901
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,389
you'll feel right as rain.

902
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:35,942
What was said...

903
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,027
was for you...

904
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,404
and for you alone.

905
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,428
They're on the way.

906
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,293
What is that?

907
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:51,475
Oh, déjà vu.

908
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,063
What did you just say?

909
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,815
Nothing. Just had a little déjà vu.

910
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,692
- What did you see?
- What happened?

911
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,279
A black cat went past us...

912
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,370
and then another that looked just like it.

913
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,949
How much like it?
Was it the same cat?

914
01:19:08,168 --> 01:19:09,624
It might have been. I'm not sure.

915
01:19:09,648 --> 01:19:11,388
Switch, Apoc.

916
01:19:15,038 --> 01:19:16,034
What is it?

917
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:18,124
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.

918
01:19:18,148 --> 01:19:20,128
It happens when they change something.

919
01:19:23,928 --> 01:19:25,428
Oh, my God.

920
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,720
Let's go.

921
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,769
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

922
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:41,484
Oh, no.

923
01:20:21,768 --> 01:20:24,504
That's what they changed. We're
trapped. There's no way out.

924
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,488
Be calm. Give me your phone.

925
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,155
They'll be able to track it.

926
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,824
We have no choice.

927
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:31,908
Operator.

928
01:20:31,968 --> 01:20:35,618
<i>Tank, find a structural drawing
of this building. Find it fast.</i>

929
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:46,048
- Got it!
<i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

930
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:50,136
Eighth floor.

931
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,929
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

932
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:53,681
Switch, straight ahead.

933
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:55,599
Neo...

934
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,858
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

935
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,659
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

936
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:14,994
Good.

937
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,005
Where are they?

938
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,608
They're in the walls.

939
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,236
In the walls!

940
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,300
It's an agent!

941
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,934
Morpheus!

942
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,352
You must get Neo out!

943
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,437
He's all that matters!

944
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,940
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

945
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,234
Go!

946
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,409
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

947
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,518
Cypher, come on!

948
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:53,277
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

949
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,945
And you are?

950
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,947
A Smith.

951
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,490
Agent Smith.

952
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:01,118
You all look the same to me.

953
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,050
Take him.

954
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,141
No!

955
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,083
- Operator.
<i>- Yeah, I need an exit, fast.</i>

956
01:25:13,107 --> 01:25:15,098
- Cypher?
- Yeah.

957
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:18,112
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

958
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,239
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

959
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,865
Somebody up there still likes me.

960
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,367
I got you.

961
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,786
<i>G- get me out of here. Fast.</i>

962
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:28,706
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

963
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,999
Right.

964
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,712
- Operator.
<i>- Tank, it's me.</i>

965
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,130
Is Morpheus alive?

966
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:37,798
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

967
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:40,216
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where to yet.</i>

968
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:42,636
He's alive. We need an exit.

969
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:43,971
You're not far from Cypher.

970
01:25:44,138 --> 01:25:45,548
<i>- Cypher?</i>
- I know.

971
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,725
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i>
- Got it.

972
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,027
Got him.

973
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:09,997
Where are they?

974
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:11,498
Making the call.

975
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,334
Good.

976
01:26:26,468 --> 01:26:28,108
You first, Neo.

977
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,144
Shit!

978
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,107
Tank!

979
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,901
No!

980
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,988
I don't know. It just went dead.

981
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,016
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

982
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:12,768
Cypher? Where's Tank?

983
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,548
You know...

984
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,237
for a long time...

985
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:27,324
I thought I was in love with you.

986
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,160
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

987
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,956
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

988
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,583
<i>Too bad things had to
turn out this way.</i>

989
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,168
You killed them.

990
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,170
- What?
- Oh, God.

991
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:41,839
I'm tired, Trinity.

992
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,134
I'm tired of this war...

993
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:48,262
tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

994
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:53,225
of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

995
01:27:55,428 --> 01:27:56,948
But most of all...

996
01:27:57,147 --> 01:28:00,524
<i>I'm tired of that jack-off
and all of his bullshit.</i>

997
01:28:01,648 --> 01:28:03,188
Surprise, asshole!

998
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:05,696
I bet you never saw this coming...

999
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:06,989
did you?

1000
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,660
God, I wish I could be there...

1001
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,745
when they break you.

1002
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,958
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

1003
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:20,377
so right then...

1004
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:21,962
you'd know it was me.

1005
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,630
You gave them Morpheus.

1006
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,340
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

1007
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:27,426
He tricked us!

1008
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,970
If you had told us the truth...

1009
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:33,098
we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1010
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:35,476
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1011
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,604
"Free." You call this free?

1012
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,525
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1013
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:48,030
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1014
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,407
I choose the Matrix.

1015
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,326
The Matrix isn't real.

1016
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,994
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1017
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:56,497
I think the Matrix...

1018
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,416
can be more real than this world.

1019
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,087
All I do is pull the plug here.

1020
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:05,672
But there...

1021
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,509
<i>you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1022
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,761
Trinity.

1023
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:14,228
No!

1024
01:29:16,258 --> 01:29:18,264
<i>Welcome to the real world, huh, baby?</i>

1025
01:29:18,288 --> 01:29:19,382
But you're out, Cypher.

1026
01:29:19,406 --> 01:29:20,304
<i>You can't go back.</i>

1027
01:29:20,328 --> 01:29:22,008
Oh no. That's what you think.

1028
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,649
<i>They're gonna reinsert my body.</i>

1029
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:24,845
<i>I go back to sleep.</i>

1030
01:29:24,869 --> 01:29:27,528
<i>And when I wake up,
I won't remember a goddamn thing.</i>

1031
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:28,779
By the way...

1032
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,990
if you have anything
terribly important to say to Switch...

1033
01:29:32,488 --> 01:29:33,844
<i>I suggest you say it now.</i>

1034
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,870
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1035
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:40,207
Not like this.

1036
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:45,712
Too late.

1037
01:29:45,968 --> 01:29:47,688
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1038
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:49,883
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1039
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,135
I'm just a messenger.

1040
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:55,722
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1041
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,475
If Morpheus was right...

1042
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:00,894
there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1043
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,980
<i>If Neo's the One...</i>

1044
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,315
<i>then there'd have to be...</i>

1045
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:08,151
some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1046
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:09,528
Right?

1047
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,239
I mean, how can he be the One...

1048
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,490
if he's dead?

1049
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:17,119
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1050
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,746
<i>if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1051
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,333
Come on.
All I want is a little yes or no.

1052
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:27,045
Look into his eyes...

1053
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,298
<i>those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1054
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,385
and tell me...

1055
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,345
<i>yes...</i>

1056
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,055
<i>or no.</i>

1057
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:39,891
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

1058
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:41,226
I don't believe it.

1059
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:47,399
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1060
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:07,044
You first.

1061
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,554
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1062
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,516
Dozer?

1063
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:42,162
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1064
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,166
Marveled at its beauty...

1065
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,794
its genius?

1066
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:51,838
Billions of people just...

1067
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,841
living out their lives.

1068
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:57,552
Oblivious.

1069
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:05,018
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1070
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:09,940
was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1071
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:13,360
where everyone would be happy.

1072
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,404
It was a disaster.

1073
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:19,991
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1074
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,619
Some believed that...

1075
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:27,249
we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1076
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,168
But, I believed that...

1077
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,768
as a species...

1078
01:32:30,828 --> 01:32:34,388
human beings define
their reality through misery...

1079
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,091
and suffering.

1080
01:32:36,338 --> 01:32:38,688
So the perfect world was a dream...

1081
01:32:38,748 --> 01:32:44,138
that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1082
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:49,146
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1083
01:32:49,598 --> 01:32:50,868
The peak of...

1084
01:32:51,028 --> 01:32:52,768
your civilization.

1085
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:55,277
I say, "your civilization"...

1086
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:59,894
because as soon as we started thinking
for you, it really became our civilization...

1087
01:32:59,918 --> 01:33:03,468
which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1088
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:06,913
Evolution, Morpheus.

1089
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:08,540
Evolution.

1090
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,711
Like the dinosaur.

1091
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,506
Look out that window.

1092
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:19,342
You had your time.

1093
01:33:20,052 --> 01:33:23,972
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1094
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,683
The future is our time.

1095
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,105
There could be a problem.

1096
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:36,401
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1097
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:38,820
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1098
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,280
How much time?

1099
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:43,658
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1100
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:48,330
and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1101
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,541
When it does, Morpheus will tell them
anything they want to know.

1102
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:52,834
What do they want?

1103
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:57,130
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1104
01:33:57,381 --> 01:34:00,300
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1105
01:34:00,548 --> 01:34:03,268
they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1106
01:34:03,488 --> 01:34:06,048
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1107
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,390
or you...

1108
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:08,850
or even Morpheus.

1109
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,487
Well, there has to be
something that we can do.

1110
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,733
There is. We pull the plug.

1111
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:21,571
You're going to kill him?

1112
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:22,989
Kill Morpheus?

1113
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,242
We don't have any other choice.

1114
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:34,960
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1115
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:37,148
If indeed the insider has failed...

1116
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:40,568
they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless --

1117
01:34:40,668 --> 01:34:42,568
They're dead. In either case --

1118
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:46,179
Then we have no choice, but continue
as planned. Deploy the sentinels.

1119
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,514
Immediately.

1120
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,438
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1121
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,608
You were a father.

1122
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:02,112
We'll miss you always.

1123
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:10,203
Stop!

1124
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,732
I don't believe this is happening.

1125
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:14,916
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1126
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,085
I don't know, I...

1127
01:35:17,418 --> 01:35:20,065
- This can't be just coincidence. It can't be.
- What are you talking about?

1128
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:21,339
The Oracle.

1129
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:23,383
She told me this would happen.

1130
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:27,971
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1131
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,639
What choice?

1132
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:35,145
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1133
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:37,814
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1134
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:41,651
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1135
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,820
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1136
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:47,657
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1137
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,201
What?

1138
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,537
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1139
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,874
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1140
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,793
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1141
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,712
No, Neo, that's not true.

1142
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:03,924
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1143
01:36:07,648 --> 01:36:12,064
Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1144
01:36:12,088 --> 01:36:16,568
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1145
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:21,524
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1146
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,360
I know that's what it looks like...

1147
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:24,569
but it's not.

1148
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:27,197
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1149
01:36:28,278 --> 01:36:29,988
Morpheus believed something.

1150
01:36:30,128 --> 01:36:33,828
And he was ready to give his life for
what he believed. I understand that now.

1151
01:36:34,248 --> 01:36:35,664
That's why I have to go.

1152
01:36:35,688 --> 01:36:38,041
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1153
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,834
What?

1154
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:42,253
I believe I can bring him back.

1155
01:36:59,228 --> 01:37:01,568
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1156
01:37:01,688 --> 01:37:03,688
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1157
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,736
Let me tell you what I believe.

1158
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,614
I believe Morpheus means more
to me than he does to you.

1159
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:13,908
I believe if you are really serious about
saving him, you are going to need my help.

1160
01:37:14,488 --> 01:37:16,844
And since I am the ranking
officer on this ship...

1161
01:37:16,868 --> 01:37:19,666
if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1162
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,836
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1163
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:24,796
Tank...

1164
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,089
load us up.

1165
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:39,019
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1166
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:40,979
during my time here.

1167
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:45,233
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1168
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:47,736
and I realized that...

1169
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,280
you're not actually mammals.

1170
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:54,951
Every mammal on this planet...

1171
01:37:55,286 --> 01:38:00,206
instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding environment.

1172
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:02,292
But you humans do not.

1173
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:06,379
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1174
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:11,134
and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1175
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:13,748
The only way you can survive...

1176
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:16,806
is to spread to another area.

1177
01:38:22,228 --> 01:38:25,228
There is another organism
on this planet that...

1178
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:27,317
follows the same pattern.

1179
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:29,611
Do you know what it is?

1180
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,821
A virus.

1181
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:36,201
Human beings are a disease.

1182
01:38:36,568 --> 01:38:38,288
A cancer of this planet.

1183
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,497
You are a plague.

1184
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,457
And we...

1185
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,000
are the cure.

1186
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,419
Okay, so what do you need?

1187
01:38:47,038 --> 01:38:48,468
Besides a miracle.

1188
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:49,964
Guns.

1189
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,008
Lots of guns.

1190
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,103
Neo...

1191
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:07,398
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1192
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,527
That's why it's going to work.

1193
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,533
Why isn't the serum working?

1194
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:19,452
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1195
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:22,789
Leave me with him.

1196
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:26,501
Now.

1197
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,305
Hold on, Morpheus.

1198
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:42,267
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1199
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,771
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1200
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:49,691
I'm going to be honest...

1201
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:51,276
with you.

1202
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,073
I...

1203
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,075
hate...

1204
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:01,286
this place...

1205
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,913
this zoo...

1206
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:05,290
this prison...

1207
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:08,710
this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1208
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:11,254
I can't stand it any longer.

1209
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,882
It's the smell.

1210
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:17,135
If there is such a thing.

1211
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:20,763
I feel saturated by it.

1212
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,558
I can...

1213
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:25,351
taste...

1214
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:27,562
your stink.

1215
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:31,441
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1216
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:32,609
It's repulsive.

1217
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:34,986
Isn't it?

1218
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,449
I must get out of here.

1219
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:42,076
I must get free.

1220
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:45,205
And in this mind is the key.

1221
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:47,123
My key.

1222
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:50,251
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1223
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:52,128
Do you understand?

1224
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:53,796
I need the codes.

1225
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,382
I have to get inside Zion...

1226
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,219
and you have to tell me how.

1227
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:01,512
You're going to tell me...

1228
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,932
or you're going to die.

1229
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:27,247
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1230
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:32,210
Holy shit!

1231
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:47,016
Backup. Send backup.

1232
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,958
Freeze!

1233
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:28,010
What were you doing?

1234
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:31,139
He doesn't know.

1235
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,890
Know what?

1236
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,463
I think they're trying to save him.

1237
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,062
There is no spoon.

1238
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:51,844
Find them and destroy them!

1239
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,306
I repeat, we're under attack!

1240
01:46:27,422 --> 01:46:28,589
Trinity!

1241
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,174
Help!

1242
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:53,406
Only human.

1243
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:55,449
Dodge this.

1244
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,172
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1245
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:14,510
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1246
01:47:15,637 --> 01:47:17,013
It wasn't fast enough.

1247
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:21,058
Can you fly that thing?

1248
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:23,185
Not yet.

1249
01:47:26,188 --> 01:47:27,328
Operator.

1250
01:47:27,368 --> 01:47:30,898
<i>Tank, I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1251
01:47:31,361 --> 01:47:32,653
<i>Hurry.</i>

1252
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:42,204
Let's go.

1253
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:58,387
No.

1254
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:52,608
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1255
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:31,689
He's not going to make it.

1256
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:42,533
Got you.

1257
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,767
Trinity!

1258
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:32,852
I knew it.

1259
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:34,687
He's the One.

1260
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,872
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1261
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,917
Morpheus...

1262
01:51:58,587 --> 01:51:59,670
The Oracle.

1263
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:03,299
- She told me I...
- She told you...

1264
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,259
exactly what you needed to hear.

1265
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:06,886
That's all.

1266
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:10,890
Neo, sooner or later you'll
realize, just as I did...

1267
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:13,517
there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1268
01:52:14,268 --> 01:52:15,828
and walking the path.

1269
01:52:18,607 --> 01:52:19,815
- Operator.
<i>- Tank.</i>

1270
01:52:20,728 --> 01:52:23,428
- Goddamn, it's good to hear your voice, sir.
<i>- We need an exit.</i>

1271
01:52:23,528 --> 01:52:26,728
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1272
01:52:39,377 --> 01:52:41,795
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1273
01:52:42,047 --> 01:52:45,633
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1274
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:48,844
Order the strike.

1275
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:57,394
They're not out yet.

1276
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:09,907
You first, Morpheus.

1277
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:32,888
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1278
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:40,104
but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1279
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:46,986
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1280
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:51,281
Everything but this.

1281
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:53,826
But what?

1282
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:19,893
Neo!

1283
01:54:20,145 --> 01:54:21,770
- What happened?
- An agent.

1284
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,939
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1285
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:27,943
Mr. Anderson.

1286
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:31,530
Run, Neo. Run.

1287
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:38,454
What is he doing?

1288
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:39,955
He's beginning to believe.

1289
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:08,317
You're empty.

1290
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,194
So are you.

1291
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:46,355
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1292
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:48,524
Mr. Anderson.

1293
01:56:29,482 --> 01:56:31,567
Jesus, he's killing him.

1294
01:57:57,737 --> 01:57:59,863
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1295
01:58:00,615 --> 01:58:03,617
That is the sound of inevitability.

1296
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:09,539
It is the sound of your death.

1297
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:12,793
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1298
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:14,670
My name...

1299
01:58:17,674 --> 01:58:19,716
is Neo.

1300
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:54,167
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1301
01:58:56,671 --> 01:58:57,713
Oh, shit.

1302
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:11,560
Sentinels.

1303
01:59:12,312 --> 01:59:14,563
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1304
01:59:16,607 --> 01:59:18,775
Tank, charge the EMP.

1305
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:22,070
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1306
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:24,323
He's gonna make it.

1307
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:26,450
Flat or pumps? No, just --

1308
01:59:26,701 --> 01:59:29,578
What the shit? That's my phone!

1309
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,580
That guy took my phone!

1310
01:59:33,958 --> 01:59:36,251
Got him!
He's on the run.

1311
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:39,171
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1312
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:41,298
<i>I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1313
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:46,261
Oh, shit!

1314
02:00:07,825 --> 02:00:09,826
Help! Need a little help!

1315
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:12,662
<i>The door.</i>

1316
02:00:28,638 --> 02:00:30,138
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1317
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:32,307
<i>Your other left!</i>

1318
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:40,273
<i>The back door.</i>

1319
02:01:01,045 --> 02:01:02,170
Oh, no.

1320
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,340
Here they come.

1321
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,370
He's going to make it.

1322
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:48,717
<i>The fire escape at the
end of the alley, room 303.</i>

1323
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:24,920
They're inside.

1324
02:02:27,256 --> 02:02:28,298
Hurry, Neo.

1325
02:03:24,522 --> 02:03:25,647
It can't be.

1326
02:03:33,447 --> 02:03:34,823
Check him.

1327
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:40,370
He's gone.

1328
02:03:47,086 --> 02:03:49,504
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1329
02:03:57,096 --> 02:03:58,138
Neo...

1330
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,558
I'm not afraid anymore.

1331
02:04:03,008 --> 02:04:04,264
The Oracle told me...

1332
02:04:04,288 --> 02:04:07,188
that I would fall in love, and that, that man...

1333
02:04:08,068 --> 02:04:10,708
the man that I loved would be the One.

1334
02:04:13,237 --> 02:04:15,196
So you see...

1335
02:04:15,906 --> 02:04:17,907
you can't be dead.

1336
02:04:19,493 --> 02:04:21,328
You can't be...

1337
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:25,040
because I love you.

1338
02:04:26,876 --> 02:04:28,585
You hear me?

1339
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:31,379
I love you.

1340
02:04:55,112 --> 02:04:56,404
Now, get up.

1341
02:05:05,081 --> 02:05:06,247
No.

1342
02:05:32,983 --> 02:05:34,025
How?

1343
02:05:34,902 --> 02:05:35,944
He is the One.

1344
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:04,157
Neo!

1345
02:08:00,422 --> 02:08:02,131
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1346
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:04,217
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1347
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:08,263
<i>I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.</i>

1348
02:08:08,597 --> 02:08:10,431
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1349
02:08:11,892 --> 02:08:13,226
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1350
02:08:13,394 --> 02:08:15,979
<i>I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1351
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:19,190
<i>I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.</i>

1352
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:21,734
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1353
02:08:21,986 --> 02:08:25,071
<i>And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.</i>

1354
02:08:25,322 --> 02:08:27,198
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1355
02:08:27,449 --> 02:08:29,200
<i>without you.</i>

1356
02:08:29,493 --> 02:08:33,121
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1357
02:08:33,372 --> 02:08:37,083
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1358
02:08:39,712 --> 02:08:41,045
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1359
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:43,256
<i>is a choice I leave to you.</i>
