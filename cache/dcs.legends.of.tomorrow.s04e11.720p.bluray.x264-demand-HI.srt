Legends Of Tomorrow...

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,035
Is this your new girlfriend?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,713
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,856
You and I dating would be totally weird.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
Totally weird.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,878
Wow, that's beautiful.

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,354
Step away from the creature, miss.

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,035
You murdered him!

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,113

[roars]

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,671
Hank is running some secret project.

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,912
He's not just taking the fugitives,
he's testing on them.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,195
I don't need you anymore.

15
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,158
I don't need you anymore, either.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
[groans]

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,158
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

18

[sighs]

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,872
Maybe I shouldn't intrude.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,156
Nate needs all of our support right now.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,800
[Ray] What am I supposed to say to him?

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,136
"Sorry the woman I've been
exchanging love letters with in prison

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,080
killed your dad."

25
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,471
[scoffs] They ought to put that
on a condolence card.

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,472
Look, we are going inside

27
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,280
and we are going to strive, with grace,

28
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,272
to help our friend cope with his loss.

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,035
[Nate] <i>Damn it.</i>

30
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,713
[Zari] Here, let me help.

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Hey, uh...

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,637
Thanks for sticking around
this past week.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,671
What are pretend girlfriends for?

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,351
My mom is going to be so crushed
when I tell her we broke up.

35
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Then don't.

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,513
I mean, she's going through a lot.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,990
We can pretend break up anytime we want.

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,438
We should...
We should probably get out there.

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,109
You ready for this?

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,760
- [indistinct conversations]
- [Nate exhales deeply]

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,320
Oh, Nathaniel.

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,073
I need you to make a toast later.

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,073
Tell everyone what an amazing man
your father was.

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,437
Mom, I don't think that's a great idea.

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,874
What? Of course it is.

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,274
And, Zari, I am so glad that you're here
for Nathaniel to lean on right now.

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,879
Yeah, you know me. I'm... I'm his rock.

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,316
I can't... I can't face him.

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,079
Ray, wait.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,630
[sighs]

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,880
[Constantine]
I hope you're not stress-eating, squire.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
I don't know what else to do.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
I can't believe this is happening.

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,110
[breathes deeply]

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,873
You feel the energy in this room.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,034
It's like sitting on a keg of dynamite.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
You see, wakes are notorious soft spots

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,717
where the supernatural
meets the living world.

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,240
You see Nate's aunt?

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,154
That particular prayer
is to ward off evil spirits.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
They've covered the mirrors

62
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,159
so the bad lads can't get in.

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,233
- That's creepy.
- Yeah, well.

64
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,232
Creepy is my business.

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,232
[electricity crackling]

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,838
And it looks like business is good.

67
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,956
- [Nate] Oh!
- [Ray gasps]

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,070
Nate! Nate, Nate, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,276
No, it's okay, Ray.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,317
No. No, no, it's not.

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,030
I keep giving Nora second chances
and she goes and does this.

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,157
Look, you thought Nora could change...

73
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,312
I never thought my dad would be
torturing magical creatures,

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,754
so I guess...

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,320
I guess we were both wrong.

76
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,715
[sighs]

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,917
I can't believe
you're the one comforting me.

78
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,720
Come on, I love you, bro.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
That's never going to change.

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,030
I love you, too.

81
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,473
[crackling]

82
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,395
Oh, no, don't... No, no, no, don't...

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,757
Don't... Don't do it, Ray.
You're gonna do it.

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,556
You're gonna do it.

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,270
[gasps]

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,869
Nora?

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,274
How... How are you doing this?

88
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,192
[scoffs] It's a reflection spell.

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,555
I can't hold it much longer.

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,656
Well, good. Because there's nothing
you could possibly say

91
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,696
that would make any difference.

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,757
This time, there will be
no more second chances.

93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,797
Ray, I didn't kill Nate's dad.

94
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Oh, thank God, you're innocent.

95
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
Tell me where you are.
I need to talk to you in person.

96
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,716
Now, who wants a nice, juicy steak?

97
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,237
Charlie, you know that I'm a vegetarian.

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,518
No, no, no, you used to be a vegetarian

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,990
when you were a normal, boring human.

100
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,072
- But now, you are...
- A monster?

101
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,080
Exactly.

102
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,081
I mean, how cool is that?

103
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,392
Wait, are you trying to get me
to shift into Wolfie?

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Of course I am.

105
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,041
You've been moping about the ship
thinking about your lost love.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,756
I think that he would really want you to
just embrace your wild side.

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
[chuckles]

108
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,392
Konane liked me as Mona.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Whoa!

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
The birds on your shirt?

111
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,595
These are the names of my favorite
Jane Austen characters.

112
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
[Gideon] It appears that

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,559
you are experiencing
the impact of a magical fugitive.

114
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,389
[both] Oh!

115
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,117
This better be good, Mona.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,160
A fugitive got to Jane Austen.
She never wrote <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i>

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,119
And <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> disappeared,
too.

118
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,696
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait.

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,996
Did someone say history is in trouble?

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,470
Legends assemble.

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,511
Okay, yeah, I really need
to get out of here, too.

122
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,670
Hey, what's up?

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,230
Nothing. There's a fugitive alert,
but it can wait.

124
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,155
No, you should go.

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,600
It's hard enough I have to play pretend,
you guys shouldn't.

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,235
Okay.

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,910
Bye, Nate.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Bye, Zari.

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,670
Gideon traced the new fugitive
to a wedding

130
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,753
Jane Austen attended in Bath,
England, 1802.

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,117
I already had Gideon chart a course.
Can I come on the mission?

132
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,555
Please?

133
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Sure.

134
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,190
Yeah, and as much as I love
a good wedding sneak,

135
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,950
I'm gonna QB from... From my bedroom.

136
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,277
Is he acting weirder than normal?

137
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,113
- [all] Yeah.
- [Zari clears throat]

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,635
- [Mona sniffing]
- Speaking of weird.

139
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,077
I think my sense of smell
has improved because of Wolfie

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,200
and you smell exactly like... Nate.

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
No, I don't.

142
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,239
It's definitely Nate.

143
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,436
Nate and something else.

144
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,749
[sniffs]

145
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,913
- Arousal?
- [laughing]

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,596
No, I don't... I don't like Nate.
That would be wrong and...

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Nate likes you.

148
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,517
He confessed it
when he swallowed the truth bug.

149
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,717
We are so not passing
the Bechdel test right now.

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,996
It's okay to talk about guys sometimes.

151
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,356
Come on, I bet it's been months
since you got laid.

152
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,671
Now, why don't you just go smash Nate?

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,991
Or better yet, you should go
smash somebody else,

154
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,456
because if you're
still thinking about Nate,

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,119
then you know you're really into him.

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,793
Why don't you talk to Nate?

157
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,280
Tell him how you feel.

158
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,476
[scoffs] Boo.

159
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,040
That is a terrible idea.

160
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,679
Okay, I'm going. Bye.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,879
This is like a Jane Austen novel
come to life.

162
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,313
- [wind blows]
- [gasps] My bonnet!

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
[man] Look out!

164
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,281
- [neighing]
- [man] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

165
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,516
[all gasp]

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
[grunts]

167
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
[man] Forgive me, miss.

168
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Are you hurt?

169
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Only my pride.

170
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,317
Injured pride is a small thing...

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,634
if it allowed us to meet.

172
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,199
[man 2] What's the holdup there?

173
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,350
Come, come, I say.

174
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,556
Duty calls.

175
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
[clears throat]

176
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,192
[man] Apologies, Lord Remington.

177
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,839
We'll be on our way shortly.

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
- [both laughing]
- Here.

179
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,071
[clears throat] Not a word.

180
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,514
Was that a curtsy?

181
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,711
- [all laughing]
- "Only my pride."

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Okay, let's go. Shut up!

183
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,515
- [all laughing]
- A damsel.

184
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,593
- [hymn playing on church organ]
- [indistinct chattering]

185
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,670
[Zari clears throat]

186
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,151
If you don't jump that
buff coachman's bones, I will.

187
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
We're at this wedding
to catch a magical creature.

188
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,912
[smacks lips] If that's the groom,

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,434
then I'm glad I'm not the bride.

190
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,674
A man's charms are equal to his fortunes

191
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,878
and Mr. Dockerty's fortunes
are prodigious.

192
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,714
[shushes] Jane, don't be rude.

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,357
That's Jane Austen.

194
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,960
[wedding music playing]

195
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,158
I cannot marry you, Mr. Dockerty.

196
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,310
[all gasp]

197
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,318
- My heart yearns for another.
- [all gasp]

198
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,718
Our family scullery maid.

199
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,998
Ellen, are you here?

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm here!

201
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,874
I love you, too.

202
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
- [exclaims]
- [woman] The scandal!

203
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,560
[all gasping]

204
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Wow.

205
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,671
[Mr. Dockerty]
I give not one fig, Miss Sinclair.

206
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,069
For my heart, and my lower extremities,
yearn for your mother.

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,120
[all gasp]

208
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,271
Get over here, gorgeous.

209
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
[all murmuring]

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
[Mr. Dockerty] Come to me, my love.

211
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,392
Now, this is what I call a wedding.

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,756
[buzzing]

213
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,875
The coast is clear.

214
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,750
I really don't want you to get
in trouble with your friends.

215
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh, it's no trouble.

216
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,752
It looks like everyone else
is still on mission.

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,956
Okay.

218
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,235
So, who did kill Hank?

219
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,719
- [sighs] The demon.
- Okay, good.

220
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,279
Obviously...
I mean, obviously, it's bad.

221
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,714
If it's a demon, that means
that John will be able to find proof

222
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,757
and you just need to lay low
until he comes back.

223
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,593
You really don't mind me staying here?

224
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,672
Yeah, no,
it'd be nice if you stayed here.

225
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,036
- Oi, Rayge? Where are you?
- [gasps]

226
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,597
- [Charlie continues indistinctly]
- [Nora groans]

227
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,796
Rayge?

228
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,435
- It's a long story. Go.
- What's a long...

229
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
[Charlie] What...

230
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,749
What are you hiding in there?

231
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,115
Hmm? What? Nothing.

232
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Oh, buffing the old bishop, was we?
[chuckles]

233
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,120
It's all right, mate.
No judgement here, all right?

234
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,270
- Come on.
- Yeah.

235
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,639
So the bride and
the scullery maid, that was...

236
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,757
- Insane.
- Romantic.

237
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,115
I was gonna say hot.

238
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,635
Regardless, that definitely
did not happen in actual history.

239
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,317
[Sara] Ray, Charlie, what you got?

240
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,360
This wedding was the second of
a series of "lust outbreaks" in 1802.

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,353
Yeah, the sexual revolution
came a couple hundred years too early.

242
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,150
Why would it make
Jane Austen stop writing?

243
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,430
We need more info.

244
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,638
Jane Austen was known for
being a keen social observer.

245
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,117
So if anyone would have noticed
a new magical arrival in town,

246
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,429
it would be her.

247
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,989
Okay, let's go interview Jane.

248
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,639
[Charlie] <i>Oh, wait, hang on a tick.</i>

249
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,394
People with the real dirt,
always the servants.

250
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,199
Like a handsome coachman, perhaps.

251
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Hmm?

252
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,230
Fine, I'll go ask him some questions.

253
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,431
- But that's it.
- You go get it, girl.

254
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,715
Okay.

255
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
[door opens]

256
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,794
Sister dear,
this is Miss Lance and Miss Wu.

257
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,553
They're new in town.

258
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,154
Try not to scare them away.

259
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,993
I shall do my best, Cassandra.

260
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,158
We are so sorry to interrupt
your writing, Miss Austen.

261
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,993
This? Just a letter.

262
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,390
Shall we take a turn around the room
while we converse?

263
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,920
We'd be delighted to.

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,310
It's a Regency thing, go with it.

265
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,552
So, the bride, Miss Sinclair,

266
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,996
her behavior must have been
quite a shock.

267
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,396
Ever since Lord Remington
arrived a week ago,

268
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,712
the entire town has been acting
most imprudently.

269
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,431
But Miss Sinclair's situation
is truly horrendous.

270
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,356
I think you of all people would
celebrate the triumph of romance.

271
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,794
What's to celebrate?

272
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,792
Miss Sinclair will be cut off
from her fortune

273
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,576
and the two women
will have nothing to live on.

274
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,559
But it's because of you, I mean...

275
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,036
I have come to believe that love will
find a way to overcome any obstacle.

276
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,033
Then you're either lying
or you're a fool.

277
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,710
Tell me, has love worked out
so well for you?

278
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,110
- No.
- Then you are a fool.

279
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,709
For you shouldn't have to
learn a lesson twice.

280
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,915
[Mona growling]

281
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,714
[grunts softy]

282
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,439
Let's go find Lord Remington.

283
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
We should be going.

284
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
[Zari] <i>Hello?</i>

285
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,033
[sighs] This is stupid.

286
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
[coachman clears throat]

287
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,871
What a pleasure to see you again.

288
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,160
Hey, man.

289
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,636
What's up, Pretty?

290
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,554
This whole toast thing is
eating me up on the inside.

291
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,109
My... My dad was such a dick.

292
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,800
He lied about everything and now
he's turning me into a liar, too.

293
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,394
[sighs] Listen,

294
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,712
your old man's gone, whatever you say
out there, that's for you.

295
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,230
You know what, Mick?

296
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,839
I think you're onto something.

297
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,918
- [exhales]

[inhales sharply]

300
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
[Hank echoing] <i>Nathaniel!</i>

301
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,829
Hey, where is Nate?

302
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,435
We need to find him
because Hank's spirit is still here.

303
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
[door closes]

304
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,874
Hey, cheer up.

305
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
What does Jane Austen know?

306
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,274
How to be witty and wise
and mix satire with romance.

307
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,320
[women giggling]

308
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,597
I bet you these girls know
where Lord Remington is.

309
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,478
[Mona] They do look like fan girls.

310
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
Okay, you know the era,
you take the lead.

311
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,870
He's simply the handsomest man
I've ever laid eyes on.

312
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,233
[Mona giggling]

313
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,554
I know what you mean.

314
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,951
Lord Remington is such a fine specimen.

315
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,238
I can't say I share your sentiment.

316
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,071
[snoring]

317
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,509
His coachman though,

318
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,037
what he lacks in means,
he makes up for in magnetism.

319
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,236
[woman] I concur.

320
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,835
His arrival has sent
many hearts aflutter.

321
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,991
[Mona giggles nervously]

322
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Coachman.

323
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,711
As in, the guy we pushed Zari
to hook up with.

324
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,235
Zari is gonna smash the fugitive.

325
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,756
Come on!

326
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
[panting] Sorry.

327
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,199
This is moving really fast.

328
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,590
- I agree.
- You do?

329
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,076
What's your name?

330
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,995
[scoffs] Uh...

331
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,276
My name is Zari. What's your name?

332
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,874
You know what? Don't answer that.

333
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,316
You don't kiss like any man
I've ever known.

334
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,269
What are you?

335
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,072
I am Kamadeva.

336
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,237
The Hindu god of love.

337
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,196
Awesome.

338
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,360
- [Kamadeva and Zari moaning]
- We're too late.

339
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,910
Zari?

340
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,029
- We think you might be dealing with...
- The fugitive?

341
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah, I know.

342
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,359
This is Kamadeva.

343
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,238
As in, the namesake of
<i>Kama-sutra,</i> Kamadeva?

344
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,549
That I did not know.

345
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,475
Look, I'm not going to sleep with
a magical fugitive.

346
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,033
You are incredible.

347
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,515
A woman has never before
resisted my charms.

348
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,034
All right, you're coming with us.

349
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,680
I would follow Miss Zari
to the world's end.

350
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,474
Well, your days of ruining Regency-era
marriages are over, Kamadeva.

351
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,759
I only sought to grant people the
courage to follow their heart's desire.

352
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,953
Oh, think he likes you.

353
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,480
Gideon, get us out of here.

354
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,870
I'm not so sure we can go yet.

355
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
[Gideon] Miss Wu is correct.

356
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,513
The historical records still indicate

357
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,398
that Jane Austen's career is
in jeopardy.

358
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
We caught the fugitive.
What's the problem?

359
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,556
Well, it's too late
to knock on Jane Austen's door tonight.

360
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,756
We'll talk to her tomorrow.

361
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,992
So, I'm to spend the night...

362
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Alone.

363
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,910
[sighs] What a waste.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,514
All right, everybody out.

365
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,193
- Come on.
- Hi.

366
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,794
Surely, I could have a bed?

367
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,556
[door opens]

368
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,156
Well, I had Gideon fabricate
some jimjams.

369
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,596
Because it's a slumber party.

370
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,751
Oh, thanks.

371
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,274
Obviously, since you are my guest,
you will get the bed.

372
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,992
Well, it's big enough
for the both of us. We can just share.

373
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,714
Oh, okay.

374
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,840
You can turn around now.

375
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,310
[Ray scoffs softly]

376
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,114
It really covers everything.

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,356
The thing is, I pride myself
on being a gentleman,

378
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,911
and the gentlemanly thing to do
would be to sleep in the chair, so...

379
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,554
[Ray clears throat]

380
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,312
[stammering] But you can't...
There's no way...

381
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
Oh...

382
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,279
That's not...

383
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,192
[snoring]

384
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay.

385
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,240
[Nora sighing]

386
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,216
- [Constantine] Hey, mate.
- [knocking on door]

387
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,833
How is the old toast going?

388
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,151
Is there one or two "N"s in "conniving"?

389
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,840
Right then, may I suggest
a slight change of plan?

390
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,274
No, Mick is right.

391
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,240
It's time for me to tell the truth
about my dad.

392
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,636
How was I supposed to know
Hank's ghost was here?

393
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Wait, what?

394
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,681
Yeah, that's about the gist of it,
Natey boy, you see.

395
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,479
Your old man's spirit is
working very hard

396
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,353
to stay attached to the mortal realm.

397
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,120
I can only surmise that he has something
he wants to say to you, so,

398
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,136
if you wouldn't mind leaving off
your roast for a bit,

399
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,992
join us for a brief séance

400
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
and I'll have him on his way in no time.

401
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,754
No.

402
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,274
There's nothing Hank can say now

403
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,398
to excuse him from embezzling money
and hurting creatures.

404
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,557
In fact, I'm glad he's still here.

405
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,711
'Cause it's his turn to listen to me.

- [powering up]
- [spooky voice moaning]

407

You don't scare me, Hank.

408
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,479
[record spinning rapidly]

409
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Ray.

410
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,154
Do you want me in bed with you?

411
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,715
Yes, I did. I do.

412
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,995
I do.

413
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,474
[Nora moans]

414
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Is this okay?

415
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,430
Yes.

416
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480

Damn it, this is definitely a dream.

- The fugitive get to you, too?
- Yeah.

427
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,696
[Charlie] Well, personally,
I really enjoyed my night,

428
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,518
blowing David Bowie's mind.

00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,401
Who'd you get a leg over, Z?
Wait, let me guess. Nate?

431
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,676
No, Kamadeva.

432
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Both?

433
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,672
It was both! Blimey, Z,
I didn't know you had it in you.

434
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,989
What about you, Wolfie?

435
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,157
You dreamt about Konane.

436
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,516
Mona.

437
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,920
I'll get it.

438

- [sobbing]
- [Zari clears throat]

439
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Hey. Hey, hey. It's okay.

440
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,912
He had the sweetest eyes.

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,196
And when he would look at me,

442
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,476
the whole world would disappear.

443
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,153
And now, he's dead.

444
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,591
Mona, I know it's hard, but,

445
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,798
try to have some perspective.
You didn't know him for very long.

446
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,113
So, you think I'm a fool too?

447
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,590
No, I just don't think anyone
should give their heart away

448
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,319
without thinking about the consequences.

449
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,359
But romance is taking
a chance on someone

450
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,397
without knowing how it's gonna end up.

451
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,757
Romance is something used
to sell novels. It's not real.

452
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,752
Well, it'll never be real for you.

453
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,153
Not if you never try.

454
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,232
Not if you never take a risk.

455
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,976
You know, it's hard
to take advice from someone

into a werewolf.

I might be stupid for being a romantic,

460
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,871
but it's not Konane's fault.

Stay back, beast!

If I'm a beast, it's because of you!

Your books made me
an incurable romantic.

You're the reason
I risked everything for love.

You don't believe in romance!

I believe from the depths of my soul
that one should only marry for love.

487
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
You do?

488
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,791
So much so that I rejected the only man
who has ever asked for my hand.

489
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,070
He was a smug simpleton
who only read sermons!

490
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
[sighs]

491
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,033
How remarkable.

492
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,672
You shouldn't mess with people's dreams.

493
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,910
[chuckles]

494
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,357
My powers don't create passion
out of thin air.

495
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,393
Whomever you dreamt about,
you truly desire.

496
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,016
That doesn't mean I have to act on it.
It's called impulse control.

497
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,353
You sound like a woman who has never
let herself fall in love.

498
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,511
Where I'm from, love is a liability.

499
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,719
And yet, a life without love
is no life at all.

500
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,320
Tell me, what does a god know
about the human heart?

501
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,513
My real name is Sunjay.

502
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,430
I was born thousands of years ago.

503
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,319
When the actual Kamadeva
was immolated by Shiva,

504
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,798
I gathered his ashes in this vial.

505
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,158
They bestowed powers
I could have scarcely imagined.

506
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,519
Why are you telling me this?

507
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,990
Because I like you.

508
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,276
And I think you secretly yearn
to be impulsive and free.

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,117
Unless you lack the courage.

510
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,078
Okay. Give me a hit.

511
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,834
- Might I suggest...
- No, if I'm gonna do this,

512
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,436
I want to experience love, lust,
the whole shebang.

513
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,718
That is, unless you lack the courage.

514
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,079
One, two, three.

515
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,470
Wow.

516
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,559
Most of you here knew Hank well.

517
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,918
Or thought you did.

518
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,152
I'm gonna talk about a different Hank.
A Hank I got to know this year.

519
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,039
- [electricity crackling]
- [people gasp]

520
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,360
[mouthing] What are you doing?

521
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,835
[clears throat]

522
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,316
Hank was a workaholic
who never took a day off.

523
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,830
Well, Hank,
you can finally rest in peace.

524
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
[sighs]

525
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Um...

526
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,950
Hank never knew his own father.

527
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,399
That's why he wanted to be there
for Nathaniel growing up.

528
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,195
But work often got in the way.

529
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,834
So, one year,

530
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,432
we planned to use Hank's leave
to stay for a week in Disney World.

531
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,597
Nathaniel was over the moon.

532
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,960
But the morning that
we were to fly to Orlando,

533
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,237
we ended up having to take Nathaniel
to the hospital instead.

534
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,440
When Hank saw the look of disappointment
in his son's eyes,

535
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,912
he went out and rented
a Mickey Mouse costume.

536
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,673
Put it on and went to the hospital.

537
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,757
He convinced everyone there that
Mickey Mouse had come to see them.

538
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,269
Hank Heywood was not a perfect man.

539
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,396
But when he was at his best,
that is who he was.

540
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,637
A man who could make you
believe in magic.

541
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
To Hank.

542
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,872
[all] To Hank.

543
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,518
Why did you tell me that
by following their hearts

544
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,831
those women would only
fall into despair?

545
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
[sighs]

546
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:48,801
Because my decision
was the result of my pride.

547
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,873
When my father dies, my sister and I
will be reduced to penury.

548
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,119
- But your writing...
- Has been rejected by every publisher.

549
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,040
[scoffs]

550
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,759
It's no wonder.

551
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,277
I satirize the manners of a society that
seems to have lost all sense of decorum.

552
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,432
Therefore,
I have decided to stop writing.

553
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,838
But you will publish.

554
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,719
You can't give up now,
because your books

555
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,239
are timeless.

556
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,915
- How can you be so sure?
- Because...

557
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,158
You're my favorite author.

558
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,591
May I offer you a bit of advice?

559
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,389
My books advocate a partnership
based on love and mutual respect,

560
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,959
not on losing control.

561
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,195
[both laughing]

[Sunjay sighs]

563
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,800
What shall we do next?

564
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I have an idea.

565
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,634
Let's get married.

566
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,874
[music playing]

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Do you hear that?

568
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,709
No, hear what?

569
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,432
There is definitely music playing.

570
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,318
Kamadeva loved music.

571
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,156
- Perhaps you should sing.
- [scoffs] I don't sing.

572
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,473
[singing] <i>Every day I find a way</i>

573
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,992
<i>To shove my past and anger down</i>

574
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,309
Go on, my love.

575
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,675
That was beautiful.

<i>My humor's dry

<i>Today, instead of closing off
I'm opening a door</i>

[both] <i>So now I'm tossing sense aside
And I surrender</i>

<i>To the fantasy and pleasure
I surrender</i>

<i>Do you have a ring? I'll try it
I surrender</i>

585
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,195
In the morning, we should go ask
the parson to marry us.

586
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,873
A Christian wedding?

587
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,872
For a Muslim woman and a Hindu man?

588
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,077
Let's not think with our heads,

589
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,117
but feel with our hearts.

590
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,517
Gideon, where's that music coming from?

591
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,354
[Gideon] I took the liberty
of broadcasting Miss Tomaz's comms.

Ha! It's rather infectious.

593
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,397
Ray, this music, I think it's magical.

594

You're right. I want to express
my feelings to you in verse.
