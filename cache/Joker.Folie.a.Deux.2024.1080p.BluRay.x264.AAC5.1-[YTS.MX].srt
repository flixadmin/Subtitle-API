I can see you every day
until you get out.

533
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,624
And then what?

534
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,920
We're gonna build a mountain.

535
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,676
Wait, wait.

536
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,148
You brought make-up.

537
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,277
I want to see the real you.

538
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,304
Look what they did to you.

539
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,472
It's just us now.

540
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,901
You need to stop taking your medication.

541
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,778
I already have.

542
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,383
Can you do it?

543
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,759
Yeah.

544
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,383
What's he gonna ask me about?

545
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,969
Besides... you know.

546
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,764
Well, hopefully, about your life in here,

547
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,351
and what the conditions
are really like in this place.

548
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,063
He might ask you about Lee.

549
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,442
She's been out there giving
a lot of interviews about you.

550
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,735
And about herself.

551
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,695
Good.

552
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,281
You know, I love her.

553
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,159
She gets me.

554
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,203
Two minutes. Paddy's ready.

555
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,038
Arthur.

556
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,001
This is a chance for you to show
a different side of yourself.

557
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,797
So the public can see who you really are.

558
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,132
And I don't think you should smoke.

559
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,634
I think it makes you look cavalier.

560
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,552
Okay.

561
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,637
We need to use this time

562
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,348
to show people that you're human.

563
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:44,020
They need to understand
you were sick. Delusional.

564
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,313
Mm-hm.

565
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,358
You're not Joker. You're Arthur Fleck.

566
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,777
Hm?

567
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,113
Don't worry. You're gonna be great.

568
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,618
Arthur.

569
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,792
Are you okay? It's--

570
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,128
It's not too late to cancel.

571
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:18,930
So, uh... you want me
to call you Arthur or The Joker?

572
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,057
Mr. Meyers,
you know we have an agreement.

573
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,892
You can't call him "Joker."

574
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,353
It's Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

575
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,940
- When you're ready, Paddy.

576
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,234
She has to leave now.

577
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,320
You can watch from behind the glass,
but you can't be in here.

578
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,823
Just be yourself.

579
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,376
- We rolling?
- Rolling.

580
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,505
Cameras up.

581
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,175
Two years ago, the name Arthur Fleck

582
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,469
hit Gotham like a hurricane.

583
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,763
An unassuming part-time party clown

584
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,890
and struggling stand-up comic,

585
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,810
Fleck committed five horrific murders

586
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,770
in the span of just four weeks.

587
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,691
And now, with hundreds
already lining up to get a seat

588
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,236
at one of the first trials
ever broadcast live on TV,

589
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,989
Arthur Fleck, The Joker,

590
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,199
is sitting down for his first interview

591
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,202
since that infamous night
on Murray Franklin.

592
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,831
And yes, we all know how that turned out.

593
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,753
- Arthur Fleck, welcome.

594
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,213
Hello.

595
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:39,093
Take me back to that night
onstage with Murray Franklin.

596
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,930
What was going through your mind...

597
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,683
when you pulled out that gun
and blew his brains out?

598
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,398
Well, Paddy, um...

599
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,696
I was going through a lot back then. Um...

600
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,909
I don't really remember much
from that night. I, uh...

601
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,870
blacked out, I saw bright lights.

602
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,247
I was having a hard time

603
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,958
knowing the difference
between what was real or not.

604
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,126
Oh, please.

605
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,420
You did it on live TV, pal.

606
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,047
Doesn't get any more real than that.

607
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,427
Paddy, all I remember from that night
is I was gonna kill myself.

608
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,845
On television.

609
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,849
I thought Murray
was playing a part in my show.

610
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,477
But he was a bad actor.

611
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,646
So he got what he deserved.

612
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,649
Your last joke, if we can call it a joke,

613
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,609
"You get what you bleeping deserve."

614
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,610
That's what you said.

615
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,321
That's not fun, that's not funny.

616
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,658
You're right, I...
I should have told a better one.

617
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,911
You're trying to be funny now?

618
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,412
No.

619
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,542
Do you deserve to die?

620
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,753
The DA is calling for the death penalty.

621
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,381
You just said that you wanted
to kill yourself on TV.

622
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,507
So, tell us...

623
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,343
...you still wanna die?

624
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,181
Well, at the time, it certainly
seemed a lot easier than living.

625
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,227
Um, but that's...
that's not me anymore.

626
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,436
That's not...

627
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,647
That's not who I am.

628
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,648
That wasn't really you.

629
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,191
No, that's not right.

630
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,234
Let me get this straight.

631
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,528
- That's not what I meant.
- So your defense is,

632
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,446
"It was The Joker who did it."

633
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,281
- An insanity defense.
- Okay, I don't--

634
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,741
I don't know about a defense.

635
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,077
That this alternate personality,

636
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,372
this killer clown in you killed Murray.

637
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,333
Who am I speaking to now?
Which one of you is here?

638
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:37,294
The poor, low 1Q Arthur Fleck?

639
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,797
Or The Joker, who goaded
a bunch of no-good punks--

640
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,674
Do you really care?

641
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,676
You don't.

642
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,137
You're just like Murray.

643
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,806
You're just like everyone.
You want sensationalism.

644
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,057
You don't care about...

645
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,184
You just wanna talk about my mistakes.

646
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,811
You wanna talk about the things
that I did in the past.

647
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,271
Not about who I am now.

648
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,606
Not how I'm different now.

649
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,403
That's what we should be
talking about, Paddy.

650
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,239
Okay, okay.

651
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,576
- We should take a break.
- We're not taking a break.

652
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,535
All right.

653
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:16,459
Okay, so, tell us...
what's changed, Arthur?

654
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,463
Well, I'll tell you what's changed, Paddy.

655
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,716
I'm not alone anymore.

656
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,135
Right.

657
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:30,097
The girl who was singing.
The night you tried to escape.

658
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,349
We weren't trying to escape.

659
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,768
Miss Harley Quinzel.

660
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,272
You two put on
quite a performance that night.

661
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,607
Aww...

662
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,861
She's really something, isn't she?

663
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,863
You tell me.

664
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,532
I mean, don't you think it's all...

665
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,578
...don't you think it's a little too much?

666
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,915

We'll be back
with more of Arthur Fleck

693
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,344
after a word from our sponsors.

694
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,018
The murder trial of Arthur Fleck

695
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,395
will begin today.

696
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,815
Assistant DA, Harvey Dent,
is preparing his opening remarks

697
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,317
in what some are calling,
"The Trial of the Century."

698
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,610
After months of protests,

699
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,446
police will be on high alert,
closing surrounding streets,

700
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,908
and setting up barricades for crowds
that could reach in the thousands.

701
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,368
If you ask me, this is what you get

702
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,996
when there's a complete
breakdown of social services.

703
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,165
And don't get me started
on this media frenzy.

704
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,875
All right, Denise, you're on the air.

705
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:30,212
Thank you for taking my call.
Enough is enough.

706
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:34,633
This idiot doesn't deserve a trial.
He should be sent straight to the chair.

707
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,302
An example should be made out of him.

Shh! Shh! There he is.

00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:00,737
Arthur Fleck...

726
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,656
Hey, shut the fuck up.

727
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:05,701
Arthur.

728
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,077
Milligan.

Arthur.

730
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,080
I'll split your head open.

00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,220
Yeah, Arthur.

732
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,391
He's looking good.

733
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,187
All rise.

734
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,813
This court is now in session.

735
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,441
The Honorable Judge
Herman Rothwax is presiding.

736
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,946
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

737
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,157
Please be seated.

738
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,912
William, please invite the jury in.

739
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,672
Are you all right, Mr. Fleck?

740
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,301
Everything okay?

741
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,222
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm just looking for someone.

742
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,310
Please, Mr. Fleck, sit down.

743
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,815
I realize there's a lot going on.

744
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,443
But this is still a court of law.

745
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,696
Any and all outbursts
will not be tolerated.

746
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,574
And that applies
to everyone in this courtroom.

763
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,365
It's my view that there is
absolutely no evidence

764
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:54,077
that Arthur Fleck suffers from
multiple personality disorder.

765
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:58,749
Or that he ever behaved
in the role of "Joker,"

766
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:03,837
as a separate personality
dissociated from himself.

767
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,590
Doctor, in your opinion,

768
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,301
concerning the work you did on this case,

769
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:14,598
do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers
from a mental disease or defect?

770
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,225
No. In my opinion,

771
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:22,189
he's not psychotic
or unable to test reality.

772
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,192
I think he was sane
when he committed these crimes.

773
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:29,905
In fact, I believe he fakes
his mental illness.

774
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,033
Quiet.

775
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,914
And... if he's, uh...

776
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,501
...faking it, as you say,

777
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,836
then what is your opinion

778
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,298
on the defendant's mental condition?

779
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:51,009
I believe he has four relatively minor

780
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,845
and quite common mental disorders

781
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:57,474
that involve long-standing sadness,

782
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:01,812
narcissistic self-centeredness,
friendlessness,

783
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,606
an indifference to the feelings of others.

784
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,109
This is a very disturbed individual.

785
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:12,364
But I can't give you any kind
of psychiatric defense for him.

786
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,616
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

787
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,452
Nothing further, Your Honor.

788
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,081
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

789
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:22,541
Thank you.

790
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,796
Doctor Liu, good morning.

791
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,005
Morning.

792
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,342
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

793
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,052
About two hours.

794
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,637
About two hours.

795
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,598
It was actually 89 minutes.

796
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,686
Tell me, how can you say for certain,

797
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,896
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

798
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,151
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

799
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,361
that this "Joker"

800
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:55,824
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

801
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,160
That that's not who he is.

802
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:01,538
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

803
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:06,501
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

804
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,713
And in my view, it's just a performance.

805
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,340
Did you read the records

806
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,468
from the Department of Social Services...

807
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:19,598
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

808
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,975
they returned him to his abuser's home?

809
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,188
- His mother's home.

810
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,023
I did, yes.

811
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:32,235
And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

812
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,947
did you ask him why Social Services

813
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,575
didn't believe the horrific stories

814
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,453
a seven-year-old boy told them

815
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,498
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

816
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,005
No, I... I didn't ask him about that.

817
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,840
Hmm.

818
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,510
So you want us to believe,

819
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:02,891
that after spending
just 89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

820
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:07,103
and reading through his records and tests

821
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:10,857
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

822
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:16,071
you want us to believe
that you can say with absolute certainty

823
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,659
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

824
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,038
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

825
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,541
and create another identity

826
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:33,713
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

827
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,758
from all the trauma and abuse he suffered?

828
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,429
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

829
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,641
when he was attacked and tormented

830
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,061
by three drunk bullies on the subway?

831
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,276
"After I woke up this morning,

832
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,779
I thought, ‘Murray, Murray, Murray.'

833
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,448
And then there's Murray.

834
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,033
Funny, right?

835
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,494
Then I remember Sophie.

836
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,997
- I had anoth--"
- Objection. Your Honor...

837
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,125
Again, my client's personal diary
is privileged.

838
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,376
Overruled.

839
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,671
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane
limits her comments

840
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,089
to Mr. Fleck's journals--

841
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,674
But these are my own
personal private jokes.

842
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:18,884
They weren't meant to be read out loud.

843
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,635
- Mr. Fleck. Quiet!

844
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,015
These are your words
she's reading.

845
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,143
And it's up to the jury to determine
what to make of them.

846
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,063
Please proceed.

847
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,358
Ms. Kane, please continue reading

848
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,278
from the, uh... the highlighted portion.

849
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,114
"Then I remember Sophie.

850
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,242
Had another dream about her. Forgot it.

851
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,454
I almost never dream.

852
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,831
What do I gotta do to remember?"

853
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,500
That's Sophie Dumond,
Mr. Fleck's neighbor,

854
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,711
whom he was obsessed with.

855
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:55,712
What was that date?

856
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,256
November 17.

857
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,509
Let the record show,

858
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,638
November 17th is the day that Mr. Fleck

859
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,349
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer to death.

860
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:14,356
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

861
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,653
Now, I know it's not
your area of expertise,

862
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,989
but you have read all
of Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?

863
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,407
Yes, I have.

864
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,077
And in your opinion,

865
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,538
does this sound like a different voice?

866
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:36,294
Like a different, uh...
personality wrote this?

867
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,547
No, it sounds like Arthur.

868
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:41,967
Go on.

869
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,220
He often wrote about his fantasies.

870
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:52,143
And... the... women he had
imaginary relationships with.

871
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:56,272
And of course, his jokes.

872
01:02:56,356 --> 01:03:00,735
There were always a lot of... these...

873
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,988
these unfunny jokes.

874
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,408
She's just a social worker.

875
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,118
I don't think she's even qualified--

876
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,328
You know, you're making him out
to be a fucking idiot in there.

877
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:14,040
He's never gonna get out
if you keep this shit up.

878
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,626
Ask her why she has me
sitting so far away from him.

879
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,087
Let's not do this here. Please?

880
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,006
Do you see all those people out front?

881
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,632
Who do you think they're here for?

882
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,843
How many T-shirts is Arthur Fleck on?

883
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,470
How many signs?

884
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:28,763
It's the Trial of the Century

885
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,349
and she doesn't even know
who her own client is.

886
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,019
- What do you mean by that?
- Can't you see how sick he is?

887
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,104
How much help he needs?

888
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,314
He's not sick.

889
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:41,234
He's perfect.

890
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,654
You don't really think he's just gonna
walk out of here, do you?

891
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,656
Yeah, he's gonna walk
right outta here.

892
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,909
- With me by his side.
- And then what?

893
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,996
Any further statements?

894
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,914
And then we're gonna build a mountain.

895
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,417
- A what?
- From a little hill.

896
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,170
- What does that even mean?

897
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,880
- Are you going to get married?
- Move!

898
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,341
You're not listening.

899
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,969
We can win this case,
and she's gonna fuck it all up.

900
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,388
No, you're not listening.

901
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,057
Lee's looking out for me.

902
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,352
She understands what I've been through.

903
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,979
What are you talking about?

904
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,857
We're from the same neighborhood.

905
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:25,278
She lost her father. You know...
her mom was awful to her.

906
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,821
She had her committed.

907
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,449
So just give her a break.

908
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,328
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

909
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,662
I know.

910
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,332
But she didn't grow up
in your neighborhood.

911
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,502
She lives on the Upper West Side
with her parents.

912
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,671
Her father is not dead, he's a doctor.

913
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,342
She voluntarily committed herself
to the hospital,

914
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:50,386
and then just checked herself out
when she wanted to.

915
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,639
She didn't check herself out.

916
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,598
Arthur.

917
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,684
I was a bad influence on her,
so they separated us.

918
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,357
Did she mention she went
to grad school for psychiatry?

919
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,360
You wouldn't get it.

920
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:10,115
My point is she's playing you for a fool.

921
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,201
I'm sorry, I just--

922
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,913
I know what it's like to love somebody.

923
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,749
But I don't think you can believe
a word she says.

924
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:31,010
From NCB Studios
in Gotham City.

925

Well, you weren't even looking
at me anymore.

948
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,103
You were making it all about yourself.

949
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,606
- And the song...

950
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,067
is about loving me!

951
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,196
Now look who's making it
all about themselves.

952
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,614
- Oh...

953
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,866
So you're saying it's not about us?

954
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,370
It is, but we're singing for them.

955
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,622
- That's why we're here, honey.

956
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,875
Oh! 'Cause I got this sneaking suspicion

957
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,503
that we're not giving the people
what they want.

958
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,922
It's okay baby, you're right.

959
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,509
Let's give the people what they want.

960
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,930
Music. Let's take it from the top.

961
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,814
Is the honeymoon over?

962
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,073
What?

963
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,869
Why'd you-- Why'd you do that?

964
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,630
Pew!

965
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,882
Pew!

966
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,885
- Get Healey.
- Pew!

967
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,806
- Ba-room!

968
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,230
Well, look at you.

969
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:32,859
Couple of weeks back on TV
and already acting like you own the joint.

970
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,445
What the fuck are you two doing
sitting on our bleachers?

971
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,280
Who said they're your bleachers?

972
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,824
Ricky, what the fuck has gotten into you?

973
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,577
You heard me. Up.

974
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,079
Guess who I just saw out front?

975
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,207
Your little lady friend.

976
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,586
All right, enough. Get up, both of you.

977
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,088
Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.

978
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,218
See, Arthur? What'd I tell ya?

979
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,263
Move it!

980
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,768
Every day, this asshole.

981
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,694
You're a real
fucking whack job, Fleck.

982
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,573
Uh-uh!

983
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:35,880
Hey.

984
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,256
Five minutes.

985
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,596
How are you holding up?

986
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,235
Is everything okay?

987
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,202
Did you-- Did you lie to me?

988
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,541
Sure.

989
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,293
I mean, everybody lies a little.

990
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,175
And you're not
from the same neighborhood as me?

991
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,678
And your...
your dad's a doctor?

992
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,930
You're rich?

993
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,976
I just wanted you to like me.

994
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,526
Did you really check yourself in here?

995
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,446
Yeah.

996
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,452
That's crazy.

997
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:53,583
Just... because you wanted to meet me?

998
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,793
Just to meet you.

999
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,550
You could have just wrote me a letter.

1000
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,971
And said what? I'm nobody.

1001
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,349
I haven't done anything
with my life like you have.

1002
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:17,690
Did you really watch that TV movie
they made about me 20 times?

1003
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,735
Um... probably more like four or five.

1004
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,783
Was it actually good,
or did you lie about that too?

1005
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,827
It was great.

1006
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:41,672
My lawyer... says you're
playing me for a fool.

1007
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,634
I'm no fool.

1008
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,221
Can't you see what she's doing?

1009
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,806
They're laughing at you in there.

1010
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,561
She doesn't care about you.

1011
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:58,814
I do.

1012
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,402
Do you know I moved
into your old apartment building

1013
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,197
to make us a home for when you get out?

1014
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,533
- Did your lawyer tell you that?

1015
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,953
- You did?

1016
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,080
- l don't want to live there.

1017
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,086
I'm pregnant.

1018
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,634

Or your daughter?

1047
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,459
I did, yes.

1048
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,922
You believed he was dangerous.

1049
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,926
Well, he broke into my apartment.

1050
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,054
You call the police?

1051
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,515
No.

1052
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,853
His mother told me, uh...

1053
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,689
that he'd had problems
his whole life, but that he...

1054
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,399
wouldn't hurt a fly.

1055
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:32,361
And...

1056
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:38,117
...was the man who broke
into your apartment that night,

1057
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:44,331
was he different in any way
from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

1058
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,209
I didn't really know him.

1059
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,881
I saw him in the lobby,
the elevator a few times.

1060
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,842
Like I said,
I knew his mother a little bit.

1061
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,428
She was really sweet to my daughter.

1062
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,805
And Ms. Dumond,

1063
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:03,476
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1064
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,855
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1065
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:12,067
Well, after Arthur did what he did,

1066
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,488
the press wanted to talk to me about it.

1067
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:18,157
And then I was a character

1068
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,118
in that awful TV movie they made, and...

1069
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,329
- It was awful?
- Then all these people...

1070
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,330
No.

1071
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,957
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1072
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:31,128
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1073
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,672
blaming me for what happened to Arthur.

1074
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,260
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1075
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:39,595
We moved out of the city.

1076
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:43,516
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1077
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,726
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1078
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,980
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1079
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:54,026
Maybe they wouldn't be dead now if I did.

1080
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,364
Thank you. No more questions.

1081
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,700
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

1082
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,454
Ms. Dumond.

1083
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,750
What happened after you asked Arthur

1084
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:12,086
to leave your apartment that night?

1085
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:16,131
He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

1086
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:20,511
So, he never hurt or even threatened
you or your daughter?

1087
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:22,972
No.

1088
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:27,434
And did you watch him on TV
on Murray Franklin the following week?

1089
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,144
I did.

1090
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,064
And did that seem
like the same man

1091
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,191
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

1092
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:38,571
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

1093
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,991
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

1094
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,161
And while Arthur's mother

1095
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:49,415
was being so sweet to your daughter,

1096
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,709
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1097
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,423
Um...

1098
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,635
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1099
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:04,221
and that he lived in a fantasy world

1100
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,182
and that he had this laugh.

1101
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,643
She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

1102
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,937
That's what she called it.

1103
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,106
"His dumb laugh.”

1104
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,566
Yes.

1105
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,193
What else did she tell you?

1106
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:24,241
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1107
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,494
So that he would feel better about it.

1108
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,998
So that he would stop crying,
so that he wouldn't kill himself.

1109
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,042
What was the story?

1110
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:37,046
That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1111
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,633
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

1112
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,176
And?

1113
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,762
And she...

1114
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,972
couldn't believe that
he based his whole life

1115
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,891
around this made-up story.

1116
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:52,519
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

1117
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,982
She made fun of him
for doing that?

1118
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,859
She just thought
it was ridiculous

1119
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:00,277
that he thought
he could make people laugh.

1120
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,446
I mean, she said Arthur
wasn't funny at all.

1121
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,033
Did she tell you
that he had been

1122
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:08,369
in and out of institutions his whole life?

1123
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,329
Yes.

1124
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,666
Did she say
anything else about him?

That he had never had a girlfriend

1156
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:12,719
and she thought he was probably a virgin.

1157
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:13,971
I can't do this.

1158
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,224
- Oh! I can't do this anymore!

1159
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,101
Your Honor, may I approach
the bench, please?

1160
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,310
No, you may not.

1161
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:21,395
I want to fire my lawyer.

1162
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,604
It's about time!

1163
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:23,605
Excuse me?

1164
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,274
- I'd like to represent myself.

1165
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,441
You're fired.

1166
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:29,361
Arthur, don't do this. This is real.

1167
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,113
- You'd better believe it's real.

1168
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,448
I want order in my court. Order!

1169
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:38,579
Bailiff! Take Mr. Fleck
to his holding cell!

1170
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:41,540
Order!

1171
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:47,296
I want to see all counsel
in my chambers immediately!

1172
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,141
This way? Thank you.

1173
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,355
Hey, no touching.

1174
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,859
I'm so fucking proud of you.

1175
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:18,702
You should see it out there.
They're all going crazy for you.

1176
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:22,873
You did it.

1177
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,963
I know, but maybe I should read
a law book or something.

1178
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,842
You know I never went to high school?

1179
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,597
I said, no touching.

1180
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,772
You can do anything you want.

1181
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,983
You're Joker.

1182
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,677
Good evening,
it's 48 degrees at 6:00

1183
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,512
on this Wednesday, November 8th.

1184
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,265
I'm Stan L. Brooks
and here's what's happening.

1185
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:22,849
Shocking developments at the trial

1186
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:25,060
of Arthur Fleck downtown today.

1187
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:28,105
Fleck, the accused Killer,
also known as Joker,

1188
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:32,901
interrupted testimony and fired his lawyer
Maryanne Stewart in open court.

1189
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,903
Then he kissed her goodbye.

1190
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,989
Afterwards, Fleck
was extensively questioned

1191
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,157
by Judge Herman Rothwax.

1192
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,618
The right of self-representation

1193
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:45,247
is not a license to abuse
the dignity of the courtroom.

1194
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,916
Can you control your emotions, Mr. Fleck?

1195
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,251
Yes, sir.

1196
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,794
Judge Rothwax reluctantly

1197
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,422
approved Fleck's request
to represent himself,

1198
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:56,133
as long as he agreed to stand-by counsel.

1199
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,302
A decision that both Fleck's
now former attorney,

1200
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:02,681
Maryanne Stewart and Assistant DA,
Harvey Dent disagree with.

1201
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,891
It's really tragic.

1202
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:07,561
Arthur believes he has
all of these supporters,

1203
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,896
but they don't care about him.

1204
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,815
They care about Joker.

1205
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,776
He's not dealing with reality.

1206
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,945
He's mentally ill.

1207
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,655
If we could have
just convinced him of that

1208
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,407
then we would have won this case.

1209
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,117
Fleck knows what he's doing.

1210
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,744
He knows he's losing.

1211
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,288
We cannot forget that he's evil.

1212
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,874
This is all just part of his plan.

1213
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:32,002
The Arthur Fleck trial
will resume on Monday morning.

1214
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,087
In other news, Mayor Thorndike...

1215
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,050
- There he is.

1216
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,760
All right, calm down, everybody.

1217
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,178
Hey, shut the fuck up!

1218
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:43,764
Sit down. Sit down.

1219
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,184
- Fleck, get off. Arthur!
- Yeah, Arthur!

1220
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,353
Hey, come on. Get off the table.

1221
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:51,188

1242
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,801
After reviewing all the case law
that offers precedent,

1243
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:06,221
Jensen v. Superior Court
being the most relevant,

1244
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,974
I have reluctantly decided

1245
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,935
that Mr. Fleck does have the right

1246
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,397
as an attorney,
to dress himself how he likes...

1247
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,108
- ...as long as he doesn't cause disorder

1248
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:21,528
or interfere with
the functioning of the Court.

1249
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:26,992
I will not allow this proceeding
to become as unruly as it is outside.

1250
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,912
And I will not let you turn this
into any more of a circus

1251
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:31,997
than you already have.

1252
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,499
- Thank you.

1253
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,627
Mr. Dent, call your next witness.

1254
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:44,009
The State calls Gary Puddles.

1255
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:45,844
Bailiff?

1256
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,096
Will you please escort
Mr. Puddles to the stand?

1257
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:10,368
Gary.

1258
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,499
Go get 'em.

1259
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,568
Please raise your right hand.

1260
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:47,614
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony

1261
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:49,324
you're about to give is the whole truth

1262
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:52,077
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1263
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,370
I do.

1264
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,583
Good morning, Mr. Puddles.

1265
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,585
- Thank you for being here.

1266
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,591
So one last question, sir.

1267
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,302
The person who you saw

1268
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:11,805
stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer to death,

1269
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,308
are they in this courtroom here today?

1270
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:16,309
Yes.

1271
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,853
Can you point him out to all of us?

1272
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:23,191
And... describe his clothing?

1273
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:27,404
He's... He's sitting right there
at the table.

1274
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:30,907
Wearing a red suit and clown make-up.

1275
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,702
- May the record reflect

1276
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,329
the identification
of the accused, Your Honor?

1277
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,039
Yes, it will.

1278
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,458
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1279
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,380
Your witness, Mr. Fleck.

1280
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,474
Mr. Puddles.

1281
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,812
Gary Puddles?

1282
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:06,026
Tell me, sir, is that your God-given name?

1283
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:08,486
Yes.

1284
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:10,113
Really?

1285
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:14,117
Really?
Your last name is Puddles?

1286
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:20,457
Why, it sounds like a... a joke.

1287
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:21,958
Well, it's not.

1288
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:26,796
You expect us to believe
that your last name is Puddles?

1289
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,214
- Puddles?

1290
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:30,925
Mr. Fleck, where is this going?

1291
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:35,138
As I said, I'm not gonna let you
turn my courtroom into a circus.

1292
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,431
Okay.

1293
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,684
But, um, with all due respect, Your Honor,

1294
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,770
don't you think
it's a little late for that?

1295
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,772
- Don't try my patience.
- Okay. Okay.

1296
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:49,235
Mr. Puddles...

1297
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:53,281
earlier this afternoon you testified

1298
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,618
that you saw me stab Mr. Kliman Manhoff

1299
01:30:56,701 --> 01:31:00,205
in the neck a couple of times. Correct?

1300
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:01,956
Kleinmanhoffer.

1301
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,043
Yes, I saw you.

1302
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,419
Mm.

1303
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:10,048
And what else did you see that day?

1304
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,302
You stabbing him in the eye,

1305
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,971
and bashing his head into the wall,

1306
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:19,474
many, many times.

1307
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:24,771
Yes, but, uh, Randall
was a bit of a bully, wasn't he?

1308
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,899
He didn't deserve to die.

1309
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,778
- l don't know.

1310
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,238
Eh, never mind.

1311
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,990
Gary, did you catch my act

1312
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,493
on The Murray Franklin Show
later that night?

1313
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,328
No, I didn't.

1314
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:41,329
No?

1315
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:45,834
Might I remind you
that you are under oath?

1316
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,002
I was locked up at the police station.

1317
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:49,504
In an interview room.

1318
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,091
‘Cause they thought
you might come and kill me.

1319
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:55,635
I was the only witness.

1320
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:57,679
They kept me in there all night.

1321
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,766
Isn't that convenient, Mr. Puddles?

1322
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,894
That you didn't see the show,
you didn't see anything I had to say,

1323
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:06,521
I can't believe it!

1324
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:07,814
Mr. Fleck.

1325
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:09,858
Okay.

1326
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,320
Uh, when you were
in my mama's apartment,

1327
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:16,114
God rest her soul,

1328
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:20,493
when, as you say, you saw me
bash Mr. Klannonmen--

1329
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:25,498
whatever's-- head into the wall,
"many, many times,"

1330
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,793
did I seem crazy to you?

1331
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:33,673
Did I seem like a different person?

1332
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:40,764
Or was I the same old Joker
that I always been?

1333
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:45,310
Arthur, don't do this
to yourself, it isn't you.

1334
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:49,314
It isn't me?
So you don't think this is me?

1335
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:53,401
Well, maybe... maybe...
you don't know who I really was.

1336
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,489
I never saw that side of you.

1337
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,532
Well, maybe you weren't looking.

1338
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,785
Maybe no one was.

1339
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:05,663
Because nobody knew I existed.

1340
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,374
But look around, look at all these people.

1341
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:11,920
Everyone outside. These cameras.

1342
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:15,298
Who do you think they see, Mr. Puddles?

1343
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,134
Joker.

1344
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,597
Oh, sweet child,

1345
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:28,645
what you have proven here today,
is that you are no different

1346
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,815
than any of those people
that underestimated me.

1347
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:33,650
From Murray Franklin,

1348
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:38,238
to those goddamn fat,
stupid guards at Arkham.

1349
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,698
They think that
they can treat me like trash.

1350
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,325
But I will no longer allow you,

1351
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,369
or you, or you,

1352
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,580
or any of you to keep me down.

1353
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:50,124
- l am free!

1354
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,840
Why are you doing this
to me, Arthur?

1355
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:58,299
What?

1356
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,385
Gary, I like you.

1357
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,888
I told you I wouldn't hurt you,
and I didn't.

1358
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:05,348
Not hurt me?

1359
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:08,977
I couldn't go back to work.

1360
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:14,107
I still can't sleep,
and I'm scared all the time.

1361
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,901
I never used to be scared.

1362
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:21,948
I'm scared right now, here.
With you in front of me.

1363
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:27,078
I couldn't do anything that day.

1364
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:30,123
I felt so small.

1365
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,669
I was reminded
how powerless I really am.

1366
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:39,215
Oh... you got
a flair for the dramatic.

1367
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:42,302
You are tugging at
my heart strings, little Gary.

1368
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,141
No more-- no more questions, Your Honor.

1369
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,936
Do you know what that feels like, Arthur?

1370
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,521
Oh, fuck!

1371
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:57,734
You were the only one at work
who never made fun of me.

1372
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,237
You were the only one
that was nice to me.

1373
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:07,076
I said, no more questions, Your Honor!

1374
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:13,207
Very well, Mr. Puddles.

1375
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,418
The court thanks you for your testimony.

1376
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,547
Please step down, you're excused.

1377
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,939
Mr. Dent, call your next witness.

1378
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:40,693
We're not calling
any more witnesses, Your Honor.

1379
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,488
That is the State's case.

1380
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,781
The State rests.

1381
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,574
Very well.

1382
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,160
All right, Mr. Fleck,

1383
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:52,205
at this point, you may mount your defense.

1384
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,460
The defense rests as well, Your Honor.

1385
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,171
Pardon?

1386
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,634
Mr. Fleck, you don't want
to put on any defense?

1387
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,637
No, Your Honor. The defense rests.

1388
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,306
"Th-Th-Th-That's all folks."

1389
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:12,558
- All right, all right.

1390
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,186
All right.

1391
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,399
That's enough!
This is a court of law!

1392
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,987
With both sides having rested,

1393
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:29,033
this court will recess
until tomorrow morning at 9:30.

1394
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,786
You made our case
for us, you fucking idiot!

1395
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:33,621
You're gonna fry
for killing my son!

1396
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:34,539
Burn in hell!

1397
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:35,623
Anything you want to say?

1398
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:37,125
Arthur, will you be convicted?

1399
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,084
Arthur, over here.

1400
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,168
Let's see that smile.

1401
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:40,837
Where do you think you stand, Arthur?

I told him,
"I'm not dealing with those days."

1455
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:16,427
I'm only working four of these days.

1456

You wanna-- You wanna hear a joke, right?

1488
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:19,550
- You really think...

01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:21,093
...fancy red suit

1490
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:23,554

01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:33,022
Let me tell you one I used to do
about my mother.

1494
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:34,398
You can drop the act now.

1495
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:35,733
- My mother was...
- Because we know

1496
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,735
it's only Arthur in there, okay?

1497
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:40,279
And she only dated abusive guys.

1498
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:41,364
Yeah, is that right?

1499
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,491
And, I asked her, I said,

1500
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:47,703
"Mom, why do you stay
with your abusive boyfriend?"

1501
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,580
And she said...

1502
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,290
"Beats the hell out of me."

1503
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,210
I told you to drop it.

1504
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:57,254
Oh, he liked it!

1505
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:05,096
Oh, Jackie...

1506
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,139
aren't you gonna buy me a drink first?

1507

01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:37,576
A word of caution.
This is not a comedy club.

1562
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,703
You are not onstage.

1563
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:03,435
Excuse me.

1564
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:07,898
Do you need a short recess, sir?

1565
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:30,462
l... I wanted to come out here as Joker.

1566
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:36,844
And I was gonna go on a... an angry rant.

1567
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,138
And blame all of you,

1568
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,223
and everyone...

1569
01:48:44,685 --> 01:48:47,896

01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,318

1573
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:12,629

1574

02:06:29,248 --> 02:06:30,666
Yeah, I can make it quick.

1767
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:32,502
Okay.

1768
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,588
So, a psychopath walks into a bar,

1769
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:38,508
and sees this famous clown
sitting there all alone.

1770
02:06:39,008 --> 02:06:40,551
Totally drunk, it's pathetic.

1771
02:06:41,469 --> 02:06:43,596
"I can't believe you're here," he says.

1772
02:06:44,138 --> 02:06:49,101
"What a disappointment.
I used to watch you on TV.

1773
02:06:50,478 --> 02:06:52,188
What can I get you?"

1774
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:54,398
And this clown turns and says,

1775
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:58,778
"Well, if you're buying
you can get me anything."

1776
02:07:01,072 --> 02:07:03,366
"Perfect," the psychopath says.

1777
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,660
"How about I get you
what you fucking deserve?"

1778
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,483
