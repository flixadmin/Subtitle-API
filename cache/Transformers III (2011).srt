Mr. McNamara,
the President is expecting you.

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,521
We believe a UFO has crashed
into the Moon.

31
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,636
We think the Russians are onto it
as well.

32
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,355
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,747
We need to get to the moon.

34
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,700
We are going to attempt
a manned mission.

35
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,698
NASA said it would take 5 years.

You get there before the Russians.

<i>Ok, I am gonna step off the LEM now.</i>

76
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,225
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

78
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,315
Are we good?
Yes sir.

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,030

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,112
Eagle, we are getting a signal interference.

83
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,139
Do you copy?

84
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,766
<i>We now have had confirmation</i>

85
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,916
<i>of loss of signal</i>

86
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,782

89
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,054
Mission is a go.

90
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,741
We have 21 minutes.

91
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,732
Oh my God.

92
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,906
<i>It's some sort of giant metal face.</i>

Jesus.

00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:56,988
Control,

95
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,291
we are inside the ship.

96
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,610
Extensive damage.

97
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,633
Way too big to check the entire ship.

98
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,498
Everything is dead in here, Houston.

99
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,058
No signs of life anywhere.

100
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,826
These things are massive.

101
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,349
We copy.

102
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:26,606
You have got 7 minutes on your oxygen.

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,989
We are not alone after all, are we?

104
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,587
No sir.

105
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,100
We are not alone.

106
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,192
<i>Go ahead, Mr. President.</i>

107
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,738
<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.</i>

108
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,488
<i>I am talking to you by telephone

109
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,218
<i>Oval Room at the White House.</i>

110
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:45,668
<i>And this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.</i>

111
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,793
<i>I just can't tell you
how proud we all are of you.</i>

112
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,880
<i>For every American, this has to be
the proudest day of our lives.</i>

113
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,928
<i>Because of what you have done...</i>

114
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,434
<i>We have splashdown.</i>

115
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,927
<i>The heavens,</i>

116
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,841
<i>have become a part of man's world.</i>

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,185
<i>For one priceless moment,</i>

118
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,312
<i>in the whole history of man</i>

119
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,400
<i>all the people on this Earth are truly one.</i>

120
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,530
<i>One in their pride in what you have done.</i>

121
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,625
<i>It inspires us to redouble our efforts</i>

122
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,234
<i>to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.</i>

123
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,605
My hero needs to wake up.

124
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:20,663
What is that?

125
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,131
This is your new lucky bunny.

126
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,892
It's a beautiful thought Carly,
but I don't think it's the whole...

127
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:33,624
bunny that's lucky.
You see, it's just this section here.

128
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:36,327
You see, it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.

129
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,026
Well, it's just a good luck charm.

130
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,359
To help you think positive?

131
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,197
Today is important.

132
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,345
Come on, get up.

133
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,995
Hey, wear that nice tie.
Yeah.

134
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,033
You need any money for lunch?

135
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,583
No, I don't need any money for lunch.

136
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,333
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

137
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,212
You love it, don't you?

138
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:00,801
I am just your American boy toy.

139
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,105
A lover boy toy.

140
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,527
You know how demoralizing it is
to have saved the world twice

141
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:06,901
and still be groveling for a job?

142
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,167
People don't know
you saved the world, Sam.

143
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,978
I mean, I do. I believe you.

144
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,975
The government knows. I mean, they could
hook me up with a job right here in D.C.

145
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,813
I mean, I should be working
with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

146
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,023
Come on, they paid for your college.

147
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,114
The President gave you a hero medal.

148
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,555
Thank you, man. Great job.

149
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,999
That's the cooties thing
that ever happened to me.

150
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,070
Alright guys.

151
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,645
What the fuck!

152
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,340
And as I recall, that was not even
the highlight of your day.

153
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,208
Mr. Ambassador, here.

154
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,951
British Embassy, you are up next.

155
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,947
No, you don't wear it.
Is not...

156
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:48,886
See, you have got to...
Would I...

157
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:49,833
The box.
Because I...

158
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,108
I could not, even if I wanted to.

159
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,682
You are supposed to leave it
in the box, right?

160
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,156
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

161
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,026
Oh, yeah. My medal.

162
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:05,715
You know who gave that to me?

163
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,071
Who?

164
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,530
Potus.

165
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,824
President of the United States.

166
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:17,070
Babe, it's hard for everybody to get a job.

167
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,418
I don't have time. You see, my parents
are gonna be here in a week

168
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,351
on their road trip Partybus World Tour.

169
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,946
If my dad gets here
and I don't have a job,

170
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,516
he is gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.

171
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,524
Alright, tonight, I will give you a job.

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,554
Romance me with a nice dinner,

173
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:34,019
and maybe you can get that bonus.

174
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,685
Get lucky.
Get him out of here.

175
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,423
Wait. No, no, no, no.

176
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,984
Oh, he is gross!

177
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:46,279
She is good.
Sorry.

178
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,932
They are stranded here.
Somebody is got to watch out for them.

179
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,289
Yesterday, that one was
in my underwear drawer.

180
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,246
Did research. Looking real good, too.

181
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,081
No need to hit me man.

182
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,842
You are not a normal boyfriend.
That's what you love about me.

183
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,444
Crybaby.
We are not at the love word yet.

184
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,381
Maybe a little bit closer when you are
covering your half of the rent.

185
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,420
Good-bye.

186
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,299
Fricking shorting my circuits out here!

187
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,425
It's inhumane, what it is!

188
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,844
Make us live in a box on a balcony,

189
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:14,330
right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!

190
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,459
Stop, ok?

191
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,692
You and your creepy sidekick
can't be in here without permission.

192
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,794
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?

193
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,435
Giddy-up, little doggie!

194
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,524
Yo Brains, wassup?

195
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,111
Doing good.

196
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,778
Shit, I seen this one.

197
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:30,645
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

198
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:33,732
You know Sam, I don't know
about moving in with this chick.

199
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:36,069
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

200
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:37,924
She was mean. Didn't like her.

201
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,647
Us guys got to stick together.

202
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,174
We are family

203
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,092
No, we are not family.
You are a political refugee,

204
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,671
and I have finally found someone
who appreciates me for me.

205
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,555
Well, you tell her
that we are not your pets,

206
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,931
and we are not your toys!

207
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,425
Alright? We are an advanced, genius
alien race, just looking for a home.

208
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,192
Maybe it was not such a good idea.
Didn't have to stop.

209
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,888
Come on.
What are they going to do, tow it?

210
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,359
Where is he?

211
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,419
Sammy!

212
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,241
Come on, that's funny!
Sam.

213
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,618
I missed you guys so much.

214
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,540
Sure, you did. What do you think?

215
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,867
Look at that.
Cute.

216
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,418
You look old.
Stop it.

217
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,530
Feel like I can see the end.

218
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:20,770
I love your little tie.
Hey, where is my girl?

219
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:22,410
Where is my beautiful Carly?
She is at work Ma.

220
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,676
She is got a new job. You guys said
you were gonna be here in a week.

221
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,621
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?
We just hauled ass in this thing.

222
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,557
We stopped for gas.
This thing. The love tub, it flies.

223
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,414
Are we keeping you from something?
Like say...

224
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,661
your job?

225
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,018
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.

226
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,229
I have job interviews.

227
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,310
That's good.

228
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,050
That sucks.
Stop it.

229
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,122
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you are in D.C.

230
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,387
You are here with your son
and your family.

231
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,368
I mean, it's a good time.
It sucks that you don't have a job.

232
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:53,005
Yeah, but there is good things
to do here too, right?

233
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:55,044
Right? Museums and monuments, ok?

234
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,919
I will see you tonight.
I am bagging the gift.

235
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,564
Sam, I think for an interview
you should wear real pants.

236
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,591
I think for life, you should wear real pants.

237
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,290
What happened to Bumblebee?
Jesus...

238
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,501
He is off on his missions.
I had to get this for backup.

239
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,294
Your car has a job?

240
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:09,303
Stop.

241
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,002
What does it change into?

242
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,369
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.

243
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,350
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.

244
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,442
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee,

245
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,265
If Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.

246
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,735
Come on, we will give you a ride!

247

255
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:12,856
And stay there!

<font color="#f4ff7a"><i>We work in secret teams

260
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,596
I am Voshkod,

261
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,369
General Counsel
with Ukrainian Department of Energy.

262
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,679
My government will officially deny

263
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,635
that we are having this conversation.

264
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,240
At one of our decommissioned facilities,
a discovery was made,

265
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,984
which I fear may be...

266
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,168
alien in nature.

267
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,617
The facility's name is Chernobyl.

268
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,256
Mr. Voshkod.

269
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,310
So, uninhabited since '86.

270
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,897
I hear it won't be livable again
for another 20,000 years?

271
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,318
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.

272
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,693
It's a tragedy.

273
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,198
This way.

274
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,764
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.

275
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,509
Watch your radiation levels.

276
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,795
Mr. Voshkod, where is your protective gear?

277
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,678
Where is your protective gear?

278
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,656
It would not matter.

279
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,476
For me, it's only a matter of time.

280
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,601
Through the school.

281
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,177
Yuri will take you below.

282
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,687
And one other thing, Colonel.

283
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:05,723
In private,

284
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,806
there were some energy experiments.

285
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:11,664
It can wait.

286
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,038
Keep moving. Stay tight.

287
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,204
Ok, right here.

288
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,038
I think I found it.

289
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,898
Optimus, we got a visual.

290
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:40,520
Looks like the object is clamped
in some kind of a metal harness.

291
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,926
What's this?

292
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:45,219
Guys!

293
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,187
Why does this thing have
Soviet space program markings on it?

294
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,395
Sputnik?

295
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,725
Energon readings, sir.

296
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,344
It's strong.

297
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,272
Below us.

298
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:57,895
It's coming fast.

299
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,448
Contact, contact!

300
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,025
Get topside now!

301
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:21,505
Move, move, move!

302
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,450
Let's go!

303
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,331
Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

304
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,162
Stay behind me!

305
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,567
Optimus!

306
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,380
Fall back!

307
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,883
It's circling around us!

308
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:07,973
It's taking our flank!

309
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,374
Get the heavy weapon!

310
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,314
Optimus!

311
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,131
What the hell was that thing?

312
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,077
That...

313
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,303
is Shockwave.

314
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,719
Why was he after this?

315
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,586
It's impossible.

316
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,843
This is an engine part

317
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:53,275
from a long lost Autobot ship.

318
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,749
Pleasure working with you.

319
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,549
Interviews. This is so exciting.

320
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,464
Honey, do you want some gum?

321
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,955
Your breath gets really gnarly
when you are nervous.

322
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,168
Mr. Witwicky?
Yeah. Search is over.

323
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,980
I am Mr. Whitley.

324
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,020
Mr...

325
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,610
Is anybody else joining?
No.

326
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:40,811
No?

327
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,200
You want me to move right there?

328
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,113
I will move right there.
I would prefer not.

329
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,196
Ready? Begin.

330
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,764
Graduated this year. Majored
in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies.

331
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,266
Very interested in government
and technology,

332
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,813
how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.

333
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:52,977
Shape the future.

334
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,494
Why did we bother sending him
to an Ivy college for?

335
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,246
3 months out of school
and he can't find a job?

336
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,830
Mr. Masuhisu...

337
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,152
Matsumoto.
Hasi...

338
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,713
Matsumoto.
Moto.

339
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,655
Martha, can I call you Martha?
No, you may not.

340
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,591
Ok Jack, there is two types
of people in this world.

341
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,912
There is thinkers, there is doers.

342
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,592
There is winners,

343
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:13,269
there is dreamers and there is buddies.

344
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,515
What about some weaknesses?

345
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,223
I don't...

346
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,586
You have a very trustworthy face.

347
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,164
You remind me of like an...
Asian Colonel Sanders.

348
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,603
A man I can trust.

349
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,817
He is a millennial.

350
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:26,127
That means they are the, you know,
like lost generation.

351
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,158
Why was the FBI looking for you?

352
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,156
The what?

353
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,744
Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that.

354
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,754
It was during all that alien craziness
when you were 14.

355
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,864
I mean, they were very kind to me,
found me in a jiffy.

356
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,962
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.

357
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,610
I am just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy

358
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,000
In the office with a medal.

359
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,582
From Obama?
Yeah.

360
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,086
In this office, we are mostly Republicans,

361
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:49,754
so...

362
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:51,264
I am not feeling too good.

363
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,225
No?
No.

364
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,241
Why don't you get a little dipping tray
and dip the dog in Pepto?

365
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,426
That's a solution.

366
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,146
How?

367
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,429
I got another one.
We got to go. Come on.

368
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:58,601
Really?

369
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,770
Sit.

370
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,285
Got myself a Mr. Sam Witwicky,
recent college graduate.

371
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:08,273
Previous experience, next to zero yet...

372
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,831
he has a recommend letter from our board?

373
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,071
WTF to that.

374
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,031
Do I know somebody on your board?

375
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,574
Here is the deal.
You know who we are.

376
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:20,327
Accuretta Systems, global leader in telecom,

377
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,296
aerospace, 17 billion in profit last year.

378
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,654
We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL,
you name it.

379
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,421
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

380
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,177
First job out of college is critical kid.

381
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,055
You either take a step down
the correct career path,

382
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,688
or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

383
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,226
So it all depends on how you respond
to my next two words.

384
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,102
Impress me.

385
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,029
Now?
Impress me.

386
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,109
You catch me off guard.

387
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,419
I don't know where to begin.
Impress me.

388
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,054
I am an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

389
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,152
So you are a go-getter, ramrod...
Yes sir.

390
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:55,292
Take-charge kind of guy?

391
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,413
I am a killer. A stone-cold killer.

392
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,377
So, take-charge guy?

393
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,939
Take-charge, Viking, barbarian,
of course, that's me.

394
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,454
Pow! I am here.

395
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,545
We are not looking for that here.

396
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,089
No brown-nosing. No suck up.

397
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:15,960
No toolery. I...

398
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,816
<i>Yes, Mr. Brazos.</i>

399
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:26,065
Why is Shontel using
what appears to be a red cup,

400
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,520
from the red floor

401
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:30,002
when we are on the yellow floor?
<i>I am on it.</i>

402
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,823
It is a visual and therefore
a visceral betrayal.

403
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,616
Stop it!

404
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,668
Such a dumb-ass.

405
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,874
Disgusting!

406
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,903
Thank you!

407
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:45,567
It's total anarchy around here.

408
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,040
The...

409
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:51,465
e-mail I read said administrative aide?

410
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,113
Nope. Mail-room.

411
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,027
I am gonna go.

412
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,051
Do you have any idea how many,

413
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,678
Ivy League Phi Beta Kappas would kill to...

414
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:03,513
Mister, I saved your life twice.

415
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,932
Ok? I can't tell you how or when,

416
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:06,846
or why,

417
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,172
but I have done shit that matters

418
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,260
and I would just kind of like a job
where I matter again.

419
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,903
So thank you, but no, thank you, ok?

420
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,108
You know what I think?

421
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:17,389
You want the job after this job.

422
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,523
But son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

423
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:23,749
And that's why you are gonna be
so very, very good at it.

424
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,118
Because when I look at you,

425
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:26,468
I see a younger me.

426
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,057
<i>All arriving Autobots,</i>

427
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:50,143
<i>in par, training and debriefing
in 15 minutes.</i>

428
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,736
<i>Dino, report to Bay 23.</i>

429
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,322
<i>Sideswipe, Bay 37
for weapons assessment.</i>

430
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,748
Senator, I suggest you remember that

431
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:06,105
when the NSA wants funding,
they call me.

432
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,495
When the CIA is gonna take out a target,

433
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,581
they ask first for my permission.

434
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:11,944
And when the President wants to know

435
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,154
which members of Congress
are politically vulnerable

436
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,502
in terms of let's say...

437
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,734
undiscovered criminal conduct,

438
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,292
I am the number he dials.

439
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,835
<i>U.S. agencies say
they have been monitoring the blast.</i>

440
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,932
<i>But if, in fact,
this was a covert military strike,</i>

441
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,106
<i>no nation has claimed responsibility.</i>
CIA is up my ass

442
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:28,783
about this mystery raid in the Middle East.

443
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:31,003
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

444
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,407
I am not sure, ma'am.

445
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:36,582
Alright guys. This is how you do
a Decepticon head kill shot.

446
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,420
As Director of National intelligence,

447
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,310
I am a really big fan of intelligent answers.

448
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,406
I-I can't really tell you definitively.

449
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,967
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

450
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,592
They like to sneak out of the house
every once in a while.

451
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:49,064
Colonel Lennox, are you in command
or are you not?

452
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,536
Yes, ma'am, I am.

453
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:52,517
Stop with the ma'am.
Enough with the ma'am.

454
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,916
Do I look like a ma'am?

455
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,162
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

456
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,103
This gun is my perfect invention, Ironhide.

457
00:25:59,128 --> 00:25:59,969
Right.

458
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,922
Oh good, you are here!

459
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,057
Me name's Que.

460
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,932
I do hope you have answers for him.
I have never seen him so upset.

461
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,749
Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?

462
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,340
Our Director of National Intelligence?

463
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,392
He is in a bad mood.

464
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,312
He is not talking to anybody today.

465
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:16,313
What is this,

466
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:17,879
the silent treatment?

467
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,655
We have seen that and this is not that.
Definitely not.

468
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,452
This is worse.

469
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,844
Prime! Make something of yourself!

470
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,332
He is pissed.

471
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:34,943
You lied to us.

472
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:39,132
Everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared.

473
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,042
So why was this found
in human possession?

474
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:44,190
We were in the dark on this also.

475
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,221
It was Director Only clearance
at Sector 7 until now.

476
00:26:47,246 --> 00:26:48,143
The bag.

477
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,139
Which bag?
Hermes. Birkin.

478
00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:52,596
Green ostrich!

479
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,425
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,729
This is a secret few men knew,

481
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:59,648
and fewer still remain alive.

482
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,984
Allow me to please introduce to you

483
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,586
two of NASA's
founding mission directors

484
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,955
and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

485
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,454
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

486
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,075
Sir?

487
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,553
Optimus Prime.

488
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,748
From a fellow space traveler,
It's a true honor.

489
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,613
The honor is mine.

490
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,629
Our entire space race of the 1960s
it appears...

491
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:24,569
was in response to an event.

492
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,468
Our astronauts investigated,

493
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:30,229
a crashed alien ship.

494
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,847
No survivors on board.

495
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,108
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

496
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,768
This was a mission...

497
00:27:37,064 --> 00:27:38,945
you will never speak of.

498
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,112
I understand, sir.

499
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:44,346
A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

500
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,546
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.

501
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,825
Somehow they must have picked up
that fuel rod.

502
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,289
We believe the Russians deduced

503
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,416
that the rod
was a fissionable fuel assembly,

504
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,590
believed they had it mastered,
and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

505
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,009
We landed 6 missions in all.

506
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,833
We took hundreds of photos and samples.

507
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,593
We locked them away forever,

508
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,512
and the moon program was shut down.

509
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,844
Well, did you search the crash vault?

510
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,049
The ship's name was the Ark.

511
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,385
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

512
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,874
It was carrying an Autobot technology
which would have won us the war.

513
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,318
And its captain.

514
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,306
Who was its captain?

515
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,279
The great Sentinel Prime,

516
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:31,244
the technology's inventor.

517
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,950
He was commander of the Autobots,
before me.

518
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:36,950
It's imperative that I find it

519
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,857
before the Decepticons learn of its location.

520
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,798
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

521
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,003
And...

522
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,557
you must pray it's in time.

523
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:02,886
Hi. I am here to see Carly Spencer.

524
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,177
Carly!

525
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,033
You got the job?

526
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,368
This is crazy.
You really got it?

527
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,657
Yes.
See what did I tell you, it's the bunny.

528
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,790
You are so welcome.

529
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:23,609
Do you like me more?
A little bit yeah.

530
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,102
You said you were his assistant curator,

531
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:26,695
you didn't say the guy owns Space Mountain.

532
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,254
I know. isn't it beautiful in here?

533
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:30,963
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

534
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,076
Yeah?
Yeah.

535
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,046
Sam.

536
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,342
Dylan Gould.

537
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,264
Hey.

538
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,254
A pleasure to meet you.

539
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,476
Pleasure meeting you.

540
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,980
Carly's told me a lot about you.

541
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:45,723
Well, vice versa.
It's a beautiful building you got.

542
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:47,143
It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.

543
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,704
Thank you very much. it leaks.

544
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:50,594
Before Carly came
to help run the collection,

545
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,643
It was just a complete mess.

546
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,659
But now, the restorations are back on track.

547
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,040
We are going to Pebble Beach this year,

548
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:57,829
and we are gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

549
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:00,837
You know why?
Because this woman right here...

550
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,392
Is my secret weapon.
Ok.

551
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:05,458
Mr. Gould please, you exaggerate.

552
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:07,026
All I have done is get you organized.

553
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,448
You have done much more than that,
my Duchess.

554
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:12,073
Nicknames, that's fun.

555
00:30:12,098 --> 00:30:13,979
Yeah. The Duchess.

556
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,518
She is adorable.

557
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,304
You know, when I stole her away
from the British Embassy I said...

558
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:19,751
it's easy to manage a country.

559
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,758
Try managing a priceless collection of art.

560
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:26,728
Take e a look at this
1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

561
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,114
Designed by a Frenchman.

562
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,774
Look at the curves.

563
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:30,984
Elegant, isn't it?

564
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,328
Beautiful.

565
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:34,407
Sensual.

566
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:37,006
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

567
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,076
Come on.

568
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:42,704
My dad had a $10 desk and a dream,

569
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,719
and he built it into an empire.

570
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,517
We are the largest accounting firm
in the U.S.

571
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,962
I started up the venture side
after he passed.

572
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:52,439
Invest in the future.

573
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,111
Try and bet on the winners.

574
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:56,301
See, collecting cars,

575
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:57,909
helps me keep my sanity.

576
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:05,652
You guys look great.

577
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:10,683
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

578
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,620
I have not seen that one.
No. Me neither.

579
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,996
Jeans are tight.

580
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:17,155
Here we go. Here we go.

581
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,667
You see that?

582
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,566
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?

583
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:21,908
And you are gonna wave at him
while he is judging me?

584
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:23,703
What's with you? He is my boss.

585
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:25,493
This job pays for our food, our rent.

586
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:26,539
No, I totally understand.

587
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,134
I am totally fine. I get it.
I am well fed.

588
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,004
And guess what?
I am not your boy toy anymore.

589
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,735
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?

590
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:33,222
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

591
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:35,954
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?

592
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:43,338
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?

593
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:44,690
None of the above. Check!

594
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:47,002
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

595
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,408
Get in the car, please.

596
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:50,021
Sam,

597
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,349
he is hardly the first man
to ever smile at me.

598
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:53,659
I think I can handle it.
Hold on, hold on.

599
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:56,121
It's-It's the smiling back part
that gets me. Ok?

600
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:59,121
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

601
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:00,742
That works for me.
Yeah.

602
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,165
Easy! Easy!

603
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:10,808
You are not gonna get it started that way.

604
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,730
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I am about 32% done with my restoration.

605
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,223
Some chrome work,
put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

606
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:18,368
You know, Carly is been telling me
you have been struggling job-wise.

607
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:21,761
Just so you know, I am on the board
for Accuretta Systems,

608
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,513
and I put in a call for you.

609
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,098
Let's keep it between us, ok?

610
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:26,701
She is so proud of you.

611
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:28,876
You are a lucky man.

612
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:35,053
Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.

613
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,284
<i>You are a go for landing.</i>

614
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:46,965
Ratchet, let's roll.

615
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,179
We are entering the Ark.

616
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,791
His levels are faint.

617
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,376
He locked himself away,

618
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,493
to guard the pillars.

619
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,478
Sentinel.

620
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:42,878
You are coming home, old friend.

621
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,517
All hail Megatron.

622
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:35,784
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

623
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,117
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

624
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,040
My poor master.

625
00:34:52,065 --> 00:34:56,343
How it pains me to see you so wounded,
so weak.

626
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:59,349
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

627
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,553
You know what you are told,
which is nothing.

628
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,842
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

629
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:17,047
And what news from your little assassin?

630
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,258
Autobots have taken the bait!

631
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:20,898
They ave discovered the Ark,

632
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:23,125
and returned with its cargo.

633
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:27,703
You did me great honor
tracking that ship to the moon.

634
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,326
Your human collaborators
have served their purpose,

635
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,462
Soundwave.

636
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,269
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

637
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,792
Laserbeak,

638
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:41,910
kill them all.

639
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:43,540
With pleasure.

640
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,306
Is your daddy home?

641
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:01,086
Then Madeline said...
Madeline!

642
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,603
Hello, Mom.

643
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,202
Get out of the house!

644
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:13,060
What are you doing in my house?
Just visiting.

645
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:32,679
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

646
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:37,173
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!

647
00:36:37,513 --> 00:36:38,684
New guy! You see that?

648
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,993
That's a Latin meltdown, ok?

649
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:42,213
You ever show up in my office
with a hoochie-mama outfit, you are fired.

650
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:43,273
You got that, ok?

651
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,417
Even you are gonna be on this cart
for 2-and-a-half years, it's ok?

652
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:47,011
I want you to live it, love it and name it.

653
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:50,014
There is no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Ok?

654
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,244
Yes sir.
Move!

655
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,520
I found that paper I was telling you about.

656
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,314
What are we looking at?
Shut up!

657
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,977
You do that to me again
and I will kick your ass!

658
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:23,822
Hi.

659
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,149
Hi, angel.

660
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,609
How are you?
Good.

661
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:30,157
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it ok for me to stop by?

662
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,610
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual

663
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,736
Isn't exactly a page turner.
This is great.

664
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,674
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world,
and I have organized four binders.

665
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:39,181
I am living the dream. Come on.

666
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,498
Visitor violation.

667
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:46,419
You ok?

668
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:47,844
Absolutely.

669
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,593
I am next.

670
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:55,825
Listen.
What?

671
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,554
Saturday...

672
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,184
Dylan is throwing a party at his house.

673
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,975
It's a work thing but he is invited you too.

674
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,842
Did he?

675
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,468
I want you to come
and laugh at my bad jokes.

676
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,145
It would really mean a lot to me ok?

677
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,956
I would love to go.
How did you get over here?

678
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:08,498
Car.
You don't have a car.

679
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:10,067
Yes I do.

680
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:11,654
What, did you win it in a raffle?

681
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:13,483
He gave me one.

682
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:14,458
He gave you a car?

683
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:15,942
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

684
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,489
A work perk.

685
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:18,659
What kind of car did he give you?

686
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:22,325
A Mercedes SLS AMG.

687
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:24,405
Really throaty engine.

688
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,760
<i>Mercedes-Benz SLS</i>

689
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:29,597
<i>combines breathtaking performance...</i>
You drove this here?

690
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,944
That's a $200,000 car.

691
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:34,725
I know.

692
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,581
You know how long it would take me
to afford a car like this?

693
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,812
A long time?
Yeah, like 53 years.

694
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,122
He said it was for both of us.

695
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,428
Then what we should do is,
we should sell it and buy a house.

696
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:47,397
You are frustrated, I know.

697
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:48,628
I have been there.

698
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:49,982
It's called paying your dues.

699
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,371
Good things will happen.

700
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,681
Ladies and gentlemen,

701
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,067
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

702
00:38:56,092 --> 00:38:59,209
Who would like
to score some Bruce Brazos points?

703
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:01,084
Bruce, you found your guy.

704
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,258
Witwicky!

705
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:07,627
The man who makes this company run.

706
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:09,877
Now, who have we here?

707
00:39:09,902 --> 00:39:12,643
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?

708
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:14,698
Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
Hi.

709
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:16,592
I am his girlfriend.
A pleasure to meet you.

710
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,311
Sam was right. You really do
have a smashing head of hair.

711
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:20,701
Well, thank you.

712
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:22,986
Sam, I got to run.
Yeah.

713
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:26,133
Here, your present.

714
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,558
Your favorite color.

715
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:31,914
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.
And you.

716
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:35,559
See you, boys.

717
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,650
I am still stewing about
that binder incident Jerry.

718
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,251
May I finish my Shuhua milk, Donny?

719
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:49,542
I don't care about your exotic milk.

720
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:50,789
I care about respect!

721
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,637
I know who you are!

722
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,465
Witwicky! Witwicky!

723
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,856
I am talking to you!
Excuse me. Thank you.

724
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,029
Slow down, tiger.

725
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,885
You showed up in the background
of 6 different photos,

726
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,525
two continents, with aliens.

727
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,454
That was you, in Egypt? Right?

728
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:28,282
Because you know the aliens.

729
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:29,407
See you!

730
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:32,502
Give me my jacket!

731
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,261
I am Wang. Deep Wang.

732
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:43,969
Deep Wang.

733
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,930
You are not getting it. Deep Throat.

734
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:47,876
Watergate? I am talking code to you...

735
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,345
Damn it.

736
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:52,549
They watch and listen.

737
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:55,932
I can't go to the government,
but you, you can.

738
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,610
Because shit is going down, son!

739
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:59,534
It is Code Pink as in Floyd!

740
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:02,635
Dark Side! Why do you think
no one is been up there since 1972?

741
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,994
I know you are speaking English,
it's just a very strange English.

742
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:07,080
That's why I am not...

743
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:08,732
Don't.

744
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,272
I am gonna hit you.

745
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:11,753
I am gonna hit you right back, son.

746
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,640
It's my manifesto.

747
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:15,014
They are whacking us out,

748
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,804
everyone who knows what's on the dark...

749
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:20,596
Your alien friends are in danger,
you know, the good ones. it's up to you.

750
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,014
Calm down.

751
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,601
Easy, Sam!

752
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,769
What are you looking at?

753
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,863
Yo, dawg.

754
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,902
Are you up in my shit?

755
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:41,617
Who are you working for?

756
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:44,860
Staredown you and me.

757
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:48,113
Guess I won.

758
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:52,881
Moon satellites.

759
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:56,227
The Russian space program.

760
00:41:57,054 --> 00:41:58,360
Experts dead.

761
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:00,094
Space program ends.

762
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:02,923
Dark side... Dark side of the moon.

763
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,094
Look what I found outside the bathroom.

764
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:06,554
Is it yours?
Deal with this.

765
00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:07,932
Yes, sir.

766
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:12,384
I did everything you want!

767
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,496
I really think we should talk,
because some of the stuff you...

768
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,189
Knock first!

769
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,569
Can't you see I am busy?

770
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,434
Who are you? Who are you?

771
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,181
You straddled me in the stall.

772
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,035
That's happened to me once in this life.
I would not forget it.

773
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,895
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

774
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:31,341
You took your package out.
We are not boyfriends, ok?

775
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:33,652
One phone call from me
and I will have you fired.

776
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,347
Yes I will Gaylord!

777
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,217
Are you ok?

778
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,027
Hemorrhoids!

779
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,964
Should I come back?
When should I come back?

780
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,800
Come back when you learn some manners!

781
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,971
I don't know him!

782
00:42:48,995 --> 00:42:50,557
I would never say anything!

783
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,131
Ok, ok!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite,

784
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,258
just like I promised,

785
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,117
I can put a blind spot in the program
as a bonus.

786
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:00,862
What more do you want from me?

787
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,741
Jerry, you are my favorite.

788
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:06,347
I will do whatever you want me to do.

789
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,698
I know,

790
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:10,282
but my superiors need me to...

791
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,876
Please, you don't have to...
suicide you.

792
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,342
What did you say to Witwicky?

793
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,659
Shit!

794
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,931
Who wants some chicken dinner now, bitch?

795
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,182
Because somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

796
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,731
Come on! You want some of me?

797
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,396
I don't need any more didactic lectures
from Chuck.

798
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,646
Jesus!

799
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,487
Get legal.

800
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:57,916
That's Jerry!

801
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,446
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died,

802
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,765
but looking out the window
is not going to bring him back.

803
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,950
The man was depressed.

804
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,010
Don't take a picture!

805
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,342
You can keep watching him,
but he's not getting up.

806
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,218
You all read Humpty Dumpty.

807
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,074
Ok?

808
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,901
Witwicky.

809
00:44:12,243 --> 00:44:14,515
I am spearheading the press.
You clean up.

810
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,183
Wang is everywhere.

811
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:18,276
He is in the bistro.

812
00:44:18,301 --> 00:44:20,758
He is in the bamboo.
He is on the balustrade.

813
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,356
You see the sidewalk down there?

814
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:23,742
Man!

815
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,826
<i>Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.</i>

816
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:27,679
And then...

817
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:30,647
Listen, I am not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

818
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,543
Who you share a toilet stall
with is totally your business.

819
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,497
This is exceedingly Japanese.

820
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,939
They never make it easy, do they?

821
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,194
What is with you?
This is the real deal Carly, ok?

822
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,043
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life.

823
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,406
I will explain it to you later.

824
00:45:29,516 --> 00:45:31,141
We have got an emergency.
You got to get Colonel Lennox out here.

825
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,869
I am reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.

826
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:33,977
You got to open that gate right now.

827
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:36,588
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.

828
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,141
Right. Packing M4s?

829
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,670
What are you protecting, colostomy bags?

830
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,113
Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
Babe...

831
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,741
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school?

832
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:44,469
So you are nurses
and foot-powder protectors?

833
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:45,555
Babe? Babe?
Fantastic. Yes.

834
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,313
I don't think we are in the right place.
We are in the right place.

835
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:48,984
We are in the right place,
we are in the right place

836
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:50,179
and I am gonna talk to Optimus right now.
Sir.

837
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:51,907
You are gonna get Optimus out here.
Sir, you got the wrong building.

838
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:53,024
I don't know what you are talking about.

839
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:54,789
What part of Decepticons are back
do you not understand?

840
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:55,657
Yo!

841
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,545
You being a smartass?

842
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,546
Do not hit my car, it's a collector's item!

843
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,068
I would not do that.

844
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,333
You are crazy!

845
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,377
We got an Energon reading!
We have got aliens in the vehicle!

846
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:09,992
You move, you are dead!

847
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:10,756
Out!

848
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:13,250
Out!
Got aliens in the vehicle!

849
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,803
Freeze!

850
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:17,411
Get out!
We are freezing!

851
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:18,123
Are you...

852
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,357
Are you kidding me?

853
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,025
Sam, they have got guns!

854
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,312
I got him. Go!

855
00:46:25,336 --> 00:46:27,198
Bee! is Bee in there?

856
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:29,615
Ok, alright!

857
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:32,526
This how you treat Autobots?
We are on the same team.

858
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:35,133
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven,
dickhead.

859
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:37,165
That's right.
A-hole.

860
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,699
How is your car now?

861
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,424
That's my car.

862
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,646
Come here.

863
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,007
Come here!

864
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,935
Come on. Sam.

865
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:56,439
What is your deal?

866
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,208
I know your black ops stuff
is important to you.

867
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,560
You know, I am not trying to diminish it
or guilt-trip you or anything,

868
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,075
I just never see you anymore.

869
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,302
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

870
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,771
Sam. That makes me feel bad.

871
00:47:06,796 --> 00:47:08,467
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

872
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,976
Look at the jalopy I am driving now.
I feel bad every single day.

873
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,751
Yo, let's go both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

874
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:15,141
What, we not good enough
for you anymore?

875
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,943
I am sorry babe.
They were very rude alright?

876
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,658
And you are fixing my car.

877
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,585
You don't think so?

878
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,021
Raise your hand if you had
a flying psycho-ninja copier

879
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:26,163
trying to kill you today!
Those are my brass knuckles.

880
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:29,155
That's my anklet, do I have to take
that off too and my toe rings?

881
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,258
<i>All NEST officials clear the floor.</i>

882
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,431
<i>We have 10 minutes
until attempted contact.</i>

883
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,799
We have taken possession of the 5 devices

884
00:47:35,824 --> 00:47:38,051
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

885
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,130
They are some kind of
prototype Autobot technology.

886
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,990
They say Sentinel
was the Einstein of his civilization,

887
00:47:45,015 --> 00:47:46,377
so we are gonna keep these locked up

888
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,063
until we know what we are dealing with.

889
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,980
Right now, no one gets access.

890
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,636
No one.

891
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,609
This Wang guy recognized me.

892
00:47:53,941 --> 00:47:54,884
He told me to warn you.

893
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,737
He was talking about the dark
side of the moon, then they killed him.

894
00:47:56,761 --> 00:47:57,946
Wait a minute.
He mentioned the moon?

895
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,244
Yeah, dark side of the moon.

896
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,862
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

897
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,040
I thought their war was
with the Autobots.

898
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,366
And that is when he made his first
quick-look science report.

899
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:07,561
That's what we want...

900
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:09,499
Who is the chick? Ok.

901
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:11,329
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

902
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,418
Director Mearing,

903
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:13,920
this is Sam Witwicky...

904
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:15,506
it's a civilia...
I know his name, Colonel.

905
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,969
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

906
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,855
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime,

907
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,586
when he touched down in suburbia
looking for my house?

908
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,889
This is the National Intelligence Director.

909
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,189
In case you...

910
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,474
Hi.

911
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:27,272
Disrespecting a federal officer?

912
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,819
Maybe that will get you somewhere.
Who is she?

913
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,112
She is my girlfriend.

914
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:31,992
What is this, like a date?

915
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,631
She knows all about the Autobots, ok?
She knows Bumblebee.

916
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:37,209
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.

917
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:38,487
Hey, I have an idea.

918
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:39,785
How about we get back
to the important topics,

919
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,311
so like the fact that I almost had
my face cut off by a Decepticon?

920
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:44,859
As a taxpayer, I would like to lodge
a complaint as a matter of fact.

921
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:45,835
Ok, listen.

922
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,359
One of the software engineers
at Sam's office was murdered today.

923
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,438
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

924
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:52,376
Here is the thing, Colonel Lennox.

925
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:55,952
We cannot entrust national security
to teenagers

926
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,048
unless I missed a policy paper.

927
00:48:58,072 --> 00:49:00,202
Are we doing that now? No.
Good.

928
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,178
I don't care who you are.

929
00:49:02,213 --> 00:49:03,928
If you breathe a word of what you
see in here,

930
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:05,475
you will do time for treason.

931
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,936
Do you understand me?

932
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,726
I will take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them.

933
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,702
I don't know you.

934
00:49:11,397 --> 00:49:12,343
You will.

935
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,896
Sentinel Prime.

936
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,501
These things run on Energon,
and he is out of it.

937
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:19,532
He is in a...

938
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,030
sort of a sleep mode.

939
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:22,634
Let us begin.

940
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,223
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

941
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,423
He holds the only thing in the universe
that can repower a Transformer's spark.

942
00:49:39,586 --> 00:49:40,947
This is incredible.

943
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,724
Sentinel Prime,

944
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,111
we bid you return.

945
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:58,183
Hold your fire!

946
00:49:58,779 --> 00:49:59,983
Sentinel!

947
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,952
It is I, Optimus Prime!

948
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,782
It is alright.

949
00:50:05,914 --> 00:50:07,017
You are safe.

950
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,587
There is nothing to fear.

951
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,900
We are here.

952
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,126
You are home, Sentinel.

953
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,554
The war... The war!

954
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,935
The war was lost.

955
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,398
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.

956
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,236
We have taken refuge here
on planet Earth.

957
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:35,215
Its human race is our ally.

958
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,563
My ship.

959
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:38,233
We came under fire.

960
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,608
The pillars.

961
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:42,004
Where are the pillars?

962
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,237
You saved 5 of them,

963
00:50:44,261 --> 00:50:45,991
including the control pillar.

964
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,618
Only 5?

965
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,939
We once had hundreds!

966
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,064
Excuse me gentlemen.

967
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,093
May I ask,

968
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:54,017
what is this technology you are looking for?

969
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,967
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

970
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,670
Together the pillars form a space bridge.

971
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,512
I designed, and I alone, can control it.

972
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,558
It defies your laws of physics

973
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,401
to transport matter
through time and space.

974
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:11,418
You are talking about
a teleportation device, are not you?

975
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,141
Yes, for resources,

976
00:51:13,165 --> 00:51:14,407
for refugees.

977
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:16,770
Refugees or troops of soldiers,

978
00:51:16,794 --> 00:51:18,234
weapons, maybe bombs!

979
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,158
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?

980
00:51:21,183 --> 00:51:23,485
It is our technology,

981
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:25,862
and it must be returned.
Yes.

982
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:27,911
If humans say so.

983
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,961
You can't just bring weapons of
mass destruction into our atmosphere!

984
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,625
You kind of have to clear customs first!

985
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,108
A little formality called paperwork
kind of separates us from the animals.

986
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,594
I will overlook your condescending tone

987
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,297
If you heed the gravity of mine.

988
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,680
The Decepticons must never know
the space bridge is here.

989
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,927
For in their hands,

990
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,106
It would mean the end of your world.

991
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,687
Total Nightmare file.

992
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,213
So, the investigation is open.

993
00:51:57,237 --> 00:51:58,712
We have sent agents to your office.

994
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:01,353
And, for the time being, we are gonna
send you home with Autobot protection.

995
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,637
Who do I need to speak to

996
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,248
to get you guys to understand
that I can help,

997
00:52:05,468 --> 00:52:06,620
that I can contribute?

998
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,528
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?

999
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:10,704
I could tell you about the solar system,
all the fun planets to hang out in.

1000
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,854
Get off my desk, please.

1001
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:12,909
You pulling out guns?

1002
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,777
I can't help you out now.
She angry.

1003
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:15,753
Oh, my God.

1004
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,549
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?

1005
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:19,370
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...

1006
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:22,011
This is a unit
for veteran intelligence officers

1007
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:23,323
and Special Forces,

1008
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:25,554
not for boys who once owned special cars.

1009
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,589
That's a bit harsh, isn't it ma'am?

1010
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:29,009
Don't call me ma'am. I am not a ma'am.

1011
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,758
Well you are a woman, are not you?

1012
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,573
So...

1013
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,137
are those yours?

1014
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,643
Yeah. CIA.

1015
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,773
I only ask because I also have a medal,

1016
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:39,301
from the President.

1017
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:40,145
Yeah.

1018
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,702
Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?

1019
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:45,220
No one gets to work with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

1020
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,953
You are breaking my chain of command.

1021
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,143
Come on, let's go.

1022
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,661
You have done what you came for.

1023
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,283
With all due respect young man,

1024
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:54,664
I appreciate what you did.

1025
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:55,915
But you are not a soldier.

1026
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,928
You are a messenger.
You have always been a messenger.

1027
00:52:59,172 --> 00:53:00,537
He is a hero.

1028
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,682
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I will see you up there.

1029
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:14,763
This blows.

1030
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:17,182
That lady officially kicked us out.
Yeah.

1031
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,436
Witness Protection Program sucks.

1032
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,613
Yeah, but we are a whole lot safer
with big yellow and his cannons.

1033
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,531
That dog can't protect crap.

1034
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:26,960
Bee?

1035
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,256
You miss hanging out?

1036
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,303
Yeah me too.

1037
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,501
That woman, she called me a messenger.
Can you believe that?

1038
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:46,448
After everything
I have done, I am a messenger.

1039
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,296
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy,

1040
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,188
we feel the same way.
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

1041
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,891
We should do something about it.

1042
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,096
Bee,

1043
00:53:57,322 --> 00:53:59,244
I need to know why they are killing humans.

1044
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,947
I say we call in the expert.

1045
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,442
<i>My next guest is a former
American intelligence operative</i>

1046
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,332
<i>who has dared to speak out</i>

1047
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:10,005
<i>regarding our alleged military alliance
with what many describe</i>

1048
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,413
<i>as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.</i>

1049
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:17,876
<i>He is the author of the bestselling book,
Code-Name Hero.</i>

1050
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,086
<i>Former special agent, Seymour Simmons.</i>

1051
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,442
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

1052
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,625
<i>Now, Agent Simmons,
you would have us believe</i>

1053
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,460
<i>that it is in our best interest</i>

1054
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:30,200
<i>to formally take sides
in this so-called alien civil war?</i>

1055
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,762
Well, the other side wanted
to spank us for breakfast,

1056
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,219
so I would not exactly call it a toss-up.

1057
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,166
These Decepticons are lethal.

1058
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:40,002
<i>But polls show
half the world would feel safer</i>

1059
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,767
<i>with the Autobots completely gone.</i>

1060
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:44,751
<i>Get them out of here!
We don't need them here!</i>

1061
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:46,772
I feel safer when I sleep
with a hand grenade.

1062
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,232
<i>Doesn't mean I am always right.</i>

1063
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,151
Agent,

1064
00:54:49,175 --> 00:54:51,843
here at The Factor we have obtained
documents that show,

1065
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:53,598
you were fired...

1066
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,809
Chaz, I am doing an interview.
Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

1067
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,019
Downsized, Bill.

1068
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,722
Budget cuts. Chaz out.
<i>Your psych evaluation reports</i>

1069
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,590
<i>keep severe delusional tendencies.</i>

1070
00:55:01,615 --> 00:55:02,877
This is ambush journalism.

1071
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:04,777
<i>You want the truth
about the alien alliance?</i>

1072
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,790
<i>Buy my book!</i>

1073
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,167
<i>Buy my book!</i>

1074
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,791
<i>Before it's too late people!</i>

1075
00:55:08,816 --> 00:55:10,032
<i>You want a piece of me, Bill?</i>

1076
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,422
<i>You want to get naked? I am ready!</i>

1077
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,464
<i>Interview is over!</i>

1078
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:14,558
<i>You, out of my house.
You are sounding like a pinhead, agent.</i>

1079
00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:16,288
<i>It's over. Understand?
And I have got a suggestion for you.</i>

1080
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,226
<i>Damage control.</i>

1081
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,583
Dutch!
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!

1082
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,815
You have 23 seconds to leave the property.

1083
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,250
I have called the police!

1084
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:25,938
You are peasant people
throwing rocks at a giant!

1085
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,229
What's up next? What have we got?

1086
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,740
Book signing, Midtown noon.

1087
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:30,967
Then we pitch your reality show
to the Discovery Channel.

1088
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,504
And I have this...

1089
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:35,241
Witwicky who keeps calling me
5 times today.

1090
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:36,426
Kid? What does he want?

1091
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:38,101
I called you because
the Decepticons are back.

1092
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,491
I want to know why and I need your help.

1093
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,609
They are back?

1094
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:43,238
Well, that's good for business.

1095
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,478
What if I told you
I know a 50-year-old alien secret

1096
00:55:45,503 --> 00:55:46,709
that nobody ever told you.

1097
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,709
Do not tempt my addiction.

1098
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,088
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

1099
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,088
Dutch,

1100
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:54,986
is this line secure?
No.

1101
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,385
Don't take the risk.

1102
00:55:58,697 --> 00:56:00,018
I am rich why should I?

1103
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,973
Do not relapse. I won't.

1104
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:06,018
Do not let the demons win.

1105
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:06,910
Got it.

1106
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,521
What kind of...

1107
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:11,027
secret?

1108
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,117
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

1109
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,320
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

1110
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,530
Oh Apollo.

1111
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:20,851
Dutch!

1112
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,186
Tell Megatron,

1113
00:56:29,444 --> 00:56:30,830
let's tango.

1114
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,054
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

1115
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,357
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

1116
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,771
I have wondered what might have been,

1117
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,690
if you had fought the final battle,

1118
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,357
instead of me.

1119
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:58,154
Never mourn the past, young warrior.

1120
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,904
Thanks to you,

1121
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,600
our race survives.

1122
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,537
You were our leader, Sentinel.

1123
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,007
It is your right to lead us again.

1124
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,113
In a world I do not know,

1125
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:15,253
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.

1126
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,667
You are mine.

1127
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,645
You have got to break this case down.

1128
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,685
What we have here
is an astronaut epidemic.

1129
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,807
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.

1130
00:57:27,831 --> 00:57:29,365
Killed. DOA. Car death.

1131
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:30,505
It's like these guys can't drive.

1132
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,729
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

1133
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,315
Procured your information, Witwicky.

1134
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,822
Thank you Bruce.

1135
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,736
Now,

1136
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,705
let me see one right now. One time.

1137
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,325
Quick.
Very.

1138
00:57:50,227 --> 00:57:51,842
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

1139
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,331
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

1140
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,347
See, forensics show
Wang may have messed with the code,

1141
00:57:57,372 --> 00:57:58,953
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,

1142
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:00,218
which is also the dark side.

1143
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,804
Fucking awesome.

1144
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,528
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,
coerce us to do their dirty work.

1145
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,864
And once they are done...

1146
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,419
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

1147
00:58:10,604 --> 00:58:12,435
So humans are working for the Decepticons.

1148
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,234
I don't think this is about the Decepticons

1149
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,192
looking for something on the moon.

1150
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,110
I think it's about something...

1151
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:22,192
they wanted to hide.

1152
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,880
Come to Daddy.

1153
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,373
Come on, throw down.

1154
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,169
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?

1155
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,043
He is a freak.

1156
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,382
Like it?
Get back!

1157
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,762
I am ticklish!

1158
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:40,880
Sir!

1159
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:44,347
We are having a pretty high-level
alien Intel confab here

1160
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,845
that I don't think you are cleared for,

1161
00:58:46,938 --> 00:58:47,749
errand boy.

1162
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,809
Yeah, you are right.

1163
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,265
It's a bitching robot.

1164
00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:51,312
I think it's time to go Bruce.

1165
00:58:51,337 --> 00:58:53,874
Thank you so much for this. And...
Got to go, Bruce.

1166
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,522
I am smoking over here.

1167
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,723
Downloading missing Russian cosmonauts.

1168
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,609
Turns out the Soviets canceled
a manned mission to the moon.

1169
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,454
The moon, in 1972.

1170
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,781
And two of their cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

1171
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,708
And I just found them alive.

1172
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,001
You are a genius Brains.

1173
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,958
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

1174
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,635
Missed it by that much.

1175
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,456
Hi.

1176
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,262
Would somebody care to tell me
what the hell is going on?

1177
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,471
Who are you?

1178
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:31,439
Who are you?

1179
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,974
Who am I? Who is that?

1180
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:34,063
Dutch! Frisk her!

1181
00:59:34,435 --> 00:59:36,060
Certainly.
No.

1182
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:37,671
Dutch.

1183
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:38,888
Don't touch me.

1184
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,695
I am not gonna touch her.
Sam?

1185
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,208
Angel.

1186
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,694
I was working.

1187
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,738
I am sorry about this.
Great. We are homeless.

1188
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:47,892
She lives here?

1189
00:59:49,015 --> 00:59:50,533
You had your chance to frisk her.

1190
00:59:50,876 --> 00:59:51,910
I have a girlfriend.

1191
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,126
Really? What's her name?

1192
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:55,068
India.

1193
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,632
We are supposed to be
at Dylan's party, remember?

1194
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:00,238
I do remember, but these are my friends.

1195
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,719
They need me.
I have to be here right now.

1196
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,660
So what the Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this on their own?

1197
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,212
You know what I liked
about your war stories, Sam?

1198
01:00:07,465 --> 01:00:09,547
It's that they were stories,
they were in the past.

1199
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,562
Look, I know you are thinking
about your brother, ok?

1200
01:00:11,587 --> 01:00:14,169
And you are thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.

1201
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,183
No?
No.

1202
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:15,850
Why not?

1203
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:17,532
Why isn't it Sam?

1204
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,657
You think we would rather have his medals,
or we would rather have him?

1205
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,816
I hear you. I get it.

1206
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,866
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

1207
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,412
Just stop for a second.

1208
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:28,955
You think I could sleep last night?

1209
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,328
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1210
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,301
He doesn't know who he is without it.
I just want to matter.

1211
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,327
You matter to me.

1212
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,452
I know you are worried.
I know you are worried.

1213
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:46,559
But I promise you I can, I can handle this.

1214
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,808
Can you? You can promise it?

1215
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,109
I promise.

1216
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,499
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

1217
01:00:57,422 --> 01:00:59,007
I am not ready for this.

1218
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,311
Are you coming with me?

1219
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,046
I can't.

1220
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,659
Ok.

1221
01:01:11,886 --> 01:01:12,902
Hey.

1222
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,705
Here is your foot.

1223
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,594
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

1224
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,518
How the hell did she afford that car?

1225
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,961
Her boss.
Rich bastards!

1226
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,434
I used to hate them.

1227
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:40,735
Now it's...

1228
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,703
Going to a gig on the hunt
for two Russian cosmonauts.

1229
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,068
Nothing like driving in a Maybach?

1230
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,119
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell you.

1231
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,072
My Dutchman,

1232
01:01:53,096 --> 01:01:56,000
former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

1233
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,569
tracked them down here.

1234
01:01:58,878 --> 01:02:00,663
So, these cosmonauts went into hiding.

1235
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:01,585
Why?

1236
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,582
Bingo.

1237
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:03,672
I got a match.

1238
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,052
You are a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1239
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,587
The thing about Russians is,

1240
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:09,079
they never like to talk.

1241
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,218
It's gonna take a little
of the international language.

1242
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:17,617
<font color="#5feaff">Do svidaniya.</font>

1243
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,841
That means good-bye.

1244
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:24,620
<font color="#5feaff">Please.</font>

1245
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,070
<font color="#5feaff">Alright.</font>

1246
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:32,753
Who will lead the revolution.

1247
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,670
A famous.

1248
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:36,407
Dutch?

1249
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,299
Give me something tough.

1250
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,059
<font color="#5feaff">Baryshnikov.</font>

1251
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,377
We do speak English.

1252
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,301
Dutch, you suck.

1253
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,210
It's a Cyrillic...

1254
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,212
alphabet. It's like all the...

1255
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:51,544
buttons you never push on a calculator!

1256
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,598
I don't suck.

1257
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,944
Agent Seymour Simmons.
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

1258
01:02:57,085 --> 01:02:58,429
We know who you are,

1259
01:02:58,663 --> 01:03:00,043
cosmonautchiks.

1260
01:03:00,262 --> 01:03:01,103
So what?

1261
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,852
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon then...

1262
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:07,272
it all got shut down.

1263
01:03:09,131 --> 01:03:10,650
The question is...

1264
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:11,777
why?

1265
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,450
<font color="#5feaff">Who are these three idiots?</font>

1266
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:16,503
<font color="#5feaff">Guys, who let them in?</font>

1267
01:03:16,528 --> 01:03:18,415
Can my child smoke in here?

1268
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,095
<font color="#5feaff">I don't know these guys.</font>

1269
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,186
<font color="#5feaff">How did they come in?</font>

1270
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,829
<font color="#5feaff">Why they are here?
I don't know, come on, come on!</font>

1271
01:03:22,853 --> 01:03:24,306
<font color="#5feaff">Do it!
Hands-on!</font>

1272
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,842
Ok, alright. Ok.

1273
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:30,178
Go ahead, shoot me.

1274
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:31,511
<font color="#5feaff">Why did you come here?</font>

1275
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,631
I am willing to die for my country.
Are you?

1276
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:34,980
<font color="#5feaff">Why are you here?</font>

1277
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,135
Really?

1278
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,788
<font color="#5feaff">Come on!</font>
You are beautiful.

1279
01:03:37,993 --> 01:03:39,332
Has anyone ever told you you are beautiful?

1280
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,253
She is a beautiful woman.
<font color="#5feaff">Shut up.</font>

1281
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:41,133
<font color="#5feaff">Come on!</font>

1282
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:45,588
Hey!

1283
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,236
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1284
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:53,276
Dutch!

1285
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,606
Hold, Dutch, hold!

1286
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,329
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.

1287
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:57,638
Dutch, stop!

1288
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,372
I am so sorry. That is the old me.

1289
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,207
Ok, let's everybody just calm down!

1290
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:09,375
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax.

1291
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:10,903
World War II is over.

1292
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,903
You are about to see
one of the biggest Soviet secrets.

1293
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,356
America first to send man to the moon.

1294
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,708
But USSR first to send camera.

1295
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,364
In 1959, our Luna 3...

1296
01:04:27,827 --> 01:04:29,353
take picture of the...

1297
01:04:29,377 --> 01:04:31,069
dark, the shadow side.

1298
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,616
Sees nothing.

1299
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,569
But in 1963,

1300
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:38,280
Luna 4 sees...

1301
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,491
Strange rocks.
Yeah.

1302
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,699
Around the ship.

1303
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:43,622
Hundreds of them.

1304
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,119
Yeah, show picture.

1305
01:04:46,228 --> 01:04:47,205
With some...

1306
01:04:47,736 --> 01:04:49,119
drag marks.

1307
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,297
I have seen these.
These are not rocks, these are pillars.

1308
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,632
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1309
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,242
We know about them
because the Autobots have 5 of these.

1310
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:04,691
The Decepticons must have raided
the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there,

1311
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:06,999
took the pillars, and hid them.

1312
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:08,254
It doesn't make sense.

1313
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,270
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

1314
01:05:10,302 --> 01:05:13,013
Why would they leave Sentinel when
he is the only one who can use them?

1315
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,864
Unless...

1316
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,067
He is the one thing they still need.

1317
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,278
We have got to meet up with Sentinel,

1318
01:05:19,302 --> 01:05:20,872
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

1319
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,691
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1320
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:24,879
We are coming to NEST now.

1321
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,171
Mr. Witwicky, I thought I made it clear to you

1322
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:30,686
that I did not want you calling this phone.

1323
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,425
<i>Listen, the whole thing has been
a setup since the beginning.</i>

1324
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,650
The Decepticons wanted Optimus
to find Sentinel

1325
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:37,381
<i>because only Optimus could revive him.</i>

1326
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,257
But we have the space bridge.

1327
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:40,800
Mearing, you have 5 pillars.

1328
01:05:40,957 --> 01:05:42,657
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1329
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,047
<i>You are doing exactly
what they wanted you to do.</i>

1330
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:45,228
<i>What do you need me to say to you?</i>

1331
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,735
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

1332
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,107
We are going to NEST.

1333
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,402
<i>We have an Energon alert.</i>

1334
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,859
<i>Energon readings detected
on the D.C. parkway.</i>

1335
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,370
<i>Currently tracking three black Suburbans.</i>

1336
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,341
Bee, you got to get Sentinel
out of here! You got to guard him!

1337
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,911
Oh, mein Gott! I am fired!

1338
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,671
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

1339
01:07:12,935 --> 01:07:13,974
Got you!

1340
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,404
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

1341
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,062
Bee, you have got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!

1342
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,728
Bee!

1343
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:15,956
Alright, back to NEST!

1344
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,761
Dino, I got him!

1345
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,975
Ironhide!

1346
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,181
Is there a problem?

1347
01:09:02,808 --> 01:09:04,969
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

1348
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,806
Weapons down.

1349
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,934
And we will let you escape
with your dignity.

1350
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,340
Drop them.

1351
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,813
That's good.

1352
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,351
Ironhide, watch out!

1353
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,739
Ironhide, catch!

1354
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,438
Behind you!

1355
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,176
Decepticon punk!

1356
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,750
Class dismissed.

1357
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:00,809
Get inside!

1358
01:10:01,036 --> 01:10:02,769
Let's go!
Move! Keep moving!

1359
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,747
Lennox!
Go, go, go, go!

1360
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,189
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1361
01:10:06,214 --> 01:10:08,432
I have got my whole team deployed
looking for them. Ironhide!

1362
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,955
Protect Sentinel!
Get him locked up inside!

1363
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,220
Consider it done!

1364
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,362
Hey, you have got to guard him,
because he is the key to the whole thing.

1365
01:10:14,387 --> 01:10:16,492
Indeed, I am.

1366
01:10:16,656 --> 01:10:19,449
What you must realize, my Autobot brothers,

1367
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,123
is we were never going to win the war.

1368
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,625
For the sake of our planet's survival,

1369
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:27,091
a deal had to be made

1370
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,589
with Megatron.

1371
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,079
Get back!
What have you done?

1372
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,694
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1373
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,165
Bee!
Get back!

1374
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,252
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!

1375
01:11:08,276 --> 01:11:09,449
Come on!
No...

1376
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,771
Get a medic down here!

1377
01:11:19,796 --> 01:11:21,056
We don't have enough men!

1378
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,045
Do not engage Sentinel!

1379
01:11:23,706 --> 01:11:24,946
Just go to the back gate.

1380
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,484
Take cover!

1381
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,489
Watch left! Watch left!

1382
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,699
Let's go! Follow me!

1383
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,757
Director, don't go there!
Stand down!

1384
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,261
Hey, Sentinel!

1385
01:11:51,296 --> 01:11:52,957
Director!
What is going on?

1386
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,561
What do you think you are doing?

1387
01:11:58,042 --> 01:11:59,721
I am a Prime!

1388
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,182
I do not take orders from you.

1389
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,736
Director Mearing, come on.

1390
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:06,547
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.

1391
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,919
Now return what belongs to me!

1392
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,364
Oh, my God!

1393
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,967
You guys ok?
Is everybody out?

1394
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,340
Everybody, stay calm.
You are gonna be fine.

1395
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,305
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!

1396
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:44,918
This is all on you!

1397
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:47,098
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

1398
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:49,943
Come on, let's go.

1399
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:52,056
Alright, notify the 101st Airborne!

1400
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,181
We need to hunt this thing down!

1401
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,131
Carly!

1402
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,288
Hot from our little campfire.

1403
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,610
Is mores. Isn't that great?

1404
01:13:09,736 --> 01:13:11,442
We are really living off the land.

1405
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,093
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?

1406
01:13:14,183 --> 01:13:16,726
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.

1407
01:13:16,838 --> 01:13:17,827
Why would not she be at home?

1408
01:13:17,918 --> 01:13:19,006
We had a fight and...

1409
01:13:19,306 --> 01:13:20,830
we might have broken up,

1410
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:21,935
or be on a break. I don't really know.

1411
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,361
What? No.
Look, I can't talk about it right now.

1412
01:13:24,386 --> 01:13:26,627
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.

1413
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:29,675
Sam, we are having
a family meeting. Family meeting!

1414
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:30,965
You may not know this,

1415
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,402
but your father and I
were not always this perfectly happy.

1416
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,902
You know, there was a time
in our marriage

1417
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:36,653
when I thought this was not gonna work out.

1418
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:37,736
Mom can we please not?
I just try

1419
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,153
to understand.
She is damaging him.

1420
01:13:39,177 --> 01:13:41,498
You break up with one world-class hottie...
No.

1421
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:42,912
Stop. Stop, ok?

1422
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,872
She dumped me, I moved
on to something better. That's it.

1423
01:13:44,897 --> 01:13:46,057
I am a happier person.
The second beautiful girl,

1424
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:47,262
Why don't you help me?
And you lose her.

1425
01:13:47,287 --> 01:13:49,537
They had an argument.
One fight.

1426
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:52,429
You are not gonna get a third one,
I mean unless you have like a...

1427
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,918
big...
What the... Ma!

1428
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,002
Mom, mom...
Maybe you just,

1429
01:13:55,026 --> 01:13:56,552
Mom.
Don't know what you are doing.

1430
01:13:56,577 --> 01:13:58,252
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
You need the book.

1431
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,830
You are always wrong.
Tell him about the book.

1432
01:13:59,855 --> 01:14:00,720
Get used to it.
Ok.

1433
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,597
You have got to read this.
She Comes First.

1434
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,790
There is some killer shit in here.
No. No.

1435
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,541
No. No.
That's it, I am going.

1436
01:14:06,566 --> 01:14:07,967
No. No. No.
Sit down!

1437
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:09,674
Sit down! Back me up!

1438
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,947
Happy wife, happy life.
Heck yeah.

1439
01:14:13,018 --> 01:14:13,979
Unhappy wife,

1440
01:14:14,236 --> 01:14:16,344
stone-cold misery for the rest of your...

1441
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,609
Stop.
It's true.

1442
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:19,978
All I am saying is, do you love this girl?

1443
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,638
She is the one.
Then you got to go get her.

1444
01:14:22,816 --> 01:14:25,532
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles he...

1445
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,664
he moved heaven and earth to find me.

1446
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,614
What you... Say what you said.

1447
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,012
Say it.
I will follow you to the end of time.

1448
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,632
Does that suck or what?

1449
01:14:34,657 --> 01:14:36,568
It's like e a bad sci-fi film.
No. It is so sweet.

1450
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,891
I want you to get out of the city.
You get as far away from here as you can.

1451
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:41,360
You understand?

1452
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:42,758
I love you.

1453
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:06,202
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!

1454
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,624
So when Sentinel left Cybertron,
it was to defect?

1455
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,415
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

1456
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,751
before fate waylaid us both.

1457
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,636
The only way to revive him,

1458
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:22,704
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

1459
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,990
Excellent strategy.

1460
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,555
Mine, mine!

1461
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,775
So he is now your partner, master?

1462
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:43,452
He is my greatest triumph.

1463
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,824
So impressive.

1464
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:47,393
Commencing transport.

1465
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:50,307
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

1466
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:51,783
Forgive me.

1467
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,841
Here we are.

1468
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,793
Fight us now.

1469
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,833
Contact!

1470
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,965
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

1471
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:47,594
Autobots, retreat!

1472
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,294
Why, Sentinel, why?

1473
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,829
For Cybertron!

1474
01:17:17,853 --> 01:17:19,169
For our home!

1475
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,000
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!

1476
01:17:22,024 --> 01:17:24,800
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1477
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,047
No, It's not the only way.

1478
01:17:27,071 --> 01:17:28,568
This is our home!

1479
01:17:28,592 --> 01:17:30,134
We must defend the humans!

1480
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:32,338
So lost you are, Optimus.

1481
01:17:32,452 --> 01:17:34,488
On Cybertron, we were gods.

1482
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,649
And here,

1483
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:38,142
they call us machines.

1484
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,488
Let the humans serve us, or perish.

1485
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,400
You are lucky I didn't kill you.

1486
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:49,231
In time you will see.

1487
01:17:50,017 --> 01:17:51,676
It's not over.

1488
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,243
Now, if I were him,

1489
01:17:57,329 --> 01:17:59,410
I would not let you
out of my sight for one second.

1490
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,473
It's funny. I was just thinking
on the way over here,

1491
01:18:03,527 --> 01:18:05,680
I could really use some advice
from Dylan, and there he is.

1492
01:18:05,705 --> 01:18:07,241
Can I speak to you, Carly?
Welcome. Please, sit down.

1493
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,166
Have a drink.

1494
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,257
You know what, I don't need a drink.

1495
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:11,787
Or a car, or a job.

1496
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,289
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.

1497
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,599
Is that ok with you, Mr. inappropriate?

1498
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,102
Excuse me.

1499
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,967
What's going on?
I will tell you outside.

1500
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,334
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1501
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,116
I remember a talk I had
with my dad once about tough choices.

1502
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,035
Yeah, now is not the time.
We will set something up, though.

1503
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,493
Of course, it was way back,
when my dad's firm was in charge

1504
01:18:32,536 --> 01:18:34,664
of budget review and accounting for NASA.

1505
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,873
You see, the thing that he taught me was,

1506
01:18:37,898 --> 01:18:39,286
when it's not your war,

1507
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:41,219
you join the side that's going to win.

1508
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,082
Move.

1509
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,634
Too direct? Or is it just me?

1510
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:46,916
Certainly not you, sir.

1511
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:01,608
You are mine!

1512
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,648
No!

1513
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,932
Get help!
Sam, I can't get out!

1514
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,198
Someone get help!
Good night!

1515
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,281
Good night, Mr. Dylan.

1516
01:19:11,306 --> 01:19:12,916
Get me out of here!

1517
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,973
Help! Get help!

1518
01:19:19,014 --> 01:19:20,160
He is young.

1519
01:19:20,184 --> 01:19:22,239
He will learn. Good night.
Get me out!

1520
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,505
It was a fun night.

1521
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:28,298
You really think you are the first man ever
asked to join the noble alien cause?

1522
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:29,509
Who are you?

1523
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,798
Do you know why we have not been back
to the moon since 1972?

1524
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,103
Because these two,

1525
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,932
they came to my dad and they told him
to do some creative accounting.

1526
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,605
Make it way too expensive
to ever go back. So, he and the others

1527
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:43,138
shut down the American
and Russian space programs.

1528
01:19:43,163 --> 01:19:45,397
And they ave been our clients ever since.

1529
01:19:45,422 --> 01:19:46,508
You helped them kill people?

1530
01:19:46,585 --> 01:19:48,045
You think they would give you a choice?

1531
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,778
Besides, it's not
like I personally participated.

1532
01:19:49,803 --> 01:19:51,928
I am a liaison. I liaise.

1533
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:56,798
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1534
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,295
Sam!

1535
01:20:03,101 --> 01:20:03,995
Sam!

1536
01:20:04,347 --> 01:20:05,511
Let her go!

1537
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:07,717
Sam!

1538
01:20:11,178 --> 01:20:13,033
I have had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1539
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,186
You are the one spy
I have never been able to provide

1540
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:16,795
as someone close to the Autobots.

1541
01:20:20,132 --> 01:20:22,293
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

1542
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:23,807
Yes, he will.

1543
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,063
They all do.

1544
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,626
They will slaughter her, you understand me?

1545
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:31,314
In the time it takes you to blink,

1546
01:20:31,338 --> 01:20:33,189
they will do it to her
and they will do it to me.

1547
01:20:33,256 --> 01:20:35,042
So you show a little respect

1548
01:20:35,067 --> 01:20:37,220
when someone offers you a job!

1549
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:39,748
Wrist.

1550
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,436
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

1551
01:20:42,466 --> 01:20:44,315
because you are the one human he trusts,

1552
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,876
and you will ask one question.

1553
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,455
How does he intend to fight back?

1554
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:50,005
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1555
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,048
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?

1556
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:58,385
It's very high-tech.

1557
01:20:58,421 --> 01:20:59,885
It lets us see what you see,

1558
01:20:59,909 --> 01:21:02,311
hear what you hear
and it taps your nervous system.

1559
01:21:02,409 --> 01:21:04,775
So, if you so much as try and signal...

1560
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,399
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

1561
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,734
Relationships have consequences.
I am here because of my father.

1562
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:13,297
She is here because of you.

1563
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,120
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1564
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,157
Soundwave, would you please?

1565
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,321
Sam, do your job.

1566
01:21:26,522 --> 01:21:27,495
She will be safe.

1567
01:21:27,519 --> 01:21:28,759
I give you my word.

1568
01:21:31,657 --> 01:21:32,709
I will kill you.

1569
01:21:33,123 --> 01:21:34,491
You have my word.

1570
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:40,386
Combatant Commands
are now at DEFCON 1.

1571
01:21:40,513 --> 01:21:43,183
Approximately 200 Decepticons
are now in hiding.

1572
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,513
Energon detectors have been triggered

1573
01:21:45,538 --> 01:21:47,699
as far away as South America and China.

1574
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,393
The U.N. just received an encrypted audio file.

1575
01:21:50,629 --> 01:21:52,564
They say it's from the leader
of the Autobots.

1576
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,061
Defenders of Earth.

1577
01:21:55,309 --> 01:21:57,971
We have come for your natural resources

1578
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,260
to rebuild our damaged planet.

1579
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,242
When we have transported all we need,

1580
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:05,507
we will leave your world in peace.

1581
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:08,048
For such peace to exist,

1582
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:13,126
you must immediately exile
the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

1583
01:22:13,816 --> 01:22:15,306
Non-negotiable.

1584
01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:17,676
Renounce the rebels.

1585
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,192
We await your reply.

1586
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,767
We will debrief you in transit.

1587
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,265
Yeah, I really don't see
how I can be of any help.

1588
01:22:24,418 --> 01:22:25,553
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.

1589
01:22:25,578 --> 01:22:27,409
We could just do this another time,
I think.

1590
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:33,222
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1591
01:22:33,378 --> 01:22:34,371
What?

1592
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:36,227
You warned us that they were using humans.

1593
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,150
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

1594
01:22:38,175 --> 01:22:39,246
Director!

1595
01:22:40,345 --> 01:22:43,145
Who am I? Hey, you are the expert.
I am just a walking security risk.

1596
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,510
Are you alright?

1597
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,499
Yes.

1598
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,292
No, you are not. You are sweating.
I am fine.

1599
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,254
I am fine.
I am sweating because I am nervous.

1600
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:59,470
I am nervous because you got me
in here with this information.

1601
01:22:59,495 --> 01:23:01,034
Ok, I am a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.

1602
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,168
I can't keep a secret to save my life.
You would not dare.

1603
01:23:02,193 --> 01:23:03,216
That's the truth. I am telling you.

1604
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,865
Director, the Pentagon is calling in 15.

1605
01:23:07,122 --> 01:23:08,996
What are you doing?
Nothing. What are you doing?

1606
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:11,386
Get away from me.

1607
01:23:11,706 --> 01:23:14,245
<i>It's been a remarkable series of events
today at the Capitol.</i>

1608
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:15,532
<i>Just moments ago,</i>

1609
01:23:15,556 --> 01:23:18,073
<i>legislation was passed to exile the Autobots</i>

1610
01:23:18,098 --> 01:23:19,429
<i>from American shores.</i>

1611
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,866
<i>The U.S. military alliance
with them is officially over.</i>

1612
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,812
<i>In the words of the House Majority Leader,</i>
Yeah.

1613
01:23:24,837 --> 01:23:26,610
<i>The sponsor of today's resolution,</i>

1614
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:28,313
<i>We cannot in good conscience...</i>
What?

1615
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:30,952
They can't do this. You got to tell them
they can't do that.

1616
01:23:30,976 --> 01:23:32,287
Ok. It's official.

1617
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:33,580
It's a go people.
These are our allies.

1618
01:23:33,604 --> 01:23:34,947
The Autobots fought for us.
They fought with us.

1619
01:23:34,972 --> 01:23:36,007
And where are we now?

1620
01:23:36,118 --> 01:23:37,654
Facing an enemy invasion

1621
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,508
with an enemy that has the means
to deploy countless more.

1622
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,579
If there is any more you know,

1623
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,053
anything at all about the enemy's intentions,

1624
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,768
now is the time to tell.

1625
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,941
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.

1626
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,936
And that is where you are wrong.

1627
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,981
Its name is the Xanthium.

1628
01:23:59,519 --> 01:24:01,094
It brought the second wave of Autobots

1629
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,610
and it's been under NASA's care
and study ever since.

1630
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,266
We linked it with a decommissioned shuttle

1631
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,953
to maintain military control
until they are gone.

1632
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:13,162
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque
on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

1633
01:24:13,187 --> 01:24:15,504
You are gonna risk the lives
of all me mates!

1634
01:24:15,529 --> 01:24:16,652
I will ball you!

1635
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,958
These guys are the Wreckers.
They take care of the Xanthium.

1636
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,386
We don't let them off the base much,
because they are assholes.

1637
01:24:21,411 --> 01:24:23,575
You got to pull that, ya Nancy wanker!

1638
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,141
It's time to kill him!

1639
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:27,077
I am just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.

1640
01:24:27,102 --> 01:24:29,665
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.

1641
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,772
Epps!
You are ridiculous!

1642
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,234
Is that you?
What up, man?

1643
01:24:33,259 --> 01:24:34,412
What are you doing here?

1644
01:24:34,921 --> 01:24:36,594
I retired from the Air Force.

1645
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:38,243
Can you let my hand go?

1646
01:24:39,504 --> 01:24:40,835
What the hell was that?

1647
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,490
Now I just consult
to run interference for them.

1648
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:44,758
Well, you are not helping!

1649
01:24:44,783 --> 01:24:46,945
No more combat and aliens shooting
at my ass.

1650
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:48,071
I got a dream job.

1651
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,119
Time to get off this planet.

1652
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,324
Kicking the Autobots out.

1653
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:53,804
Can you believe this is happening?

1654
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:56,984
Where do you think it's taking them?
Any planet but here.

1655
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,719
I wanna talk to whoever is in charge here!

1656
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,922
Well, well, well.

1657
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:07,654
Charlotte Mearing.

1658
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:08,842
Agent Simmons.

1659
01:25:08,931 --> 01:25:10,712
Former Agent Simmons.
So...

1660
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:12,596
I see you survived Washington.

1661
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:13,888
Washington, Egypt,

1662
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:17,032
heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

1663
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,768
They are bringing everybody in, kid.

1664
01:25:19,088 --> 01:25:21,102
Putting all the Intel on the table.

1665
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,357
And if you think deporting 9 Autobots,

1666
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:26,406
is gonna solve a damn thing...

1667
01:25:26,431 --> 01:25:27,671
It's out of my hands.

1668
01:25:28,485 --> 01:25:30,225
Moving up in the world?

1669
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,372
Your booty looks excellent.

1670
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,380
If you ever say a word to anyone

1671
01:25:39,405 --> 01:25:40,941
about what happened that night in Quantico,

1672
01:25:41,425 --> 01:25:42,665
I will cut your heart out.

1673
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:44,678
You already did.

1674
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:46,870
Sammy, listen to me.

1675
01:25:47,326 --> 01:25:48,756
Don't let them exile us.

1676
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:51,488
Don't let them take us, Sam.
It's a Decepticon trap.

1677
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,589
Check the nitrogen levels.

1678
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:31,266
We are booking out of here.

1679
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:34,928
Optimus?

1680
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,138
What your leaders say is true.

1681
01:26:37,185 --> 01:26:39,755
I... This was all my fault.

1682
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,143
I told them whom to trust.

1683
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:44,317
I was so wrong.

1684
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,945
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.

1685
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:48,762
Remember this.

1686
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,779
You may lose your faith in us,

1687
01:26:52,277 --> 01:26:53,530
but never...

1688
01:26:53,678 --> 01:26:55,326
in yourselves.

1689
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,206
I need to know
how you are gonna fight back.

1690
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,627
I know this is strategy, I know you...

1691
01:27:08,147 --> 01:27:10,676
you are coming back with reinforcements,
something. I know there is a plan.

1692
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,312
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.

1693
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,477
There is no plan.

1694
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,611
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with ourselves?

1695
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:28,600
You are my friend, Sam.

1696
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,151
You always will be.

1697
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,158
But your leaders have spoken.

1698
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:36,910
From here,

1699
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,627
the fight will be your own.

1700
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,736
Make it short.

1701
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:57,727
We are loading up.

1702
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,261
Alright, hustle up!

1703
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:02,405
We are launching at dawn.

1704
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,395
We are gonna do whatever we can.

1705
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:08,938
Make it like it was.

1706
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,735
You will always be my friend, Sam.

1707
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,938
I got to be going on.

1708
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,753
Years from now, they are gonna ask us,

1709
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,215
Where were you
when they took over the planet?

1710
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,583
We are gonna say,

1711
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,389
We just stood by and watched.

1712
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:58,739
You should really look at this
as a partnership.

1713
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,329
You have to stand on the side of progress

1714
01:29:01,364 --> 01:29:02,966
if you wanna be a part of history.

1715
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:16,672
<i>Seven.</i>

1716
01:29:16,979 --> 01:29:17,745
<i>Six.</i>

1717
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:18,676
<i>Five.</i>

1718
01:29:19,027 --> 01:29:19,759
<i>Four.</i>

1719
01:29:20,034 --> 01:29:20,718
<i>Three.</i>

1720
01:29:21,078 --> 01:29:21,777
<i>Two.</i>

1721
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:22,637
<i>One.</i>

1722
01:29:22,965 --> 01:29:23,636
<i>Zero.</i>

1723
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,531
<i>Go ahead and throttle up.</i>

1724
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,884
You wanted an answer. You got one.

1725
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:54,752
<i>I always get what I want, Sam.</i>

1726
01:29:55,115 --> 01:29:56,509
<i>We just needed to be sure.</i>

1727
01:29:57,162 --> 01:29:58,242
Sure of what?

1728
01:29:58,435 --> 01:29:59,748
That they would go without a fight.

1729
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,752
<i>Say again.
We are tracking an incoming object.</i>

1730
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:06,547
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1731
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,260
I need your help to track a phone call.
There is a man on this phone.

1732
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:16,321
He is the head of their human operations
and he has Carly hostage.

1733
01:31:16,397 --> 01:31:18,228
I want you to sit down. Don't move.

1734
01:31:20,447 --> 01:31:21,409
Follow me.

1735
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,106
I am watching him drive up right now.

1736
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:29,712
The call was placed en route.

1737
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:32,142
I am hacking into the phone's camera now.

1738
01:31:32,772 --> 01:31:34,808
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.

1739
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,603
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.

1740
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,580
Ok, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I have got it.

1741
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,401
Trump Tower, Chicago.

1742
01:31:42,425 --> 01:31:43,335
Lower penthouse.

1743
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:44,398
We are on.

1744
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:48,515
I am going.
You sure?

1745
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,413
She is done nothing but try to help me,
and I can be there in 15 hours.

1746
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,014
You are not going alone.

1747
01:31:56,662 --> 01:31:58,685
I still got my NEST friends out there.

1748
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:01,160
I will round them up,
we will find your girlfriend,

1749
01:32:01,185 --> 01:32:02,482
we are gonna bring this guy in.

1750
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,765
Why are you helping me?

1751
01:32:04,807 --> 01:32:07,092
Because that asshole killed my friends too.

1752
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,319
They said they were here for our resources,

1753
01:32:25,343 --> 01:32:26,788
to rebuild their planet.

1754
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,572
Yes,

1755
01:32:27,665 --> 01:32:29,625
but really one resource in particular.

1756
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,921
One unique to our planet.

1757
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:34,851
Us?

1758
01:32:36,973 --> 01:32:38,251
You are very smart.

1759
01:32:38,897 --> 01:32:41,423
You see, they can't rebuild
without a slave labor force.

1760
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,533
How many rocks up there in
the universe offer 6 billion workers?

1761
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,944
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

1762
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,642
They are not shipping people.
They are shipping their planet here.

1763
01:32:57,475 --> 01:32:58,569
Oh, my God.

1764
01:33:00,248 --> 01:33:01,451
What's Sentinel doing here?

1765
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:02,607
Watch.

1766
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:05,389
They are spreading hundreds of
pillars around the globe right now.

1767
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:06,902
In just a few hours,

1768
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:08,308
they are gonna launch them into orbit

1769
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,928
and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere.

1770
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:12,742
The red one there,

1771
01:33:12,766 --> 01:33:13,785
controls the rest.

1772
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,916
He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.

1773
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,434
Be gone, insect operative.

1774
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,071
Your work is done.

1775
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,339
Your Excellency. He is such a dick.

1776
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,991
You want this to happen?
I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1777
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:31,552
You think I asked for this?

1778
01:33:31,576 --> 01:33:32,892
I inherited a client.

1779
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,565
Yeah and when Cybertron is here

1780
01:33:34,589 --> 01:33:35,598
we are all their slaves,

1781
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:38,100
I guess they will still need a
human leader. Don't jinx me.

1782
01:33:38,256 --> 01:33:39,992
You want to survive, you listen to me.

1783
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,941
It is time for the slaves of Earth
to recognize their masters.

1784
01:34:01,797 --> 01:34:03,412
Seal off the city.

1785
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:00,884
Get the dogs out of here now!
Get them in the back!

1786
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:04,775
I guess they didn't tell you about
this part, did they?

1787
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,235
You think I am at every meeting?

1788
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,485
Look, I am safe.

1789
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:10,704
They said I was safe.

1790
01:35:22,526 --> 01:35:23,561
Let's roll!

1791
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:31,796
We had a signal earlier.

1792
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,780
It's not working.

1793
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,848
<i>This is a national emergency broadcast.</i>

1794
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,574
<i>Chicago has suffered a massive attack.</i>

1795
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,595
Wrong way!

1796
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,959
Get out of here! Go back!

1797
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,766
<i>There is a ring of alien ships
around Chicago.</i>

1798
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,641
Our high-range bombers
were just knocked out of the sky.

1799
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:27,533
<i>They can't get through
enemy air defenses over the city.</i>

1800
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,252
<i>Our satellites have been jammed.</i>

1801
01:36:29,277 --> 01:36:31,354
<i>We have no way to monitor
the enemy's movement.</i>

1802
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,531
<i>Our old NEST teams are on stand-down
holding at Grissom Air Force Base.</i>

1803
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:36,336
We are about 10 minutes from
the battle zone.

1804
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:39,009
We have Special Forces
trying to gain access to the city,

1805
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,783
<i>and infantry is staging at the perimeter.</i>

1806
01:36:40,808 --> 01:36:43,470
Excuse me, excuse me,
it just doesn't make sense!

1807
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,122
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1808
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,003
They keep shooting down our drones.

1809
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,425
<i>They want us blind.</i>

1810
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,479
<i>But we do have a couple
of mini-drones we are gonna try.</i>

1811
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:55,081
Well, whoever is manning these UAV drones,

1812
01:36:55,106 --> 01:36:57,206
can we try to redirect them
toward Trump Tower?

1813
01:36:57,231 --> 01:36:59,518
The kid Witwickety,
was on his way to Chicago.

1814
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:02,367
Said some point-man human op is there,

1815
01:37:02,587 --> 01:37:03,969
for the Decepticons!

1816
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:05,924
Listen, if I know anything, I know this,

1817
01:37:05,949 --> 01:37:09,066
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

1818
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,356
My God.

1819
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:55,019
We came here to find her
in the middle of all that?

1820
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,987
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1821
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,203
I am not going in there.

1822
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,622
No one is going in.

1823
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:09,543
I am.

1824
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,462
With or without you, I will find her.

1825
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,210
You are gonna get yourself killed, Sam.

1826
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:16,713
Is that what you want?

1827
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,169
Is that what you want?

1828
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,929
You came all the way out here
to get yourself killed?

1829
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:22,639
Listen to what I am saying.

1830
01:38:22,664 --> 01:38:24,404
She is here because of me.
Do you understand?

1831
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,513
Listen, if you go in this building,

1832
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:28,415
that's if she is even still alive,

1833
01:38:28,472 --> 01:38:29,946
there is no way
you are gonna be able to reach her!

1834
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:31,385
What do you suggest I do?

1835
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:33,916
It's over.

1836
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:37,799
I am sorry, but it's over.

1837
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,350
No.

1838
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:41,670
Incoming!

1839
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:30,850
We will kill them all.

1840
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,548
Wreckers, kill him!

1841
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,532
This is going to hurt!

1842
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,929
A lot!

1843
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,187
Your leaders will now understand.

1844
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:55,751
Decepticons will never leave
your planet alone.

1845
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:59,274
And we needed them to believe
we had gone.

1846
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:00,858
For today,

1847
01:40:00,947 --> 01:40:02,733
in the name of freedom,

1848
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,640
we take the battle to them!

1849
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,470
I saw your ship blow up!
The ship?

1850
01:40:30,741 --> 01:40:32,466
We were never in the ship!

1851
01:40:32,551 --> 01:40:34,829
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

1852
01:40:35,188 --> 01:40:38,225
We were hidden
in the first booster rocket to separate.

1853
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:41,397
Splashed down back in the Atlantic,
just as planned.

1854
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,928
We ain't going nowhere.

1855
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:46,545
Yeah, no one is exiling us.

1856
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,949
The Autobots are staying right here.

1857
01:40:51,105 --> 01:40:52,839
We are gonna help you win this war.

1858
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:55,652
They are surrounding the city
to make a fortress

1859
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:59,094
so that no one can see
what they are up to inside.

1860
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:02,946
Our only chance is the element of surprise.

1861
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,524
I think I know where to look!

1862
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,785
<i>Mini-drone is on approach
to Trump Tower.</i>

1863
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,311
You are telling me Sam is headed into that?

1864
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,067
Poor kid.

1865
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,222
Probably never got close.

1866
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,628
So, you can fly this thing, right?

1867
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,378
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?

1868
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,456
So you so-so can fly this?
That feels terrible.

1869
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,250
We are right behind you.

1870
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,640
Alright, we are going in!

1871
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:08,785
The city is secure.

1872
01:42:09,217 --> 01:42:12,175
The humans cannot stop us.

1873
01:42:12,418 --> 01:42:14,750
As the afternoon falls,

1874
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,125
the rest of the pillars
will reach their launch position.

1875
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:20,664
This is the victory I promised you,

1876
01:42:20,688 --> 01:42:22,747
so many years ago,

1877
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:28,268
where we rebuild Cybertron together!

1878
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:30,995
I have deigned to work with you

1879
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,253
that our planet may survive!

1880
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:37,539
I will never work for you!

1881
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:42,117
You would be wise
to remember the difference.

1882
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,588
I am so sick of this.
I am just sick of waiting.

1883
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:10,757
Where is she?

1884
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,681
Where is she?

1885
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:15,449
You have got some balls.

1886
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,088
No, Sam!

1887
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:31,763
No!

1888
01:43:32,185 --> 01:43:33,237
No!

1889
01:43:33,261 --> 01:43:34,462
No.

1890
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,702
Carly!

1891
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,250
Carly!

1892
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:45,988
Jump!

1893
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,245
Bee, fire!

1894
01:44:22,973 --> 01:44:23,925
Bee!

1895
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,780
Autobots! They are alive!

1896
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,693
Decepticons, defend the pillar!

1897
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,737
Raise the bridges!

1898
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,409
Find them!

1899
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,511
Sam.

1900
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:18,676
You found me.

1901
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,102
I would follow you anywhere.

1902
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,042
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

1903
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,660
Well, you are crazy.

1904
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:39,417
What is that? is that us?

1905
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:42,199
This thing's a military UAV.

1906
01:45:42,223 --> 01:45:43,993
Stone, check and see if it's still working.

1907
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:45,258
Yeah, it's still got power.

1908
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:46,829
Flight Control, do you copy?

1909
01:45:47,524 --> 01:45:49,544
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?

1910
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:51,258
I think we got something.

1911
01:45:51,283 --> 01:45:52,643
Epps! We got Epps!

1912
01:45:54,139 --> 01:45:55,925
<i>Come on, work! Work!</i>

1913
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,643
Alright, turn the volume up on that!

1914
01:45:57,668 --> 01:45:58,671
The kid!

1915
01:45:58,943 --> 01:46:00,627
<i>Can you rotate or something?</i>

1916
01:46:01,853 --> 01:46:03,053
Yes, yes!

1917
01:46:03,077 --> 01:46:04,640
Ok, ok, ok.
They can see us.

1918
01:46:04,808 --> 01:46:06,548
<i>Chicago is ground zero,
do you understand?</i>

1919
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:07,974
<i>Can you hear us?</i>
Witwicky.

1920
01:46:07,998 --> 01:46:09,081
<i>You understand?</i>

1921
01:46:09,347 --> 01:46:10,760
<i>Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here</i>

1922
01:46:10,785 --> 01:46:12,241
<i>and he has the pillars
to his space bridge.</i>

1923
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,874
They are on top of a building
on Chicago River.

1924
01:46:13,899 --> 01:46:15,429
It's owned by Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

1925
01:46:15,454 --> 01:46:18,380
<i>Now, the pillar that controls everything
is in the southeast cupola.</i>

1926
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,662
<i>You have got to destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down the pillar</i>

1927
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:22,956
<i>or they are going to transport
Cybertron here, do you understand?</i>

1928
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:24,466
<i>Do you understand?</i>
What?

1929
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:27,035
Give me a GPS on the building
and on that drone!

1930
01:46:27,059 --> 01:46:28,010
Let's go!

1931
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:30,604
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

1932
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:32,257
Guys on the tarmac, 5 minutes.

1933
01:46:32,282 --> 01:46:33,445
<i>The southeast cupola.</i>

1934
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,401
Alright!

1935
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:38,297
We need to move
before the fighters spot us.

1936
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,633
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.

1937
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:43,063
Let's roll.
Ratchet, cover high.

1938
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:46,602
Hey, think we could use that rocket
to shoot down the pillar?

1939
01:46:46,728 --> 01:46:47,931
We are 8 blocks away.

1940
01:46:48,103 --> 01:46:49,610
We got to get closer to take a shot.

1941
01:46:49,635 --> 01:46:51,351
Not closer. Higher.

1942
01:46:51,501 --> 01:46:52,798
We need a clear line of sight.

1943
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:54,060
And it's across the river.

1944
01:46:54,084 --> 01:46:56,001
Gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

1945
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:57,566
We only got one shot.

1946
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:00,198
One shot is all we need.

1947
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:03,620
We got to be able to see
around that building from the ground.

1948
01:47:03,849 --> 01:47:05,463
Get NSA to send service specs

1949
01:47:05,487 --> 01:47:07,959
for any cameras in that area.
Maybe some are working.

1950
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:11,000
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

1951
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:12,664
Listen up.

1952
01:47:12,789 --> 01:47:14,039
You want to hit back?

1953
01:47:14,826 --> 01:47:16,293
We are gonna have to wingsuit in.

1954
01:47:16,687 --> 01:47:18,156
It's the only way to get close.

1955
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:21,898
I can't promise anyone a ride home,
but if you are with me,

1956
01:47:22,762 --> 01:47:24,161
the world needs you now.

1957
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,098
I will find my own ride home, sir.

1958
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:31,642
Who else?

1959
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:36,022
General Morshower,

1960
01:47:36,047 --> 01:47:38,617
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

1961
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:41,034
We are coming north and low.
You guys drive them to the east.

1962
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,262
Autobot victory! Autobot victory!

1963
01:48:32,676 --> 01:48:35,222
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

1964
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:37,249
They got my trailer.

1965
01:48:37,273 --> 01:48:39,121
I need that flight tech.

1966
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,760
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.

1967
01:48:43,322 --> 01:48:44,349
Wreckers...

1968
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:46,576
we need a diversion.

1969
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,107
Let's get some!
You got that right.

1970
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:50,595
Listen,

1971
01:48:50,904 --> 01:48:52,682
we are gonna circle around
to that glass building.

1972
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,732
And we will get high enough
to make the rocket shot

1973
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,469
while you guys draw his fire.

1974
01:48:56,494 --> 01:48:57,984
Let's move!
Wait a minute!

1975
01:48:58,032 --> 01:49:01,365
I am not letting you go out there
without my urban combat prototypes.

1976
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:03,220
We got to go, Que!
Come on.

1977
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:05,201
They are great inventions for kicking ass!

1978
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:06,369
What are these?

1979
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:07,829
Those are boom-sticks.

1980
01:49:08,106 --> 01:49:09,771
Armed in 30 seconds.

1981
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,000
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

1982
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:14,411
Go, go! Move your ass! Move, move!

1983
01:49:14,436 --> 01:49:16,830
Move, move!
Go, go, go!

1984
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,133
Move, move!
Let's go!

1985
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,412
Let's go!
Run!

1986
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:46,430
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
No, no, no!

1987
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:48,320
Where you going?
Stop, stop, stop!

1988
01:49:48,344 --> 01:49:49,164
Don't leave!

1989
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:50,572
You never leave a 'bot behind!

1990
01:49:51,892 --> 01:49:53,267
Shockwave is coming!

1991
01:49:57,702 --> 01:49:58,717
Go for the stairs!

1992
01:49:58,742 --> 01:50:00,131
Epps, this way!

1993
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:03,287
<i>Breaking right. Breaking right.</i>

1994
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:04,936
<i>Bead. Rolling in.</i>

1995
01:50:10,256 --> 01:50:11,371
<i>We got another one coming around.</i>

1996
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:13,478
<i>Coming around on the left side,
coming around on the right side.</i>

1997
01:50:13,503 --> 01:50:15,869
We are going to use Willis Tower
for cover!

1998
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:18,000
Once we make altitude, we jump!

1999
01:50:18,025 --> 01:50:20,937
<i>A lot of airplanes out here!
Contact off the nose.</i>

2000
01:50:23,308 --> 01:50:24,718
<i>Mayday! I don't think he is gonna make it.</i>

2001
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,359
<i>Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.
Heads up! Heads up!</i>

2002
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,643
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

2003
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,476
<i>Tally on the left.
Got him.</i>

2004
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:46,653
<i>Time on target. 20 seconds.</i>

2005
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:48,213
Here we go!

2006
01:50:48,377 --> 01:50:49,442
Here we go!

2007
01:50:49,706 --> 01:50:50,753
Keep it tight!

2008
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:52,218
<i>Coming, coming around.</i>

2009
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,329
Alright, focus, focus, focus.

2010
01:50:59,515 --> 01:51:01,255
<i>Threat above tower, 6 o'clock!</i>

2011
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,354
Locusts!

2012
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,317
<i>Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!</i>

2013
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:07,982
<i>Watch out, watch out!</i>

2014
01:51:08,007 --> 01:51:09,399
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2015
01:51:11,646 --> 01:51:12,735
<i>Look out, look out, look out!</i>

2016
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,476
Get them out, get them out, get them out!

2017
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:15,698
Everybody out, out, out!

2018
01:51:15,722 --> 01:51:16,742
Jump, jump, jump!

2019
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:24,334
Get out, get out!

2020
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:26,172
I am stuck! I am stuck!

2021
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:28,526
<i>Now. Get them out now!
Get them out now!</i>

2022
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,589
<i>Help!</i>

2023
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:52,786
<i>Get separation.
Track away, track away!</i>

2024
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,800
Hard left! Hard left!

2025
01:52:16,290 --> 01:52:17,473
600 feet.

2026
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,660
Check your 6! Check your 6!

2027
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:36,219
He is on our ass!

2028
01:52:36,244 --> 01:52:38,108
Watch out, watch out!

2029
01:52:43,024 --> 01:52:43,959
Sharp right!

2030
01:52:49,656 --> 01:52:50,623
Building dead ahead!

2031
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:51,812
Thread the needle!

2032
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:02,984
Pull, pull!

2033
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,446
Come on, we are high enough!
This is a mother getting up here!

2034
01:53:08,471 --> 01:53:10,480
Get your fat ass over here!
I am coming.

2035
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,411
Set up the rocket!

2036
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:20,866
They are coming.
Weapons status?

2037
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:23,154
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

2038
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:27,276
There, the building with the dome.

2039
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:30,116
For our brothers,

2040
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:32,784
let's make this trip worth it.

2041
01:53:35,434 --> 01:53:36,469
Oh, God.

2042
01:53:38,596 --> 01:53:40,156
The building.
The building!

2043
01:53:45,135 --> 01:53:46,416
They are shooting at the building!

2044
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:51,565
This is not a good idea.
What?

2045
01:53:51,971 --> 01:53:53,881
This is not a good idea.
This building is unstable.

2046
01:53:53,905 --> 01:53:55,413
Listen, stop for a second.
If we don't do what we came to do,

2047
01:53:55,437 --> 01:53:57,026
it doesn't matter, we all die.
Right?

2048
01:53:57,299 --> 01:53:58,502
That's your target.
Come on, man!

2049
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,489
I don't even care
if the building collapses.

2050
01:54:00,607 --> 01:54:01,940
I am having a heart attack anyway.

2051
01:54:03,805 --> 01:54:05,262
The building is going over!

2052
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:06,590
Hang on!
Take cover!

2053
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,084
Keep your hands up!

2054
01:54:24,821 --> 01:54:25,981
It's ok! It stopped!

2055
01:54:26,463 --> 01:54:27,742
Guys, look!

2056
01:54:28,107 --> 01:54:30,133
Incoming, incoming!
Everybody hide!

2057
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:00,615
Don't move.

2058
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:07,125
Go, go.

2059
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:15,526
Run!

2060
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:16,936
Cover fire!

2061
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:20,568
Shoot the glass!

2062
01:55:20,772 --> 01:55:22,623
Jump out the window!

2063
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:30,419
Jump!

2064
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:48,714
We are gonna die!

2065
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:53,354
Sam, I can't stop!

2066
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:54,876
Shoot the glass!

2067
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,304
Sam!

2068
01:56:47,698 --> 01:56:49,245
Is everybody ok?

2069
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:51,128
You ok?

2070
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,669
What the hell was that?

2071
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:55,881
Driller-bot is thirsty.

2072
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,485
This evil thing is looking at me!
What?

2073
01:57:14,277 --> 01:57:16,484
It's even got an uglier Decepticon with it!

2074
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,811
We have to evac!

2075
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:38,674
Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!

2076
01:57:38,699 --> 01:57:39,745
We are trapped!

2077
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:42,844
Ok. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!

2078
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:45,550
Oh Lord Jesus,
let me just get out of this alive.

2079
01:57:56,090 --> 01:57:57,796
Move! We got to move!

2080
01:57:57,821 --> 01:57:59,937
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?

2081
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:01,862
Move!
We are about to be eaten, people!

2082
01:58:24,389 --> 01:58:26,175
We are gonna die!

2083
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,280
Hold on!
Give me your hand!

2084
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:45,941
I am swinging that way!
Got her!

2085
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,572
Oh, my God!

2086
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:50,028
I am dropping you on the fire escape!

2087
01:59:07,556 --> 01:59:08,718
Sam!

2088
01:59:09,726 --> 01:59:10,781
We got to move!

2089
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:26,786
I am coming for you!

2090
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:23,880
Optimus!

2091
02:00:23,905 --> 02:00:25,137
Wreckers!

2092
02:00:25,567 --> 02:00:26,572
We are coming!

2093
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:29,935
Decepticons around the world,

2094
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:32,169
launch the pillars.

2095
02:01:03,998 --> 02:01:05,772
We are so lost!

2096
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:07,507
Always left out.

2097
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:09,787
Ka-ching!

2098
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,185
It's time to lay down the law.

2099
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:15,970
About to bring some hurt now.

2100
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:24,932
It's starting!

2101
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:26,539
You see it?

2102
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:30,599
Look out!

2103
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:40,458
Where are Sam and Carly?

2104
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:44,505
We will go this way.

2105
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,381
I give you one thing to do,

2106
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,429
one thing to do,
and you drop the bail on that?

2107
02:01:55,517 --> 02:01:57,132
I ain't signed up for all this!

2108
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,434
Got aliens blasting at me,
running around, chasing me!

2109
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:01,762
I am ducking through churches and
buildings and all that kind of crap man!

2110
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,844
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

2111
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,061
I am trying to keep it together.

2112
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:11,479
What a treat!

2113
02:02:11,503 --> 02:02:13,865
You and me, alone!
Carly!

2114
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:20,739
Come on, come on! Run!

2115
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:23,991
Ok.

2116
02:02:24,551 --> 02:02:25,824
He is after me, not you.

2117
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,332
Run!

2118
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:31,411
You can't hide, boy!

2119
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:39,029
I just love it when
your little insect feet try to run!

2120
02:02:39,054 --> 02:02:40,310
Sam!
Run!

2121
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:48,476
I thought you were working for us, boy?

2122
02:02:52,115 --> 02:02:54,652
No! Sam!

2123
02:03:03,947 --> 02:03:04,984
My eye!

2124
02:03:18,057 --> 02:03:19,083
My eye!

2125
02:03:22,262 --> 02:03:23,947
Target the Decepticon!

2126
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,027
Sam!

2127
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:39,569
Please, you have got to save Sam!

2128
02:03:39,594 --> 02:03:41,004
You have got to save him!
What the hell is he doing?

2129
02:03:44,417 --> 02:03:45,858
This better work.

2130
02:03:46,127 --> 02:03:47,740
D-Bots! D-Bots!

2131
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:02,213
I can't see!

2132
02:04:02,349 --> 02:04:03,459
I can't see!

2133
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:04,748
Sam!

2134
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:07,127
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

2135
02:04:07,213 --> 02:04:08,498
I am trying!
Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

2136
02:04:08,733 --> 02:04:09,987
The bomb is gonna blow!

2137
02:04:11,209 --> 02:04:12,442
The bomb is gonna...

2138
02:04:12,662 --> 02:04:14,547
You human scum!

2139
02:04:14,572 --> 02:04:16,560
We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
What bomb?

2140
02:04:16,585 --> 02:04:17,620
You see that bomb?

2141
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:20,029
Cut it, cut it, cut it!
I got it!

2142
02:04:20,244 --> 02:04:21,665
How long do we have?

2143
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:24,587
I am gonna kick you!

2144
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:35,627
Cut, cut, cut!

2145
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:38,644
I am gonna kill...

2146
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:57,213
Well, he is dead.

2147
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:00,940
Hey,

2148
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:02,637
Bee is going to run with
the rest of the Autobots

2149
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:03,947
and meet us at the edge of the river.
Alright.

2150
02:05:32,926 --> 02:05:35,043
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!

2151
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:38,936
This is a total cluster...

2152
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:41,006
We got to get across the river.

2153
02:05:42,177 --> 02:05:43,065
You see that?

2154
02:05:43,089 --> 02:05:45,380
She said the control pillar
was in that first cupola. Alright.

2155
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,591
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

2156
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:50,240
<i>Tomahawks are inbound.</i>

2157
02:05:52,128 --> 02:05:53,538
<i>ETA. 20 minutes.</i>

2158
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,156
I am in the traffic cameras.

2159
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:57,609
<i>4 Autobots are captured.</i>

2160
02:05:58,384 --> 02:06:00,218
Oh, my God. We are helpless.

2161
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,917
Whatever is set to happen with those...

2162
02:06:02,188 --> 02:06:04,188
pulses getting faster
it's gonna happen soon.

2163
02:06:05,141 --> 02:06:06,756
<i>No sign of Optimus.</i>

2164
02:06:07,643 --> 02:06:09,355
How do we get these bridges down?

2165
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:12,323
Spread out. Check in there.

2166
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:15,714
Epps!

2167
02:06:16,027 --> 02:06:18,191
Epps, I have been looking for your ass.
How you doing?

2168
02:06:18,216 --> 02:06:19,310
Retirement is wack.

2169
02:06:19,518 --> 02:06:20,627
Even worse,

2170
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:22,742
we can't get across the river
to that building,

2171
02:06:22,767 --> 02:06:24,678
and the Autobots are upstairs, surrounded.

2172
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,356
Just pan the camera around, alright?

2173
02:06:32,381 --> 02:06:34,292
Alright. Pan... Pan right. That's you.

2174
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:37,132
Try getting into the bridge control room.

2175
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:41,670
What are they doing?
They are just standing there.

2176
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:43,000
Hang on, Dutch.

2177
02:06:43,265 --> 02:06:45,267
See if you can hack into the bridge.

2178
02:06:46,557 --> 02:06:48,095
Sir, SEALs are here.

2179
02:06:48,726 --> 02:06:50,557
It's a good day, boys! What do you got?

2180
02:06:50,645 --> 02:06:53,014
Got a 10-man SEAL unit sir,
tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

2181
02:06:53,042 --> 02:06:54,031
How long?
15.

2182
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:56,180
You are my prisoners!
Take it easy.

2183
02:06:56,204 --> 02:06:57,561
We surrender.

2184
02:06:58,528 --> 02:06:59,452
Get off me.

2185
02:07:00,762 --> 02:07:01,738
Get off me!

2186
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:04,954
Alright, you are gonna need your
40 Mike-Mikes and frags.

2187
02:07:04,979 --> 02:07:07,524
Go full auto.
The vibrations jack up their circuits.

2188
02:07:07,548 --> 02:07:09,444
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

2189
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:12,201
Alright, your target is up
on top of that building, that cupola.

2190
02:07:12,611 --> 02:07:15,220
How doomed you are, Autobots.

2191
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:17,626
You simply fail to understand,

2192
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:19,661
that the needs of the many,

2193
02:07:19,887 --> 02:07:22,087
outweigh the needs of the few.

2194
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:24,447
Activating the bridge.

2195
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:38,011
They happy about something.

2196
02:07:38,776 --> 02:07:40,292
We are in the heart of their ship.

2197
02:07:40,736 --> 02:07:42,316
Let's give them a little ride.

2198
02:07:43,534 --> 02:07:45,214
We gonna screw this ship up.

2199
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:48,114
It's a 128K binary encryption code.

2200
02:07:49,314 --> 02:07:50,599
It's difficult...

2201
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:52,903
But not for me. I am in.

2202
02:07:53,145 --> 02:07:54,707
Bridge down.

2203
02:07:56,002 --> 02:07:57,324
The bridge is coming down!

2204
02:07:57,582 --> 02:07:58,901
Someone is watching over us!

2205
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:00,237
Come on! Let's go!

2206
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:02,619
Pleasure working with you, Seymour.

2207
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:04,971
I believe you are supposed to say.

2208
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:07,018
Good job, Dutch.

2209
02:08:07,258 --> 02:08:08,320
<font color="#5feaff">Thank you.</font>

2210
02:08:14,234 --> 02:08:15,702
Get off! Get off!

2211
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:17,405
Get off me!

2212
02:08:40,671 --> 02:08:43,066
Hurry! They are triggering the pillars!

2213
02:08:44,508 --> 02:08:45,497
Prisoners?

2214
02:08:45,882 --> 02:08:46,961
You are keeping prisoners?

2215
02:08:47,011 --> 02:08:48,922
Yes.

2216
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,898
You need to teach them about respect.

2217
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:53,484
This was all business, but now
it's personal, do you understand me?

2218
02:08:54,984 --> 02:08:56,637
I understand.

2219
02:08:56,793 --> 02:09:00,125
No prisoners, only trophies.

2220
02:09:00,706 --> 02:09:01,513
Bee,

2221
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:04,324
I think they are going to kill us.

2222
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:06,435
You,

2223
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:08,799
your time is up.
Wait, wait, wait!

2224
02:09:08,824 --> 02:09:10,063
We surrendered!

2225
02:09:10,087 --> 02:09:11,316
We are your prisoners.

2226
02:09:11,341 --> 02:09:13,286
Move it!
Can't we talk this out?

2227
02:09:13,596 --> 02:09:15,527
We are all a bunch of good chaps!

2228
02:09:15,887 --> 02:09:17,369
I mean you no...

2229
02:09:19,757 --> 02:09:20,940
Why did you...

2230
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:30,588
Good-bye, my old friend.

2231
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:34,284
You are mine now.

2232
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:48,445
Get off me!

2233
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:50,988
I got to help him.
What?

2234
02:09:51,826 --> 02:09:52,914
What are you doing?

2235
02:09:53,369 --> 02:09:55,680
I got to help him.
You can't help him.

2236
02:09:56,088 --> 02:09:56,916
Sam?

2237
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:05,105
Turn around.

2238
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:16,935
We... We gave them a hell of a run.

2239
02:10:33,576 --> 02:10:35,146
We did it, Brains! We did it!

2240
02:10:35,286 --> 02:10:36,822
Rip this ship apart!

2241
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,067
We had a nice run Brains, you and me.
Yeah, we gonna die.

2242
02:11:35,637 --> 02:11:37,621
Ok, baby!
You all come with us!

2243
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:40,847
Go! You guys, follow that ground team! 
Go!

2244
02:11:40,935 --> 02:11:42,945
Move, move, move!
Epps, third floor!

2245
02:11:42,969 --> 02:11:44,177
We are going to 45!

2246
02:11:49,936 --> 02:11:51,551
Alright. Two snipers, right here!

2247
02:11:53,489 --> 02:11:54,576
Alright, dock up!

2248
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:57,295
We jump in 3 minutes!

2249
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:02,592
Set up shop right here.

2250
02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:08,553
Set up.

2251
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:11,996
I am downstairs.

2252
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:14,673
We got 5 targets
and Shockwave right below us.

2253
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:16,183
Stand by to jump!

2254
02:12:16,761 --> 02:12:18,613
Alright, let's go! Get ready, get ready.

2255
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:32,903
Go!

2256
02:12:43,974 --> 02:12:45,714
Snipers, take out their eyes.

2257
02:12:49,378 --> 02:12:51,115
Alright, demo team, let's crank steel.

2258
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:00,277
Turning steel!

2259
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:38,782
Don't fire till I tell you!

2260
02:13:49,475 --> 02:13:50,311
Go!

2261
02:13:52,816 --> 02:13:54,154
Good job, kid!

2262
02:13:54,685 --> 02:13:55,647
Fire!

2263
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:09,284
We got him!
Yeah!

2264
02:14:10,459 --> 02:14:11,591
He is on the run!

2265
02:14:14,499 --> 02:14:15,958
Autobots, attack!

2266
02:14:21,804 --> 02:14:23,237
Mortar that bridge!

2267
02:14:27,434 --> 02:14:29,766
It's our world now!

2268
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,281
Commence transport!

2269
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:47,067
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2270
02:15:01,927 --> 02:15:03,435
Optimus!

2271
02:15:38,213 --> 02:15:40,014
You die!

2272
02:15:48,410 --> 02:15:49,695
No!

2273
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:02,298
Get down here, Sentinel!

2274
02:16:02,394 --> 02:16:03,532
Optimus,

2275
02:16:04,657 --> 02:16:06,568
you forget your place!

2276
02:16:13,415 --> 02:16:15,614
I bring you Cybertron,

2277
02:16:15,903 --> 02:16:17,343
your home,

2278
02:16:18,157 --> 02:16:20,618
and still you choose humanity.

2279
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:24,674
You were the one who taught me
freedom is everyone is right.

2280
02:16:28,597 --> 02:16:30,838
I will retrigger that pillar!

2281
02:16:31,034 --> 02:16:33,315
Then you will have to go through me!

2282
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:39,513
Ok, I have got to try and help.

2283
02:16:39,608 --> 02:16:41,519
I have to. You stay here.
Don't you go. Don't go.

2284
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:43,016
You will be fine, ok?

2285
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,154
I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.

2286
02:16:47,241 --> 02:16:48,764
Charge the pillar!

2287
02:16:49,197 --> 02:16:50,528
We got Autobots!

2288
02:17:07,803 --> 02:17:09,232
Reinforcements!

2289
02:17:09,847 --> 02:17:12,482
Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!

2290
02:17:17,455 --> 02:17:20,213
We are taking fire!
I need those Tomahawks now!

2291
02:17:20,258 --> 02:17:21,650
<i>First wave inbound.</i>

2292
02:17:27,906 --> 02:17:29,934
We have got to cover for Optimus!

2293
02:17:44,673 --> 02:17:45,662
Decepticons,

2294
02:17:46,326 --> 02:17:47,676
trigger the pillar!

2295
02:17:48,552 --> 02:17:50,228
Restart that pillar!

2296
02:17:51,013 --> 02:17:52,345
Trigger the pillars.

2297
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:54,921
I can't hold them!

2298
02:17:55,273 --> 02:17:57,384
The ships have us pinned!

2299
02:17:58,270 --> 02:17:59,680
No!

2300
02:18:00,022 --> 02:18:02,691
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!

2301
02:18:02,716 --> 02:18:05,092
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

2302
02:18:05,272 --> 02:18:06,412
Positive surface contact.

2303
02:18:06,494 --> 02:18:08,162
<i>Target I.D.</i>
Target acquired.

2304
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:37,380
Dylan!

2305
02:18:37,575 --> 02:18:39,448
Wait!
No!

2306
02:18:42,358 --> 02:18:43,302
Dylan!

2307
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:45,559
Stop! Stop!

2308
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:46,641
No!

2309
02:18:47,852 --> 02:18:49,763
You can't do this, ok?

2310
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:51,837
There is only one future for me.

2311
02:19:16,298 --> 02:19:17,879
Cybertron,

2312
02:19:18,246 --> 02:19:19,881
you are saved,

2313
02:19:20,615 --> 02:19:22,290
at last.

2314
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:34,647
Have you come to surrender?

2315
02:19:35,075 --> 02:19:37,617
Was it all worth it?
Obviously.

2316
02:19:37,655 --> 02:19:41,694
All your work to bring Sentinel back
and now clearly he has all the power.

2317
02:19:42,188 --> 02:19:43,785
It's actually almost tragic.

2318
02:19:43,876 --> 02:19:46,693
You dare lecture me, slave?

2319
02:19:47,087 --> 02:19:49,903
Your Decepticons
finally conquering this planet,

2320
02:19:49,928 --> 02:19:51,422
and yet, their leader won't be you!

2321
02:19:51,447 --> 02:19:55,170
It will be me! It will always be me.

2322
02:19:56,542 --> 02:19:57,974
In any minute now,

2323
02:19:58,765 --> 02:20:00,129
you will be nothing...

2324
02:20:00,918 --> 02:20:02,429
but Sentinel's bitch.

2325
02:20:09,962 --> 02:20:11,079
Rocket!

2326
02:20:12,905 --> 02:20:14,111
Die!

2327
02:20:26,668 --> 02:20:27,804
You chose sides?

2328
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:30,164
You chose wrong.

2329
02:20:36,442 --> 02:20:38,692
Always the bravest of us!

2330
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:44,721
But you could never make
the hard decisions!

2331
02:20:47,773 --> 02:20:50,310
Our planet will survive!

2332
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:52,577
No!

2333
02:21:02,871 --> 02:21:04,429
We were gods once.

2334
02:21:04,621 --> 02:21:05,761
All of us.

2335
02:21:06,041 --> 02:21:07,155
But here...

2336
02:21:07,179 --> 02:21:08,097
Please!

2337
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,410
There will only be one!

2338
02:21:21,807 --> 02:21:25,111
This is my planet!

2339
02:21:36,238 --> 02:21:38,051
I just saved a whole other world.

2340
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:39,879
You think you are a hero?

2341
02:21:40,064 --> 02:21:41,551
You think you are a hero?

2342
02:21:41,576 --> 02:21:42,231
No.

2343
02:21:42,848 --> 02:21:44,040
I am just a messenger.

2344
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:53,126
The pillar is still connected!

2345
02:21:55,048 --> 02:21:56,458
Bring it up!

2346
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:58,965
Bee! Let's do this!
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

2347
02:21:59,052 --> 02:22:00,553
Pillar is still connected!

2348
02:22:00,762 --> 02:22:02,778
Rip that pillar down!

2349
02:22:26,288 --> 02:22:27,318
Now,

2350
02:22:28,053 --> 02:22:30,031
we need a truce.

2351
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,373
All I want is to be back in charge.

2352
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:35,072
Besides,

2353
02:22:35,797 --> 02:22:38,125
who would you be without me,

2354
02:22:38,311 --> 02:22:39,515
Prime?

2355
02:22:39,676 --> 02:22:41,570
Time to find out.

2356
02:23:04,618 --> 02:23:05,857
Optimus,

2357
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:07,735
all I ever wanted

2358
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:10,046
was the survival of our race.

2359
02:23:10,749 --> 02:23:12,405
You must see why...

2360
02:23:12,733 --> 02:23:14,890
I had to betray you.

2361
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:17,169
You didn't betray me.

2362
02:23:18,006 --> 02:23:20,107
You betrayed yourself.

2363
02:23:20,675 --> 02:23:22,076
No, Optimus!

2364
02:24:18,196 --> 02:24:19,110
Sam.

2365
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:00,359
I love you.

2366
02:25:03,486 --> 02:25:04,819
You are the only thing I need in this world,

2367
02:25:04,844 --> 02:25:06,570
and I will do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.

2368
02:25:08,074 --> 02:25:09,682
I am going to hold you to that.

2369
02:25:10,785 --> 02:25:12,275
Just never let me go.

2370
02:25:13,205 --> 02:25:14,182
I promise.

2371

2372
02:25:29,387 --> 02:25:30,968
I love this car.

2373
02:25:31,387 --> 02:25:32,879
Bee, you have got to slow it down.

2374
02:25:33,293 --> 02:25:35,052
You got to slow way down, ok?

2375
02:25:35,777 --> 02:25:37,316
