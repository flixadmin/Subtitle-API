1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,720
Gotham falls, we rise.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,400
<i>After the bridges blew,
the city was up for grabs.</i>

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,920
<i>Gangs are carving up territory.</i>

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,400
We are running out of food.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,840
Ammunition.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,880
We are surrounded by hostile forces.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,760
Say hello to Butch.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,040
No!

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,440
Put out the word,
100,000 rounds of ammunition

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,480
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,040
You want to cure her?

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,440
You have to go to the witch.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,040
And where do I find this witch?

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,680
You have to help us.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,320
My brothers and sisters,
they're killing us.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,760
His name is Will Thomas.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,440
Parents died in a home invasion a few
weeks after the bridges came down.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,800
Guys that broke in
took him to some sort of factory

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,640
where he was held alongside
dozens of other stolen kids,

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
all chained together.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,240
God.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Who are these guys?

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,560
Call themselves The Soothsayers.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,720
- You ever heard of them?
- No.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,080
But who can keep track these days?

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,080
- Which district?
- Granton. Near the water, he said.

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
Had them digging some sort of tunnel.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,160
Will broke free
from his restraints last night,

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,320
and walked 9mi
through the Dark Zone to find us.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
What kind of tunnel?

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Unclear.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,640
There's an abandoned waterworks
by the old dock in Granton.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Detective Gordon?

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
My friends.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,320
You'll save them, won't you?

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
I'll look into it.

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,240
The Soothsayers
won't be happy I escaped.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,800
They'll punish the others for it.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,880
Please, Mr. Gordon.
I promised them I'd bring help.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,880
I know it's a sad story
and emotions are high,

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,080
but need I remind you that,
every two-bit criminal out there

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,960
is looking to kill you
to claim Penguin's bounty?

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,120
So you're saying we do nothing?

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
No, I'm saying the second
you step outside that door,

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,240
someone's gonna take a shot at you,

47
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
and if it's not you
that's getting hit,

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
it's gonna be the schmo
standing next to you,

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,600
which is most likely gonna be me.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Captain.

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,960
There's a call from the mainland.

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,040
<i>All of us here believe that if peace
is to be sustained on the island,</i>

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,280
<i>confrontations must be avoided.</i>

54
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,080
We have kids in danger out there.

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
We're their only hope for rescue.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Your dedication to your job
is admirable, Captain,</i>

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,600
<i>but you lack perspective.</i>

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,960
<i>Travel into harm's way,
and you may save a few lives,</i>

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,560
<i>but you'd also be jeopardizing
thousands of others</i>

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>should you be killed.</i>

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>The collective opinion over here
is that you stand down</i>

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,000
<i>and keep those
within your Green Zone safe.</i>

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
I don't need opinions,
I need supplies.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
When can I expect them?

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
<i>Until Gotham airspace
can be declared safe again,</i>

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,520
<i>we cannot sacrifice any more pilots,</i>

67
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,680
<i>whether they're ours
or Wayne Enterprises'.</i>

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,880
So you can save a few lives
for thousands, but I can't?

69
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
<i>Mr. Gordon...</i>

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Jim.

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,400
I need five men and transport
for twenty kids or more.

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,040
We only have a few squad cars
and that rust bucket transporter.

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
That'll have to do.
How are we on ammo?

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
Well, we got what we got
from Penguin,

75
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,080
and we got a box of shotgun shells
and a box of nine mils.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,880
What did the bureaucrats
on the mainland say?

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Do nothing, protect the Green Zone.

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,000
Four shells each. Half a mag each.

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,440
The boy said
The Soothsayers are here.

80
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,640
That means we have to pass
through Sirens territory,

81
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,440
but it's only three or 4mi
from then on.

82
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,640
Three or 4mi
into the Dark Zone?

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
God only knows what's out there.

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
Barbara's been stockpiling vehicles

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
and everything else
as payment to enter her club.

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
It's worth a shot.

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,760
She's gonna be thrilled to see you
after what happened with Tabitha.

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
We're gonna need housing
for those kids when we get back.

89
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,480
- Yep.
- If we get back.

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Let him go.

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Are you with her?

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Who?

93
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
The witch.

94
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm not with the witch.

95
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
I just came here for her help.

96
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
Come for her magic, have you?

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,160
So, did others from our district.

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
And look at them now.

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,480
They came for help, too,
and she took their souls.

100
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,840
But she'll never kill again.

101
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
We have her this time.

102
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
You captured her?

103
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,080
She's locked
in the storeroom back there.

104
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
We stripped it clean
before we locked her in.

105
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,640
Plants, you see.

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
She talks to them.

107
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
Makes them do things.

108
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,720
So we took her light, water;
put salt on the floor.

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,280
She's helpless now.

110
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
- I need to talk to her.
- No.

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,360
We sent for more of us.

112
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,000
When they come, we burn her.

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,520
Listen.

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,360
My brother is missing.

115
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
I know this witch took him.

116
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,040
I need to find out
what she did with him.

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
Please, let me talk to her.

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,840
Five minutes is all I need, and then
you can do whatever you want.

119
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Your brother's dead.

120
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
She'll kill you, too.

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Five minutes.

122
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
In there.

123
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
Hello, Ivy.

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Barbara.

125
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,000
{\an5}This place is busy, despite things.

126
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
{\an5}What's that?

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,920
{\an5}It's a big fat prize, Jim,
begging to be taken.

128
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,920
{\an5}So, what brings you crawling out
into the open tonight?

129
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,400
{\an5}Come to join the party?
One last hurrah

130
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
{\an5}before someone wastes you?

131
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,240
{\an5}I'm here to ask a favor.

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
{\an5}A favor, right.

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,640
{\an5}Is this after you stood by
and did nothing

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
{\an5}while my best friend on this Earth
was stabbed through the heart?

135
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
{\an5}- I put him down.
- You restored his limp.

136
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,280
- He should be dead!
- Barbara.

137
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,920
Everybody out!

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
{\an5}Now!

139
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
I said move!

140
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
Planning revenge?

141
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,960
{\an5}Well, someone has to do
something about that freak.

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,360
{\an5}He has an army. It would be suicide.

143
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Look around, Jim.

144
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
{\an5}We're all slowly dying.

145
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,080
{\an5}Just some of us get to choose how.

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
{\an5}I'm sorry about
what happened to Tabitha.

147
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,680
Things got out of control.

148
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm just trying to keep
this city from falling apart.

149
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
You're too late.

150
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
So, this favor?

151
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,800
I need transportation.

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Trucks, maybe.

153
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,960
- Where are you going?
- It's a police matter.

154
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,800
You know, they should really
write that on your tombstone.

155
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
They're downstairs
in the basement lot.

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Knock yourself out.

157
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
Drive right into this nightmare
you created.

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
You won't last the night.

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
Here he comes, Gotham.

160
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,480
Your judge, your jailer,
your most hated son!

161
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,200
Have at him!

162
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Rip him to shreds!

163
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,800
No one deserves to die more than him.

164
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
<i>All right, we're entering
the Dark Zone.</i>

165
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,800
<i>Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

166
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,960
This place was a cesspit

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,280
before the rest of the world
turned its back on us.

168
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,960
I wonder what's left here now.

169
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,440
I doubt many stayed up here.

170
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,520
This whole grid never regained power.

171
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,520
Damn it! You were saying, Jim?

172
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
It's a freaking arrow, Jim.

173
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
It's a freaking arrow!

174
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,520
Welcome to the badlands.

175
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Come on.

176
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Come on, come on.

177
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,640
Get up! Get up!

178
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,600
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
- Stand down!

179
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,240
Causing trouble again, Gabriel?

180
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,560
We need water and food.

181
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,000
Some of us haven't slept in two days.

182
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,360
You know, you could've woken me

183
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,560
when that sneaky rat left
in the night.

184
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,360
But you didn't, and now,
he's out there,

185
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,520
and he's causing all kinds
of problems for us.

186
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,080
The smoke. You should take it.

187
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
It'll give you energy.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Inhale enough...

189
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,440
and it'll let you see the future.

190
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,760
You fail to see the importance
of our work here, Gabriel.

191
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,560
But you see,
once this tunnel is complete,

192
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,040
we will have exclusive access
to the mainland.

193
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,240
People will be forced
to do business with us.

194
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,080
Food, booze, guns, smoke.

195
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,800
All will come from the tunnel.

196
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,280
We've been digging for over a month.

197
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
We've only gotten a hundred feet.

198
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,840
It's too narrow.

199
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,160
The roof is leaking.
Once we hit the river, it'll flood

200
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,760
- and kill anyone...
- So negative!

201
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Gabriel.

202
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Shame.

203
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
I had such high hopes for you.

204
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,240
That one day you would wear
the mask and share

205
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,480
in our good fortune.

206
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Never mind.

207
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Sykes.
Man, you got to come out front.

208
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Who was on watch?

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
Put your weapons down.

210
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
Is that James Gordon?

211
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,840
The James Gordon?

212
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
It's our lucky day, fellas.

213
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Kill this one, and we're bullet rich!

214
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,640
In Penguin's graces we will be.

215
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
I said put 'em down.

216
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,640
Give us the kids
you're holding captive. We'll leave.

217
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Kids?

218
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
I don't know
what you're talking about.

219
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
What are the cattle prods for?

220
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Fun.

221
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,760
Stay here.

222
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,320
He moves, kill him.

223
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
It's okay.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's all right. I'm a cop.

225
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Will's alive?

226
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,720
He found you and sent you
to rescue us, didn't he?

227
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
He did.

228
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,360
Will made it! He's alive!

229
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
We need the keys.

230
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
There are trucks outside.

231
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
We'll drive you to the Green Zone...

232
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,840
find you a new home.

233
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,280
Thank you. God bless you.

234
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,880
Okay, guys.

235
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,080
We're gonna get out of here.
They're gonna help us get out.

236
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,640
One at a time. Hold on.
Yeah, we're gonna be okay.

237
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Why would anyone be a cop
in a world like this?

238
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,640
Well, the Halloween shop
was all out of gas masks,

239
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,760
so, it was either this or sexy nurse.

240
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,080
You know what?

241
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,880
My guess is these cops ain't
got enough ammo to shoot a duck.

242
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Wrong. Penguin gave us a boatload.

243
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Penguin wants your boss skinned.

244
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,920
Let's take 'em, boys.

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
Come on! Go! Go!

246
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Hey!

247
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Go!

248
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,720
You okay? Come on.

249
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,000
Take cover! Go! Go!

250
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,600
- The alley! Go! Go!
- Come on!

251
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Bruce?

252
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Thank God.

253
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,800
You have to help me.

254
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
I didn't kill those men
out there in the vines,

255
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,560
you have to believe me.

256
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
You'll forgive me
if I find it hard to do so.

257
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
It wasn't me.

258
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,800
- It was the park.
- The park?

259
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,840
The trees, the plants,
the roots underground...

260
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,800
They're speaking to one another.

261
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,240
When those men came to kill me...

262
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,760
the plants came to my protection.

263
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,440
Then maybe we can help each other.

264
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
I have...

265
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
a friend, who was shot.

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,280
The bullet severed her spinal cord.

267
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,760
The doctors can't seem to help her.

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,040
But a woman at the hospital
said that you might be able to.

269
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
Normally, I would say no.

270
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,520
But this park,
ever since we were cut off

271
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,680
from the rest of the world,
it's been behaving differently.

272
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,680
There are things growing here
I have never seen before.

273
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
You okay in there?

274
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,520
Our friends are on their way.

275
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
Time's running out for you, witch!

276
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
There's a seed.

277
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
It's growing under the oaks.

278
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,080
It's said to have magical qualities.

279
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,080
When digested, it heads for damaged
tissue and bone, healing them.

280
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
If I help you find it...

281
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,760
will you protect me
from those men out there?

282
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,120
Yes! Yes!

283
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,040
Yes, it worked!

284
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,720
No more sleepwalking for me.

285
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Good morning.

286
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,840
See, it was just some...

287
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,360
random stupid thing
brought on by stress.

288
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,400
It's all in your head.

289
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
There's nothing there.

290
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Who the hell are you?

291
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,160
What? Are you serious?

292
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,400
- Very.
- You don't remember?

293
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
No.

294
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Name's Tank.

295
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
You're part of the Street Demonz
gang?

296
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,760
Yeah, you know that.

297
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Why should I?

298
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
What are you doing here?

299
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,760
You brought me here.

300
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
- I brought you here?
- Last night.

301
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Did I...

302
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,840
hit you, et cetera?

303
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Any idea why?

304
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,720
You wanted information,
and I wouldn't give it to you.

305
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm gonna guess you gave it to me.

306
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,840
I can't remember.

307
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
We're gonna have to do this
all again, aren't we?

308
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Guess so.

309
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Fine.

310
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,280
Gordon, where are you?

311
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
We need to hide.

312
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Follow me.

313
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
It's not safe out there.

314
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
We've got to get out of the daylight.

315
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,760
We're sitting ducks.
How are they holding up?

316
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,560
We'll be fine.

317
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Jim, we're not alone.

318
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
Someone lit that candle.

319
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,560
In the old west,
settlers used to leave a candle

320
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,040
burning to lead others to safety.

321
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,680
Maybe there's still good
people left in Gotham.

322
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,360
All right, fine.
We'll take a look around.

323
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Stay here.

324
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,360
If you see something, shout.

325
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Radio check.

326
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Forget it.

327
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
We're out of range
of the precinct's antenna.

328
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,480
Look, if those other trucks
made it back to safety,

329
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
maybe they'll send someone
back here to get us, huh?

330
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,440
Maybe. Until then, I'll take
the next floor, you do the basement.

331
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,160
Oh. Check out the basement
in a creepy hotel by myself? Sure.

332
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,040
What could go wrong, right?

333
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Let's get settled.

334
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Hello?

335
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Is somebody there?

336
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,280
GCPD.

337
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Come out, now.

338
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,600
It's okay. It's all right.

339
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Oh, my God.

340
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Not good. Oh, God. This...

341
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
This is not good.

342
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Jim!

343
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,080
Fine. I'll tell you.

344
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,280
You wanted to know
where the Street Demonz base was.

345
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,440
- That's it?
- And you wanted to be sure

346
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
the boss would be there.

347
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,680
- Emmanuel Vasquez?
- Yeah.

348
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Okay. How did I seem?

349
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,280
Was I confident, flamboyant,
charisma for days?

350
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,840
Or a little more conservative,
kind of repressed, a little nerdy?

351
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,240
You seemed stiff, man of few words.

352
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,520
In a daze, actually.

353
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Interesting.

354
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Okay, let's go.

355
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Where?

356
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
To where you told me to go.
To the Street Demonz' base.

357
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,960
To Vasquez.

358
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,800
I want to know why I went there.

359
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,840
- Oh, no!
- Push her back inside.

360
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,200
- Lock the door.
- Stay calm.

361
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Okay? Her name is Ivy.

362
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,360
She's a witch,
and will burn for what she's done.

363
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,920
I take full responsibility for her.

364
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,280
If she's done what you say,
she will pay for her crimes, but...

365
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,760
You are so utterly naive.

366
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,160
You didn't have to kill them.

367
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
I wanted to.

368
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Why are you here?

369
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm here for my friend.

370
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Our friend.

371
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Selina.

372
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,880
Selina's the one that's hurt?

373
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,920
She's paralyzed
and has lost the will to live.

374
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Good.

375
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,960
That bitch destroyed
the last of the Lazarus Water.

376
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Let her suffer.

377
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
I don't believe you mean that.

378
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,200
You've known each other
for a long time.

379
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,720
You grew up on the streets together.

380
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,000
You know, I wasn't lying
when I said this park is changing.

381
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

382
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,120
It consumes them,

383
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
and then it flourishes.

384
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,800
I think, I shall plant your body
in the ground, Bruce.

385
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,400
What will grow from you, I wonder?

386
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,480
Those men you killed were right.

387
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
You are a witch.

388
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,960
A murderous, callous witch.

389
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,840
- You trying to bait me, boy?
- I wouldn't waste my breath.

390
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,920
I can see there's no good left
in you.

391
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,040
If you were trying
to help this park flourish,

392
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,440
it would be full of beauty and color.

393
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,160
Instead, it smells of death.

394
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
It's a work in progress.

395
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,640
It's a nightmare.

396
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,360
If I do help you,

397
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,640
you'll leave me alone?

398
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Follow me.

399
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
It's okay.

400
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,840
- I'm Jim. What's your name?
- I... I can't remember.

401
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,760
- Where are your parents?
- Dead.

402
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,040
When the lights went out in the city,

403
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,720
a gang came, they murdered them.
I ran.

404
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
- She found me.
- Who?

405
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
The ghost.

406
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
She was kind at first.

407
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,360
But she can be very cruel.

408
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Jim!

409
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,680
We're not alone.
There's a crazy woman.

410
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,880
She's killing people.

411
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,240
The ghost. We got to go.
She hates strangers.

412
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
There's no such thing as ghosts.

413
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,720
We'll protect you
from whoever she is.

414
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,880
- You can't.
- Why? Who is she?

415
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,920
She makes me call her Mother.

416
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,320
- We got to go.
- He's not lying! Come on, Jim.

417
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Hey!

418
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,280
Hey! Come on!

419
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Kid!

420
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,960
Hey, kid!

421
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,560
The lights will make you dizzy.

422
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,920
And then you'll fall asleep.

423
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,600
You won't feel a thing.

424
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
Jim, I don't feel so good.

425
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,280
You can't fight it. Give in to it.

426
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Jim!

427
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Who are you?

428
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,360
I'm the only mother that boy knows.

429
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,400
You're a crazy bitch
who kills people,

430
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
takes their stuff
and burns their bodies.

431
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,680
I'm protecting him.

432
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,520
When I found him,
he was barely alive.

433
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Those animals out there,
they would have killed him or worse.

434
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,760
I taught him how to survive.

435
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Hey!

436
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Where is everybody?

437
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,080
- Beats me.
- Come on.

438
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,920
Oh, boy.

439
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,520
Holy crap.

440
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
That's Vasquez.

441
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Did you do this?

442
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,000
Honestly, I don't remember.

443
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What about that?

444
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,880
Penguin did this.

445
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
I think not.

446
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,000
Well, whoever did
just started one hell of a war.

447
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Here.

448
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,400
Is that human blood?

449
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,600
If Selina ingests this,
it'll find its way to her wound.

450
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Its roots will wrap around her spine,

451
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,920
fusing the nerves
and cartilage together.

452
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
It'll cure her?

453
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Maybe.

454
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,760
- Just maybe?
- Everyone's different.

455
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,560
Depends on how strong she is.

456
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
One thing is for sure though...

457
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,440
the seed will alter her forever.

458
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,200
- How?
- Some say

459
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,040
the darker angels of our nature
are unlocked and set free.

460
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Can she live with that?

461
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,640
Can you?

462
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,120
I don't know
if there's any other way.

463
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,680
Then go, give it to her.

464
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,360
What's the matter, Bruce?

465
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,400
Don't know if you can trust me?

466
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,160
- I don't.
- Good.

467
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,840
Then you're finally becoming a man.

468
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Where will you go?

469
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,400
Where I'm going is none
of your business.

470
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
Best hurry.

471
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,640
That root will die if left out
in the open for too long.

472
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
Where have you guys been?
You've been gone for a while.

473
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,240
Chasing ghosts.

474
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,040
They're like rats in the walls.
This whole place is their spiderweb.

475
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

476
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
We got to go. Not everyone
wants your help, Jim Gordon.

477
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,840
Detective Gordon,
your hand's bleeding.

478
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
We need to leave.

479
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Come on.

480
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
- How many bullets you got left?
- Two.

481
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,440
Look at here, boys!

482
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
I'll tell you what...

483
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,880
you give me my workers back,

484
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
and I'll let you and your partner go.

485
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,240
I'm just kidding.

486
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,480
Of course, I'm not gonna do that.

487
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,440
I'm gonna kill you all!

488
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,480
Wait just a minute, please.

489
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,320
The prize for this man's head
is mine.

490
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
How is she?

491
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Not great.

492
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,440
I mean, she hasn't said a peep
since you've been gone.

493
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
You all right?

494
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Did you find the witch?

495
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
It was Ivy.

496
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,840
- What's that?
- Ivy said it could help Selina.

497
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,480
- What, and you trust her?
- What choice do I have?

498
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,640
Listen, I want to help Selina
as much as you,

499
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,160
but Ivy is a maniacal,
cold-blooded killer.

500
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,720
- You know that, don't you?
- Give it to me.

501
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
Selina, I have doubts.

502
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
Bruce, I was willing
to kill myself yesterday.

503
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,800
Nothing's changed since then.

504
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,520
So, if Ivy wants to kill me...

505
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,360
she can have at it.

506
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,960
What do I do, just swallow it?

507
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Yeah.

508
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Still here.

509
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,800
I know Ivy's lost her mind.

510
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
But...

511
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,760
after her mom and dad died,
she was just...

512
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,240
sleeping on the streets.

513
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,000
And it was a cold winter, and...

514
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,640
she started to get really sick.

515
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
So, I...

516
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,040
took her under my wing, I guess...

517
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,040
and, showed her
where to get food...

518
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
where to get a roof over her head.

519
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,480
And after some time,
she started to get color in her face.

520
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
And I just...

521
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,040
kept checking in on her.

522
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Almost every day.

523
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,240
She may look old now, but...

524
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
she'll always be
that little girl to me.

525
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,480
- No, no, no, Selina.
- Doctor!

526
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,840
- Selina.
- Doctor!

527
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,000
Selina, stay with me.

528
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
Stay back. Give us room.

529
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
No, Selina.

530
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
She's burning up.

531
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,080
Pulse is low. What happened?

532
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,920
Oh, God, what have I done?

533
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,960
Put it down, Knucklehead!

534
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,760
You two clowns ain't got
a single bullet between you.

535
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Wrong.

536
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
I got two.

537
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,880
Prove it.

538
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,840
I won't say it again, freak.

539
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,200
Gordon comes with me.

540
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
I'll tell you what!

541
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,000
I'll take his head,
and you can have the rest of him!

542
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Hi, Jim.

543
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,800
About our last chat...

544
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
I may have been a little rash.

545
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,120
This what got you all hot
and bothered?

546
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,240
- They need a bath.
- Crazy bitch...

547
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Wow.

548
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,680
Your last bullet, just for me, huh?

549
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Must be love.

550
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,520
Not all square yet though.

551
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,120
You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

552
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,320
Oh, yeah? What's that?

553
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,320
Kill Penguin.

554
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
How 'bout we table this

555
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,520
until I can get them safely
into the Green Zone, huh? Come on.

556
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Wow.

557
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,760
You're safe now. Go on.

558
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
You made it.

559
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
You had me worried.

560
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,160
All sorts of chatter out there
about people hunting you down

561
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,840
for Penguin's reward money.

562
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,320
Well, they'll just have
to try harder.

563
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,600
He did have help
from the unlikeliest of places.

564
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
You're welcome.

565
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Come on, show me what you got.

566
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Nice place.

567
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,080
250 apartments.
Running water, hot and cold.

568
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,000
Gas. No electricity yet.

569
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Is there a bar?

570
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,520
Once the kids we liberated moved in,
word got out pretty fast

571
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,240
that there was a safe place
to live in the city.

572
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,960
Citizens are heading here in droves.

573
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,080
This place will be full by sundown.

574
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Then we'll find another.

575
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,400
I just want to thank you,
Captain Gordon.

576
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,160
My family, we've been drifting
from one place to the next

577
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,320
ever since the blackout.

578
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
You've delivered us.

579
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Seriously?

580
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll see you around, killer.

581
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,880
We have some unfinished business,
you and I.

582
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,600
Whatever she took
put her body into shock.

583
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,880
Her temperature skyrocketed.
Her WBC count was off the charts.

584
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,880
Then, two hours ago,
everything stabilized.

585
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,120
I have no idea why.

586
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,680
She was still in a lot of pain,
so we sedated her.

587
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,320
She's been sleeping for a while now.

588
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,840
I think it'd be best
to come back in the morning.

589
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,040
Thank you, doctor.

590
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,880
Right. Master Bruce,
I think we should...

591
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
we should get some shut-eye.

592
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Come on.

593
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Bruce.

594
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
It's a miracle.

595
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
How do you feel?

596
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Different.

597
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,520
- Any pain?
- No.

598
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,880
Selina, I thought I'd killed you.

599
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I'm better.

600
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,040
Even better than before, in fact.
