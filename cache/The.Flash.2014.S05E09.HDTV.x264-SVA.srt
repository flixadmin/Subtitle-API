1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,625
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,628 --> 00:00:03,718
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:04,953
To the outside world,

4
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:07,117
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,087
But secretly, with the help of my friends

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,623
at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime

7
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,593
and find other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,196
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,562
she changed the present.

10
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:20,059
And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

11
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,768
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,471
I am the Flash.

13
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,600
You failed.

14
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:56,569
Why are you doing this?

15
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:59,017
You did this to yourself.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,089
And now all of you will perish.

17
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:18,306
My name is Dr. John Deegan,
and I, like most of you,

18
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,375
I'm a psychiatrist.

19
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:22,809
Do you know what my
patients tell me the most?

20
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:25,196
They feel inferior.

21
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:28,567
I'm here to tell you,
whether we admit it or not,

22
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:32,872
some people, they're just born lucky,

23
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:36,442
which leads us to the
real problem, imperfection.

24
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,478
How can we ever hope to feel like

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,182
supermen or superwomen

26
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:47,053
without first becoming super ourselves?

27
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,188
I'm here to tell you how, folks.

28
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,473
If we utilize eugenic
insights, I feel...

29
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:57,396
Hey, Frankenstein, go back
to your mad scientist lab.

30
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,433
Ma'am, ma'am, please...
Would you wait, please?

31
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:03,035
Folks, folks, folks, please listen.

32
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:06,172
I'm just saying, we can
truly help our patients.

33
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,841
Listen to me!

34
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:12,244
Idiots!

35
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:18,984
Doctor.

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,107
Dr. John Deegan.

37
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,493
I need your help, John.

38
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:30,696
Go find someone else
to prank, douchebag.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,534
My God, what are you?

40
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,937
Something beyond your comprehension.

41
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,606
I've traveled far to this place and time

42
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:44,168
to lay this precious
burden at your feet.

43
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:48,434
Use this book to reshape
the world as you see fit.

44
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:53,185
Show them what a real god can do, John.

45
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,659
Why me?

46
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:02,361
You have vision.

47
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:05,830
That book holds the key to
your transformation, John,

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,535
and all you have to do is open it.

49
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,810
Use it wisely, John.

50
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:20,609
The universe is in your hands.

51
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:23,187
I can... I can see...

52
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,650
I can see everything.

53
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:29,154
And a word of advice:

54
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:31,323
think big.

55
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:40,698

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,774
Honey, breakfast is ready.

57
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,580
Honey.

58
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:57,623
It'll get cold.

59
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,492
What?

60
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:18,938
Morning.

61
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,454
Look, babe, they're perfect this time.

62
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:25,377
What if Barry walks in?

63
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,912
What if he could have seen that?

64
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,581
See...

65
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,382
Where's Barry?

66
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,585
Did you get enough sleep last night?

67
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:34,787
Look, babe, I know that
we haven't caught Cicada,

68
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,814
but Caitlin's immunity can help us.

69
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:37,949
Who's Cicada?

70
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,825
Our big bad.

71
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:42,861
Barry, are you okay?

72
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:44,463
I'm Barry?

73
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,779
What is wrong?

74
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,204
Honey, hi. Talk to me.

75
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:55,641
I did not get enough sleep.

76
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:00,045
Are you... you sure it's not my cooking?

77
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,782
- 'Cause...
- No, no.

78
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,587
These smell delicious.

79
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,640
Thank you.

80
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,650
You know what?

81
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:10,048
I think that you call Captain Singh

82
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,818
and you ask for a day off.

83
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,559
Look, with all the superhero-ing

84
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,996
you've been doing, I think
you've earned it, honey.

85
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:19,079
You think maybe I should
go into S.T.A.R. Labs?

86
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,501
What... what?

87
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:22,636
Only my husband would think

88
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,342
working on Speed Force equations

89
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,745
would be called a day off.

90
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:29,743
I love you, Barry Allen.

91
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,390
I love you, Iris West-Allen.

92
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:41,801
Break in at Ivo Labs.

93
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,471
Cisco's on comms.

94
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:45,507
I'll meet you guys at S.T.A.R. Labs.

95
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,337
Whoa... whoa.

96
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,790
Whew. That's a rush.

97
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:05,557
Sorry, I polished it last night

98
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,526
and left it on our dresser.

99
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,539
Oh, Barry, what have you done this time?

100
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,971
Barry, we got a break-in at Ivo Labs,

101
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,873
two armed men going after diamonds,

102
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:43,032
the ones they use for conductors.

103
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,142
Hey, pump the brakes.

104
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:45,645
You're gonna have to hang a U-ey,

105
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,626
'cause you passed Ivo
by about 18 blocks.

106
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:49,659
Found it.

107
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:51,489
Someone's excited to get to work.

108
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:53,603
It is too early for this.

109
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,499
Forget it, Flash.

110
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,135
We're leaving with the
diamonds, or this guy dies.

111
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:04,829
I said back off.

112
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,423
Hey, what are you doing there?

113
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,574
Just hit the guy with
the lightning punch.

114
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:12,745
You have failed this city.

115
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:15,281
Pretty sure that's not your line.

116
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,817
Your adrenaline levels
are off the charts.

117
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,119
What's going on?

118
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,642
Overkill much?

119
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:53,807
Cops are on the way.

120
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,217
Why don't you just let
them take over from here?

121
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,219
So he's fine, Caitlin?

122
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:12,354
Mm-hmm.

123
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:13,772
Oh, God, thank goodness.

124
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,904
Really? There are no anomalies?

125
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,643
I don't... I don't have a brain tumor?

126
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:18,548
Nothing?

127
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:20,189
Barry, you're in perfect shape.

128
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:22,548
Babe, tell me about it.
I mean, hi, these abs.

129
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,617
And they're all mine.

130
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,126
Maybe we could lay off

131
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,587
the public displays of affection,

132
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,955
just at work, you know?

133
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,228
Since when?

134
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,449
You're always saying that
touch is your love language.

135
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:34,556
That's right, Ralph.

136
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,037
Just feel like we're being
very insensitive to all of you.

137
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,098
Oh, man, we've talked about this.

138
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,267
I'm over Gypsy, okay?

139
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,470
But I appreciate the thought.

140
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:45,906
I'll be all right.

141
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,342
I'm gonna go home...

142
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,626
Because I need to think.

143
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,147
Think?

144
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,856
What are you guys doing?

145
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:05,224
Following you into the hallway.

146
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,992
'Cause something is definitely up.

147
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,627
You need to talk about it?

148
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:09,995
Yeah, Barry,

149
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,331
you haven't seemed like
yourself all morning.

150
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,548
I'm fine.

151
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,234
I just think that maybe I should go

152
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,237
and talk with someone who
might better understand

153
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,439
what I'm going through.

154
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,374
I'm gonna go see Oliver Queen.

155
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,810
I'll be back.

156
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,885
Dig, what are you doing here?

157
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:35,254
I'm kicking your butt.

158
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,990
Now get up, come on.

159
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,945
You guys redecorate the Bunker?

160
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,014
Oliver, you've been to
A.R.G.U.S. a million times.

161
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,966
Oliver?

162
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,713
I'm Oliver Queen.

163
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:01,980
Yeah, I'll say.

164
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:03,682
I'm the Green Arrow.

165
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:06,418
Holy crap.

166
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:12,798
I've been hanging with
a tough crowd, huh?

167
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,366
Yeah, you think?

168
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:18,236
Look, I need to make a
call, just to S.T.A.R. Labs,

169
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:21,084
just for some important
Green Arrow business.

170
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,564
- You know how it is.
- Later.

171
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,868
What's that?

172
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,198
We've got Bratvas fighting Bertinelli's

173
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:30,302
over in old Diaz weapons
cache in the Glades.

174
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:32,284
I could really use some backup, Oliver.

175
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:35,287
Oh, man, I don't know
if I'm feeling up for it.

176
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,387
I think I just tweaked something.

177
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,922
A.R.G.U.S. rapid response
is on another mission.

178
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:40,591
We're the only ones
that can make it in time.

179
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,961
- Okay, yeah, I'm in.
- Good.

180
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:47,666
Suit up.

181
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,534
How do I put this...

182
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:52,137
I forget, do... do I
need help putting this on?

183
00:10:58,378 --> 00:10:59,736
What are you doing?

184
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,689
I thought you going to
fire an incendiary arrow.

185
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,048
So did I.

186
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:25,444
Did you freaking see that?

187
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,305
Stop fooling around and get the driver.

188
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:33,478
Damn.

189
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:35,848
Diggle!

190
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:38,959
No... no.

191
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:42,282
Oh, man. Oh, I'm glad to see you.

192
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,421
Uh-huh, yeah.

193
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,195
Nice outfit.

194
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,341
This can't be a coincidence.

195
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,277
There... there has to
be a reason behind this,

196
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,579
which means that someone is responsible.

197
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:11,454
We need to know who... hey,
can you... can you not do that?

198
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:14,985
Man, what a total "Freaky Friday."

199
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,856
No, wait, we didn't switch bodies.

200
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:19,724
It's more of a "Quantum
Leap." Where's a mirror?

201
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:22,490
Focus, just for a second,

202
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,796
and take this seriously
because the world thinks

203
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,080
that you're Oliver Queen
and that I'm Barry Allen,

204
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,033
and I would really like to know why.

205
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,101
- Totally.
- Is that cool?

206
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,170
- Yes. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,807
Weird.

208
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,090
Hey, Mayor.

209
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:40,511
Just, if you could... just
for 90 seconds of seriousness.

210
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:42,280
You gotta admit, this is a little cool.

211
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:44,349
I will find it a lot
cooler when I wake up

212
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,585
in my own bed tomorrow morning.

213
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:48,153
You woke up in bed with Iris?

214
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:49,554
Mm-hmm.

215
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,656
We have to fix this right now!

216
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:54,259
Let me get this straight.

217
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,429
You believe that you
are not Barry Allen,

218
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,497
but in fact, he is?

219
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,906
- Barry, did you time travel again?
- No, I didn't.

220
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:03,237
- She's talking to Barry.
- Sorry...

221
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,002
I am Barry.

222
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,806
- Yeah, and I'm Wild Dog.
- Easy, Wild Dog.

223
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:08,775
Sarcasm.

224
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,674
It's not great sarcasm, Cisco.

225
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:13,378
- Do you mind if I...
- No, of course not.

226
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,916
Oliver's brain scan is perfectly normal,

227
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,652
no signs of hypnosis
or psychic interference.

228
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:23,021
Tachyon meters are clear.

229
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,856
No one's screwing with the Timeline.

230
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:26,501
Guys, come on, this is crazy.

231
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:27,669
I mean, there's no way that

232
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:29,339
I could be married to Oliver Queen.

233
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,862
Sorry, but, babe, you know
he's not my type, right?

234
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:34,764
Iris, you really don't believe me?

235
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,269
We're telling the truth.

236
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:39,070
Okay? We're telling the truth.

237
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:42,212
Something is very,
very wrong with reality.

238
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:43,381
Yeah.

239
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:45,576
All right, Team Flash meeting.

240
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,978
Not you, Barry.

241
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,546
Th... uh...

242
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,799
I've only got eyes
for you, you know that.

243
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:52,918
I sw... if you touch her...

244
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,152
I didn't touch her.

245
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:55,712
You thought about it.

246
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:59,314
All right, well, if your
team's not gonna help us,

247
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:00,477
then we have to keep moving.

248
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,717
They'll help us, okay? They'll help us.

249
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:04,658
We just gotta get... we just
gotta get Iris on board first.

250
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,964
Good... fine, how... how are
you going to convince her?

251
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm not, you are.

252
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,290
- She's your wife.
- I know, man.

253
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,470
I know, I don't... I don't
like this anymore than you do.

254
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,439
You just gotta tell her
how much you care about her.

255
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,841
Tell her she's your lightning rod.

256
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,590
I'm not... I'm not saying that.

257
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:23,725
Just say it.

258
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,061
Trust me.

259
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,962
It works every time.

260
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,123
Mind if I join you?

261
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,325
Yeah.

262
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,995
This should help.

263
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,925
I guess you forgot you can't get drunk?

264
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:42,795
This day could not get any worse.

265
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,303
You really think that you're Oliver?

266
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:47,105
Yeah.

267
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:52,711
You know, Felicity called
me when Oliver was in prison.

268
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,764
Do you know how he ended up in Slabside?

269
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,248
She... she called you?

270
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:58,517
He cut a deal, Barry,

271
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,452
completely behind Felicity's back.

272
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:01,753
He didn't even warn her.

273
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:05,223
The FBI just showed
up and took him away.

274
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:06,591
She said all that?

275
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,958
She's hurting.

276
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:11,862
Oliver's life, it's completely defined

277
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:15,467
by anger, vengeance.

278
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,206
That's why I am so lucky
to have you in my life.

279
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,579
Are you not the least bit worried

280
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:29,781
that reality might be broken?

281
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:33,407
Don't you have to consider what
we're telling you is the truth?

282
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,086
Isn't it possible?

283
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:38,223
Yeah, yeah, it is,

284
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,998
which is why I'm really sorry, Barry.

285
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,939
Would you... I thought
I couldn't get drunk.

286
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:46,196
Nanites, courtesy of Ray Palmer.

287
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,768
Whoever you are, we need
to get you to a safe place

288
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,770
until we can figure out what happened.

289
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,825
I hope you can understand.

290
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,428
Oh, come on.

291
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,846
Sorry, dude.

292
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:12,024
Oh, come on.

293
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,455
Guys, come...

294
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,825
Guys, come on!

295
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:18,061
Let us out of here!

296
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,916
Come on.

297
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,019
Why are we in your secret prison?

298
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,163
It's not a prison.

299
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,421
It's a Tesla conductor tube
that dampens meta-powers.

300
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,124
Okay, it's a prison.

301
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,496
We just need to convince everybody

302
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:31,249
that we're not crazy!

303
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:32,417
How?

304
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,108
How do you suggest that we do that?

305
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:37,346
Because everyone on Earth
thinks that we're each other.

306
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,738
- That's it.
- Hmm?

307
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740
Maybe it's just Earth-1
that's been affected.

308
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,108
If we can get an extrapolator,

309
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,743
breach to Earth-38 and find Kara.

310
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,878
If she remembers us,
then maybe she can help

311
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,413
fix whatever's happened.

312
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:52,569
You skipped the part where
you explain how we escape.

313
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,685
Were you able to get
in touch with A.R.G.U.S.?

314
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:56,821
Well, I tried, but I
kept getting interference

315
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,455
at 650 nanometers.

316
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:00,491
Isn't that the wavelength for red light?

317
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,159
Red light, exactly.

318
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:04,094
And when I checked the
city's weather cams,

319
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,262
this is what I found:

320
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,864
red skies, yellow lightning.

321
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:09,033
So you think Barry and
Oliver's shared psychosis

322
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:11,302
is a result of weird weather?

323
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,870
Stranger things, right?

324
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,039
Okay, I'll run their scans again.

325
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,605
Best off giving up now.

326
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,492
Who the frak is that?

327
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:41,644
I spent the past seven months
in a maximum security prison,

328
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:45,102
and no matter who bad things
got... and they got bad...

329
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,311
Every cell had a toilet.

330
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,075
You sure you can't hold it?

331
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,759
Oh, you wanna back up the pipes.

332
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:54,874
And fry the dampener, yes.

333
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:56,610
That's a good idea.

334
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:58,128
Okay.

335
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:01,491
One problem, I'm not gonna be able
to reach the valve with these on.

336
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,000
You're gonna have to
dislocate your thumb.

337
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:04,069
Are you crazy? I'm...

338
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:05,996
I'm not crazy. You need
to dislocate your thumb.

339
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,658
Just apply pressure to the joint.

340
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,576
No, I'm gonna break my hand...

341
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:11,679
You're not gonna break your hand,

342
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,463
because in this reality,

343
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,866
your ligaments have been
stretched and conditioned

344
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:18,202
in the art of escape by Anatoly Knyazev.

345
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:20,866
Now, man up, apply
pressure to the joint,

346
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,425
and dislocate your thumb.

347
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,381
- It worked.
- Yeah.

348
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,984
All right.

349
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,019
Okay, now just wait for it.

350
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:38,589
Dampener's down. Now what?

351
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:40,125
You're gonna have to
phase us out of here.

352
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,205
- What?
- Phasing.

353
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,494
That's when I vibrate
at the frequency of air,

354
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,230
causing all the cells in
my body to get so excited

355
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:47,998
I can pass through solid objects.

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,900
Right, "phasing."

357
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,072
Want any advice?

358
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,942
One second here, Barry, please.

359
00:18:57,944 --> 00:18:59,686
I'm just saying, it's not an easy move,

360
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:00,881
and if you screw this up

361
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,205
then you're gonna come out of the phase

362
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,306
halfway through the glass.

363
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,686
What?

364
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,683
Why are you laughing?

365
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,353
I didn't realize...

366
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,288
- Your thumb looks ridiculous.
- Oh, my God.

367
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,725
I didn't realize that's how mine looked.

368
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:16,749
Well, look at that, you did it.

369
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:18,328
Great.

370
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,030
Don't leave me, man.

371
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,863
Figured it out.

372
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,071
All right, let's go.

373
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:29,940
Get the extrapolator
and get out of here.

374
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,843
I can't let you do that, Barry.

375
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:38,558
Iris, please, I know how weird this is,

376
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,685
but somewhere inside, you
know we're telling the truth,

377
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,954
that it's me, Barry.

378
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:47,691
Do you remember when I first moved in?

379
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:51,413
Joe brought me to the house
after my mom was killed.

380
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,797
I looked at you and I
said, "My dad didn't do it."

381
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,369
- And then you said...
- "I believe you."

382
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:00,870
You always did.

383
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:03,307
And now I need you to believe me again.

384
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,710
Iris, you're my lightning rod.

385
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,134
Quick, before I change my mind.

386
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:24,561
We'll fix this, I promise.

387
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:41,860
I'm writing it.

388
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:44,580
We've been over this, hon.

389
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,884
No, you talked, I ignored.

390
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:49,019
You need a new muffler.

391
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:50,954
I think this is a tie rod end.

392
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,656
Come on, Kara, back me up here.

393
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:53,952
Uh, no, thanks.

394
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:55,351
I know better than to get involved

395
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,221
in a debate with Lois Lane.

396
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,028
But you do know the feeling,

397
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:03,667
that itch, that fire in
the back of your head,

398
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,937
the siren song of a story
that has to be written.

399
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,774
Huh?

400
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:13,010
Yeah, I do, I do.

401
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:16,380
The world is gonna want
to know why Lois Lane

402
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:18,415
went to Argo City with Superman.

403
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,250
Details, I'll make up a reason.

404
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:22,152
Oh, so much for truth in journalism.

405
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,121
Says the reporter who writes about

406
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:26,356
his own exploits as Superman.

407
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:29,793
I was the first human to set foot

408
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:32,129
on what's left of Krypton,

409
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:34,465
to lay eyes on the Jewel Mountains,

410
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:38,681
to endure the endless,
torturous deliberations

411
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:39,764
of the High Council,

412
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,471
and I have to write about it.

413
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,740
One small step for Lois Lane,

414
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:47,711
one giant leap for Lois Lane's career.

415
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:50,514
Says the woman who is already
the most famous, feared,

416
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:52,883
and intrepid reporter on two planets.

417
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:56,320
And yet someone on this farm

418
00:21:56,323 --> 00:22:01,426
is still making 21¢ on
the dollar more than me.

419
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:05,796
And it ain't Kara, honey.

420
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,666
You two catch up.

421
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:12,853
I am gonna go slam some
small things really hard.

422
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,496
Okay, just be careful on that ladder.

423
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,465
It's really old.

424
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,568
You'll catch me.

425
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,146
Break time, boss?

426
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:26,583
I've never been challenged
like that before,

427
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:27,818
just to my face:

428
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,920
"Tell us who you are, Supergirl."

429
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:31,861
Well, except for Ms. Grant.

430
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:33,158
Well, and I'm sure it was harder

431
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,486
when it's the president
doing the threatening.

432
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,594
- Cat was scarier.
- Yeah.

433
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:41,827
Do you think I did the right thing?

434
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,034
Our secret identities, they
protect the people we love

435
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,670
from being threatened by our enemies.

436
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:48,839
There aren't a lot of things
more important than that.

437
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,542
I'm just sad I have to leave the DEO,

438
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:55,546
and now Alex is there alone.
I feel like I let her down.

439
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:58,315
Oh, and then I left you
to defend Earth alone

440
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,616
so I could got to Argo.

441
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:01,051
- Nah...
- I'm sorry.

442
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,887
No, don't be sorry
about that. It's home.

443
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:06,690
I'm really glad you
got to see it finally,

444
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:08,225
connect with it.

445
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:09,931
It was more than just connecting

446
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:11,361
with our culture, you know?

447
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:13,830
I'm okay.

448
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,167
You know, it was Lois.

449
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,903
Everything new that
I experienced on Argo,

450
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:21,505
she was experiencing it too.

451
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:26,677
You know, out there we were...
We were both strange visitors.

452
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,380
I must sound so selfish.

453
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:33,733
No, love is the most
unselfish thing in the world...

454
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:35,552
On any world.

455
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:41,091
Well, about that.

456
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:44,761
There's something that I've
needed to talk to you about.

457
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:46,002
Okay.

458
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:47,304
Wait, wait, wait.

459
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:48,731
- Who are you?
- We come in peace.

460
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:50,200
Whoa, Lois, wait, wait.

461
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:52,336
This is Barry and
Oliver. They're friends.

462
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:53,603
- Wait.
- So you know that

463
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,633
I'm Oliver and he's Barry?

464
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,141
Yeah, w... why wouldn't I?

465
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,587
Oh, man.

466
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,689
Okay.

467
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:03,111
Um, you guys, this is my cousin Clark.

468
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:04,614
I'm so glad you get to meet.

469
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,298
Your cousin. That cousin?

470
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,322
The super cousin?

471
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,361
Oh, please, call me Clark.

472
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,541
Uh, welcome to our farm.

473
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:12,910
Cool.

474
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:14,757
Are you puffing out your chest?

475
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,845
Yes.

476
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:17,788
Lois Lane, "Daily Planet."

477
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,264
Wait, why did you guys think
I wouldn't recognize you?

478
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:22,366
- Well...
- Oh, uh...

479
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:26,536
Oh. Well, that's new.

480
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:28,405
We could use your help.

481
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:31,642
All units to Waid and Augustyn.

482
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:34,077
Something's destroying IVO Labs.

483
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,137
He has our powers.

484
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,270
Again.

485
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,629
Okay, come on, man.

486
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,038
I mean, I've been shooting
paint cans all afternoon.

487
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,343
Unless... unless a
paint can rewrote reality

488
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,179
- and made us swap lives...
- I get it.

489
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,215
Then you need actual
combat training, Barry.

490
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,517
All right, fine. You know what?

491
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,767
Why don't you go over there, run at me,

492
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,946
and I'll try and hit you with an arrow.

493
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:25,422
Right, okay.

494
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,025
Where did you bury the
remote control bows?

495
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,535
Dude.

496
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:31,805
Come on, I'm not you.

497
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:34,230
Yeah, well, okay.

498
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,702
Ready!

499
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,206
Here we go.

500
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,709
Nice try.

501
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,044
Ow.

502
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,207
Oh, I've been waiting
four years for that, man.

503
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,590
Oh, it's priceless. Hold on.

504
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,699
Need to get a photo.

505
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:55,606
- What?
- Boom.

506
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:57,793
I got it, don't worry. Hold on a second.

507
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:01,723
That's great.

508
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,168
You think this is funny?

509
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,104
Do you think my skills are a joke?

510
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:05,981
Come on, man.

511
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:07,728
I was a much better
sport when you shot me.

512
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,121
I shot you to teach you
how to case an environment.

513
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,645
You shot me to get a laugh.

514
00:26:12,648 --> 00:26:14,014
- All right.
- You know what?

515
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:16,751
Fine, fine. Come at me.

516
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:19,121
Try to get... try to get one hit in.

517
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,024
Deck him, Barry!

518
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,989
What? He's a jerk.

519
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:25,825
I'm not doing this.
This isn't how I train.

520
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:27,926
Oh, you train? Really?

521
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,532
I thought your powers just
dropped out of the sky.

522
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,544
If you're trying to get a rise
out of me, it's not gonna work.

523
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:33,778
Need a peanut gallery?

524
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:35,481
Can you not do anything
without your wife in your ear?

525
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:36,762
Are you serious, man?

526
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:38,298
Felicity invented quarterbacking.

527
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:41,531
I don't think that you
can go more than nine hours

528
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:44,067
without some sappy motivational speech.

529
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,069
I'm not doing this.

530
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,293
Your team betrayed you.

531
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:48,034
You needed them, and they weren't there.

532
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:49,704
I'm not doing this.

533
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:57,261
You know, if you really
knew how to use my speed,

534
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:59,064
I never could have laid a finger on you.

535
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,654
That's the guy who attacked
us at Ivo Laboratories,

536
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,879
Anti-Meta-human Adaptive
Zootomic Organism.

537
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,568
A-M-A-Z-O, "AMAZO."

538
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:10,817
Sometimes these things
just fall into your lap.

539
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,120
It says Ivo Labs was contracted by A.R.G.U.S.

540
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,657
to build a unit capable
of identifying meta-powers.

541
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,833
He doesn't just scan powers.

542
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,301
He's pumping a nano-adaptive
hybrid of the "Mirakuru" serum.

543
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,138
So that's how he stole our powers.

544
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,841
He scanned our meta-human genes,

545
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,744
then used the Mirakuru
hybrid to copy them.

546
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,646
So an evil copycat Gort

547
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,549
is coming to klaatu
barada kick-to our asses,

548
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,385
and we can't let out Flash
and Green Arrow to fight it?

549
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,889
Well, we could if they were still here.

550
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,129
Why don't you tell them, Iris
West-Allen, what happened.

551
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:43,422
Hurry.

552
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,762
You let them out?

553
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,165
Okay, look, I know what you're thinking.

554
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,370
But I spoke to Oliver, or whoever he is,

555
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,860
and I could feel something.

556
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:59,042
Guys, I felt like I was
really talking to Barry.

557
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,648
I believe you.

558
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,798
It is weird out there.

559
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:13,010
These red skies, Barry
and Oliver... that,

560
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,660
and I vibed somebody in the Speed Lab.

561
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:16,801
- What?
- Yeah.

562
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,879
Some guy with ridges on his head,

563
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:20,429
these big muttonchops.

564
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,900
Do you think that the
red skies, this guy,

565
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:26,503
these disparate events
are somehow connected?

566
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,582
So Barry and Oliver were mind-swapped

567
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:30,885
by a guy with muttonchops?

568
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:33,989
Man, it's not even Tuesday.

569
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:37,648
It's AMAZO.

570
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,583
He just entered city limits.

571
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,410
Don't tell me you came to say sorry.

572
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:07,017
I try to avoid saying that word.

573
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,080
Look, man, I get it.

574
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,887
You were just trying to
help in your own Oliver way,

575
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,481
trying to get a rise out of me

576
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,518
so I'd fight like you.

577
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:17,119
Yeah, it's more than that, Barry.

578
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,589
I've been doing this
for a very long time.

579
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,567
And nearly every time
that I learn a lesson,

580
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,923
it comes with a painful memory.

581
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,933
Watched friends die. I've
had to kill to survive.

582
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,078
When I'm the Green Arrow,

583
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:34,606
I channel those painful memories.

584
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,506
I... I draw on a darkness

585
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,343
every time I draw back my bow.

586
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,426
So to see you with all of my abilities,

587
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,126
just laughing and joking around,

588
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,963
it pissed me off,

589
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,299
more than I would care to admit.

590
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:51,487
Whenever I run, whatever
I'm feeling inside,

591
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,481
grief, guilt, I've gotta just let it go

592
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:56,413
and focus on whatever
I'm running toward:

593
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:59,362
Iris, my friends, all
the joy in my life.

594
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:02,866
When I'm happy, I run faster,

595
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,802
just like when you phased earlier.

596
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,471
You were having a good time.

597
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,308
You couldn't dislocate your
thumb until you got angry.

598
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,811
If you're gonna be the Green Arrow

599
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,884
and I'm gonna be the Flash...

600
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:19,616
Maybe we need to start
acting more like each other.

601
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,986
Yes, finally, God.

602
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,082
Super hearing, sorry.

603
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,552
But I've been sitting in there

604
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,267
waiting for you guys to figure this out

605
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,957
because I have a lot of thoughts, okay?

606
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,043
I should smile more.

607
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:34,764
Yeah, maybe you should. It might help.

608
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,134
You guys have to act the parts.

609
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,268
Come on, try it.

610
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,418
What?

611
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,454
I'm the Green Arrow.

612
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,559
Wear a mask.

613
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:46,108
Sound like that... I don't...

614
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:49,723
Cisco?

615
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:54,095
Hey, Supergirl, Barry...

616
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:56,065
Oliver.

617
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:57,486
You believe us now?

618
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,923
Yeah, we all do.

619
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,426
Sorry we locked you up.

620
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,428
But if you feel like forgiving us

621
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,676
and coming back to Earth-1,

622
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,630
we've got a little bit
of a sitch back home,

623
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,353
like a please, for the love of God,

624
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:11,435
there's a killer robot
destroying the city

625
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,613
kind of sitch.

626
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:14,350
We could use some help.

627
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,608
- Let's do it.
- You wanna tag along?

628
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,610
If you don't, I will, Smallville.

629
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,747
Cool. Who are you?

630
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,113
A friend.

631
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:39,039
Where the hell is Cisco?

632
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,541
I'm right here.

633
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,076
And I brought the big guns.

634
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:03,083
What are they doing?

635
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:04,404
Trying to keep AMAZO off balance

636
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,333
before it has time to
replicate their abilities.

637
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,030
Finish him.

638
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,086
No sign of movement.

639
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:27,788
Nice work.

640
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:29,923
We got lucky.

641
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,696
Uh, guys, you might want
to get out of the way.

642
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,638
What the hell is he doing?

643
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,751
Exactly what we wanted to avoid.

644
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:08,641
Well, that's not great.

645
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,700
AMAZO copied all of their powers,

646
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:15,502
and now it's on the hunt for more.

647
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:17,243
Cisco, there's got to be something

648
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,586
you can do to stop it.

649
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:22,076
How do you stop a T-3000
that kills for breakfast?

650
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,251
It's a computer, right?
So just turn it off.

651
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,788
- I hate it when you're right.
- Well, I'm right.

652
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,391
Let's go.

653
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:33,285
- It can phase.
- That's what that's called?

654
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:35,477
Well, we can't fight what we can't hit.

655
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,247
I've got an idea.

656
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,492
Bring him back here.

657
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,894
No problem.

658
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:42,563
Move.

659
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,372
When he comes back, knock him down.

660
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,577
He won't be able to phase
and run at the same time.

661
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:46,870
Guys, where are we at?

662
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:47,907
I think we got it.

663
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,641
We reverse-engineered
AMAZO's operating system

664
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:52,626
and whipped up a virus to wipe the CPU.

665
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:54,128
- Not so difficult.
- Except...

666
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:56,565
Except it's a robot that has replicated

667
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,001
their super strengths, and, thus,

668
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,870
now it is impenetrable,
so you cannot put

669
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,001
the virus inside it.

670
00:35:01,004 --> 00:35:02,308
That's not great.

671
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,563
Okay, so what do we do?

672
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:06,078
Look, if AMAZO inherited
all of their strengths,

673
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:08,321
then maybe it inherited
their weaknesses too.

674
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,090
Only we're not gonna weaken it, Iris.

675
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:11,859
We're gonna send it straight to hell.

676
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,508
Oliver, you're gonna have to
counteract AMAZO's phasing

677
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,274
while Supergirl and Superman hold it.

678
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:20,060
- Got it.
- I'll only have one shot.

679
00:35:20,062 --> 00:35:22,262
Now, bring me that virus, Cisco.

680
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,266
Come here.

681
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:29,669
Get ready.

682
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:41,229
Done.

683
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,946
Don't miss.

684
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,716
I won't.

685
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:53,593
Hurry up!

686
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:58,732
AMAZO, you have failed this city.

687
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,766
AMAZO has been dismantled

688
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:38,677
and every piece locked up
in a S.T.A.R. Labs vault

689
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,607
except for this one.
This is my souvenir.

690
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,849
A round of applause, everybody.

691
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,317
Felicitations, Flash.

692
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,548
That's quite a performance
you did out there.

693
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:50,326
Well, I appreciate that,
but still Oliver Queen.

694
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,626
And I am still Barry Allen.

695
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,895
I don't know, guys.

696
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:56,294
You took down AMAZO in one shot.

697
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,964
Only the Green Arrow can do that.

698
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,399
And, Oliver, you outran
AMAZO, just like the Flash.

699
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:04,013
Maybe we should stick with this
whole body swap thing for a while.

700
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,212
Seems to be working okay.

701
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:07,188
I don't know that anybody
would be too worried

702
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,579
if you two don't switch back.

703
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:09,735
No, no, no, no, no, no.

704
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:11,814
We need to figure out who
did this to Barry and Oliver

705
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:14,349
and why and then we're
gonna reverse it, okay?

706
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:16,540
Caitlin, any thoughts?

707
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:17,838
I haven't quite figured it out yet,

708
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,524
but until I do, I am confident

709
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,048
that Central City and Star
City are in good hands.

710
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:23,550
Speaking of "in good hands,"

711
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:26,180
I should probably get back
to Metropolis and Lois.

712
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:28,883
If anything were to happen,
her entire world's unprotected.

713
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:30,219
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

714
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:32,189
Thank you for helping us, Clark.

715
00:37:32,192 --> 00:37:34,033
We couldn't have stopped
AMAZO without you.

716
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,669
Oh, not so sure about that.

717
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,901
Hello, uh, Clark.

718
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:40,263
Help a genius out, would you?

719
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,508
Look, I want to give you this check...

720
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,391
I do this for free, the
whole helping humanity thing.

721
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,290
Oh, you think that I'm giving...

722
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:48,305
no, no, not for that.

723
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,468
This is a alimony
check for my third wife.

724
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:52,704
She also live on Earth-38,

725
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:56,208
and I might be a little
bit behind in the payment.

726
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:58,712
If you could just do me the favor...

727
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:01,316
You want me to deliver
this to your ex-wife?

728
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:03,285
To my ex-wife, my third ex-wife.

729
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,215
You're welcome.

730
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:07,218
You're welcome too.

731
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:09,755
It's super.

732
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:12,298
Man, I can trust him, right?

733
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,616
Are you okay?

734
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:25,883
No.

735
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,152
You did a great job with AMAZO,

736
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:30,756
but at what cost, Barry?

737
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:32,525
What do you mean?

738
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:35,763
Do you know why I let you and Oliver go?

739
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:38,930
It was because of something that I felt.

740
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,774
When I stopped looking with my eyes

741
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,169
and I started listening with my heart,

742
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:47,107
I realized that you,

743
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,979
Barry Allen, have always been

744
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:54,083
and will always be the man that I love.

745
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,898
No matter what mask I wear,

746
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,048
I'll always show you my true face.

747
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:06,141
I need you to promise
me something, Barry.

748
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:09,861
Promise me that when we
figure out who did this to you

749
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:11,563
and when you get your speed back

750
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:15,735
and you're finally back in my arms...

751
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:19,670
That'll you'll come back to me.

752
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,477
Of course I'll come back.

753
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,657
Barry, I heard what you said

754
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,027
right before you took that shot.

755
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,712
You're the Green Arrow now.

756
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:34,946
But please don't become Oliver Queen.

757
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:38,275
I won't.

758
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:42,328
I promise.

759
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,240
Barry, we need you in the workshop.

760
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:03,079
So you think this person
you saw has something to do

761
00:40:03,082 --> 00:40:04,674
with what's happened
to Barry and Oliver?

762
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:05,976
I mean, I saw him right after

763
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:07,509
these two swapped capes.

764
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:09,619
You've been having trouble
with your vibes lately, right?

765
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,368
- Maybe it's that?
- No.

766
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:13,173
This was beyond me.

767
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:16,244
It felt like something important.

768
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:18,984
We need to see it.

769
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:24,616
Okay, hang on.

770
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:32,611
My God, I can see everything.

771
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,033
Fascinating.

772
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,196
I wouldn't have thought
the men of this Earth

773
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,755
had this capacity.

774
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:46,625
But it won't avail you.

775
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:50,110
None of you can stop
what's been set into motion.

776
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:52,977
You're best off giving up now,

777
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,381
because nothing you can do can alter

778
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,634
what's about to happen.

779
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:01,715
Are you okay?

780
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,952
No, not even close.

781
00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:09,071
What did you see?

782
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:16,009
This.

783
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:17,407
I don't recognize him.

784
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,063
Doesn't matter.

785
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,500
I know where to find him.

786
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:23,657
So what's our next move?

787
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:29,067
We're going to Gotham City.

788
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:48,626
