00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,463
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

708
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:36,068
Or you might just explode.

709
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,835
We don't really know.

710
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:39,138
Uh, uh, huh?

711
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:40,905
(whimpers, yelps)

712
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:42,573
(screaming)

713
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:44,609
Ah... (chuckles)

714
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,646

726
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:23,514
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

(entry bell jingles)

729
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:33,192
(laughing):
Cool!

730
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,493
Aw, you guys look adorable.

731
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:37,628
And-and really tough
and-and scary.

732
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:39,965
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

733
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,432
Hi-yah!

734
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,302
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

735
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:46,704
- That's the spirit. Oh!
- (gong clangs)

736
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,941
Oh, okay, now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

737
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:52,944
Blair and Britney, right?

738
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,746
- Mm...
- We will!

739
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:56,514
Okay. Bye, Mom.

740
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:57,882
- LUCY: Bye!
- (kids grunting)

741
00:29:57,983 --> 00:29:59,051
Gotcha.

742
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:00,818
Hi-yah!

743
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,653
Circle up, people.

744
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:05,256
(grunting fiercely)

745
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:07,558
Show respect for your sensei.

746
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:10,762
KIDS:
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan!

747
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:12,530
Hai!

748
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:19,238
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

749
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:21,073
You look like a sheepdog.

750
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:22,440
Sorry, Sensei.

751
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,176
(Agnes whimpers,
chuckles nervously)

752
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:25,978
Now, we have
two new students today

753
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:31,016
ready to begin their journey--
hi-yah! -- to awesomeness.

754
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:33,384
- You, tiny girl.
- (gasps)

755
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:35,787
Step forward
and tell us your name.

756
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,288
Um...

757
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,557
(whispers):
It's Britney.

758
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,126
Uh...

759
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:43,427
m-my name?

760
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:46,364
I can't...

761
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:49,001
There's no "can't" in karate.

762
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:51,402
Ten push-ups after class!

763
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:53,437
Hey, that's not fair.

764
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:55,506
(grunting)

765
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,210
You better not be talking back
to your sensei.

766
00:30:58,309 --> 00:30:59,811
(grunts fiercely)

767
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:03,714
Now, are you ready to tell us
your name and participate?

768
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:05,716
Mm...

769
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:07,351
I guess not.

770
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,420
Then why don't you go sit

771
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,789
in the corner
of disgrace and reflection

772
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:14,926
and think about what kind
of person you want to be?

773
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:23,768
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

774
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:25,469
Yeah, probably.

775
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,771
- Excuse me?
- (neck cracks)

776
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:29,440
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

777
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,443
you picked the wrong dojo.

778
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,613
(grunting fiercely)

779
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:39,617

(kids cheering)

785
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:50,996
That was for my sister.

786
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:52,897
(O'Sullivan yells)

787
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,199
(whimpers)

788
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,901
You broke my pinkie toe.

789
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,036
(whimpers)

790
00:31:58,136 --> 00:31:59,238
(Edith chuckles nervously)

791
00:31:59,338 --> 00:32:01,240
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

792
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,540
(Edith chuckles nervously)

793
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,642
LUCY(quietly):
Okay, put this over here.

794
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:05,543
Hair gel.

795
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:07,279
- Hairspray.
- Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham.

796
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,281
Oh, yeah, uh, yeah? Uh, um, hi.

797
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,351
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

798
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,219
Well, what can I say?

799
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,686
I'm good at what I do.
(chuckles)

800
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:18,556
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

801
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:21,193
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

802
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:23,362
(both laugh)

804
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:26,365
I have a hair emergency, people.

805
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:30,102
Where's what's-her-name?
Remy? Rhonda?

806
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:32,004
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

807
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:33,471
Rachel's on maternity leave.

808
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,974
What?! Oh, that is unacceptable.

809
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:41,146
But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

810
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:43,614
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

811
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:46,450
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

("Dynamite" by BTS playing)

814
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:53,992
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

815
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:57,029
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

816
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,597
(chuckling): Let nature do
its "thang," you know?

817
00:32:59,697 --> 00:33:02,334
No, no, no, no,
that style is dead to me.

It's-it's time for
a whole new Melora.

819
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,339
I want this.

820

Wow. (chuckles)

Wow. Um...

822
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:15,513
Okay. Let's start with color.

823
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:18,449
Yes, color, 'cause that's
what you start with.

824
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:22,254
A little of this.

825
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,022
Some of that.

826
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:25,456
And, ooh, that's pretty.

827
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:27,059
This isn't so hard. (chuckles)

What?

831
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:39,870
(sniffs)
Should it be smoking?

832
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:41,173
Yes, uh-huh.

833
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:43,008

847
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:14,839
My latest creation.

848
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:18,377
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

849
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:19,877
Ay, I love it.

850
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:22,014
Oh, and look at
the little antenna.

851
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:22,913
That's so cute.

852
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:24,983
It's not supposed
to be cute, no!

853
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,986
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

854
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:32,424
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking bald potato,

855
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:34,692

- Blah, blah, blah.

00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:40,331
Please, Junior, Daddy needs
to steal a honey badger.

1462
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:45,270
Whew. Okay.

1463
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,773
I know they keep Lenny here
at night.

1464
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:51,075
And if memory serves,

1465
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:54,679
there is a hidden switch
around here somewhere.

1466
00:59:54,779 --> 00:59:56,180
Ah. Aha.

I'll hit him with this.

1474

Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

1475
