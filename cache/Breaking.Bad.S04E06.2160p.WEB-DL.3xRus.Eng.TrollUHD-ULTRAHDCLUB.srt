1
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,094
No, no, no!

2
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,801
Hey.

3
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>It's me.</i>

4
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>I wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids.</i>

5
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,319
{\an8}<i>I love you.</i>

6
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,825
<i>It's me.</i>

7
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:07,205
{\an8}<i>I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and...</i>

8
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,896
{\an8}- Morning.
- Afternoon.

9
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,441
{\an8}Oh, really? Jesus.

10
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,569
{\an8}You shouldn't have let me sleep.

11
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,738
{\an8}You needed it.

12
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,337
{\an8}Skyler, I don't entirely remember
what happened last night.

13
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,548
{\an8}I mean, I might have said
some things that...

14
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,593
{\an8}Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?

15
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,224
{\an8}- Skyler, I can't even focus on...
- Gale Boetticher.

16
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,810
{\an8}Did you know him?

17
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,312
{\an8}My God. What...?

18
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,482
{\an8}What exactly did I say last night?

19
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,651
{\an8}Just enough.

20
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,904
Did you work together?

21
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,037
Who killed him?

22
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,582
Was it the people you work for?

23
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,752
{\an8}Definitely not.

24
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,379
{\an8}Was it somebody who

25
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:43,844
at some point,
might wanna do the same to you?

26
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,226
{\an8}I seriously doubt it. No.

27
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,731
{\an8}God.

28
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,028
{\an8}Oh, God.

29
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,746
{\an8}I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

30
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,792
{\an8}I know exactly what happened
last night. I drank too much wine.

31
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,378
{\an8}You told Hank

32
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,133
{\an8}that the man he was looking for
might still be out there.

33
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,971
{\an8}That it might not be this Boetticher
after all.

34
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:33,977
{\an8}And I was up all night, wondering
why you would say that to him.

35
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,687
{\an8}Because I was drunk, Skyler.

36
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:40,066
{\an8}No, but then I was remembering
your black eye.

37
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,112
{\an8}Your business disagreement
that you don't wanna talk about.

38
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,407
{\an8}Look, I don't want to talk
about any of this. Ever.

39
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,994
{\an8}The firewall, all right?

40
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,121
{\an8}Church and state.

41
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,124
{\an8}That's how we need to approach
this thing.

42
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,672
And then I remembered the message
you left me the other day

43
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,217
when you said you loved me.

44
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,223
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe you...

45
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,811
I don't know, that you were regretting
what's happened between us.

46
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,313
And I get that.

47
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,107
After last night, I...

48
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531
Walt, I think you're scared.

49
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,410
I think that message
was some kind of goodbye.

50
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,329
No, Skyler.

51
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,707
{\an8}- I think last night was a cry for help.
- Oh, Jesus.

52
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,292
{\an8}A cry for help?

53
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,337
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

54
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,008
That is just...

55
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:52,305
{\an8}That is it exactly. Yes.

56
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,641
{\an8}You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

57
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,892
{\an8}God.

58
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,852
At least this would all be over.

59
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,482
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous
weight just lifted off of me.

60
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,818
Now I understand myself.

61
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,611
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,489
Walt, I've said it before.

63
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,993
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

64
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,581
- I don't wanna hear about the police.
- I do not say that lightly.

65
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,875
I know what it could do to this family.

66
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:26,381
But if it's the only real choice we have,
if it's either that or you getting shot...

67
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,550
I don't wanna hear about the police.

68
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,971
You're not some hardened criminal,
Walt. You are in over your head.

69
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,432
That's what we tell them, the truth.

70
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,226
- That is not the truth.
- Of course it is.

71
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,730
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money...

72
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,108
- We're done here.
- Roped into working... Unable to quit.

73
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,402
You told me that yourself, Walt.

74
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,448
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Walt, please.

75
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,410
Let's both of us stop trying
to justify this whole thing,

76
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,328
and admit you're in danger.

77
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,417
Who are you talking to right now?

78
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,338
Who is it you think you see?

79
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,760
Do you know how much I make a year?

80
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,763
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

81
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,475
You know what would happen
if I decided to stop going in to work?

82
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,979
A business big enough that it could be
listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.

83
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,858
Disappears. It ceases to exist
without me. No.

84
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,112
You clearly don't know who you're
talking to, so let me clue you in.

85
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,283
I am not in danger, Skyler.
I am the danger.

86
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,579
A guy opens his door and gets shot,
and you think that of me? No.

87
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,832
I am the one who knocks.

88
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,375
Look, I was...

89
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,058
Skyler?

90
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,000
Here we are. Just like you left it.

91
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,713
And where is your pretty wife?

92
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,425
She has other business to attend to.

93
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:22,182
Well, like I say to her,
place sells as is. Understand?

94
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,893
Yes, I understand.

95
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,103
Good, good.

96
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,856
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

97
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,609
She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

98
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,112
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.

99
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,325
So here is everything you need.

100
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,411
- I keep very good files.
- Thank you.

101
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,081
So you are the boss now, huh?

102
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,670
You think you're ready?

103
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,091
Yes, I think so.

104
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,305
Being boss is tough.

105
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:07,852
I know you think I was hard on you,
but you'll learn.

106
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,939
Being in charge is not easy.

107
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,982
It takes hard work.

108
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,527
- You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
- Yeah?

109
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,780
I don't know.

110
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,907
Not so much, maybe.

111
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,618
But maybe when you are the boss

112
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,830
you will just keep your feet up
and relax.

113
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,169
The real important thing...

114
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,921
And not everyone knows this.

115
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,882
...is to be tough.

116
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,263
Boss has to be tough.

117
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,432
Has to say no to people.

118
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:52,939
Has to make cashiers wipe down cars

119
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,901
even if they don't want to.

120
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,031
Can you be tough, Walter?

121
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,996
I am sure you can handle.

122
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,293
And if not,
you can always call your wife, no?

123
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,593
- Always sticky.
- Yeah.

124
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,429
No problem.

125
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,599
As is.

126
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,619
Who'd have thought that someday
I would be handing these keys to you?

127
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,597
Many years. Almost forgot.

128
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,562
Bogdan.

129
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,525
As is.

130
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,851
Thank you.

131
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,680
You okay there?

132
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,725
I'm fine.

133
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,855
Just not using is...

134
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,158
Eat something.

135
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,819
Yeah?

136
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,448
That's right, both of them.

137
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,867
All right.

138
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,953
I'm on my way.

139
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,832
You need any help?

140
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,003
No.

141
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,025
You want me to call her back?

142
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,236
No. No.

143
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,326
What exactly did she say?
I mean, exactly.

144
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:03,457
Just, you know, she asked if
I was okay and not to worry.

145
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,334
Like that.

146
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:12,424
Any rough timetable on this thing,
as to when she's coming home?

147
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,931
It's about the gambling, right?

148
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,519
Well, it's kind of hard to...

149
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,771
Dad, she can't understand.

150
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:30,567
It's not like you're doing this
on purpose. You can't help it.

151
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,570
It's not that simple.

152
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,992
Look, you have a disease.
It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

153
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,746
- No, it's not. Not at all.
- Yes, it is. I read online.

154
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,666
She's not even allowed to be mad at you.

155
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,585
She can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

156
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,213
Son, these are two very different things.

157
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,758
Not really.
Gambling addiction is a sickness.

158
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,594
- You can't...
- Listen, what is going on with me

159
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,431
is not about some disease.
It's about choices.

160
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,182
Choices that I have made.

161
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,060
Choices I stand by.

162
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,989
You're not moving back in, are you?

163
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,290
No.

164
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,176
Hey, you know what?
School can wait.

165
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,889
Why don't we take a little detour?

166
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,184
What kind of detour?

167
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,061
You'll see.

168
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,652
<i>Charlie, pick up line three.
Line three, Charlie.</i>

169
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:03,869
I think it's time we got you
your own car. What do you think?

170
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,663
What?

171
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:12,127
I think if you're gonna buy me off

172
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,963
buy me off.

173
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,219
<i>Get an attendant over to the lot.</i>

174
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,991
- Amazing. It's amazing.
- Yeah. It's good-looking.

175
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,995
That's good. I'm glad you like it.

176
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,874
- I do. Thank you, Dad.
- All right. You're welcome.

177
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,809
So you're here.

178
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,478
Yeah.

179
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,817
You're actually here? To work?

180
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,946
Yeah, man. Jesus.

181
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,573
Jesse.

182
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,284
Come here.

183
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,453
- All right, I need an update.
- Update on what?

184
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:33,041
An update on these little field trips
that you've been taking with Mike.

185
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,046
I told you already. We pick up money.
Check on things. Stuff like that.

186
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:43,969
And you're his bodyguard, right?
What? That's what you said.

187
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,054
I said I guarded him.

188
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:51,059
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

189
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,270
And this has to be you?

190
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:59,067
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any
of the couple dozen muscle-heads

191
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:03,280
that Gus has working for him?
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

192
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,534
Why? What, is there something
about you that I don't know?

193
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,037
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

194
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,581
Your hands registered as lethal weapons?

195
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,832
Register this.

196
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,502
All I'm saying is that
do you not even question this?

197
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,006
Do you really believe that you mean
anything to these people?

198
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,259
Not trying to insult. Just trying to
make you see things.

199
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:28,305
I see they can't outright kill me,
but they don't want me getting high.

200
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,893
I see this thing probably started
as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.

201
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,978
But you know what?

202
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:40,025
I saved Mike from getting robbed,
even killed, maybe.

203
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:44,029
So maybe I'm not such a loser after all.

204
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,826
I mean, what if it...? Oh, God.

205
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,964
- All right. What if it's all just a setup?
- What?

206
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,385
What if this robbery that you stopped
wasn't even real?

207
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,805
I mean, think about it.
Your first day out guarding Mike.

208
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,391
He steps out for one second
and what happens?

209
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,644
- You immediately get robbed.
- You are such an asshole.

210
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,314
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer. Like you said

211
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,151
Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows I won't stand for it.

212
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,362
He hates the fact that he needs me.

213
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,241
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

214
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,119
If you'd been there,
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

215
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,831
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you, huh?

216
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,918
Because the way you describe it,
they gave up pretty damn easy.

217
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:45,674
No, no, this whole thing, all of this

218
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,636
it's all about me.

219
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,226
Hello?

220
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,731
Look, just hang on.

221
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,779
Yeah?

222
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,156
I'll be right up.

223
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:56,411
- What?
- I gotta go.

224
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,332
What? Am I supposed to clean all this
on my own?

225
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,670
Hey.

226
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,093
God...

227
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,739
<i>Buenos dias, </i>ladies, <i>buenos dias.</i>

228
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,491
Do you speak English?

229
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,244
- No.
- No, okay.

230
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,123
Help, help.

231
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,967
I need help to clean. Yes.

232
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,191
- Yes, <i>muy bueno. </i>It's just this...
- No.

233
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,861
No, no, no.

234
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,530
No, no, no.

235
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,956
No, no, ladies.

236
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,222
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what.
I tell you what. Look, look.

237
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,183
Universal language.

238
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,315
This one for you. Yeah, <i>sí.</i>

239
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,068
<i>Sí, Presidente </i>Grant.
Very important man.

240
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,034
<i>Mas dinero</i> after the...

241
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,079
Are we good?

242
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,584
I think we're good. I think we listened
to you. Please,<i> por favor, por favor.</i>

243
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,713
Please,<i> por favor, por favor.</i>

244
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,550
Yes.

245
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,212
What's the deal?

246
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:03,844
Well, the deal is,
we're watching that house.

247
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,097
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

248
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,141
Yeah? What for?

249
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,727
A little birdie told me there's some guys

250
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:15,147
that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

251
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:18,651
And which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

252
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,696
So, what's the plan?

253
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,282
I just told you.

254
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,202
We sit here and watch that house

255
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,205
until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

256
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,125
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

257
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,171
Why don't you just go break the door down

258
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,299
pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

259
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:47,012
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product,

260
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,306
and most likely armed.

261
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,060
Now, what you may not know
about meth-heads...

262
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,396
Or maybe you do.

263
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,982
They're kind of unpredictable.

264
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,236
I don't care for unpredictable.
So we wait.

265
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:08,117
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

266
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:13,289
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

267
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,876
Yes, sir.

268
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,925
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?

269
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,809
Where you going?

270
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,980
You said they're selling right?
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

271
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,072
Who the hell are you?

272
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,575
- Tucker! Tucker!
- I'm here to buy.

273
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,328
- Will you shut the damn door?
- Not my question.

274
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,290
Name's Diesel. Heard you
maybe had some of the blue.

275
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,168
- Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker! Tucker!
- I just...

276
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,046
- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
- Tucker!

277
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,340
- Come on, help a brother out.
- Tucker!

278
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,010
- Will you shut the damn door?
- We don't sell to strangers.

279
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,512
- Tucker!
- Get off the porch, asshole.

280
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,182
- Will you shut the door?
- All right already!

281
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,351
Tucker!

282
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,095
Guess we'll go with Plan A, then.

283
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,863
- Pop the trunk, would you?
- Why?

284
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,283
- There's something in there I need.
- And what would that be?

285
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,869
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

286
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,956
Oh, your first attempt
being such a wild success?

287
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,543
You may know this whole
PI sit-in-the-car business,

288
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,212
but I know meth-heads.

289
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,390
What are you doing?

290
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,601
Digging.

291
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,145
Why?

292
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,523
You know why.

293
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,776
How deep are you going?

294
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,821
I don't know.
How deep do you think it is?

295
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,202
Pretty deep.

296
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:50,339
Hey, you mind taking over for a minute?

297
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,842
Yeah, sure.

298
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:08,524
- Hey, mind if I use your john?
- Yeah.

299
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,552
Tucker.

300
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,305
Tucker!

301
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,437
Tucker!

302
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,361
Who the hell are you?

303
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,270
- I just...
- Who the hell are you?

304
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,783
It's cool. Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.

305
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:05,622
- What do you want?
- I just wanna buy some of the blue.

306
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,624
It's not for sale.

307
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,378
I know you were selling it earlier...

308
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:15,591
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Tucker told me.

309
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,844
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn
to keep his damn mouth shut.

310
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,221
Tucker! Tucker!

311
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:26,310
So you gonna hook me up?

312
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,814
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!

313
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,235
You know, I think he's outside.
You wanna just go outside...

314
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:40,657
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.

315
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,576
Okay? Let's go outside.

316
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:47,372
I don't have enough for you, all right?

317
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:52,628
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Okay.

318
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:57,090
- I don't wanna start any trouble.
- Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?

319
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,344
No, no, no.
I'm just saying we're cool, okay?

320
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,762
- We're good.
- What?

321
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,264
You can't know that.
What does that mean?

322
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:08,727
You don't put thoughts in my head.
You don't put thoughts in my head.

323
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:12,314
- Absolutely. You're right. You're right.
- Tucker?

324
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,237
You...

325
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,024
Here you go, Maria.

326
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,734
Veronica.

327
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,112
Ilia, <i>gracias.</i>

328
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,163
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

329
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,051
Wait, where you taking them?

330
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,389
- Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
- I'm putting them on a bus.

331
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,559
- Why? What bus?
- One that takes them back to Honduras.

332
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,311
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

333
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,108
Wait, wait. This was my idea.
Don't punish them.

334
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,194
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

335
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,697
He does.

336
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,556
Give us a minute, will you?

337
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,070
We won't be too long.

338
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,998
The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo

339
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,167
to a couple local nobodies.

340
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,921
Very disciplined of them,
not keeping anything for themselves.

341
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,924
It was all about sending a message.

342
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,843
Which they did, literally.

343
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,596
It was written on the bucket lid.

344
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,015
"Ready to talk?"

345
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,477
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

346
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,942
I know you're not really asking
for advice.

347
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,822
But let me hire 10, 15 more
good operators.

348
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,784
Then we hit them hard.
Hit them where they live.

349
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:15,538
No. This war stays cold for now.

350
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,420
What about their message?
What's the answer?

351
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,262
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.

352
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,349
How did he do today?

353
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,915
I hear you can handle yourself.

354
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,835
I guess.

355
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,421
Good night.

356
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,923
Hey, excuse me?

357
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,510
Why me?

358
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,140
I like to think I see things in people.

359
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:45,128
Slow down.
The car is not going anywhere.

360
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,509
- Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

361
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,554
- Hi.
- Hey.

362
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,019
- So did you see what's in the driveway?
- There you go.

363
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,938
Yeah, I saw.

364
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,982
Hey.

365
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,195
So that's yours, huh?

366
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,822
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

367
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,367
Well, that was very nice of him.

368
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,619
Yeah.

369
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,997
I know it looks like

370
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:24,918
well, awesome, but it's super safe.

371
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,544
Dad made sure.

372
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,048
And I promise
to always go the speed limit. Or below.

373
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,383
Way below.

374
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:36,179
And it gets great gas mileage.

375
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:42,310
So Dad said I can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

376
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,896
Just around the block.

377
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,149
Yeah. Just around the block.

378
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,195
- And be careful, okay?
- I will.

379
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,489
Bye.

380
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,912
It's really... It's really great
to have you home, Mom.

381
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,880
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?

382
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,007
- I will.
- Okay.

383
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,111
I guess we should talk.

384
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,406
Well, I think you said plenty
the other day.

385
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,493
Look, about that, it just...

386
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,746
Did you get the car wash keys?

387
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:48,543
Yes. Yes. Here.

388
00:43:54,966 --> 00:44:01,222
Skyler, I may have
overstated things earlier,

389
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:05,602
and I'm sorry to be so forward.

390
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:10,064
But I just...
I want you to know something.

391
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,900
I want you to...

392
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,819
I need you to understand

393
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,155
that you are safe.

394
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:22,744
You, Junior, Holly.
You are completely safe.

395
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,749
Everything that I do, everything

396
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,211
I do it to protect this family.

397
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,050
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

398
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,388
Okay. I...

399
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:47,310
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car,

400
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:52,607
and I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

401
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,904
It goes back.

402
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,656
Tomorrow.

403
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,326
Skyler, it will crush him.

404
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:08,414
That car directly contradicts our story.

405
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,085
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family

406
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,129
it means protecting the story.

407
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,216
What do you think the neighbors
are gonna say, Walt?

408
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,968
What about Hank and Marie?

409
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,013
How about the IRS?
What were you thinking, Walt?

410
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:29,018
I was thinking that I wanted
to do something nice for my son.

411
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,404
Look.

412
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,909
I just worry that he'll blame you
for this.

413
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,415
Oh, he will.

414
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,418
Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother,

415
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,589
for taking away
what his loving father has given him,

416
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,258
so thanks for that.

417
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,929
But you know what, Walt?

418
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,640
Someone has to protect this family

419
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,144
from the man who protects this family.
