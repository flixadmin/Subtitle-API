2
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,760
I wrote it all down:
4,200 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

3
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,560
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

4
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,140
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

5
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,730
-Is that the listing sheet?
-There is no listing sheet.

6
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,520
I heard about it this morning.
It'll be gone by this afternoon

7
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,690
-Well, how many more after this one?
-None. You know how tight the market is.

8
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,780
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,660
Evan!

10
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,000
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

11
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,630
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,000
I’m so sorry.

13
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,960
I’m meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

14
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,680
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,680
...you are sadly mistaken.

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,220
You're a saint to wait for us.

17
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,180
-Thank you.
-Hello.

18
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,360
It’s kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,900
We call it a ''townstone.''

20
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,740
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

21
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,030
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,830
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

23
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,960
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

24
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,460
Sarah.

25
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,420
There are two bedroom floors above.

26
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,380
My God, it's amazing.

27
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,760
Hey, kid. No scooter.

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,390
I don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,810
It’s got a yard. Sort of.

30
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,440
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,490
It allows for an expansive garden.

32
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,660
Working elevator.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,990
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,660
Highly unusual, the elevator.

35
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,160
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

36
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,500
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

37
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,840
It’s a very emotional property.

38
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,430
Shall we have a look at the rest?

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,470
You should make an offer immediately.

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,970
Can I see it first?

41
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,600
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

42
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,190
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,190
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,950
It’s got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,240
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

46
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
It’s a fortune.

47
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,950
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

48
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,130
He can afford it.

49
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,300
It would be so lovely
if I could show the property before I leave.

50
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,980
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

51
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,520
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

52
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,560
They share one small bath.

53
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,440
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

54
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,150
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,610
I don't know if you have live-in help.

56
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,490
No, it's just the two of us.

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,290
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

58
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,880
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

59
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,050
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,880
May I ask what you do, Mrs....

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,760
Altman.

62
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,390
Actually, I’m going back to school.
Columbia.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,400
I didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

65
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,270
Yes, until recently.

66
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,730
Master bath.

67
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,280
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

68
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,950
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

69
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,330
Now they can't find half his money.

71
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,330
I hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

72
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,710
Stop calling it ''the property.''
It sounds ridiculous.

73
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,090
Walk-in closet.

74
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,300
Could the little one please stop that?

75
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,010
Kid, no elevator!

76
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,890
And we emerge in the master suite.

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,610
That's strange.

78
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,860
What?

79
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,450
Is this room smaller than it should be?

80
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,620
You're the first person to notice.

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,420
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

82
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,270
It’s called a panic room.

83
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,100
-What?
-A safe room.

84
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,310
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-I've read about these.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,650
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

86
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,400
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

87
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,860
This is perfect.

88
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,200
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,280
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

90
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,040
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? I think not.

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,210
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

92
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,050
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

93
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,340
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

94
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,640
This whole thing makes me nervous.

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,050
Why?

96
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,970
Ever read any Poe?

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,310
No, but I loved her last album.

98
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,810
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

99
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,060
Steel.

100
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,770
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

101
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,440
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

102
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,150
...it's still functional.

103
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,160
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,370
Open it, please.

105
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,040
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,330
Please open the door.

107
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,000
That is highly inappropriate.

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,040
Open the door, please.

109
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,970
My room. Definitely my room.

110
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,680
This is really dangerous.

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,180
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,690
Motion detector, like an elevator.

113
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,400
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

114
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,650
It couldn't be safer.

115
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,290
I know they'll take asking price.

116
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,860
It’s working. I hooked up the phone!

117
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,900
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

118
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,740
579 what?

119
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,900
3000.

120
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,410
Patsy's Pizza. please hold.

121
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,840
Hey. Enough.

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,600
Mind the pizza?

123
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,100
What do you mean?

124
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,560
Our first night.
I should've thought of something special.

125
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,140
I like pizza.

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,410
Fuck him.

127
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't.

128
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,250
Fuck her, too.

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,210
I agree.

130
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,010
But don't.

131
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,950
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

132
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,870
You didn't carry anything up them.

133
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,450
You never asked
what I thought of this house.

134
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,660
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

135
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,080
-I liked our old house.
-Well, so did I.

136
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,540
You know what I was thinking?

137
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,300
I was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

138
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,260
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

139
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,260
Go ahead.

140
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,770
Oh, damn.

141
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,060
I forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

142
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,520
Dad already did it.
I’m going with him on Sunday.

143
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,030
Oh, yeah?

144
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,570
So I’ll take a cab and meet him there.

145
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,740
Is that what he said?

146
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,660
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

147
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,870
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

148
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,370
I’ll ride with you.

149
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,710
Why'd you bring me here
if I can't go anywhere on my own?

150
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,380
That's it. I quit.

151
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,300
I’m not fighting with you till tomorrow.

152
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,340
Come here.

153
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,010
It’s disgusting how much I love you.

154
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,760
Tell me about it.

155
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,270
-Mom?
-Yeah.

156
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,780
It’s too dark.

157
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
Better?

158
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,040
That's better.

159
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,950
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

160
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,750
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

161
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,580
''Shunt. Enter.''

162
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,640
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

163
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,300
''Shunt.''

164
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,430
''Enter zone number.''

165
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,940
''Shunt again.''

166
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,110
ln the morning I got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

167
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,730
Go, go back.

168
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,030
Do it.

169
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,710
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

170
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,460
Amateur.

171
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,630
We got a problem! We need to talk!

172
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,340
It’s about time. I’m freezing
my tits off out there.

173
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,220
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

174
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,770
Who the fuck is Raoul?

175
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,730
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

176
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,190
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

177
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,940
Open the fucking door.

178
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,530
No shit.

179
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,620
What is this?

180
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,080
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

181
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,580
They're not supposed to be here.

182
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,920
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

183
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,960
Videotape. We're on videotape.

184
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,050
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

185
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,680
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

186
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,810
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

187
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,520
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

188
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,360
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

189
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,190
Five-day weeks always!

190
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,910
Right?

191
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,320
I’m out of here.

192
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,330
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

193
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,660
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

194
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,000
It’s just a woman and a kid?

195
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,340
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

196
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,340
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

197
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,220
It’s just her and the kid!

198
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,260
Now, can we do this?

199
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,470
Yeah, we can do it.

200
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,560
Not with people here. And not with me.

201
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,020
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

202
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,070
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.

203
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,200
So, we keep an eye on her.

204
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,910
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

205
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,040
I don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

206
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,880
Nobody gets hurt.

207
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,710
What about us? What if she has a gun?

208
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,050
Who are you?

209
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,720
I’m Raoul.

210
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,240
You know we can't do this without you!

211
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,110
This is still a good plan.

212
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,450
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
It’s just got a slight twist.

213
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,870
Yeah.

214
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,080
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

215
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,000
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

216
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,090
No family.

217
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,920
You're right. It’s all fucked up.
I fucked it up!

218
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,090
It’s not how it's supposed to be.

219
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,640
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

220
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,900
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

221
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,070
Hey, I want that money. I want it!

222
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,820
But you...

223
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,240
...you need that money.

224
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,290
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

225
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,460
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

226
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,630
Kill the phones.

227
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,010
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

228
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,760
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

229
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,980
Wake up! Sarah!

230
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,650
Get up!

231
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,530
What did you do that for?

232
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,880
Where are you going?

233
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,470
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

234
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,390
They're in the elevator, heading down.

235
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,750
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

236
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,330
I told you. I don't hurt people.

237
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,710
They're going downstairs.

238
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,380
-That room.
-What?

239
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,970
The panic room.

240
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,640
No, press emergency stop.

241
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,310
Fuck!

242
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,310
Coming back up!

243
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,910
That's you.

244
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,250
Shit.

245
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,800
Go!

246
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,090
Fuck!

247
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,760
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

248
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,770
Damn it! Mother--

249
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,730
Shit!

250
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,030
That's seven years bad luck.

251
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,330
Shit.

252
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,970
Tell me they're not in there.

253
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,120
Oh, damn.

254
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,790
-It doesn't work?
-It’s a different phone line.

255
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,750
I never hooked it up.

256
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,920
Now what?

257
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,370
I can't hear a thing.

258
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,080
What do you think they want?

259
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,040
I don't know. Rob us....

260
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,330
I don't know.

261
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,000
What do we do?

262
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,170
We wait.

263
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,130
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

264
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,010
They can't get in. It’s not possible.

265
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,720
Mom. I heard you.

266
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,850
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

267
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,390
-You shaky?
-No.

268
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,940
-Chills?
-No.

269
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,740
Please. Don't worry about me.

270
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,670
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

271
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,590
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

272
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,010
Here he comes.

273
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,100
I locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

274
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,140
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

275
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,430
Could she have hooked it up today?

276
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,650
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

277
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,860
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

278
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,610
I checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

279
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,740
You see? She couldn't have.

280
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,780
-I thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

281
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,790
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

282
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,500
Do it.

283
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,130
Excuse me.

284
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,470
The police are on their way.

285
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,190
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

286
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,400
It’s not an intercom. It’s a PA system.

287
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,200
I know. I’m just scaring her.

288
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,740
I suggest you leave before they get here.

289
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,420
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

290
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,960
How could he know that?

291
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,670
Take what you want and get out!

292
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,720
lf only it were that easy.

293
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,050
Some paper. I need some paper.
Give me some paper.

294
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

295
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,810
You got a piece of paper?

296
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,690
-What is he doing?
-I don't know.

297
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,250
''What we want is in that room''?

298
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
They're coming in here, aren't they?

299
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,130
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.

300
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,550
What do you know about this room?

301
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,380
What do we know about that room?

302
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,880
-Let’s not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

303
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,320
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

304
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,360
Get out of my house!

305
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,740
-Say ''fuck.''
-You fuck.

306
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,700
-Mom.
-What?

307
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,750
''Get the fuck out of my house.''

308
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,000
Get the fuck out of my house!

309
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,010
Okay, I have an idea.

310
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,930
She's a woman. Women need security.

311
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,970
She won't believe you.

312
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,020
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

313
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,780
Conversation's over!

314
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,370
What? She's not coming down?

315
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,960
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

316
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,210
Like that'll help you think.

317
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,670
You know what? Fine! You think!

318
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,920
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

319
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,130
She said it again, that she called the cops.

320
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,720
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

321
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,600
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

322
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,970
How do we get into that room?

323
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,360
What is funny about this?

324
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,110
Is this shit funny to you?

325
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,530
I spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

326
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,860
...to keep out people like us.

327
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,830
It’s all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

328
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,660
We can't.

329
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,420
You can't get in the panic room.

330
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,170
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

331
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,460
And why would she do that?

332
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,630
I don't know.

333
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,850
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

334
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,230
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

335
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,480
...and I don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

336
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,860
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

337
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,440
We make it impossible for them to leave.

338
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,030
And why would they come out
in the first place?

339
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,080
I’m working on that.

340
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,460
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

341
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,970
Small space?

342
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,970
I’m okay.

343
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,010
-You can't wig out.
-I know.

344
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,850
-I mean it.
-I won't.

345
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,810
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

346
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,900
I guess it used to happen all the time.

347
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,190
Really?

348
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,860
Yeah, I read that.

349
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,410
And when did this happen all the time?

350
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,000
Twenty, thirty years ago.

351
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,960
What are they doing now?

352
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,010
I don't know.

353
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,320
They're locking us in.

354
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,450
This is not happening.

355
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,500
Sarah, calm down.

356
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,010
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

357
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,470
Sarah!

358
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,460
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

359
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,090
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

360
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,920
You won't even make a dent.

361
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,090
We'll see.

362
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,590
Hey. This is what I do.

363
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,720
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

364
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,930
...do you really think
that I would still have a job?

365
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,690
Don't get that in your eye.

366
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,310
Neighbor.

367
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,770
Help!

368
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,190
Please help us!

369
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,780
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

370
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,280
Help us!

371
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,170
Help!

372
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,340
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

373
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,630
Shit!

374
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,910
You guys just going to stand there?

375
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,710
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

376
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,160
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

377
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,840
Could you be any louder?

378
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,180
Give me a hand with those boxes.

379
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,850
Listen, goddamn it!

380
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,520
I’m in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

381
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,820
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

382
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,200
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

383
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,900
Oh, this is good.

384
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,070
This could work.

385
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,530
I was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

386
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,580
-Open it.
-I just did.

387
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,540
Open it some more.

388
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,540
We're just sending them a message.

389
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,290
They'll get the point.

390
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,960
Honey, get down on the ground.

391
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,970
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

392
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,180
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

393
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,890
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

394
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,400
What is it?

395
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,150
It’s bad.

396
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,780
They're coughing.

397
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,410
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

398
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,160
Nobody is going to die, man!

399
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,580
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

400
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,060
Mom.

401
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,020
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

402
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,320
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

403
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,200
Cut it back a little.

404
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,280
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

405
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,450
We can't get in if they're dead!

406
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,000
Stay on the ground and breathe.

407
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,300
Turn it down.

408
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,510
Turn it down! It’s too much!

409
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,180
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

410
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,560
I’m turning it down.

411
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,150
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

412
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,750
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

413
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,080
-No.
-Turn it down.

414
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,800
-Mom?
-Just a second.

415
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,560
Get under this.

416
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,400
Oh, my god.

417
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,320
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-It’s my fucking idea.

418
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,830
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

419
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,730
What is that?

420
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,730
Turn the gas off.

421
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,790
Turn the gas off right now.

422
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,770
Get back!

423
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,560
Shit!

424
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,820
God!

425
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,240
Get it off me!

426
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,870
It’s okay.

427
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:33,210
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
I’m coming in there!

428
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,380
Calm the fuck down.

429
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,520
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

430
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,560
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

431
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,770
I won't.

432
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,160
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

433
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,590
What?

434
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,590
Talk to him.

435
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,050
Please, man, give it a rest.

436
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,490
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

437
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,330
Where'd you learn that?

438
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,870
Titanic.

439
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,340
We got to talk. Downstairs.

440
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,850
No, no, no. Not you.

441
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,820
Come on, come on, come on.

442
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,400
Get up.

443
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,860
Come on.

444
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,370
Wake up.

445
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,720
The first thing I’m going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

446
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,810
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

447
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,020
I want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

448
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,190
Fine!

449
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:46,610
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

450
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,410
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

451
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,060
Got him.

452
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,520
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

453
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:22,100
I’m not losing
my half of the money because--

454
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,690
Slow down. Half?

455
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,230
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

456
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,450
Come on.

457
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,790
I’m letting you know he's a problem.

458
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,790
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

459
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,210
You're right. It wasn't your idea!

460
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,460
None of this was your idea!
It was my idea!

461
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,720
Come on, look over here.

462
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,350
Yes.

463
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,520
Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,490
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

465
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,500
-We're here!
-Help us!

466
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,370
We're over here!

467
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,090
Help!

468
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,390
Open your window!

469
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,800
Help!

470
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,650
We're never going to get out of here.

471
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,370
I’m the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

472
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,870
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

473
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,080
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

474
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,670
Are you done?

475
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:10,050
No. I’m the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

476
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,010
I’m the one who found the guy who built it,
and I convinced him to break into it!

477
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,970
Wait a minute.

478
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,350
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

479
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,320
Two of them, on the stairs.

480
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,650
Where's the third guy?

481
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,700
I left my cell phone by the bed.

482
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,700
I earned that money.

483
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,500
I will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

484
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,920
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

485
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,760
Got it?

486
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,260
lf I don't come back, close this door.

487
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,140
Just do what I say.

488
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,390
He touches me again, I’ll shoot him.

489
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,520
Christ!

490
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,190
Wait!

491
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:14,030
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

492
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,450
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

493
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,490
I’ll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

494
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,990
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

495
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,790
You live in Flatbush.

496
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,750
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

497
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,790
...because I saw that movie, too.

498
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,210
What is this?

499
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,920
I got some news for you.

500
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,590
Go.

501
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,260
Go!

502
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,080
Fuck!

503
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,750
She got something. What did she get?

504
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,840
No.

505
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,170
Charger!

506
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,050
She has a cell phone.

507
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,550
No!

508
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,850
All right, signal.

509
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,770
Come on. Signal.

510
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,740
I don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

511
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,450
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

512
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:14,920
No signal.

513
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,300
I didn't hook up this line,
but I hooked up the main line.

514
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,930
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

515
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:36,730
I can't go to prison, man.
I’m not built for that shit.

516
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,030
Be careful.

517
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,840
Get the phone.

518
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:04,130
-It doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

519
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,850
Screwdriver. Phillips.

520
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,570
Junior, when I asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

521
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:33,160
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

522
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,060
Shit!

523
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,230
Strip this and expose the wires.

524
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,570
-What are we doing?
-I have no idea.

525
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,270
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

526
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,600
Okay.

527
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,690
Yellow, yellow.

528
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:56,990
Okay.

529
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,620
Dial tone.

530
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,970
911 emergency.

531
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,890
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

532
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:17,180
-please hold.
-No, no. God.

533
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:23,770
Call Dad.

534
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,700
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

535
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,200
-Hello?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

536
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,160
-Who is this?
-It’s Meg.

537
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,670
Do you know what time it is?

538
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,340
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

539
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,300
Move.

540
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,800
-Hello?
-You've got to help us.

541
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,850
Move!

542
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,350
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

543
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:04,690
What--

544
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,790
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

545
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,410
He'll call the police.

546
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,710
You don't know her. She won't let him.

547
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,340
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

548
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:33,510
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

549
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,050
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

550
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,430
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

551
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,730
I’m sorry.

552
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,150
No, I’m sorry.

553
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,320
Why?

554
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,690
I was trying not to tell you.

555
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:55,910
What?

556
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:58,530
I’m dizzy and hungry.

557
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,040
All she's got is Nyquil and fucking Midol.

558
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,960
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

559
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,090
Whose fault was that?

560
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,590
This is impossible.

561
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,470
What's the plan now, hot rod?

562
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:18,260
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

563
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,140
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

564
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,230
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

565
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,810
Can you hear me okay?

566
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,690
I’m just dizzy, not deaf.

567
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,860
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

568
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,240
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

569
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,030
Let's check it again.

570
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,530
Mom, I did it.

571
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,790
We got to stay calm, okay?

572
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:47,080
If  we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

573
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,710
You're making me nervous.

574
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,580
I’m sorry.

575
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,750
What if I keep dropping?

576
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,880
You won't. I’ll figure something out.

577
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,180
You know, he's right.

578
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,390
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

579
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,060
What are you talking about?

580
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,310
I just got to be honest with myself here.

581
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,730
I don't need to be involved...

582
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:17,650
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

583
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,610
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

584
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:24,490
I don't need the fucking aggravation.
I’ll make an anonymous phone call.

585
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,750
They'll find the floor safe. I’ll inherit.

586
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,670
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

587
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,300
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

588
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,590
Fuck, I’ll still put away 8 or 9 hundred grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

589
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:43,510
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

590
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:46,180
Wait a minute.

591
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,350
Say what you just said again.

592
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,030
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

593
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:02,620
When? Before?

594
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,240
Yeah, before.

595
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:08,040
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

596
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,080
What are you doing?

597
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:15,170
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

598
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,920
So now you're a tax attorney.

599
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,850
-I'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

600
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:29,560
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

601
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,230
Where else?

602
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,810
Travel kit.

603
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,690
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

604
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,320
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

605
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,660
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

606
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,740
...so now I don't know what to think.

607
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,700
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

608
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,750
How much is in there?

609
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,380
Mouthwash.

610
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:58,210
Saccharin.

611
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,800
Hey, I’m talking to you. Answer me.

612
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,680
Fine. There's more.

613
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:09,520
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

614
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,020
It doesn't matter now.
It’s totally fucking moot!

615
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:15,980
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

616
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:18,520
How did you expect to get away with this?

617
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,730
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

618
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,150
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

619
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,950
What's the matter with you?

620
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,080
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

621
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,750
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

622
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:36,630
Your eyes were huge
when I told you about the gig...

623
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,130
...so don't play innocent.

624
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,710
Things didn't work out.

625
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:43,760
Play past it.

626
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,970
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:51,720
Mints? Sugar-free.

628
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:55,350
I’m opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

629
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,350
It’s looking doubtful there, big guy.

630
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,280
I will split the money with Raoul.
But I don't ever want to see you again.

631
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,110
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

632
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,450
...and we will fucking find you.

633
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,330
I’ll see you, Burnham.

634
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,830
Later, Raoul.

635
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,300
Mom!

636
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,350
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

637
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,650
...think you know all about it.

638
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,690
You don't know nothing about me.

639
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,740
Sarah, listen to me:

640
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:49,820
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

641
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:50,990
Okay.

642
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,040
You should see the look on your face.

643
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,710
What's happening?

644
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,300
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

645
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,760
Come here.

646
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,220
Come here.

647
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,220
-Don't shoot, please.
-Come on.

648
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:14,720
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

649
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,400
-Stop it, you fucking--
-Fucking what?

650
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,070
Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

651
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,410
Who's the clown now?

652
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,530
Me.

653
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,080
That's right.

654
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,370
It’s burning me.

655
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,870
Who's got the gun?

656
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:38,620
You.

657
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:40,880
Remember that.

658
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:44,090
Find out who the fuck that is.

659
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:49,380
Give me your wallet.

660
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,140
Give me your wallet.

661
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,600
Stephan Altman.

662
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:08,070
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

663
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,240
What did she say?

664
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,290
Don't know. Cut off.

665
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,120
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

666
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,460
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

667
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:29,970
No.

668
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:32,220
He's telling the truth.

669
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,510
Yeah.

670
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,390
Yeah, he probably is.

671
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,480
Because when I do this, people don't lie.

672
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,890
What?

673
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,440
-What do you want?
-Get us into that room.

674
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:45,980
-I can't.
-Yeah, you can.

675
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,990
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

676
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,110
You want me to just make something up?

677
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,370
You've got till the count of three.

678
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,950
Then you end up like Junior over there.

679
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:02,210
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

680
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,420
Two, squeeze.

681
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,130
I don't know what to tell you.

682
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:06,380
-Three.
-Wait!

683
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,210
Okay.

684
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,630
I got an idea.

685
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,310
Maybe.

686
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,850
Maybe.

687
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:24,440
Help! Rubber Soul...

688
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,150
...Yesterday and Today,
Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album....

689
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:31,530
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

690
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,950
Let It Be, Reviver, Sgt. pepper....

691
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:38,200
Oh, god!

692
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,660
Dad?

693
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:44,960
No, no.

694
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,850
Take it easy.

695
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,060
Open the door! Open the door!

696
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,940
No.

697
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,360
Don't open the door!

698
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,120
-Just make it look good.
-Don't you tell me what--

699
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,830
Open the door!

700
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,080
Don't open--

701
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:36,130
Knock it off!

702
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:39,350
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

703
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,400
Oh, god.

704
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,730
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

705
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,240
Lie down.

706
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,660
All right.

707
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,200
You'll be fine. Come on.

708
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,500
He's fucking crazy.

709
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,460
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

710
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,710
You're a strong girl.

711
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:14,210
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

712
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,720
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!

713
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:21,800
It’s almost over.

714
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,810
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

715
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,670
All right, turn around.

716
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,590
I’ll be right back.

717
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,970
It’s got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

718
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,170
Get your tapes.

719
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,490
Who's this?

720
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,330
It’s her kid.

721
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,250
What happened to her?

722
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,120
Who gives a fuck?

723
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,650
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

724
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,900
Hey, lady.

725
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:05,990
Mom?

726
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,830
What are you doing?

727
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:17,210
What are you doing?

728
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,680
We've got your kid.

729
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,640
Come down here.

730
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,480
Let's get this over with.

731
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:51,990
Get her, get her!

732
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,920
Shit!

733
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,560
What happened?

734
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,680
No! Let her out!

735
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,310
-Where's your gun?
-Open the door.

736
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,730
No!

737
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,780
-Where's your gun?
-I don't know.

738
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,450
Open up!

739
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:32,990
Open it.

740
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,750
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

741
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,380
She's got your gun!

742
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,500
Stop screaming. Stop it.

743
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,320
I know you've got the gun.

744
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:11,240
put the gun down
and step away from the door.

745
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,120
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

746
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:20,290
She needs an injection.

747
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:22,670
Do you hear me?

748
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,330
Open the door so I can give her a shot.

749
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,960
Or I swear to God, I’ll kill you both.

750
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,840
lf I open the door, you'll shoot us.

751
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:36,140
So give her the shot yourself.

752
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,310
Give her the shot!

753
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,030
Do you need this?

754
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,870
Can you do this yourself?

755
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,580
What happens if you don't get it?

756
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,380
Coma.

757
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:11,960
Die.

758
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,140
Fuck! Open it.

759
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,520
put the gun on the floor.
And go all the way downstairs.

760
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:29,150
And I'll give her the shot, all right?

761
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,040
I told you to leave the gun!

762
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:52,670
Shit.

763
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,900
You fucking bitch!

764
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:20,450
If you pull any shit like that again,
I will fucking kill her.

765
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:22,240
Do you hear me?

766
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,660
lf you step outside, I’ll kill her!

767
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:32,840
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'll cut her fucking throat!

768
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,920
Do you understand?

769
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:41,890
Yes.

770
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,730
But please, just give her the shot.

771
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,560
Please.

772
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,070
please.

773
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,030
Don't fucking do it.

774
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:02,030
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

775
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,120
Are you going to open the safe?

776
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:11,500
Don't you look at me.

777
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,720
All I know about this is what I see on TV.

778
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,770
You got to talk me through this.

779
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,150
This right here?

780
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,400
It’s this?

781
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,330
Yeah, okay.

782
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,380
Nice house you guys got.

783
01:22:58,090 --> 01:22:59,630
Your mom's rich.

784
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,550
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

785
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:20,400
Tap it.

786
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:39,590
I wish I could have put my kid in
a place like this.

787
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,510
It’s not that I didn't try.

788
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,350
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

789
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,310
Done.

790
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,060
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

791
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,940
He had it all worked out.

792
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:00,820
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

793
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,820
Thanks...

794
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,240
...Burnham.

795
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:15,040
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

796
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,210
She's going to be okay.

797
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,550
I gave her the shot. She's all right.

798
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,840
It'll be over soon.

799
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:45,870
Stephan.

800
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,090
Oh, my god.

801
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,880
Can you move?

802
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,300
Not much. I think my arm is broken.

803
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,950
Raise your arm.

804
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,330
Come on, raise your arm.

805
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:43,850
Try again.

806
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,560
Come on. Try again.

807
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,360
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

808
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:57,190
They're going to kill us.

809
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:00,110
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

810
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:03,030
Stephan, they'll kill her.

811
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,760
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

812
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,340
The police.

813
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,720
You called the police?

814
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,640
Of course, I called them.

815
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,770
You scared the shit out of me.

816
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:29,430
She killed the kid.

817
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,690
She just killed her own kid.

818
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,190
All right, take this.

819
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,860
Don't say a word.

820
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:45,030
No, her husband must have called them.

821
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,910
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!

822
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,870
Where is she?

823
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,090
There.

824
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,920
What the fuck's she doing?

825
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,270
She's going to handle it.

826
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,410
I’m just trying to unlock....

827
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,660
-Is everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

828
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:36,960
What are you.... What time is it?

829
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:40,340
It’s a little after 4:00 a.m.

830
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,260
We got a call, ma'am.

831
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:44,930
Somebody called you?

832
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,970
Can we come in?

833
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:49,640
What do you want?

834
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,930
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

835
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,310
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

836
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,270
I’m fine.

837
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:00,530
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

838
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:12,410
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

839
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,630
Come on, I’m freezing out here.

840
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,840
''There are three.''

841
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,220
What?

842
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,590
Your husband said you called for help.

843
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,600
That you said, ''There are three''
right before you got cut off.

844
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,850
Oh, that phone call.

845
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,310
And your neighbors...

846
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,190
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

847
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,990
That was the TV. It’s off now.

848
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:52,950
Can I just ask you one question?

849
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:56,370
What was the end of that sentence?

850
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:01,500
When you said, ''There are three''...

851
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,170
...what was the rest?

852
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:09,800
Look....

853
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,680
My husband and I just split up...

854
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:19,730
...and it's my first night in a new house...

855
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:23,320
...and I admit I was a little drunk.

856
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:28,070
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

857
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,780
...was going to be:

858
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,750
''There are three things that I’ll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me.''

859
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:46,590
Thank God I came to my senses
before I said all that, and I hung up...

860
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:50,390
...so nobody would ever have to know
what I was thinking.

861
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,930
Unless, of course...

862
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,520
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

863
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,610
So, Rick, you want to go?

864
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,980
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

865
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,410
All right.

866
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,740
Ma'am...

867
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:19,040
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

868
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,790
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

869
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:29,300
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

870
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:32,800
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

871
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,140
Something like that.

872
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,310
That's something you could do safely.

873
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,120
Man...

874
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:57,370
...you guys are good.

875
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,790
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

876
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,300
They really train you guys.

877
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,720
No, I’m fine. I’m fine. Cross my heart.

878
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,520
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

879
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,690
'Night, ma'am.

880
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:43,420
This kid has seen my face.

881
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,250
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

882
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,420
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

883
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:51,670
You're on the hook, too.

884
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,800
Do one. Same price for the rest.

885
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,560
Stay the fuck away from me.

886
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,560
You know how this is going to end.

887
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,600
Goddamn!

888
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,600
What's up?

889
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:17,150
Why the hell didn't we do that?

890
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,450
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

891
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:30,500
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

892
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,090
Just let me drill, man.

893
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,860
Empty?

894
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:23,400
Come on, man.

895
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,230
Bank bonds.

896
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:56,520
One second.

897
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,730
Two, three, four, five....

898
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:03,320
Why are we doing this?

899
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,990
Because it's going to come to that.

900
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,660
There are 22.

901
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,750
22 million dollars.

902
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,580
That lying little shit!

903
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:20,750
Let's get out of here.

904
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,340
Lift.

905
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:39,440
Leave that. Christ, I’ll buy you new tools.

906
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,650
You'll be okay.

907
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:24,420
It’s glass. I got you. Come on.

908
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,300
Hurry up.

909
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,260
Watch the glass.

910
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:15,860
Get down here.

911
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:19,030
Wait.

912
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:22,240
Wait. You don't want to do that.

913
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,910
Dad, don't shoot him!

914
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:28,130
Let my daughter go.

915
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:30,630
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

916
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:35,880
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.

917
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,050
Let her go.

918
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:42,390
Okay.

919
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,100
It’s okay.

920
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:46,980
Let's go.

921
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,110
Let's go.

922
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:05,750
Just let her go. Let her go.

923
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,080
Let go of her!

924
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,960
Put that gun down.

925
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,000
-Sarah, come here.
-Put that gun down!

926
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:11,750
-Sarah, come here.
-Put that gun down!

927
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,670
-Do as I say.
-Don't be crazy, man.

928
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:17,170
-Just let her go.
-Let her go!

929
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,570
Are you okay?

930
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,530
-Did they hurt you?
-No.

931
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:42,660
-Did they touch you?
-No.

932
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:52,500
Stephan, shoot him. Shoot him!

933
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:53,400
Get off her!

934
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:35,730
You'll be okay now.

935
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:46,700
-Police!
-Don't move!

936
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:49,330
-Nobody move!
-Everybody on the ground!

937

Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.

938
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:55,370
Are you okay?

939
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,380
Are you all right?

940
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:04,220
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

941
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,340
Don't move! I will kill you!

942
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,140
Move away from the wall!

943
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:12,220
Get off the fence! Move!

944
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,190
Put your hands in the air!

945
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,520
lt'll be okay. It’s fine, Dad.

946
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,820
Is there anybody else in the house?

947
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,150
No.

948
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:30,410
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.

949

It’s okay. I’m all right.

950
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:46,550
I want to see the palms of your hands!

951
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:50,050
Do you hear me? Open your hands!

952
01:46:02,110 --> 01:46:05,650
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.

953
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:07,900
Everything is going to be fine.

954
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,690
