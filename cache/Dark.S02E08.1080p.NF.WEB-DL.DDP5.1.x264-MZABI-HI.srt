I didn't want any of this, Martha.

I'm still here 'cause of you.

Jonas will come back.
Everything will happen as it always has.

that I can still change things.

you won't leave this bunker for anything.

- Is Clausen here?
- No.

191
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:08,213
Clausen had Aleksander arrested
and got a search warrant for the plant.

He's on his way there.

At the... nuclear facility...

Aleksander buried something
in the concrete.

Radioactive waste.

- Jonas was found?

No, he traveled here from the future.

It hasn't been used since the '90s.

I'm going to have a look.

Even if I told you, it can't happen.

You don't want him to come back.

Because my future already exists.

00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:58,213
[Bartosz] Do you think she's with him?

334
00:30:58,296 --> 00:30:59,463
With Jonas?

335
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:03,505
Noah was right.
He was right about everything.

336
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:08,005
I'm telling you guys,
Jonas is the reason for this shit.

337
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,630
[Claudia] Where are we going?

338
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:37,921
Bring the machine to the bunker,
near Helge's cabin.

339
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:40,921
You don't have much time.

340
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:43,505
And you?

341
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:49,546
I have my mother to find.

342
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,630
And Martha.

343
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,213
Jonas!

344
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,421
TWO HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

345
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:11,463
[Magnus] Hey, Martha, call me back.

346
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,796
They're both not answering.

347
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:18,088
[cell phone chimes]

348
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,005
My father.
He's with Elisabeth in the bunker.

349
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:32,505
- He wants me to go there.
- To the bunker?

350
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,255
[Bartosz] Shit.

351
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,463
Something's going on.

352
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,338
I'm going.

353
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,005
If they're not home in half an hour
we'll go join your dad.

354
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,838
Where are Mom and Franziska?

355
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,796
I have no idea.

356
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,921
[Wöller] So this Noah guy says
he's your father

357
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:13,630
and he's from the future...
or, no, the past.

358
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:17,463
And he says the apocalypse
starts in Winden today?

359
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:21,171
And you think this is all connected
to the containers in there?

360
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,588
[mysterious music]

361
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,796
[door slams shut]

362
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,546
- [Clausen] What is that?
- The cooling pool of the old reactor.

363
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:56,505
Apparently it's been sealed off
and become part of the greenfield.

364
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:57,671
When?

365
00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:59,755
That, um...

366
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:04,213
I don't exactly know,
but that's nothing unusual.

367
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:08,755
Sealing off the old reactor is a...
It's the start of the dismantling.

368
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,588
I want you to break it open.

369
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,005
Really?

370
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,171
Yes.

371
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:20,255
[Regina] You can't keep him another night.

372
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,463
He hasn't done anything.
This is all nonsense.

373
00:34:29,255 --> 00:34:31,463
When can Aleksander be visited?

374
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,546
I understand.

375
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:43,505
Regina.

376
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,005
[threatening music]

377
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,255
Please don't be scared.

378
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:08,963
It really is me.

379
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,088
I am so sorry.

380
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,463
I didn't mean to just leave like that.

381
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,630
I'll explain.

382
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,921
But now you have to come with me.

383
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,630
- Regina.
- [crying softly]

384
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:50,921
I'm so sorry.

385
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:56,463
[sobbing]

[ominous music]

389
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:22,130
Noah.

390
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,338
You look different now.

391
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:28,546
You know, I mean, since last time.

392
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,671
He sent you, didn't he?

393
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:33,671
Adam.

394
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:37,463
I've always wondered
when you turn into him.

395
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:39,213
I won't.

396
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,671
I will never do the things he did.

397
00:36:43,296 --> 00:36:45,421
He said you'd say that kind of thing.

398
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,963
He also said we'd be friends.

399
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,630
Before I'm betrayed.

400
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,796
Why do you follow him?

401
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,296
What made you follow her?

402
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,755
Claudia.

403
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,505
We both want to believe.

404
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:10,005
We fasten ourselves
to the salvation that's promised.

405
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:14,713
If you kill him...

406
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,630
you kill all hope of salvation.

407
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:24,130
He is the savior.

408
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:30,630
You'll be the savior.

409
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,505
[dismal music]

410
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:41,963
What is that?

411
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:43,421
Read it.

412
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,671
It's from Martha.

413
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:07,838
[quietly] This can't be real.

414
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,505
You must save her.

415
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:13,213
Bartosz, Magnus

416
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,255
and Franziska.

417
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,088
And later, me and Agnes.

418
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,463
This circuit has to be finished
for the next cycle to begin.

419
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,713
Just as the prophecy foretells.

420
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,505
And so that Martha can live.

421
00:38:30,713 --> 00:38:32,713
[breathing heavily]

422
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,755
No, this isn't right.

423
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,671
Martha.

424
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,921

[footsteps descending stairs]

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,130
[Peter] Regina.

433
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,838
That's you.

434
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:55,338
You are Claudia.

435
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:57,255
[tinny beats, dismal music]

[dark, suspenseful music]

00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:18,130
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

[suspenseful music]

439
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,880
Your colleague's in the old reactor.

[suspenseful music fades]

441
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,630
Mom?

442
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,088
Jonas?

443
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:49,546
You're back.

444
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:54,588
You're really back.

445
00:42:58,796 --> 00:43:00,463
I was looking for you.

446
00:43:03,338 --> 00:43:06,671
- I'm here to tell you...
- I know it... all.

447
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,088
When we were standing in the rain,
I know why you said that.

448
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,546
Mikkel...

449
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,255
I know everything.

450
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:18,588
At the lake, that was you.

451
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:50,546
You and I are perfect for each other.

452
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,713
Never believe anything else.

[soft music]

454
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:19,505
[Adam] And so the circle is closed.

455
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:23,630
[Martha] Jonas, who is that?

456
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,796
Tell her who I am.

457
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,755
I told you all the game's pieces
are in position already.

458
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,796
All that's needed is a little push.

459
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,546
You keep lying!

460
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:47,463
You wanted it all the exact same way.

461
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:49,380
You're the trigger!

462
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,421
The trigger is in us all.

463
00:44:52,296 --> 00:44:54,088
Each and every one of us.

464
00:44:55,046 --> 00:44:56,755
Why do you want this?

465
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,505
Why do you want the awful future repeated?

466
00:45:01,588 --> 00:45:03,963
What is created today

467
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:05,671
will begin the end.

468
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:09,505
The dark matter must be created

469
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:13,046
so that I can lead it to its destiny
in the future.

470
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,380
The end of this world.

471
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:20,005
And I am the trigger,

472
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:24,463
just not for what you think.

473
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,713
I am the trigger for...

474
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:33,338
only what will make you

475
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:35,755
what I am today.

[Martha gasping]

479
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,713
[Jonas] You'll be all right.
You'll be all right. You'll be all right.

480
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:00,838
Some pain you can't forget.

481
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:02,838
[Jonas weeps] Mar...

482
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,755
- You'll carry this pain all your life.
- Look at me! Look at me!

483
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:12,421
Until you are finally ready

484
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:15,130
to let go.

485
00:46:19,796 --> 00:46:20,796
Of her.

486
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:33,088
You can stop me.

487
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,755
Or you can try to save her.

488
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:47,421
You'll know what you have to do.

489
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,421
Please don't leave.

490
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,005
Martha.

491
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:02,046
Please. [crying softly]

492
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:05,213
Please don't go.

[Charlotte] Don't open that! Stop.

00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,338
Don't open that!

497
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:24,255
This is a hazard.

498
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:27,005
No, Mrs. Doppler. This is our elephant.

499
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:29,796
You have no idea what this all really is.
