1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,404
There's a war coming. A terrible war.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,166
There will be chaos,
rivers of blood in the streets.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,687
I know it. I can see it coming.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,407
It's time. Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,767
Hello, James, old friend.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,084
Mooney, the MCU cops,
none of them know Penguin's alive.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,244
- If they did, I'd be dead.
- James Gordon is not a good guy.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,528
He framed Mario
for the murder of the Waynes.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,564
James Gordon is
the most honest man I've ever met.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,280
This is not a city or a job for nice guys.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,166
- You're a cynic. Slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.
- You're probably right.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,084
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,084
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,084
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,082
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,242
<i>Gotham still held in a grip of terror...</i>

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,890
<i>as the mysterious masked killer...</i>

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,123
<i>...known as the Spirit of the Goat
remains on the loose.</i>

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,448
<i>But Gotham's Goat
hasn't cast his shadow...</i>

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,086
<i>...over Thomas
and Martha Wayne's celebration...</i>

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,483
<i>...of beloved son Bruce Wayne's
third birthday.</i>

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,482
<i>The Wayne family opened their home
to the children of the city orphanage...</i>

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,041
<i>- ...to share in the joyous day...</i>
- Shelly.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,964
- Aah!
- Shh, Shh, shh.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,641
That's the van registered
to Randall Milkie.

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,247
- We were right, Dix.
- Of course we're right.

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,001
Dispatch, Detective Dix...

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,805
...requesting backup
at 1100 Cannery Drive.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,651
<i>- Roger. On your...</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,964
- Come on, man. We gotta get in there.
- Wait a second. Listen to me. Wait a minute.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,606
Listen to me.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,364
Randall thinks he's the reincarnation
of some ancient murdering goat spirit.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,126
- We are waiting for backup.
- He's got Shelly Lawson.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,051
If he kills her,
that's three people we lost to this maniac.

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,808
Gotham's golden rule, Harvey: No heroes.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,840
Son of a bitch.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,891
- Idiot, she's already dead.
- You don't know that.

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,408
Yeah. I know it.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,723
I told you.

40
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,691
- Shelly.
- I told you she'd be cold.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,360
She's been here half of the night.

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,761
Wait a minute. New candles, barely melted.

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,408
Just lit.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,080
That's great. That's great news.

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,084
Randall Milkie, you're under arrest...

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,808
...for the murders of Shelly Lawson,
Daniel Tremont and Edward Talbot.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,286
Randall, be smart.

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,091
Come out of there,
or we're gonna have to blow you away.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,285
Randall Milkie is undone. Gone.

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,006
This body is moved
by the Spirit of the Goat.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,531
Ah, we're gonna go with Milkie.
I already did the paperwork.

52
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,446
Dix!

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,809
You can never stop the Goat.

54
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,050
This body may fail, but I will not.

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,403
I will always come back.
I will always come back.

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,840
Come back from this.

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,930
Milkie.

58
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,686
Dix!

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,761
Dix.

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,008
Talk to me. Talk to me.

61
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,647
Dix, come on. Come on. Dix. Help!

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,048
We got an officer down!
We need help, now!

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,650
Detective Bullock.

64
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,122
- Detective Bullock, do you give up?
- What?

65
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,410
My riddle. A man has to cross the river
with a wolf, a cabbage and a goat.

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,968
Ed, please, what's the time of death?

67
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,726
Examiner pegs it at just before 3 a.m.
this morning.

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,601
He's a bit eager with his coagulation
marker, so I'd put it at closer to 1.

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,041
Killer left her identification for us.
Amanda Hastings, 21 years old.

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,049
- She comes from money.
- Mm-hm.

71
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,522
- Guessing she was the oldest in her family.
- Why is that?

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,161
The Goat always kills the firstborn.

73
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,407
It's all the same.

74
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,008
Same MO, same victim choice,
presentation, it's all the same.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,328
We got a copycat.

76
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,767
- You all right, detective?
- No, I'm not all right.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,241
I already solved this case.

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,681
- Where's Gordon?
- Apparently, he's not answering his phone.

79
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,609
He's not answering his...?

80
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,728
You mean I'm on the clock
before the Boy Scout?

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,360
- Mm-hm.
- This is frigging ridiculous.

82
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,760
Fine, I'll tell you the answer.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,446
The man crosses the river
with the wolf and the cabbage.

84
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,286
- He leaves the wolf, goes back with the cab--
- Ed.

85
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,601
- I'm not apologizing for my past.
- I'm not asking you to.

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,928
- You're not listening.
- No, you're not listening.

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,602
- I'm not asking you to walk away from this.
- Really? It sounds like you are.

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,805
And we keep going around and around, and
I keep telling you I don't have a choice.

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,964
Barbara...

90
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,931
This city, the law, the crime here, they're
all twisted up in each other like a maze.

91
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,242
I came here to be a cop...

92
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,891
...but the city needs something else.

93
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,250
It's okay. I understand.

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,486
I'm just asking for one thing.

95
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,682
Half of what you have to carry.

96
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,282
God knows I've dumped my half on you,
and you carry it.

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,482
What I'm dealing with, it's so dangerous.

98
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,731
Half of what you carry.

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,166
If you think I care about the risk,
then you're forgetting who I am.

100
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,844
I swear I'm not.

101
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,169
Are we okay?

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,240
Are we still fighting?

103
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,806
We're negotiating terms.

104
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,769
Hmm.

105
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,125
That's not good for me.

106
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,971
You tell me what you're up against...

107
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,041
...okay?

108
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,841
You let me in.

109
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,524
Then we're okay.

110
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,043
- That's work again.
- Yep.

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,565
I'll tell you everything.

112
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,163
Everything I can.

113
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,681
Okay? I'll make it right.

114
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,844
Okay.

115
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,644
Right there.

116
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,842
We've been canvassing this waterfront
for days, Monty.

117
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,361
None of these river rats are gonna help us.

118
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,565
If we don't get a lead in the next
24 hours, MCU is dropping this.

119
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,926
Hey.

120
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,523
I'm on the disability six months.
Where do you expect me to go?

121
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,042
I'm not flushing you, old-timer, okay?
Just wanna ask you some questions.

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,050
About a shooting that took place
on that pier back there.

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,163
A shooting? Yeah.

124
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,889
- I saw it good.
- Okay. Great.

125
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,924
- You ever see this man?
- That was the man did the shooting.

126
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,764
Cold customer, ice water in the veins.

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,807
We got the son of a bitch.

128
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,929
We got Gordon.

129
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,090
- Gotham Goat?
- A wannabe.

130
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,729
For a copycat, the copy is, uh,
downright creepy, is what it is.

131
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,400
- You moonlighting or something?
- Huh? Me?

132
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,922
Yeah, because you're late,
and you look like crap warmed over.

133
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,646
- Write me up if you want.
- Screw you, Boy Scout.

134
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,601
- You're in a good mood.
- I'm in a déjà vu acid flashback.

135
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,962
Someone's hunting the kids
of Gotham's 1 percent.

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,766
The press will have a field day.
City turns upside down.

137
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,884
The whole thing's gonna come down
on the G.C.P.D. like a ton of bricks.

138
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,009
Let's catch him quick.

139
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,803
I'm guessing the killer knew
the victim, Amanda Hastings, somehow.

140
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,681
We'll go see the family, see if we can try
to get something we can work with.

141
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,763
Hey, Nygma.

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,487
Let me know when they're set up
for the autopsy.

143
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,526
- Anything in particular you want me to--?
- Just call me.

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,367
You see, the strange thing,
and the horrible thing...

145
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,410
...is that I've been having the same dream
for weeks...

146
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,888
...of a dark overbearing presence.

147
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,488
Mr. Hastings, about your daughter,
and we know that this is difficult...

148
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,048
...but did she have anyone in her life
that worried you?

149
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,603
- Anyone who might have wished her harm?
- Everybody loved my Amanda.

150
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,731
Mr. Hastings, are you all right?

151
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,202
Robert, if you need to take a moment,
I'm sure it will be all right.

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,528
Absolutely.

153
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,124
Come on.

154
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,370
I know you gentlemen
are working against the clock...

155
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,406
...but I'm afraid Mr. and Mrs. Hastings
might not be ready for this.

156
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,689
I can see that. And you are
the Hastings' therapist, Dr. Marks?

157
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,084
Yes. I treat mostly Mr. Hastings,
but we've had many family sessions.

158
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,770
Mr. Hastings has a very delicate nature.

159
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,440
He's not capable
of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

160
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,081
No one's capable of dealing
with this kind of tragedy.

161
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,526
It's a freight train.

162
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,566
It runs you over,
and you try to pick up what's left.

163
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,405
You don't believe in treatment.

164
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,524
I believe in the tranquilizers
you clobbered Mrs. Hastings with.

165
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,768
- If you're giving out samples...
- Okay. Uh...

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,209
- Detective, maybe we should, uh...
- Yeah, you're right, we should.

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,970
Excuse me.

168
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,282
- Thank you, doctor.
- Mm-hm.

169
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,361
Uh-huh. All right, got it.

170
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,281
And got it. Yes, sir, I'll
bring those files right away.

171
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,365
- Mr. Nygma.
- Hello, Miss Kringle.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,130
I'm just looking for all the information you
have on the Goat murders from 10 years ago.

173
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,291
Don't you find it curious...

174
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,929
...why someone would resurrect the myth
of a centuries-old bogeyman?

175
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,250
What is it about the Goat that has made
two people decide to kill in his name?

176
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,727
No, I don't find it curious.

177
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,924
- I think I would like your parents.
- Excuse me?

178
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,164
Kringle. Such a rare surname.

179
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,449
Most people changed it generations ago
out of embarrassment.

180
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,850
Not only did your parents keep it,
they called you Kristin.

181
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,522
Kristin Kringle. Ha, ha.

182
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,162
They must be very humorous people.
Humor is so important, don't you think?

183
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,971
Remember,
you have to sign out any evidence you pull.

184
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,970
How do you find anything at all in here?

185
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,845
I mean, organizationally speaking,
this place is a shambles.

186
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,605
I am warning you, Nygma.

187
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,924
I have this as exactly as I want it.
I know where everything is.

188
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,363
- Understand?
- Preternaturally.

189
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,289
But...

190
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,604
...I can help you, Kristin Kringle.

191
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,045
I doubt that very much.

192
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,322
There is a much better way to do this.

193
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,811
Amanda Hastings was last seen
entering this building Tuesday midnight.

194
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,161
That's about 36 hours ago.

195
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,322
You think she was abducted from here?

196
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,040
I don't know.
It was Milkie's MO 10 years ago.

197
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,726
He took each one of the victims
from their homes.

198
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,363
- But CSI found no signs of a break-in.
- They didn't with Randall either.

199
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,006
He worked for an air-conditioning
maintenance crew...

200
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,850
...that covered all three buildings.

201
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,246
He had keys?

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,201
He had keys.

203
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,406
This is Detective Gordon.

204
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,843
I need the employee list of every
maintenance and janitorial company...

205
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,401
...with access to the Hastings' building.

206
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,682
Yeah, I'll tell him.

207
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,242
They're ready for the autopsy.

208
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,767
Mother!

209
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,402
Away for so long,
and now he scratches at the door...

210
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,602
...the filthy tomcat.

211
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,771
Hi, Mom. I'm alive.

212
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,284
Why you always think I'm running off
with some painted lady?

213
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,568
- I don't even date.
- Ha!

214
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,721
Why you don't call your mother
in all this time? I tell you why.

215
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,282
You got tangled
in some hussy's demon purse.

216
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,443
Mother, there was no hussy.

217
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,923
Only betrayal and savagery and...

218
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,246
All I wanted was a little respect.

219
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,283
And they hurt me so cruelly.

220
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,042
- Oh. There was no other woman?
- Heh-heh-heh.

221
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,925
I have been to hell and back.
They tried to kill me.

222
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,967
The bullies again. My poor, poor darling.

223
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,610
They only do these things
because they resent you.

224
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,289
Envy and spite...

225
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,801
...that's all it is.

226
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,088
You watch, Ma.

227
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,244
I'm gonna be somebody in this town.

228
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,764
I always knew this.

229
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,600
The victim was asphyxiated,
likely with ether or chloroform.

230
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,531
Look under the scalp.

231
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,921
Humor me.

232
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,765
At the base of the skull, there'd
be an incision about an inch long...

233
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,281
...sewn closed.

234
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,811
Wait a minute.

235
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,367
Yes. How did I miss that?

236
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,844
An incision stitched closed
near the occipital.

237
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,202
Over a foreign object.

238
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,047
- What is it?
- It's a penny.

239
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,848
He's right.

240
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,204
- A penny?
- I know Milkie's MO.

241
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,042
No one could know that detail.

242
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,249
It isn't a copycat.

243
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,045
It can't be.

244
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,885
Ten years ago Randall Milkie took an
1813 Liberty penny just like this one...

245
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,646
...and sewed it into the heads
of each of his victims.

246
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,251
Why?

247
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,370
How the hell do I know?
He bum-rushed me wearing animal horns.

248
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,565
- I shot him. We didn't talk coin collecting.
- You're sure no one else found this out?

249
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,929
Milkie was the definition of a loner.
He didn't tell anybody.

250
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,402
- We left it out of the file intentionally.
- Suppressed evidence.

251
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,607
We Easter-egged it.

252
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,764
A killer like the Goat had a good chance
of drawing admirers.

253
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,684
Yeah, it's copycat porn.

254
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,562
We left out this one detail. The coins.
It never hit the papers.

255
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,922
How the hell did this copy-Goat know
about this?

256
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,880
Okay, so you hid it,
but the medical examiner, he had to know.

257
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,085
Ed Hayes, yeah, sure. But he
died of cirrhosis. That just leaves me.

258
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,771
And Dix.

259
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,446
- Captain, please, there's no reason--
- Go talk to him.

260
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,001
Make sure he didn't tell anyone
about the coins.

261
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,924
Hell, see if he's got any ideas.

262
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,087
<i>I'm Lacey White,
and this is the Gotham Seven Goatwatch.</i>

263
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,762
<i>Tonight, Gotham's wealthiest 1 percent
rest fitfully.</i> ..

264
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,248
<i>...under a copycat killer's deadly shadow.</i>

265
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,082
<i>And if you happen to be one of the city's
high-society silver spoons...</i>

266
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,966
<i>...then you're probably headed to the
Swiss Alps right now and away from...</i>

267
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,966
- They've got them all running like rabbits.
- Yeah.

268
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,249
I don't know why he chose an ungulate
for his totem...

269
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,249
...but he does know how to scare them.

270
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,968
You do realize you happen to be
one of them, don't you, Master Bruce?

271
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,403
Yeah, a firstborn son of Gotham's rich
and powerful.

272
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,410
I don't know, maybe we
should leave town for a little bit.

273
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,967
Pop down to the lake house.
You like it there.

274
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,162
I'm not going anywhere.

275
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,488
I have work to do.

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,128
Besides...

277
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,243
...why would the Goat take me?

278
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,124
There's no one to take me from.

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,970
- Oh, my God.
- I'm improving your system.

280
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,210
Implementing a rhizomatic cross index, with
your case files classified by subject...

281
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,643
...but arranged more like the way
a peat-moss organism grows.

282
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,649
You know, laterally.

283
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,687
- I had this entire room organized.
- Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic. Lateral.

284
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,691
What did I ever do to you, Nygma?

285
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,130
What did I do that compels you to come here
with your endless suggestions and riddles?

286
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,722
My god, the riddles.
Are you trying to get me to quit?

287
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,371
- You can't want my job.
- No, no, no. I want you.

288
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,649
To keep your job and to have it here...

289
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,047
...for working.

290
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,244
Okay.

291
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,241
I'm getting a sense
that this was somehow inappropriate.

292
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,881
You are so odd.

293
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,570
I'll just take my nonhierarchical data
paradigms out of your hair...

294
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,323
...and leave you to your work.

295
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,770
How long has it been
since you've seen this guy?

296
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,090
Bullock, I know what happened.
Anybody in your situation--

297
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,601
Listen. You think you can shrink my head,
Boy Scout?

298
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,367
You can't. This is the black box, man.
And we don't open the black box, ever.

299
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,608
- Okay, fine.
- Why don't you sit your ass down?

300
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,842
I'll be back in a few minutes.

301
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,286
We're both on this case.

302
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,207
- Dix.
- Hey. What do we have here?

303
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,247
Harvey Bullock, boy detective.

304
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,290
Look at you up there, huh,
living the high life?

305
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,010
And me down here,
all broken up with a busted liver.

306
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,723
Don't put that on me, old man. Your
bum liver's between you and the bottle.

307
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,323
I just busted up your gams
and put you in that chair.

308
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,285
Gotham's golden rule:

309
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,246
- No heroes, Bullock.
- No heroes.

310
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,408
Listen, Dix,
we have to talk about the case.

311
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,926
About the Goat.

312
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,327
I was wondering
when you would ask for my help.

313
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,241
- I'm not asking for your help.
- That don't mean you don't need it.

314
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,681
Who's this? Your partner?

315
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,526
- James Gordon. Nice to meet you.
- Come on, Dix.

316
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,809
Did you ever tell anyone about
Randall Milkie? The Liberty pennies?

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,843
We said we weren't going to.
We sealed them.

318
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,843
I know we sealed them, you jackass.

319
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,365
I told you to seal them.

320
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,331
Okay, but this new killer's
doing the same thing.

321
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,091
He's stitching up coins
in the heads of his victims.

322
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,203
Any idea how he came up with that?

323
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,007
I didn't tell anybody.

324
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,884
Ed Hayes didn't tell nobody.

325
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,690
And you didn't tell nobody.

326
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,329
- So, what the hell does that mean?
- It means we were wrong about Milkie.

327
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,444
- He was not working alone.
- No.

328
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,889
Mm-hm.
You do not have a copycat killer here.

329
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,890
You do not have a lone killer.

330
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,003
What you have...

331
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,210
...is a conspiracy.

332
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,724
A conspiracy to hang rich kids
off local historical landmarks?

333
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,723
Yeah, right.

334
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,051
He always thinks he's the smartest one
in the room.

335
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,605
I know, right?

336
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,608
That's because I'm always in a room
full of idiots.

337
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,727
Watch out for him.

338
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,166
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- He's a loose cannon.

339
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,762
He thinks he's a white knight,
jumping into the breach...

340
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,763
...like some idiot in the movies.

341
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,764
We talking about Bullock here?

342
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,847
- We're talking about Bullock here.
- Harvey Bullock?

343
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,168
Harvey Bullock.

344
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,842
Detective Bullock, do you wanna settle
the bill or should we send it to you?

345
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,929
You can just put it in the mail, thanks.

346
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,449
- Is he getting those magazines I ordered?
- Those are awful magazines, detective.

347
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,287
- But he's getting them?
- Yes, he is.

348
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,284
Good.

349
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,770
Thank you.

350
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,290
No, Mom, I'm just grabbing a few things.
Yes. Yes, I know.

351
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,410
I'll be at the marina at 9. Okay.

352
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,450
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Anita.

353
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,121
Will you put
some snack stuff together, please?

354
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,845
Miss Ember?

355
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,527
Anita, have you seen the tops
to my yellow silk...?

356
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,489
Anita?

357
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,127
Ember Copley was supposed to meet
her parents tonight at 9:00 at the marina.

358
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,961
When she didn't show, they came back,
found the maid out cold, Ember gone.

359
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,288
- You think it's our guy?
<i>- It's our guy.</i>

360
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,370
He slips in, chloroforms the maid,
grabs Ember.

361
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,690
- No sign of B and E, nothing, like a ghost.
- Like he had keys.

362
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,120
<i>Randall Milkie had a ritual.</i>

363
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,166
Dress the victims, kill them, do his
coin trick. Whole thing took eight hours.

364
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,724
If our copy-Goat's doing the same thing,
we're running out of time.

365
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,885
I pulled the employee list from the agencies
that do maintenance on Copley's building.

366
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,687
Looking for an employee that had access
to both victims' apartments.

367
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,565
- That's a lot of people.
<i>- Yeah, but our guy's been busy.</i>

368
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,406
He had to have called in sick
the last couple days.

369
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,723
Get Nygma in there.
He's freaky good with puzzles.

370
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,570
<i>You got it.</i>

371
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,001
- Renee, we have to talk.
- What are you doing here?

372
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,091
I know you think he's done terrible things,
but I also know you care about the truth.

373
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,521
You shouldn't be here.
You shouldn't be seen here.

374
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,921
Damn it, Renee, will you listen to me?

375
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,691
I'll work with you, okay? I will tell you
whatever I know, whatever I can find out.

376
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,044
- I need you to keep an open mind, okay?
- It's too late for that.

377
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,567
Whatever's happening,
you've got it wrong, Renee.

378
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,606
He can't tell me, but it isn't what
you think. He's trying to protect me.

379
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,366
He won't tell me who's out there,
who he's afraid of.

380
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,721
He's right not to.

381
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,930
- Wait, why?
- Because it'll get you killed. Okay?

382
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,682
You understand?
What he knows, who he knows, will kill you.

383
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,801
We got a judge issuing a warrant tonight.

384
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,445
You know how much I care about you.
When Gordon gets arrested, get out of here.

385
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,965
If Jim gets arrested, then this is exactly
where I have to be, by his side.

386
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,728
Please, just leave.
Get out of Gotham just till this is over.

387
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,445
And don't come to me again.

388
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,927
So four guys have called in sick
since last week.

389
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,607
The suspects from the outer boroughs
are cleared, another is out of state...

390
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,962
...but apparently, it's unconfirmed, so...

391
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,482
- So that leaves one last guy.
- Raymond Earl.

392
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,085
Shift supervisor says
he's been squatting in a place...

393
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,004
...near Cannery Park
around the 1100 block.

394
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,685
- That's him.
- You sure?

395
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,928
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm 100 percent sure.

396
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,051
Déjà voodoo all day long.

397
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,002
This is where we got Randall Milkie
10 years ago.

398
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,202
This is where Dix fell.

399
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,171
Bullock.

400
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,008
- Gotta go in. Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,130
We're going to put you to sleep
for good now.

402
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,928
You're lucky to be the sacrifice.

403
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,081
Go get her.

404
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,604
It's okay. You're safe.

405
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,126
You all right? Okay.

406
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,726
You'll never stop the Goat.

407
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,122
- I will always come back.
- Quit saying that.

408
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,561
Raymond Earl, you're under arrest.

409
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,764
Not bad.

410
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,604
All right.

411
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,364
All right.

412
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,366
Your suit is ready.

413
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,689
- I steamed it nice.
- Thanks, Mom.

414
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,808
Mm-hm.

415
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,246
I'm worried for you.

416
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,245
So anxious you look.

417
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,085
These moves you make...

418
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,482
...they're safe, yes?

419
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,089
- You're not doing anything illegal?
- No, Mom, don't worry.

420
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,171
- It's just business.
- Well, business is all very fine.

421
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,326
But always remember,
you can trust no one.

422
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,085
No one but your mother.

423
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,128
I know. I know.

424
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,490
But you know what?

425
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,082
I think I finally found somebody
I can trust.

426
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,009
- A policeman.
- Police?

427
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,171
- The police are liars.
- Mm-mm. Not this one, Mom.

428
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,725
He's a real friend.

429
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,848
Hmph.

430
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,367
He'll help me come out right in the end.

431
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,522
Raymond Earl, 33 years old.
Janitor in the city.

432
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,242
Works with an agency that
services the buildings of both victims.

433
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,447
And he's not talking.

434
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,726
History of mental illness, misdemeanor arrest
for lewd and lascivious, public disturbance...

435
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,766
Thank you, Jesus. You got him.

436
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,008
Good work, detectives.

437
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,009
I got a lot of phone calls to make.

438
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,885
Bullock, look happier.

439
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,481
What?

440
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,766
Randall Milkie worked for a company
that serviced the buildings of his victims.

441
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,889
Same as Raymond here.

442
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,924
Milkie was mentally ill.

443
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,004
No violent crimes in his history.
Same as him.

444
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,248
Ten years apart, they never meet,
and one day, suddenly out of the blue...

445
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,165
...they both decide to become the Goat?

446
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,089
It's like...

447
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,889
It's like something found them,
changed them.

448
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,924
Are you talking about Dix
and his conspiracy theory?

449
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,050
No, no. It just doesn't add up.

450
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,044
How'd he know about the coin?

451
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,403
I know that we're missing something,
and if we keep missing it...

452
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,568
...l'm afraid we're never gonna stop this.

453
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,403
Okay. We go back to Milkie's files, we look
for possible accomplices, connections.

454
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,843
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
I just-- I need to think.

455
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,770
Why don't you get some rest?

456
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,211
Yeah.

457
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,049
Good night.

458
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,969
Good night, Jim.

459
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,884
No. No. No. No.

460
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,768
Oh, no. No. No.

461
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,645
No. No. No.

462
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,605
Holy Ghost on a bicycle.

463
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,681
Barbara?

464
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,686
Jim, look, I don't know everything,
but I know enough.

465
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,405
You have to listen to me now.

466
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,530
- Baby, I can barely stand.
- Montoya has a witness.

467
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,165
- What?
- They believe you killed...

468
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,526
...this Cobblepot person.

469
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,683
- I didn't.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

470
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,690
They've got a warrant for your arrest.

471
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,524
What aren't you telling me?

472
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,011
For weeks now,
it's like you've been a different person.

473
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,921
Something happened not long
after you started the job, something...

474
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,202
Something you don't feel right about.

475
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,970
Somehow they've cornered me.

476
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,128
- Tied my hands.
- Come with me now.

477
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,210
I don't care what I leave behind
as long as we leave it together.

478
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,528
If they take you away, Jim,
I'm scared I'll lose you.

479
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,041
- Barbara--
- Please.

480
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,042
I can't run.

481
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,368
Can't run.

482
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,010
James Gordon...

483
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,886
...you're under arrest for the murder
of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

484
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,162
You have the right to remain silent.

485
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,569
Anything you say can be used against you
in a court of law.

486
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,965
You're drifting down and away, deeper--

487
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,400
- I got it.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

488
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,446
It's Detective Bullock, isn't it?
Did you wanna interview Mr. Hastings?

489
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,251
Your secretary told me
I might be able to find you here.

490
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,408
I was hoping to pick your brain
about the case.

491
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,291
Oh. Uh, I'll just be a minute. It's okay.

492
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,447
I didn't realize this before.
You're a hypnotist, right?

493
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,486
- A hypnotherapist.
- Oh, therapist. It's a funny word, "therapist."

494
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,287
It can either mean "therapist"
or "the rapist" if...

495
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,040
So you do pro bono work at an
outpatient clinic or a couple of them?

496
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,369
- I do. I try to give back.
- Yeah, you've been giving back for a while.

497
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,364
- Uh... Twelve years now.
- Mm-hm.

498
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,925
That's good.

499
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,365
To be honest, I wanted to talk to you
about one of your pro bono patients.

500
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,282
Raymond Earl. He's a person
of interest in our investigation.

501
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,042
Our records indicate you've seen him
at least a few times, right?

502
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,329
Hmm. Sounds familiar. Last year, maybe?

503
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,525
And Mr. Hastings, Amanda's father,
we know he's your patient.

504
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,611
When we were here yesterday,
he was doing something really curious.

505
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,441
He kept clenching his fist, over and over.

506
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,483
- Yes, he does that.
- Yeah.

507
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,531
See, I was reading about that, and it
said that if a patient has a compulsion...

508
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,802
...like a bad idea or an impulse...

509
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,571
...that the hypnotist
can put the poor sap under...

510
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,371
...and introduce a physical movement...

511
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,847
...like clenching your fist.

512
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,362
So instead of doing what the compulsion
wants the person to do...

513
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,608
...they just...

514
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,245
...clench their fist.

515
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,484
That's how it works. Pretty much.

516
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,122
So Mr. Hastings,
when he's in a room full of people...

517
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,721
...and he wants to start screaming,
I don't know...

518
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,764
...instead of doing that, he just:

519
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,925
Mm-hm.

520
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,003
Yeah. Okay.

521
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,647
What about Raymond Earl?
Why does he clench his fist?

522
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,449
And What about Randall Milkie?

523
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,602
I know you treated him over 10 years ago,
and I want you to follow me...

524
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,285
...because this part gets weird.

525
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,240
See, I think a hypnotist completely
turned both those men upside down...

526
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,568
...until their own identity
was the bad idea...

527
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,082
...and then it wasn't even them
clenching their fists anymore.

528
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,123
It was the Spirit of the Goat.

529
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,691
Hmm.

530
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,090
I underestimated you.

531
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,921
- I really did.
- So I'm right.

532
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,401
Aha! Yes. I'm right.

533
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,404
So you trawled the outpatient clinics...

534
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,803
...so you could find a suitable
borderline case like Randall Milkie...

535
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,965
...and then you hypnotize the poor bastard
until he doesn't even know who he is.

536
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,682
And then I tell him who he is.
That's pretty good intellection, detective.

537
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,566
Why? Why hypnotize a janitor...

538
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,250
...and turn him into the Goat?

539
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,171
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

540
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,962
It isn't an act of murder or madness.
It's an act of therapy.

541
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,811
- Therapy? For who?
- For Gotham.

542
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,607
- Excuse me?
- This city used to have hope.

543
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,003
And they gunned it down in the streets,
the rich, the powerful.

544
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,842
Their greed is pathological,
an id run rampant, eating Gotham alive.

545
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,402
So your 1 percent solution
is to kill the city's rich kids?

546
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,688
Negative reinforcement.

547
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,127
To believe that the Goat is real...

548
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,005
...that it wouldn't tolerate this?

549
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,330
Gotham wanted that,
no matter how painful it was.

550
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,126
It's true what they say.

551
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,204
You can't really hypnotize somebody
to do something...

552
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,840
...that deep down
they don't already want to do.

553
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,210
And deep down we all wanna eat the rich.

554
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,009
Tell me.

555
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,727
You are 100 percent nuthouse crazy, lady.

556
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,646
- Dr. Marks, is everything okay?
- No, it's not.

557
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,363
Dr. Marks, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder coercion...

558
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,246
...and a few things
we'll probably have to name after you.

559
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,204
Well, I do have another one for you.

560
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,850
Robert, the golden temple is open.

561
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,371
Now, kill this man.

562
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,882
- Aah!
- No, Robert--!

563
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,209
You must die.

564
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,365
Freeze, lady!

565
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,922
One more time, take me through the part
where you drove to the nice part of town...

566
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,162
...and shot the doctor lady?

567
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,001
We caught the other half of the killer.
Dr. Marks was the Spirit of the Goat.

568
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,440
That's the part that I don't--

569
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,921
We're on the same side. You understand?

570
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,731
We're fighting the same war,
and I'm getting somewhere.

571
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,891
- Getting into a 6-by-8 at Blackgate Pen.
- What is this?

572
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,805
MCU's taking Detective James Gordon
in custody.

573
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,806
- What?
- Your boy here murdered Oswald Cobblepot.

574
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,361
- That's a damn lie.
- He's right. It was a lie.

575
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,600
I didn't shoot Oswald Cobblepot.
I lied. I didn't shoot him, Bullock.

576
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,446
- Of course you didn't, partner.
- No, I mean it.

577
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,848
- Harvey Bullock, you're under arrest.
- For what?

578
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,042
Accomplice in the murder
of Oswald Cobblepot.

579
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,049
Our witness places you at the scene.

580
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,971
You think you can walk in here
and take my people like that?

581
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,211
We're not here to take down the G.C.P.D.,
just these two.

582
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,408
They're G.C.P.D.,
so the MCU's got a problem.

583
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,881
Yeah, you got a problem.
You got a real problem, you...

584
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,810
- Holy crap.
- Hello.

585
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,565
I am Oswald Cobblepot.

586
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,289
- You son of a bitch.
- Harvey.

587
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,641
You son of a bitch!
