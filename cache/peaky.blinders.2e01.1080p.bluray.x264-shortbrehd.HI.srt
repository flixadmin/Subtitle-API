That's all. You can go.

163
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,289
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

164
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
No charge.

165
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,051
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

166
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,442
He's, uh, just passing through, he says.

167
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,606
Very grand these days.

168
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,251
He's head of some
secret department,

169
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,251
the Irish Desk.

170
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,770
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

171
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,404
I'll say good night, Tom.

(METAL BANGING)

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,165
MAN: I demand to speak
to a representative!

174
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,650
(YELLING) A representative of
His Majesty the King!

175

(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

176
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,322
Father! Father!

177
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,449
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

178
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,045
Get the fuck off me!

179
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,964
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

180
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,362
I demand to speak to a representative
of His Majesty the King!

181
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,726
Make your peace with God.

182
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,849
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

183
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,490
- Father.
-Come on.

184
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,528
MAN: Now, wait!
Where are you going?

185
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,567
(LOCKING DOOR)

186
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,405
Does someone here have
business with the King?

187
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,605
Major Campbell.

188
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,967
-(SHOUTING CONTINUES)
-About time.

189
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,569
I am a very busy man, Governor.

190
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,125
In seven and a half minutes,

191
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,885
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

192
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,810
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

193
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,565
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

194
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,126
No, Governor,

195
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,165
I hear no bells.

196
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,485
Since yesterday morning,

197
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,562
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

198
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,722
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

199
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,804
(SCOFFS) It's a little late
to be coming up with nonsense like that,

200
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,086
don't you think?

201
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,003
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

202
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,003
there would be a last-minute pardon,

203
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,362
which has not materialised.

204
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,404
Forgive me, Governor,

205
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,726
but what business is this of mine?

206
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,005
He says the man who hired him

207
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,526
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

208
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,891
an Ulsterman.

209
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,926
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

210
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,002
a bullet wound in his right leg.

211
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,921
No.

212
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,162
Still no bells. Governor,

213
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,089
you have a very clear remit.

214
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,246
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

215
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,649
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

216
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,688
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man

217
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,969
to the gates of hell.

218
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,006
Is that clear?

219
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,402
And if you should ever have
the desire

220
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,006
to discuss this matter
with anyone else

221
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,046
I know where you live.

222
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,209
(PANICKED BREATHING)

223
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,767
Arthur, Tommy's
called a family meeting.

224
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,447
Arthur!

225
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,841
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

226
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,400
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

227
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,846
Arthur.

228

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,491
Come on.

231
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,491
Sit down, Finn.

232
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,204
- Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
-He's on his way.

233
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,246
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

234
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,882
Whisky.
(STRAINS)

235
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,727
Left over from the explosion.

236
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,170
It's good stuff, as well.

237
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
Right.

238
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,165
Before Tommy gets here,

239
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,168
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

240
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,651
between the rest of us.

241
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,846
You think?

242
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,206
Yeah.

243
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,323
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

244
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,930
When did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

245
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,408
You have anything to say,

246
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,290
you wait for Thomas.

247
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,691
Polly's fucking right.

248
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,330
I see all the books.

249
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,250
Legal and off track.

250
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,409
Sort of stuff you don't see.

251
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,885
And in the past year

252
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,490
the Shelby Company Limited

253
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,849
has been making £150

254
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,006
a day.

255
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,883
Right? A fucking day!

256
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,405
Sometimes more.

257
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,729
So what I want to know

258
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,249
is why are we changing things?

259
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,046
Polly, look what's happened already.

260
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,043
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

261
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,964
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

262
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,407
- Who said anything about cockneys?
-Who else?

Do you know who did it, do you?

264

- No, she doesn't know who did it.
-(DOOR OPENING)

265

I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,969
Everyone's allowed to speak.

267
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,049
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

(CLEARING THROAT)

269
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,044
I speak for our household.

270
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,886
- So...
-john, this company is

271
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,282
a modern enterprise and believes in
equal rights for women.

272
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,805
On your feet, Esme.

273
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,171
I'm not a blood member
of this family

274
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,127
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm not a member

275
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,362
I can see things
in a different light.

276
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,165
So I'll get to my point.

277
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,970
That would be nice.

278
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,326
As my husband said,

279
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,131
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

280

-(MATCH STRIKES)
-But London...

I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

282
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,326
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

283
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,765
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

284
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,922
And there are foreigners
of every description

285
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,327
and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

286
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,450
I have a child,

blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

288

I want John to see him grow up.

289
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,040
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

290
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,209
and keep chickens or something.

291
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,366
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

292
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,041
Thomas?

293
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,205
That's all I have to say.

294
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,530
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

295

Wash them down with a nice drink.

296

Thank you, Esme.

297
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,130
Firstly, the bang in the pub
had nothing to do with London.

298
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,486
Understood?

299
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,722
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

300
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,691
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

301
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,569
so long as we stick together.

302
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,086
And after the first few weeks,

303
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,401
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

304
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,522
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

305
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,966
That's right.

She's standing
across the street

410
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,165
and she tells me
she's passed over.

411
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,805

would have been 18 this year.

she wants to talk to me
