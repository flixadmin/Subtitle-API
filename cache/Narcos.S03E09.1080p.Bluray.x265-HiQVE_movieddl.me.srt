00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,528
Sir?

20
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,574
The telephone recordings you requested.
From La Picota.

21
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,285
Excuse me.

22
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,677
'He killed the DEA rat.

23
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,929
'He's beating the shit
out of the North Valley.

24
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,389
'What do you want me to say?

25
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,392
- 'Miguel's surprised us, brother.'
- 'Look, Pacho...

26
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,688
'I'm proud too of how my brother's
handled things while I'm gone,

27
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,774
'but we all have limitations.

28
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,236
'I led our organisation for 20 years
always taking care of all of you.'

29
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,323
'I know, but the thing is,

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,784
'I don't think I'm ready to surrender,
Gilberto.

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,953
'Besides, I still have to find the Salazars
and resolve the situation.'

32
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,500
'I understand, Pacho.
But you need to keep a cool head.

33
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,796
'For now, we need
to focus on the surrender plans.'

34
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,774
'A fucking fridge?'

35
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,819
A message from
Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela.

36
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,696
Son of a bitch! What's that smell?

37
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,826
The surveillance team
we sent to Cali.

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,009
CALL ME

39
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,731
It's a fucking leak.

40
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,777
Someone in the Colombian government
is telling them everything.

41
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,864
- Your CI told you this?
- Yeah. I mean, it adds up.

42
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,826
Our most important witness gets killed
right before I get him to talk.

43
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:06,330
Sir, Botero knew that
Franklin Jurado was my only play.

44
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,082
The Minister of Defence?

45
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,044
- Your CI said that he was the leak?
- That we had one.

46
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,879
- Then I'd keep that to yourself.
- Sir...

47
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,258
The fact is, Agent Peña, you've got
nothing outside of scorched earth.

48
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:22,179
A dead witness, a cartel war, and
whatever the fuck that was in the jungle.

49
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,308
We have to turn this over
to the Colombian authorities.

50
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,354
I told Botero that he will have
your case files by 5:00pm today.

51
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,899
Sir, what if Botero is the leak?

52
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,736
Then we're handing it over to the guy
who works for the cartel.

53
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,323
Ambassador, our CI, he's done
everything we've asked him to do. He's...

54
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,075
He's risked his life, his family.

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,287
- We'd be hanging him out to dry.
- So get him out now.

56
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,291
I'll authorise the paperwork. I can have
the Marines at his doorstep in 20 minutes.

57
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,712
No. We do that...
Miguel disappears and then we're done.

58
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,466
You're already done.

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,723
I thought you said I had until 5:00pm.

60
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,767
What's more important,
Agent Peña?

61
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,314
Getting Miguel Rodríguez...
or your CI's life?

62
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,153
Crosby's handing it over
to the Colombians today.

63
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,613
Any move we make,
we risk the leak finding out.

64
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,365
Fucking us and Salcedo.

65
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,367
What did Salcedo say
about the new location?

66
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,954
David stepped up security. It would
take a battalion of cops to get Miguel.

67
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,914
He says our best bet's to wait
for Miguel to move.

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,916
Which we don't have time for.

69
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,627
So we don't wait.

70
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:39,256
Sir, maybe we should cut our losses,
get Salcedo out now.

71
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,842
Crosby won't go for it. I asked.

72
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,803
Guy's risked his life for us.
His wife and kids, for fuck's sake.

73
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,432
So it's up to us to help them.
We get Miguel, we get them out.

74
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,938
Call Salcedo again.
We take Miguel today.

75
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,359
General,
Miguel Rodríguez is on the 7th floor.

76
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:02,696
His son, David, doubled security
after the raid,

77
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,658
and, well, there's no way to get inside
that building without attracting attention.

78
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,620
We have to get Miguel to move.

79
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,623
- And we capture him while they're moving.
- Exactly.

80
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,917
How?

81
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,169
Leave that to me.

82
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,298
I'll stay here in Bogotá.
You coordinate the operation in Cali.

83
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,386
But it has to be today.
There's no time.

84
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,763
Today...

85
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:39,149
Agent Peña, after our last operation,
my superior came to see me.

86
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,612
He was very diplomatic, but he made sure
to remind me of all I've achieved.

87
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,033
And that it could all be taken away.

88
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,871
I worry that the only people who could do
more damage to the country than the cartel

89
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,290
are the sons of bitches they've bought.

90
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,586
And I don't want to risk bringing Miguel
Rodríguez to jail through the front door

91
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,714
so they can let him out the back,
you understand?

92
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,341
General...

93
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:10,180
You put him in jail
and I'll make sure he stays there.

94
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,728
All right. Let's do it.

95
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,274
Let's hope the bastard enjoys
his last day of freedom.

96
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,487
'In law enforcement,
your only real power

97
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,115
'comes from the strength
of the system that you represent.

98
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,826
'You gotta believe it has your back.

99
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,662
'But sometimes...
sometimes it doesn't.

100
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,500
'Sometimes it's so compromised,
so corrupt, that you can't trust it.

101
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,336
'What do you do then,
when it tries to play you?

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,006
'You look for a way
to play it right back.'

103
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,885
All right, gentlemen,
Miguel's here in his apartment.

104
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,095
Protected by a small army.

105
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,765
Once I get the signal, I'll organise
a convoy and come down this way.

106
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,726
Carrera 15, until we get here.

107
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:00,022
There we will turn and go down
25th street until Santa Rita.

108
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,899
How many cars?

109
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,819
Four SUVs. I'll be in the first
and Miguel will be in the third.

110
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,530
We set up roadblocks, close him in.

111
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,033
I think that gives him
an opportunity to escape.

112
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,410
I've got something
far more aggressive in mind.

113
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,830
I don't want to give that son of a bitch
the opportunity to end up anywhere

114
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,124
other than the back of my truck.

115
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,503
You flush him out of the apartment,
and I'll take him down.

116
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,632
'Sir, please believe me!

117
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,176
'I swear it on my family, sir.

118
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,803
'No! No, sir! Please wait!

119
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,598
'I already told you the truth, sir!'

120
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,479
Play it again. From the beginning.

121
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,564
But what for?

122
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,777
All you're going to hear is a man yelling
because he's being tortured, nothing more.

123
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,072
I told you, maybe he said something
that will help us nail the motherfucker.

124
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,699
But didn't we already catch the mole?

125
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,827
I'll tell you something.

126
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,206
I hate that motherfucker Salcedo
with all of my heart.

127
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,708
But what's your problem with him?
He may be clean.

128
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,796
The problem I have with him is
that he's a fucking lying son of a bitch.

129
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,464
And I know it.

130
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,259
Now start it from the fucking beginning.

131
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,719
You hear?

132
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,684
Chris, for this to work,
I have to leave my family again.

133
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,812
- Okay, we'll get them out. Don't worry.
- They're watching my house.

134
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,856
All right, so we wait,
we stay clear until we have Miguel,

135
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,401
and then we go in
for your wife and kids.

136
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,445
Are you gonna keep your word?

137
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,656
We'll keep our word.

138
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,868
Hey, what happened, Jorge?

139
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,874
Hey, listen...
just use this to reach us.

140
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,258
My oldest daughter, she has
her first soccer practice tomorrow.

141
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,804
She's afraid they're gonna
make her play goalie.

142
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,144
I don't know what to tell her.

143
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,109
Hey, we're gonna get him, Jorge.

144
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,667
Put all the clothes
you want to take on the bed.

145
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,046
Put any jewellery and valuables
under the clothes.

146
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,219
Anyone comes in,
it will look like you just did the wash.

147
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,848
When it's time, put everything
in the suitcases, okay?

148
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,643
Good. One more thing.

149
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,771
Come with me, please.

150
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,612
Paola, don't freak out.

151
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,948
- Wait, Jorge, wait.
- It's only a precaution, Paola.

152
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,621
- Wow.
- My love.

153
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,831
- Eh...
- Take it, Paola.

154
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,879
Like this. Hold on tight.

155
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,048
Here's the safety. Now it's ready...

156
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,675
...now it's not.

157
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,344
That's the only thing you need to do.

158
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:22,099
If anyone you don't know
comes through that door, use it.

159
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,017
- Okay?
- Yes.

160
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,896
My love, you can do this.
You can do this.

161
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,863
I'll leave it here.

162
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,746
I can do this.

163
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,541
It's my only choice.

164
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,919
As soon as the DEA gets here,
you go with them. You can't wait for me.

165
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,297
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.

166
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,010
Don't worry.

167
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,934
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

168
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,733
What I'm about to tell you
is a little delicate,

169
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,860
but it concerns all of our futures.

170
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,279
I've been concerned
about my brother, Gilberto.

171
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:23,201
The thing is, he's been speaking to some
of our partners without telling me.

172
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,120
Undermining me.

173
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,706
Making it very difficult
to run this business.

174
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,709
So...

175
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,632
...I decided to have
my brother's phone tapped.

176
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,888
What the fuck are you saying, Miguel?

177
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,515
We don't tap each other's phones.

178
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,102
I know.
But in this case, it was necessary.

179
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,149
I heard you two talking to him
about the surrender.

180
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,863
And you heard something
I wasn't supposed to say or what?

181
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,909
What is this shit, Miguel?
Now we can't talk to Gilberto?

182
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,994
Of course you can.

183
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,871
You're not going to make
a fucking speech now.

184
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,501
No, I'm not going to make a speech,
but I'll tell you one important thing.

185
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,256
The surrender was Gilberto's dream.
It was never ours.

186
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,678
Besides, we all know how good
Gilberto is at promising things

187
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,181
when he wants something from us.

188
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,225
What did he promise you?

189
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,814
New York.
But did he tell you when? How?

190
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,566
You have shit.

191
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:45,826
Chepe... here you have a passport,
a new social security number,

192
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,871
and the addresses
of two labs in New York

193
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,499
so you can rebuild what's ours.

194
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,255
And what did he promise you?
The Salazars?

195
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,386
Here's the location
where the Salazars are hiding.

196
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,930
So you can avenge your brother.

197
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,486
Henao gave it to me.

198
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,281
So the North Valley war is over or what?

199
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,201
That's right. In our favour.

200
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,915
Of course, first I had to send
that motherfucker a little gift.

201
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:46,469
Look, Miguel...
I think you need to tell us the truth.

202
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,639
No fucking lies.

203
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,561
What the fuck have you done
with the real Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela?

204
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,026
Surrender's for pussies.

205
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,797
Shh, shh, shh!

206
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,177
Listen up... Mr. Wiretap.

207
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,848
Never ever touch my phone.

208
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,477
Understood?

209
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,289
Don Miguel.

210
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,794
Sir.

211
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,672
- What?
- Excuse me.

212
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,257
I just heard DEA agents are back in Cali.

213
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,138
Any update on the accountant?

214
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:16,977
Well, we're still looking, but no luck.

215
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,453
Motherfucker.

216
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,167
This has to be the place
Enrique told us about.

217
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,176
Look there. See if you can find
anything about Salcedo.

218
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,726
Motherfuckers.

219
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,187
I know this isn't the ideal
situation for you and your team,

220
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,148
but I appreciate your cooperation
with the transition.

221
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,274
Of course.

222
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,986
I'll put you in touch with the police
investigative team I've assigned.

223
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,529
I'll give you the phone number.

224
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,667
And they'll stop by for the files
this afternoon.

225
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:27,172
Thank you. One more thing, Minister.
It almost slipped my mind.

226
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,882
What's that?

227
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,594
I received some information
regarding Miguel Rodríguez's hideout.

228
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,766
It seems he's in a building in Cali.
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.

229
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,144
Well done, Agent. Well done.

230
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,105
I'll get this information
to my men right away.

231
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,440
No, that won't be necessary.

232
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,526
I've already got my men there
preparing for the raid today.

233
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,111
Excuse me?

234
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,532
We can't waste any time.
You want to catch him, don't you?

235
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,451
Of course I do.

236
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,870
This is the best option.

237
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,457
If we do get him, you get the credit.
I promise.

238
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,502
Thank you, sir.

239
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,973
Jorge?
Don Miguel wants to see you right away.

240
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,558
Coming.

241
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,729
Sir.

242
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,817
Just got off the phone
with our friend in Bogotá.

243
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,653
Seems those DEA agents
are here for a reason.

244
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,615
He says they're planning a raid.

245
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,078
We can take you to Santa Rita.

246
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,125
- Do it.
- Of course, sir.

247
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,220
We got some news.
Get the cars ready.

248
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,190
Peña.

249
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,069
'Your message went through.
Botero's the leak. Miguel's on the move.'

250
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,281
Good. Keep me posted on stage two.

251
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,824
Copy that.

252
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,167
- Good morning.
- Hello.

253
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,007
You seem happy.

254
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,971
Defence Minister Fernando Botero...

255
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,139
Mm-hmm.

256
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,767
...is working with the Cali cartel.

257
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,522
- What makes you so sure?
- Played a little "telephone".

258
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,651
Something I said to him that only I know
was repeated in Cali.

259
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,281
Normally, I'd say you're crazy, but...

260
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,367
I'm going to show you something.

261
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,417
- Those Curaçao bank files you gave me.
- Yes.

262
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,128
I had a bank source help me
dig through them.

263
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,463
And?

264
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:17,050
What's interesting is who's listed
alongside Franklin Jurado's name

265
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,968
on this account.

266
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,679
Santiago Medina. Who's he?

267
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,015
He's an art collector.

268
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,186
But rumour is he does some money
laundering for upper-class Colombians.

269
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,231
Cleans their cash through fancy
charities, dummy corporations,

270
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,608
campaign contributions.

271
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,198
Guess who Santiago Medina worked with
on the last presidential campaign?

272
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,202
Fernando Botero.

273
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:48,581
There's nothing.

274
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,584
Have you thought about the possibility
that Salcedo is telling the truth?

275
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,337
Just because you don't like him doesn't
mean everything he says is bullshit.

276
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,172
That's got nothing to do with it.

277
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,759
There's plenty of people I don't like
but still trust. Like you.

278
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,520
Dario. You see that camera?

279
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,024
Maybe it caught something. Huh?

280
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,527
Come on.

281
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,491
I found this one from last week.

282
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,414
Play it.

283
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,878
Fast forward.

284
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,171
Faster.

285
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,427
Hit play.

286
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,971
And stop... stop it there.

287
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,059
See? These motherfuckers
must be the DEA, right?

288
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,146
- Mm-hmm.
- Keep going.

289
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,953
His transport arrived.

290
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,044
We're in position.

291
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,796
I'll let you know when they come out.

292
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,138
Where are we?

293
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,725
'Serrano's in position.
Just waiting for Miguel to come down.'

294
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,442
Despite how difficult
this week has been,

295
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,944
we're making it out of the storm.

296
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,696
It would seem so, sir.

297
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,117
I've been thinking
about the promise I made to you.

298
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,664
Six months until you open
your security business.

299
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,795
That's right, sir.

300
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,716
It's even possible that
I'll invest in your business.

301
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,052
What do you think about that?

302
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,221
It would be an honour
to have your support.

303
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:14,727
- Can I help you with your bag?
- No, this is almost ready.

304
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,522
Take those. I'll see you downstairs.

305
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,857
Of course, sir.

306
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,904
Keep going.

307
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,284
Stop it there.

308
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,376
No, that's Enrique. Keep going.

309
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,840
Open it.

310
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,886
Salcedo is downstairs.
We're waiting for Miguel.

311
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,596
'Copy that.'

312
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,768
Stop. Go back.

313
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,771
Go back. More.

314
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,107
There.

315
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,114
- Isn't that Enrique again?
- Can you get this shit to stop shaking?

316
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,174
Man...

317
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,759
Man, you were right.

318
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,596
You were right, man.

319
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,056
I'm going to kill that motherfucker.

320
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,102
Take this.

321
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,482
Careful with this.

322
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,670
Fuck, he's not answering.

323
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,943
Here.

324
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,112
Thank you.

325
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,244
- Hello.
- Dad. It's him.

326
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,329
It's that bastard, Salcedo.

327
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,123
David, again with this bullshit?
When will you stop?

328
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,376
Listen to me.
I found the DEA hideout.

329
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,211
The one Enrique told us
Salcedo knew about.

330
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,674
'On the same street, there's a hotel with
a camera pointed towards the street.'

331
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,636
We checked the video with Dario,
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,

332
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,097
and that motherfucker Salcedo, Dad.

333
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,392
Are you sure about that?

334
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,270
One hundred percent.
I checked the plates.

335
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,689
Dad, think about it.

336
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:08,776
He's trying to take you out of a safe place
so they can catch you in the open.

337
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,612
It's a trap, Dad.

338
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,407
'Dad...'

339
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,660
I'll call you back.

340
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,840
Jorge, Don Miguel asked me
to tell you

341
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,760
that he needs your help with something
before we leave.

342
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,557
Jorge?

343
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,643
Yes.

344
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,900
Fuck.
They just called him back inside.

345
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,165
Shit.

346
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,716
David Rodríguez just showed up
at the Salcedo's.

347
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,807
NO SERVICE

348
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,480
- They know.
- 'Are you sure?'

349
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,107
Has to be. They called him back inside.
David's at the Salcedos'...

350
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,527
- Wait, wait, wait.
- 'We have to go in and get him.'

351
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,155
'We stick to the plan.
When Miguel moves, we get him.'

352
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,200
- They're gonna kill him.
- Yeah, well, he might already be dead.

353
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,661
All due respect, sir,
we have to go in.

354
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:45,873
All right, go.

355
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,959
Tell Serrano we're going in.

356
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,337
- Let's go.
- General! General!

357
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,506
'We have to go in now! Out!'

358
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,976
You need me, Don Miguel?

359
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,021
Take a seat.

360
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,404
All right, but we should be going.

361
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,868
I think we're going to be
a little safer here.

362
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,834
You fucking son of a bitch!

363
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,253
What is this?
What's going on, Don Miguel?

364
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,091
Don Miguel!

365
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,553
Look how diligent!

366
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,223
Girls, whatever happens,
you don't leave the room, all right?

367
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,767
- All right.
- Don't come out for any reason.

368
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,322
- Cover his mouth.
- Don Miguel!

369
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,659
Please!
Ah! Don Miguel!

370
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,297
Go to your room.

371
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,598
Mrs. Salcedo!
We're DEA! Open up, please!

372
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,518
Mrs. Salcedo! DEA!

373
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,937
- DEA?
- Yes!

374
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,232
Daniel Van Ness.
There's two men out front.

375
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,443
They're here for you. Stay close.

376
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,823
Let's go through the back.

377
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,339
I believed you over my own son.

378
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,259
You took my money.

379
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,554
I let you protect my family.

380
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:11,936
You listened to our private conversations,
you son of a bitch.

381
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:25,908
I gave you all my trust.
And what did it mean to you? Shit.

382
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,493
Nothing.

383
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,412
You're an animal.

384
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,917
You're a little wharf rat.

385
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,587
Not even that.
A rat has more dignity than you.

386
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,923
Do you know what I've just done,
motherfucker?

387
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,218
I told David to go to your house...

388
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:50,349
...and kill your wife and daughters,
you motherfucker!

389
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,687
Mrs. Salcedo?

390
00:30:55,813 --> 00:31:00,025
- My kids.
- Get to their room. Stay there. Go.

391
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,655
Ma'am, please open up.

392
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,742
Girls, stop folding, please.
Back here. Go back here.

393
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,661
Back! Here.

394
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,956
I want to talk, Mrs. Salcedo.
Open up.

395
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,189
Keep shooting!

396
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,528
I know you're in there, Mrs. Salcedo.

397
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,456
Don Miguel! The DEA is in the building.

398
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,541
Get María and the boy
into a car.

399
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,669
- Sir, you should come as well.
- Get the fuck out of here!

400
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,625
Give me that shit. Get out. Motherfucker!

401
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,969
Fucking rat, die!

402
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,372
Go!

403
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,065
Don Miguel, we have to leave right now!

404
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,860
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

405
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,620
- Don Miguel, we have to go!
- Kill him!

406
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,066
You're okay.

407
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,443
Where's Miguel?

408
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,238
Where's Miguel?

409
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,302
Go out the other door.

410
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,180
Hurry up, damn it!

411
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,485
Miguel Rodríguez...

412
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,822
...you're under arrest.

413
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,340
- General.
- Agent Peña...

414
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,468
I've got Miguel Rodríguez,
handcuffed, at my side.

415
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,518
And Salcedo?

416
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,445
- I've got them. They're safe.
- Get in.

417
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,281
- Let me talk to my wife.
- Jorge...

418
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,742
Jorge? Hello, my love.
Are you all right?

419
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,702
- 'Yes, and you? The girls?'
- Yes.

420
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,998
Yes, the girls are all right.
They're scared, but all right.

421
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:52,794
- 'We did it, Paola.'
- Yes. Yes, we did it.

422
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,255
'I'll be with you soon, my love.'

423
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,022
Got a minute?

424
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,069
- We were wrong.
- Wrong?

425
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,822
Yes, I checked
the Samper campaign financials,

426
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:24,201
and I found that in July of last year,
they had serious losses.

427
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,871
They needed money
for travel, ads, etc.

428
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,623
And they got $6 million.

429
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,668
Just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

430
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,838
So...
he wasn't laundering the money.

431
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,507
No.

432
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,009
That money stayed in the campaign.

433
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,553
It was a contribution.

434
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,815
I need a word. Right away.

435
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,956
- Have a seat.
- No, thank you. I'd rather stand.

436
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,250
- What's going on?
- We got Miguel Rodríguez.

437
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,543
You got him?

438
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,129
He's on a plane back to Bogotá
right now.

439
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:21,425
- It'll be all over the news in an hour.
- You couldn't let it go, could you?

440
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,680
Sir, there's another piece of this
that you need to know.

441
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,728
These are bank accounts opened
in Curaçao by a guy named Medina.

442
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,604
Yeah, I know him.

443
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,191
Good, because he was working
with Fernando Botero.

444
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,777
They received over six million dollars
from the Cali cartel,

445
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,780
which went into the Samper
presidential campaign.

446
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,034
- And you know this how?
- I did some digging.

447
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:52,205
Ambassador, I am certain
that the Minister of Defence is corrupt

448
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,374
and that it doesn't stop there.

449
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,960
You ask the president and he's gonna say
he didn't have a fucking clue,

450
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,005
but that money won him the election.

451
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,967
Gilberto, Miguel,
they walk right out of prison

452
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,928
unless these fucking politicians
are in there with them.

453
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:21,735
The voice you're about to hear
is the voice of the man you just mentioned,

454
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,989
Santiago Medina,
talking to Gilberto Rodríguez.

455
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,325
On the phone.

456
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,869
'We've been talking, Mr. Rodríguez.

457
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,915
'There's a lot of interest on our part.
If there's interest on your end...

458
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,876
'Yes. Of course there is.

459
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:43,340
'We would need to know what
we would be getting for our contribution.'

460
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,425
'Of course.

461
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:51,098
'As you know, our goal is to reward
our supporters once we take office.

462
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:55,644
'The terms we discussed
are certainly reasonable.'

463
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,480
'Then you have our support.

464
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,693
- 'How would we organise the payments?'
- 'We should get together and discuss it.'

465
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,321
How long have you known?

466
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,990
It's complicated.

467
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,912
The point, Agent Peña, is you're right.

468
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,498
But in this case...

469
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,751
...it doesn't matter.

470
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,003
You're not gonna do anything.

471
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,509
Samper is... a good friend to us.

472
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,182
So that's it.

473
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,644
They bought...

474
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,982
...the president.

475
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,318
And for now...

476
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,072
...they get to keep him.

477
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,294
We never had a chance.

478
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,165
I know it's difficult.

479
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,586
But you get used to being here.

480
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,382
You bastard.

481
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:56,515
Look, brother...
let's put the past behind us.

482
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,311
I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

483
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,523
but, regardless, we are winning.

484
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,152
I don't know what the fuck
we're winning, Gilberto.

485
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,572
By catching you, brother,
they did us a favour.

486
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,242
Now Pacho and Chepe
have to turn themselves in.

487
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:19,412
That's the only way
we'll be able to negotiate the terms.

488
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,709
Well, you better be right,
because I'm not staying in this shithole.

489
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,139
I heard about Miguel.

490
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,821
I'm going to surrender.

491
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,573
And Chepe too.

492
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:59,077
But before that,
I have one last thing I have to finish.

493
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,936
Gentlemen.

494
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:29,524
Mr. Santacruz,
we have to ask you to come with us.

495
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,610
You're under arrest.

496
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:36,364
There's room at the bar.
Make yourself comfortable.

497
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,830
Please, Mr. Santacruz.
You have to come with us.

498
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:48,126
Who do you think called the police?

499
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,130
Here's how this is gonna go.

500
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,717
When I'm done,
when I'm fucking ready...

501
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,596
...then you can give me a ride to jail.

502
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,640
Take a seat.

503
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,976
Eat this. Come on.
Order whatever you want.

504
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,144
Come on.

505
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,774
Ah!

506
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,126
This your celebration?

507
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,506
Kind of a downer.
I was hoping for some alcohol.

508
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,177
How long have you had them?

509
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:43,640
The tapes Crosby played for me.

510
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,310
Let me guess. It's, er...

511
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,813
It's complicated.

512
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:53,608
How about... I tried to warn you?

513
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:01,324
Like you've never cut a corner
to get to the front of the line?

514
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:06,830
Question is...
what you do when you get there.

515
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,459
There's always gonna be
new bad guys to fight, Agent Peña.

516
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,503
We make new ones every day.

517
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,132
But... any way you slice it...

518
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:22,637
...you're the agent that put cuffs
on two Cali godfathers.

519
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,808
No small feat.

520
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:32,939
Go on.

521
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,278
You earned it.

522
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,302
