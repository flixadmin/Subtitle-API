00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,220
I--I'm about to have
a nuclear meltdown--

351
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,321
And our captain thinks
our future

352
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,323
Is already written for us.

353
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,858
You know what I think?

354
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,893
I think you're both
a couple of quitters.

355
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,895
- There's no escape
from either these cells

356
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:14,032
Or from the future.
- Face the facts, raymond.

357
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,134
We're completely
out of allies.

358
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:19,203
- You're forgetting
sarah and snart.

359
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,172
As long as
they're on the loose,

360
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,241
We still have a chance.

361
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,510
- <i>Just another moment.</i>
<i>I'm almost through.</i>

362
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,145
- Even if this works,

363
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,913
We're never gonna be able
to fly out off here.

364
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,815
- Well, that's the beauty
of having a timeship.

365
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,650
We don't have to fly
anywhere.

366
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,586
[tapping]

367
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,489
- Can you stop doing that?

368
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,658
- Why did you start wearing
that thing, anyways?

369
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,561
- It's from the first job
I ever pulled off with mick.

370
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,263
A freeport warehouse.

371
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,099
- Oh, you do have
a sentimental side.

372
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,568
- It's not a keepsake.
It's a reminder.

373
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,769
- Of what?

374
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,838
- That even the best laid plans

375
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Can go sideways.

376
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,609
Spent a lot of time
prepping for that heist.

377
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,511
Casing the target.

378
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:04,082
Memorizing shift changes
and delivery schedules,

379
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,583
And then surprise!

380
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,519
Turns out they'd upgraded
their security system.

381
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,221
We had to bolt.

382
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,724
Three weeks of planning
and all I have to show for it...

383
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:17,862
- Was a lousy pinky ring.
So sad.

384
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,865
- Considering I'm about
to trade my life for nothing,

385
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,267
I think I came out ahead.

386

Sorry, your job.

You've proven yourself quite
adept at piloting this ship.

00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,066
- About the tractor beam--

450
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,634
- Dr. Palmer is going to help me
remotely disable it.

There's no way
they're gonna let gideon

00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,019
What if we convince the system
that the override command

461
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,989
Is coming from somewhere else?
- Or someone else.

462
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,824

00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,794

lock on to the vanishing point.

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,997
- Right.

475
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,533
I suppose it's also time
to apologize

00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,336
For being an
"insufferable know-it-all."

You know,

your way

481
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,412
Oh, by the way,
I'm going to be real pissed

About this whole
roofie thing,

483
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,883
But I do get over it.
- Roofie thing?

00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:10,020
I-I would never dream--
- yeah, you do...

485
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,757
[chuckles]
but it's okay.

486
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,561
It's actually
the best decision I never made.

487
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,331
The future...

488
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,166
You want to know
what happens?

489
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,401
- No, no,
it's--it's all right.

490
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,770
I-I know enough.

491
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,373
The young man in front of me
is proof

492
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,243
That something must have
gone right on this adventure.

493
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,081
- So long, martin.
- So long, jefferson.

494
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,622
- Professor's in the medbay.

495
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,024
Promises not to blow up
while he's on board,

496
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,793
Which I thought was considerate.

497
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,361
- Yeah, the professor's
condition is the least

498
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,029
Of our worries, I'm afraid.

499
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,198
- Yeah, much to my chagrin,

500
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,866
It turns out everything
we've done,

501
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,301
Maybe even our whole lives,

502
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,703
Has been determined
by the time masters.

503
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,305
- What?
- The time masters have

504
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,908
This thing called the oculus,
which allows them

505
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,110
Not only to gaze
into the future,

506
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,646
But to engineer it.

507
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,048
- A future where I'm dead,
apparently.

508
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,616
- And why would
they want you dead?

509
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,085
- Have you ever listened
to what comes out of his mouth?

510
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,821
- Now, in my opinion,
dr. Palmer's death

511
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,255
Is not part of their plan.

512
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,492
- No, that's not reassuring.
Ow!

513
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,094
- You saying the time masters
wanted me to do that?

514
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,230
- What I'm saying is that
they've been engineering

515
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,966
Our lives to move
in very specific directions.

516
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,002
And we are playing out
that script even now.

517
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,104
- So we can go to 2016,

518
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,473
But that might be
what the time masters want.

519
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,641
Or we can go get
kendra and carter--

520
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,677
- Which could also be
what they want.

521
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,947
- Then we need to do
what they don't want.

522
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,115
If the oculus is what
they're using to control us,

523
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,184
Then we need to destroy it.

524
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,119
- But how do we do that if
the time bastards

525
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,921
Are pulling our strings?

526
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,790
- Well, druce told me
that the oculus' ability

527
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,459
To control our actions doesn't
work in the vanishing point,

528
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,127
Most likely because
the vanishing point itself

529
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,329
Exists outside of time.

530
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,531
- Explains why we were able
to escape.

531
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:05,269
- And why we might actually have
a shot at destroying this thing.

532
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,005
I'm with ray.
- Ow.

533
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,773
- If I'm gonna be
someone's puppet,

534
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,276
I'm gonna be the one who cuts
his own bloody strings.

535
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,178
- And I like blowing stuff up.

536
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,814
- We set out on this mission to
stop savage and save the world.

537
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,884
To become legends
and change our fates.

538
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,285
That mission hasn't changed.

539
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:25,289
- This is madness.

540
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,258
I like it.

541
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:34,965
- Gideon, plot a course
to the oculus wellspring.

542
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,834

543
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,937
I think it's about time
we seized our destinies back.

544
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,979
- Mmm.

545
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,251
If I'm gonna die,
no sense watching my diet.

546

547

you know?

548

- But what if those mistakes
were all part of their plan?

549
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,826
Actually, I gotta stop
thinking about it.

550
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,728
The temporal implications
are infinite.

551
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,698
- That's why I don't think.

552
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,534
- Not bad, right?
- Good.

553
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,003
- So how'd you do it?
- Do what?

554
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,172
- How did you <i>not</i>
<i>get turned into chronos?</i>

555
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:18,075
You said the only way you held
onto yourself the first time

556
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,411
Was by focusing on
your hate.

557
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,947
- What did I focus on
this time?

558
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,750
The team.

559
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,120
- And how much
you cared for us?

560
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,690
- I thought about how royally
screwed you'd be without me.

561
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,358
My point being,

562
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,028
If I can survive
not being turned into chronos,

563
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,231
You can survive anything
they throw at you.

564
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,067
- Thanks.
I'll keep it in mind.

565
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,202
- Well, you better

566
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,973
Because if you tell the team
I actually care,

567
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,975
I'll shave your head.

568
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,213
Man, this is good.

569
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,960
- Not in the mood.

570
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,831
- I was gonna apologize
for pulling a gun on you,

571
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,800
But apparently
I was just following a script.

572
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,104
- Doesn't make you
any less of a jerk.

573
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,639
- Guilty.

574
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,475
So what do we think
of rip's plan?

575
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,810
- Does it matter?

576
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,746
Apparently everything
we're going to do

577
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,649
Has already been predetermined
by rip's former bosses.

578
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:35,119

prided myself on being the guy

580
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:41,592
Come to find out,
I'm the one being played.

581

- I don't know.

582
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,929
I still feel responsible
for everything I've done.

583
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,365
And it still keeps me up
at night.

584
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:52,269
- It's the things I didn't do
that keep me up at night.

585
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,805
- What's that?
- Oh, I don't know.

586
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,442
Maybe it's being on this ship
traveling through time

587
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:01,979
I started to wonder what
the future might hold for me...

588
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,281
And you...

589
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:08,052
And me and you.

590
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,155

from me, leonard?

591

You better be one hell

592

593
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,703
- Well, I'm dying.

594
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:29,406
I'm also sure that you're dying
and so are all the others.

ahead of you.

Normally I'd be quite concerned,
but the truth is

About the oculus,

The oculus is a massive

Most likely powered
by a scaled-down supernova

611

Contained at the bottom

Why aren't any of you
more excited by this?

- We're excited
to blow it up.

614
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:28,632
- Dr. Palmer will deactivate
the core contained supernova,

615
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,969
Which should create
an anomalistic event.

616
