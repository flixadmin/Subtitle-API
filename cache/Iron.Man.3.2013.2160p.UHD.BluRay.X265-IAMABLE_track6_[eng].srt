Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1722
01:30:00,282 --> 01:30:03,161
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1723
01:30:03,242 --> 01:30:05,120
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1724
01:30:05,242 --> 01:30:06,995
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1734
01:30:24,442 --> 01:30:27,833

Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:58,522 --> 01:31:00,991
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:31:01,162 --> 01:31:02,198
But we also have to figure out this

- Right.

1750

We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1758
01:31:17,802 --> 01:31:20,192

surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1760
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:25,913
The president's safe on Air Force One

I think we're good, here.

RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1763
01:31:29,482 --> 01:31:31,201
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

the president somehow.</i>

alert that plane.

1766
01:31:34,842 --> 01:31:36,879
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:36,962 --> 01:31:39,875
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:27,082 --> 01:32:29,881
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
