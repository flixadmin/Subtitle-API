My son, he's quite picky

to be a prime number

of prawn balls.

if he had nine balls
it wouldn't be a prime number

- Well done, mate.
- JULIE: Oh, well done.

319
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:36,825
Why is that unfortunate?

320
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:37,981
No, I was having a joke, mate.

321
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:39,835
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

322
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:42,272
- Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

323
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:44,446
- Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

324
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,243
But...

325
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:48,329
I should study.

326
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,650
- Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan. (LAUGHS)

327
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:54,605
He doesn't mean that.

328
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:56,825
Probably, yeah.

329
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,480
- Okay.
- Well...

330
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,775
- I'm gonna go and study.
- JULIE: Okay.

331
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:02,492
Well done, mate.

332
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,821
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

333
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,232
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

334
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,031
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

335
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:12,118
Would you like...

336
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,711
I should probably shoot off.

337
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,104
Okay, no, that's fine.

338
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,782
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

339
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,111
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

340
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:30,230
To join us next month,

341
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,610
take him to the airport.

342
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:34,701
I know that would make Nathan happy.

343
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:37,447
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

344
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:43,167
I should probably tell you before they...

345
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:45,625
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

346
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,361
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

347
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,648
It's a bit like I'm being fired, basically.

348
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:53,278
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:55,648
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working

350
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:58,502
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

351
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:00,867
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, if that's all right with you?

352
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,991
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

353
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,522
Oh! Jesus Christ!

354
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:08,868
(GASPS)

355
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:11,993
Oh, my God!

356
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:14,200
That's a bit of a weird one.

357
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:16,575
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

358
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:19,240
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

359
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,399
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

360
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:22,990
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

361
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,246
We were just talking, Nathan.

362
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,126
I was looking at Jupiter.

363
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:43,407
I didn't do it on purpose.

364
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:46,438
It was just...

365
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:51,691
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

366
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,787
For once. For me.

367
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:59,856
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

368
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:07,456
Okay.

369
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:35,790
MICHAEL: What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

370
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,403
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

371
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:40,492
(CHUCKLES)

372
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,367
353!

373
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:45,866
Whoa!

374
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,365
Just in time.

375
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:48,747
Perfect timing.

376
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,524
JULIE: Fireworks night again, is it?

377
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:51,617
(MICHAEL CHUCKLES)

378
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,773
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

379
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:55,033
The sparkler helps.

380
00:24:55,823 --> 00:24:56,784
Come on, Nathan.

381
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:58,626
It's time to change the fish.

382
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,417
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

383
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,406
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

384
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,865
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

385
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,898
- You're lucky I'm here, that's all.
{MICHAEL LAUGHS)

386
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,999
- MICHAEL: I'm lucky.“
- Yeah, you get me.

387
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,069
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

388
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:26,538
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

389
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:28,162
I told you, you're not getting...

390
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,531
- Ice cream, Julie!
- (GIGGLES)

391
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,485
Nathan?

392
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:40,575
Jesus.

393
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:43,742
Nathan!

394
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:47,533
Oh!

395
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:48,866
Nathan, It's okay.

396
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,869
Nathan, I'm not angry.

397
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,151
Nathan!

398
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,604
Michael? Michael?

399
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,450
JULIE: Everything all right?
NATHAN: Yeah.

400
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,706
I'm quite looking FORWARD to this
in a weird sort of way.

401
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:18,783
JULIE: Yeah, I know.

402
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,940
Little trip down memory lane.

403
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:23,744
- JULIE: Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

404
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,116
This is for you.

405
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,283
JULIE: Nathan...

406
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,283
What do you say?

407
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:36,733
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

408
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:38,109
so they're probably cursed.

409
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:40,532
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

410
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:41,989
JULIE: Very lovely of you.
MARTIN: Right then.

411
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,614
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- JULIE: Yep. Let's go.

412
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:45,866
Nathan?

413
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,898
Can you get in the back with me?

414
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:52,409
Nathan, I think Mr Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

415
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:54,776
It's okay, darling.

416
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,625
Darling, darling, it's okay.

417
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:58,567
I'll drive carefully.

418
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:01,075
No, It's all right.

419
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:04,437
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

420
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:24,823
MARTIN: Christ.

421
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,280
It's Tricky Dicky. Look out.

422
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:30,829
All right, Richard?

423
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,199
Oh!

424
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,113
Martin Humphreys. '95.

425
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,645
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

426
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,187
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

427
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:42,952
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

428
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:45,943
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

429
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,609
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

430
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,286
Wasted opportunity, this one.

431
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:52,739
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

432
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:57,161
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

433
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,497
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

434
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:01,658
Ah!

435
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:03,778
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

436
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:05,667
The dragon. Ah!

437
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,311
And where have you been lying dormant, eh?

438
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,853
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

439
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:10,949
He's mine.

440
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,818
I mean, I'm his...
Um, I've been teaching him.

441
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:17,076
Ah. The plot thickens.

442
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,414
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

443
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,498
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

444
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:24,365
Oh, well, Nathan, darling. (CHUCKLES)

445
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:25,937
Um...

446
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:28,997
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

447
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,199
Yeah.

448
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,228
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

449
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,277
- All right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

450
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:53,616
Sorry.

451
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,832
RICHARD: Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

452
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,707
<i>(STUDENTS CHATTERING)</i>

453
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:02,708
Mingle. Mingle.

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,686
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

455
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,861
Hey. How do you do?

456
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:16,900
How do I do what?

457
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,860
I mean, what's your name?

458
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,939
- Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

459
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,530
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

460
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:28,410
Best thing is just to dive in.

461
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,814
Come. Sit down.

462
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:32,988
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

463
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:35,365
They won six golds again last year.

464
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:39,874
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

465
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:43,248
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
to possibly change.

466
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:45,520
Which I believe I technically am now.

467
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:48,321
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

468
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:52,204
came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

469
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:55,036
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

470
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:58,165
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,069
Don't worry, he's always like this.

00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:12,694
Pav is from India. Pav.

478
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,352
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

479
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:17,866
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

480
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,956
before we open that little Pandora's box.

481
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:21,731
- Oh, dear!
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

482
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,450
RICHARD: Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

483
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:32,247
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

484
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,117
Right, away you go, driver.

485
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,707
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

486
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:46,150
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

487
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,816
or whatever the insult du jour might be.

488
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:51,916
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

489
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,644
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

490
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:59,791
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

491
00:31:00,488 --> 00:31:03,747
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

492
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:08,150
Now, we will be training with four other
national teams in Taiwan.

493
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,447
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

494
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,771
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

495
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:16,693
Now we should, of course, be cordial

496
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:20,614
as it falls to us to host
the competition this year, in Cambridge.

497
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:22,776
But that doesn't mean we can't be ruthless.

498
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:27,653
Now, I want you up there
with the Chinese, top of the table.

499
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,643
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate

500
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,527
who does not win a medal.

501
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:40,195
Be under no illusion.
This is all about winning.

502
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,657
Although that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

508

511
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:13,602
How's that going?

512
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:19,895
Okay, so you're the shy type.

513
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:23,738
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

514
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:28,071
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

515
00:32:29,654 --> 00:32:30,614
What?

516
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:32,489
Nothing.

517
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:34,997
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

518

They do all seem good at maths, though.

519
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:41,780
REBECCA: Yeah.

520
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:46,618
Here you are neither weird
nor the best mathematician, I'm afraid.

521
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:49,491
You are painstakingly average.

I'll need to branch out into

523

to describe a unified field theory

00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:34,234
for the four fundamental forces of nature.

525
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,113
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

526
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:38,947
No.

527
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:41,311
But you are terribly gifted, aren't you?

528
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:44,954
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

Right, come on, get your bags. Chop-chop.

Can someone help the man, please?

01:00:54,936 --> 01:01:00,613

at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

905
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:02,352
As numbers.

906
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:07,390
We can call face-down cards...

907
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:11,651
One.

908
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:14,982
Face-up cards... Zero.

909
01:01:16,394 --> 01:01:20,471
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

910
01:01:20,602 --> 01:01:26,019
But after a while it would look
something like that.

911
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:30,614
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

912
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:35,598
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up

913
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:38,927
and the card immediately to the right of it

914
01:01:40,227 --> 01:01:43,806
could be that a one followed by a one,

915
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:47,650
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

916
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:54,647
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero

917
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:58,431
turning into a zero followed by a one.

918
01:02:00,644 --> 01:02:05,882
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

919
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:09,764
And that means?

920
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,276
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

How did your mum and dad explain it to you?

1110

When they found out.

1111
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,220

1127
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:36,475
When I speak to people
of a non-mathematical nature,

1128
01:19:38,054 --> 01:19:42,380
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1129
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:46,813
But if beauty is truth and truth is beauty,

1130
01:19:47,846 --> 01:19:50,975
well, then surely mathematics
is the most beautiful thing of all.

Which worries me.

And don't be distracted
