these "poor souls" were all

00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,358
I only want what's best for you.

164
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,273
I appreciate the thought.

165
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,362
But we're big girls.

166
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,198
We can handle ourselves.

167
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,036
Can't we?

168
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,364
Sure we can.

169
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,874
Hey, Butch.

170
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,912
Hey. How're you doing?

171
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,250
You taking care of yourself?

172
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,542
Yeah. Yeah. So, how're you doing?

173
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,423
You already asked her that.

174
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,965
(CLEARS THROAT) Listen, you guys should
take him up on his offer.

175
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,974
Gotham's full of rough characters.

176
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,052
You look great. By the way.

177
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,556
Wait over there. Please.

178
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,732
Poor bunny. Break-ups are hard.

179
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,397
I offered to kill you.

180
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,945
I thought it would raise his spirits,

181
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:54,079
and would be my pleasure seeing as how
you murdered my mother!

182
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,867
But he is nursing some foolish hope
that you two will get back together.

183
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,831
Love.

184
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,587
You can take your offer and stick it...

185
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,247
We'll think about it, Ozzie.

186
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,251
Fine.

187
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,590
But that's not the only reason I'm here.

188
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,844
Spread the word.

189
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,803
I want Fish Mooney,

190
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,095
and I will give a million dollars
to whoever can bring her to me.

191
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,061
Dead, or alive.

192
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,850
Chopped into pieces.

193
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,775
I want her.

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,532
You okay, Butch?

195
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,615
World getting you down?

196
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,705
Uh, I am fine, kid.

197
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,416
And you're too young to be in here. Scram.

198
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,039
Yeesh. Just trying to be nice.

199
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,465
Just seein' her kills me. You know?

200
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,757
Get over it.

201
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,222
And that child just stole your wallet.

202
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,147
(CAT YOWLING)

203
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,853
Hey.

204
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,110
Barbara and that whip lady
are gonna get angry,

205
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,111
you stealing from their customers.

206
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,147
Let 'em. I've got other things goin'.

207
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,783
- Like what?
- Top secret.

208
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,034
Let's eat. I'm starving.

209
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,823
Hey, kid. Take it. It's yours.

210
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,576
You keep feeding strays,
and one's gonna follow you home.

211
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,120
Like you? Come on.

212
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,337
Well, that should be the last of it.

213
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,889
I'll put the kettle on.

214
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,766
There is nothing like a sweet cup of tea

215
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,394
to make home feel like home
after a long trip away.

216
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,849
Eh, Master Bruce?

217
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,017
You all right?

218
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,402
Were we right to leave, Alfred?
Stay away all of this time?

219
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,365
Well, considering
the appalling state of the topiary,

220
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,280
I should say absolutely-bloody-not.

221
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,823
Alfred, you know what I mean.

222
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,081
I know you know why we left.

223
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,380
We had to leave.

224
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,382
You're nervous about tomorrow, aren't ya'?

225
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,588
Yes.

226
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,878
Well, you wouldn't be human
if you weren't.

227
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,298
So, why don't you go through there,
take a pew. Help your feet up.

228
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,968
And I'll see about that lovely cup of tea.
All right?

229
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,655
Saving that for someone special?

230
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,375
Coffee please.

231
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,927
"Search continues
for new Arkham Asylum director."

232
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,589
Right. Good luck finding anyone
to take that job.

233
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,436
I'm Valerie Vale.
Reporter for the Gazette.

234
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,093
I know who you are.

235
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,513
And you're James Gordon.
Son of a respected Gotham DA.

236
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,650
Former war hero. Former white knight cop.
Now bounty hunter.

237
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,488
You know,
someone should do a story on you.

238
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,111
Not interested.

239
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,772
Yeah. Me neither, actually.

240
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,453
You were there that night, at Indian Hill.

241
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,783
I've got nothing to say.

242
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,196
What about the fact that besides
Hugo Strange and his assistant,

243
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,615
no one else has been arrested?

244
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,785
Or that despite everything
pointing to Wayne Enterprises,

245
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,793
there seems to be zero investigation.

246
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,499
You're new to Gotham, aren't you?

247
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,835
Okay. This is where you tell me
things work differently here?

248
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,842
I'm not from Gotham.
But my dad's a cop. My brothers are cops.

249
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,628
And things work the same everywhere.

250
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,470
I was going to say, it's hard
to find a quiet bar in this city.

251
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,886
I like coming here.
Please don't make me find another.

252
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,305
Now, do you think Cobblepot's right,

253
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,473
that Fish Mooney's
organizing the escapees?

254
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,859
Penguin is a liar and a murderer.

255
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,440
Hmm. But?

256
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:02,365
But, based on the escapees,
and knowing Fish, I hope not.

257
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,285
Well, he's offering a million dollars
to whoever brings her in.

258
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,872
You're welcome.

259
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,562
It's a puzzle.

260
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,857
The trick is opening it.

261
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,697
The man at the store said
it's one of the most difficult ever made.

262
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,364
People pass it down unsolved
for generations.

263
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,959
A mathematician once went mad trying...

264
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,249
Yes.

265
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,418
Well, there you go. (LAUGHS)

266
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,379
It was a lovely thought.

267
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,927
And did you get the biscuits?

268
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,889
And the sweater?
I know how drafty these rooms are.

269
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,519
- Mr. Penguin...
- Oswald.

270
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,358
- When I think how I treated you...
- Stop.

271
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,016
Why are you being so kind?

272
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,604
Talking to you these past months,

273
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,486
I don't know how
I would've gotten by otherwise.

274
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,071
With Fish out there planning
who knows what.

275
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,078
Me being surrounded
by morons and lunatics.

276
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,788
I know the feeling.

277
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,256
Why didn't she kill me
when she had the chance?

278
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,093
I was powerless.

279
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,473
She must have a larger goal.
I need to know what she is doing.

280
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,134
DO you?

281
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,441
When Alexander encountered
the Gordian knot,

282
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,072
a knot so complex no one had
ever been able to untangle it,

283
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,823
he just removed his sword
and cut it in two. (CHUCKLES)

284
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,287
Details can be distracting.

285
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,920
Sometimes, a simple solution is best.

286
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,333
So no matter what she is planning,

287
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,001
just remember...

288
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:32,098
Penguins eat fish.

289
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,218
You know why we're here.

290
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,603
What are you doing here? Stop. Stop.

291
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,808
(GASPS)

292
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:36,037
So, what are we after?
It's not like they keep cash around.

293
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,745
For now, survival.

294
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,000
Don't move.

295
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,918
Hands.

296
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,297
Hands.

297
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,178
Of course.

298
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,140
Drop the gun.

299
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,350
Now knock yourself out.

300
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,820
That was awesome. How did you...

301
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,196
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fish.

302
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,036
I'm fine. Watch the door.

303
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,709
Yeah, that's the only company
that makes the drug. Fray Pharma.

304
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,966
They actually have a warehouse
here in Gotham.

305
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,444
You think they could be a target?

306
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,879
JIM: Yeah, they're the only pharmacy
that carries the drug.

307
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,264
If somebody wants it,
they'll have to go to the source.

308
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,265
Let me find the address.

309
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,596
That's all right.

310
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,617
James Gordon.

311
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,286
Hands where I can see 'em.

312
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,789
So, what?

313
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,050
You're here to collect the bounty
that Penguin has over my head?

314
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,927
What is it, a million dollars?

315
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,805
And to think I let that punk live.

316
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,561
Well then, I think you'd better cuff me.

317
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,975
Cuff yourself.

318
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,099
How many others you have with you?

319
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,893
They're all with me.

320
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,280
Every wretched soul
that Hugo Strange experimented on.

321
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,441
But tonight, just him.

322
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,447
(GRUNTING)

323
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,576
Did you hear them rats last night,
scurrying around in the attic?

324
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,959
Drove me bloody-bonkers.

325
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,084
Now, may I ask you,
what's the point of having a caretaker

326
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,248
if they can't take care of nothing, eh?

327
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,090
You all right, Master B?

328
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,386
Hungry. I should've eaten.

329
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,891
Excuse me, gentlemen.

330
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,066
I do this, there's no turning back.

331
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,898
No.

332
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,565
You say your piece.

333
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,160
We'll see about getting you
a proper breakfast, all right?

334
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,956
I'd like to thank the board
for giving me this time.

335
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,400
It will come as no surprise
I'd like to talk about Indian Hill.

336
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,432
I know preliminary investigations have
concluded Hugo Strange acted alone.

337
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,101
I reject this conclusion.

338
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,226
While trapped in Indian Hill,
I was led to believe

339
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,150
an unnamed group
had taken control of my company,

340
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,360
and it was they who hired Hugo Strange.

341
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,363
I left Gotham both for my own safety,

342
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,325
and so that I might have the time to
discover hard evidence of their existence.

343
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:48,994
(SCOFFS) A conspiracy theory?
That's why we're all here?

344
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,625
Excuse me, Master Bruce.

345
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,789
Pardon me, sir.
Might I have your name please?

346
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,130
- What?
- Your name. Please, sir.

347
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,804
Crowley.

348
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,558
Mr. Crowley, did your parents
never teach you any manners?

349
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,469
I don't have to listen to this.

350
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,353
Oh, but you do, sir.

351
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,561
That is precisely the point
that I am making.

352
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,814
I know how it sounds.

353
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,898
But I now have proof they exist.

354
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,368
And I can tell you that they're here.

355

356

You have 24 hours to contact me,
or the information that I've gathered

358
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,335
will be sent to every newspaper
and television station in Gotham.

359

You still paying for stuff
about the Indian Hill freaks?

Depends. If it's good.

I heard you ran into
Fish Mooney yesterday.

So?

388
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,291
So, are you still interested
in finding her?

389
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,836
Every cop in the city
is looking for her now.

390
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,876
But I know where she's gonna be next.

391
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,504
And why are you telling me?

392
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,293
You see, I need something from the cops.

393
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,259
They're not gonna tell me.
But Bullock still trusts you.

394
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,923
And you want me to lie to him.

395

A million dollars covers a lot of sins.

396
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,393
And obviously, I get to come along.

397

Aw, don't tell me you have a conscience?

398

400
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,614
So, after your run-in with Fish,

401
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,029
Barnes had us up all night,
rousting her old hideouts.

402
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,367
Yeah. Did you find anything?

403
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,282
Nada. But I did get what you asked for.

404
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,513
You wanna tell me what this is about?

405
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,378
It's a hunch. Probably nothing.

406
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,335
Look, if you've got a hot lead
you don't wanna share

407
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,057
so you can collect Penguin's million,
I got no problem with that.

408
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,427
Just don't get yourself killed
or me fired, okay?

409

I'll do my best. Hey. Get some rest, huh?

410

Hey.

411
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,401
When did you get back?

412
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,733
A couple days ago.

413
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,149
I tried to find you before I left.

414

No worries.

415
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,820
You remember what I discovered
that night at Indian Hill,

416
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,082
that there was a secret group
that had infiltrated my company.

417
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,913
I wasn't paying attention.

418
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,998
I needed time to research them.
I couldn't do it here.

419
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,458
Okay.

420
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,588
I have a plan,
but these people are powerful.

421

they know you and I are friends.

- Got it.

- I can see that.

Don't apologize.

Shoot, if I could fly to Italy
and eat pizza all day I would, too.

- Switzerland.

- Yeah.

in a building on Douglas and 80th.

441
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,451
Also, you could scream, but then
you'd have to tell the cops everything,

442
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,986

No reason you would.

But it's clear whatever you and Strange
did to her is making her sick.

get the information for her.

Someone who wouldn't suspect
being used. Maybe a reporter.

You cross me again,

485

I will have you skinned alive
and your head put on a pike.

And you.

487

you handled things while I was away.

488

I swear, I had this feeling right here.

489
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,865
I thought I was having a heart attack.

490
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,956
But it was pride, Bullock. In you.

491
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:20,295
The next time I have that feeling,
I'll know it was just gas.

492
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,173
You both better pray that we find her.

That Mooney was using us to find Peabody.

You mean using you?
Yeah, it's her kind of play.

- Sure.

I mean, can anyone understand him?

hoping it would send us back to you,

548

Your body is beginning to reject
the changes we made to your DNA.

You feel it every time
you use your ability.
