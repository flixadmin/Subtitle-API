00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,435
One thing we know for sure

170
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,522
is that they wanted this car.

171
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,441
Because something is in it.

172
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,195
If we find out what it is,
we'll know what we're up against.

173
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,340
HOBBS: All right, listen up! The men
we're after are professional runners.

174
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,260
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way

175
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,719
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

176
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,681
We find them, we take them as
a team, and we bring them back.

177
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,269
And above all else, we don't
ever, ever let them get into cars.

178
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,938
Crime scene is 10 hours old and
counting, men. Let's go hunting.

179
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,194
Agente Hobbs! Chief of
Police, João Alemeida.

180
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,446
Luke.

181
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,740
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

182
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,868
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

183
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,494
Let me tell you something about these two men.

184
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,080
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

185
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,999
He knows every way you're going to come for him.

186
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,169
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

187
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,796
spent half his life on the run avoiding folks like you.

188
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,716
Well, if there's anything we can do to help the DSS...

189
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,843
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

190
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,428
We have plenty in the public relations department.

191
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,305
Elena Neves.

192
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,266
- A patrol officer?
- You heard me.

193
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,227
But why? We have many
more experienced people.

194
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,313
I like her smile.

195
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,315
What's the second thing?

196
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,277
Stay the fuck out of my way.

197
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:03,697
(DRILLING)

198
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,164
- Brian.
- Hm?

199
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,042
I have something I have to tell you.

200
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,793
- (DOOR OPENING)
- VINCE: God damn.

201
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,670
What a mess!

202
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,132
Where you been, man?

203
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,759
(CHUCKLING)

204
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,762
You better check that tone.

205
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,680
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

206
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,265
Stop it!
Both of you.

207
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,728
Where were you, Vince?

208
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,941
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

209
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,652
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

210
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,819
Had to wait them out.

211
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,613
That is such horseshit.

212
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,839
- (SHOUTING) That was your job, and those were your guys!
- Hey!

213
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,450
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

214
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,327
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

215
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,495
Go walk it off.

216
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:10,180
REYES: Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

217
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:14,268
but, quite frankly, your business methods are too violent.

218
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,604
Let me tell you a true story.

219
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:22,109
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

220
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,654
each trying to get the country from their natives.

221
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:32,369
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

222
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,000
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

223
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,839
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

224
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,092
They came bearing gifts.

225
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,469
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

226
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,016
Things that the natives couldn't get on their own,

227
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,352
but to continue receiving them,
they had to work for the Portuguese.

228
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,898
And that's why all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

229
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,445
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

230
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,782
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

231
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,493
And that's the key.

232
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,372
I go into the favelas and give them something to lose.

233
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,208
Electricity, running water,

234
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,419
school rooms for their kids.

235
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,882
And for that taste of a better life,

236
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,385
I own them.

237
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,596
Gentlemen.

238
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,557
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

239
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,184
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

240
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,435
I apologize for the interruption.

241
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,521
Señor Reyes, may I speak with you?

242
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,107
We've found them.

243
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,778
Pardon me, gentlemen.

244
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,920
DOM: Almost wish
I didn't see that.

245
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,175
Almost.

246
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,302
Wait, Dom.

247
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,554
Mia was on that train.

248
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,264
(SHOUTING) My sister!

249
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,518
I didn't know. I wouldn't
do anything to hurt her.

250
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,937
You set up the deal!

251
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,648
I thought the job was for the cars.

252
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,858
I didn't know.

253
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,402
All they want is the chip.

254
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,114
Damn!

255
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,408
You should've come clean.

256
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,076
What's going on out here?

257
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,161
Nothing.

258
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,707
Please, Dom, just let me have
the chip. I can take this to them.

259
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,959
They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.

260
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,044
Get out.

261
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,924
What?

262
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,050
Get out!

263
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,227
You never listen to me.

264
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,981
Not when I told you he was a cop, and not now.

265
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:10,777
You never trust me and look where it's gotten us.

266
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,155
Look at our family now.

267
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:18,285
I can't go home! Your
sister is stuck in this life!

268
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,328
Where's Letty, Dom?

269
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:23,832
Where's Letty?

270
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,775
Plasma cutter.

271
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,111
Wilkes, I want a list of every place within 50 miles

272
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,946
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

273
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,157
Pass me that manifest.

274
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,832
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

275
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,293
- You asked for me?
- I did.

276
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,045
May I ask why?

277
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,547
My smile is not that great.

278
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,678
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

279
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,639
Six months later, you upped and joined the force.

280
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:21,973
You're motivated.

281
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,811
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who can't be bought.

282
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,312
Am I right?

283
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,732
- Yes.
- Of course I am.

284
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:31,983
Good news, bad news.

285
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,735
You know I like my dessert first.

286
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,779
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

287
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,864
Found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

288
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,658
One set of tracks headed west

289
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,410
until it hit the main highway, then disappeared.

290
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,787
But another set of tracks headed east.

291
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,248
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

292
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,917
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

293
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,585
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

294
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,878
Pretty easy in this scrub.

295
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,713
Can't move without leaving a sign.

296
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,257
Give me the damn veggies.

297
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,635
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

298
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,471
Not necessarily.

299
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,975
That road heads up through the hills into the favelas.

300
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,394
Couple of years ago, it was washed out by a storm.

301
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,855
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

302
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,108
If they headed that way, we'll pick up their tracks there.

303
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,443
You come prepared.

304
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,987
I'm motivated.

305
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,738
HOBBS: All right, then.

306
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,533
Let's find ourselves a car.

307
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:51,771
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

308
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,189
What do you think?

309
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,692
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

310
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:59,404
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.

311
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,323
Let's check this one.

312
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,454
Look at that.

313
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,956
Same building, same order every week.

314
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,875
It's a delivery schedule.

315
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,022
What's this?

316
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,441
Drugs?

317
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,444
No. That's a dealer pack.

318
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,446
See, most major players, they weigh their money

319
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,406
so they don't have to constantly count it.

320
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:44,824
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

321
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,868
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

322
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,038
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

323
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,164
Yeah.

324
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,125
(GUN COCKING)

325
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,064
I thought so.

326
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,110
So what is that?

327
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,821
A 100-million plus
in cash houses?

328
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,781
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

329
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,911
I think it's safe to say that

Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

he was at the kitchen table with
Mia, helping her with her homework.

Even after she went to sleep,

414

he'd stay up for a few more hours

415

chapter and help her the next day.

And he runs the drug scene down here.

He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

I thought this was business.

523

That's funny.

From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:33,483
Because it's worth it.

You should run, you know.

972

01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:46,621
You have every reason
to leave. Why stay?

Why do you?

975

My husband was a good police officer.

We both grew up here.

978

Two years ago he was murdered in the street

979
01:18:08,644 --> 01:18:10,395
right outside our door.

980
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:16,651
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

981
01:18:18,987 --> 01:18:21,280
But everything has a price.

982
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:25,743
The people here need a new start.

983
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:27,829
They need to be free.

(SIGHS)

985
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:39,340
You didn't kill those men in the train,

986
01:18:40,008 --> 01:18:41,300
did you?

987
01:18:45,848 --> 01:18:48,641
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?

988
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:56,816
Hey!

989
01:19:00,195 --> 01:19:01,904
Was she so special to you?

990
01:19:06,702 --> 01:19:09,036
I never thought anyone could understand how much.

991
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,875
But you do.

992
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:38,065
Yeah!

993
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:50,578
Close, but not enough.

994
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:52,705
Dom, the window is too small, man.

995
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:56,542
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.

996
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,631
And I know just where to get them.

Don't hurt yourself.

999
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:36,999
It's been a while since I've been
behind the wheel of one of these.

1000
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:39,210
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

Rome, what took you so long?

1003
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:52,723
I thought for sure you'd be showing up
with some chrome spinners or something.

1004
01:20:53,809 --> 01:20:54,809
Real funny.

you all in the next quarter-mile.</i>

Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

<i>Hundred thousand.</i>

We don't pull this job off, we're probably dead anyway.

1011
01:21:11,577 --> 01:21:13,619
Let's make it a million.

1012
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,831
I like that. All right, a
million-dollar quarter-mile.

1013
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,625
All right, then.

What do you say, Dom?

1016
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,132
We talking or we racing?

1017
01:21:27,593 --> 01:21:28,676
Just don't cheat this time.

1018
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:31,929
Got to let that go.

Typical, Roman.

1022
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:58,706
I'm going to get
this money. I'm hungry.

Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

No!

Not this time, Dom.

You got to want it, Brian.

Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

- Good race, O'Conner.
- Thanks, Dom.

1029

Do you know how long I've been waiting for that shit?

1030
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:17,952
I told you he didn't see it.

1031
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,870
Your man right there?

1032
01:23:19,955 --> 01:23:22,373
He let off the throttle at the line.

1033
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:25,167
You didn't do nothing.
He let you win.

You know me.
Money ain't a goddamn thing.

1072

It's going to take a little more
than money to learn how to cook.
