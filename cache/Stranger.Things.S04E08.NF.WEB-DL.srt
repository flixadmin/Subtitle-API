1
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,307
What have you done?

2
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,820
What have you done?

3
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,605
All done.

4
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,777
Not so bad, was it?

5
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,028
See?

6
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,781
There's nothing to be afraid of.

7
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,433
Is there, Nancy?

8
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,164
Why don't you take a seat?

9
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,960
No!

10
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:01,495
Nancy, just stay with me.
Stay with me, okay?

11
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,597
Whatever you guys are doing, hurry up!

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,084
Steve says you need to hurry!

13
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,669
- Yeah? No shit!
- We're trying. We can't find anything.

14
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:12,506
- What is all this shit?
- What are you even looking for?

15
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,967
Madonna, Blondie, Bowie, Beatles?
Music! We need music!

16
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,137
This is music!

17
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,121
Son of a…

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,873
God!

19
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,192
Nancy.

20
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,966
What are you doing?

21
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,954
It's not time for you to leave.

22
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:54,507
Now that you've seen where I've been…

23
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,221
…I would like very much to show you

24
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,473
where I am going.

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,085
Take a seat, Nancy.

26
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:57,961
I…

27
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,631
Want you to tell

28
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,758
Eleven.

29
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,096
I want you to tell her

30
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:10,290
everything you see.

31
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,838
No!

32
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,315
No!

33
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,112
- Tell her…
- No!

34
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:25,389
…everything.

35
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,932
No!

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,685
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,581
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

38
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,483
It's okay. I'm here.

39
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,610
I'm right here.

40
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,197
What's going on there?

41
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,617
Get the power back on!

42
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:13,247
Tell him that the prisoners
are contained...

43
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,100
and that you're working on the power.

44
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,002
Tell him!

45
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,961
And that door there, where does it lead?

46
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,396
To... to cell block two...

47
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,440
No cell blocks!

48
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,591
I need a safe way out of here.

49
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,840
Guess you got
my message, huh?

50
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,915
Oh, no, I just have always wanted
to visit the Soviet Union.

51
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,584
With Murray.

52
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,336
You two getting along?

53
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:48,798
He's the Star sky to my Hutch.

54
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,576
I thought you were dead.

55
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,764
Thought I lost you.

56
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,519
I did lose you.

57
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,605
For eight months.

58
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,610
We had a funeral.

59
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,946
Anybody show?

60
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,531
Are you kidding?

61
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,910
You're the hero of Hawkins.

62
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,079
It's true.

63
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,334
Yeah, I always felt
I'd be easier to like when I was dead.

64
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:29,588
How about El?

65
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,509
She's good.

66
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,846
She misses her dad.

67
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,598
We all do.

68
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,043
Uh, I hate to interrupt,

69
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:45,004
but apparently, they can climb too.

70
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,137
Lower your weapons.

71
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,805
Lower your weapons!

72
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,182
Don't shoot!

73
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,624
Stop!

74
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,987
The hell is that?

75
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,675
Please tell me they don't have
another one of those things.

76
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,922
You can't go in there!

77
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,231
It's dangerous!

78
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,444
It's dangerous!

79
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,902
Oh my God.

80
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,753
The hell are they doing?

81
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,538
Hey.

82
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,706
Found something.

83
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:03,287
- Think this'll lead us outta here?
- I give it a hundred to one odds.

84
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,388
And one, two, three.

85
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,100
And one, two, three.

86
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,184
Again.

87
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,312
One, two, three.

88
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,212
Pulse is dropping.
One-fifty now. BP's 160…

89
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,760
How do you feel?

90
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,096
Can you hear us?

91
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,517
Eleven. Can you hear us?

92
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,524
No, leave her.

93
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,092
Hi, Jane.

94
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:35,248
Holy shit, dude. Check it out.

95
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:38,601
I didn't know they expanded into Nevada.

96
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,063
Watch out, Domino's.

97
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:44,942
Your dominoes are gonna fall.

98
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,470
How far is Nina from Vegas?

99
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,553
From Vegas?

100
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,224
Um, as long as
Suzie's coordinates are right,

101
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,100
about another 90 miles. Why?

102
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:57,645
Well, once we save her, El,
we should stop on the way back.

103
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,191
El could make us, like, super rich,
and we'd never have to work.

104
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:05,028
We could just play D&D and Nintendo
for the rest of our lives.

105
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:07,047
Yeah. Totally.

106
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,576
We're gonna make it, Mike.
She's gonna be okay.

107
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,721
Yeah, I know. I… I know she is.

108
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,475
But… But what if
after all this is over, she…

109
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,628
Sh… she doesn't need me anymore?

110
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,504
No, o… of course she'll still need you.

111
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,130
She'll always need you, Mike.

112
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,150
I keep telling myself that, but I…

113
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,302
I don't believe it.

114
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:32,114
I mean, she's special.

115
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,472
She was born special.

116
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,368
Maybe I was one of the first people
to realize that.

117
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,479
But the truth is,
when I stumbled on her in the woods,

118
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:40,980
she just needed someone.

119
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,567
It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny.
It's just simple dumb luck.

120
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,278
And one day she's gonna realize
I'm just some random nerd

121
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,447
that got lucky
that Superman landed on his doorstep.

122
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,408
I mean, at least Lois Lane

123
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:54,135
is an ace reporter
for the Daily Planet, right? But…

124
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,288
- Sorry.
- No.

125
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,375
No, I… it's so stupid,
given everything that's going on.

126
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,977
It's just… I… I don't know, I just…

127
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,044
Uh…

128
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,629
You're scared of losing her.

129
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,485
Can I show you something?

130
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,423
This is amazing.

131
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:34,384
Did you paint this?

132
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,702
Yeah. Yeah. I mean…

133
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,038
I mean… I mean, El asked me to.

134
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,459
She commissioned it, basically.
I mean, she told me what to draw.

135
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,477
Anyway, my point is,

136
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,546
see how you're leading us here?

137
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:48,840
You're guiding the whole party,
inspiring us.

138
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:50,424
That… That's what you do.

139
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,010
And see your coat of arms here?
It's a heart.

140
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,553
And I know it's sort of on the nose,

141
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,057
but that's what
holds this party together. Heart.

142
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,370
Because, I mean,
without heart, we'd all fall apart.

143
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,163
Even El. Especially El.

144
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:10,194
These past few months,
she's been so lost without you.

145
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:14,508
It's just, she's so different
from other people, and…

146
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,952
…when you're…
when you're different,

147
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,453
sometimes…

148
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,223
…you feel like a mistake.

149
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,169
But you make her feel like
she's not a mistake at all.

150
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:28,171
Like she's better for being different.

151
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,881
And that gives her
the courage to fight on.

152
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,465
If she was mean to you

153
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,718
or she seemed like
she was pushing you away,

154
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,805
it's because she's scared of losing you,
like you're scared of losing her.

155
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,597
And if she was going to lose you,

156
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,849
I… I think she'd rather just
get it over with quick.

157
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,576
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

158
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,855
So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.

159
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,665
And she always will.

160
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,419
Yeah?

161
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,336
Yeah.

162
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,468
After the attack,

163
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,069
you fell into a coma.

164
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,615
Like One, you had pushed yourself
beyond your limit.

165
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,077
And it very nearly destroyed you.

166
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,748
But that is where your similarities ended.

167
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:12,959
What you displayed that day

168
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,569
was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.

169
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,823
A potential I'd only dreamed of.

170
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,263
But when you awoke,

171
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,183
something had been lost.

172
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,353
Your memories,

173
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,756
along with whatever else
you'd found within yourself that day.

174
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,175
But I knew then, just as I knew today,

175
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,260
that your powers had not been lost.

176
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,013
They just needed a spark.

177
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,660
But that day,

178
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,019
you awakened something else.

179
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,146
A doorway to another world.

180
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,211
I always thought that Henry was out there,

181
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,463
hiding in the darkness.

182
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,428
I didn't know for sure,
not beyond a feeling.

183
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,179
Until now.

184
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,228
He's claimed three victims so far,
and when I saw the eyes,

185
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,814
I knew… I knew that was him.

186
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,901
He was sending us a message,
letting us know he's back.

187
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,195
That's when I came to see you.

188
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:30,327
My friends.

189
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:32,771
Well, we… we haven't risked contact,

190
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,731
but, as far as we know,

191
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,876
they're… they're all safe.

192
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,172
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven.

193
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,673
Your friends are in terrible danger.

194
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,951
With each victim he takes,

195
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,259
Henry is…

196
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,266
Chiseling away at the barrier that exists
between our two worlds.

197
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,976
"Chiseling"?

198
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,836
Imagine, if you will,

199
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,396
the barrier between our worlds is a…

200
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,132
Concrete dam.

201
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,819
Henry is putting cracks in this dam.

202
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,346
Cracks in dams

203
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,824
create pressure.

204
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,076
Left unchecked,

205
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,578
the pressure will build.

206
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,355
And build.

207
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,250
And eventually,
it will reach a breaking point.

208
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,652
And the dam will burst.

209
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:22,713
And when that happens,

210
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,299
Hawkins will fall.

211
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, that went very well, I thought.

212
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,170
You eased her into it, nice and gentle,
just like we talked about.

213
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,546
Not ominous at all.

214
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,648
He showed me

215
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:25,943
things that haven't happened yet.

216
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,739
The most awful things.

217
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,411
I saw

218
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,746
a dark cloud

219
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,332
spreading over Hawkins.

220
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,917
Downtown on fire.

221
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,712
Dead soldiers.

222
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,964
And this…

223
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,595
Giant creature

224
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,414
with… a gaping mouth.

225
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,517
And this creature wasn't alone.

226
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,644
There were so many monsters.

227
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:03,565
An army.

228
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,484
And they were coming into Hawkins.

229
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,988
Into our neighborhoods.

230
00:23:11,263 --> 00:23:12,489
Our homes.

231
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,450
And then…

232
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,413
He showed me my mom.

233
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:21,415
And Holly.

234
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,209
Mike.

235
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,545
And they…

236
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,673
They were all…

237
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,682
Okay, but… he's just trying
to scare you, Nance.

238
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,602
Right? I mean…

239
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,795
I mean, it's not real.

240
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:44,146
Not yet.

241
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:49,361
But there… there was something else.

242
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,637
He showed me gates.

243
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,034
Four gates.

244
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,287
Spreading across Hawkins.

245
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,857
And these gates, they looked like
the one outside of Eddie's trailer,

246
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,527
but… they didn't stop growing.

247
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,673
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.

248
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,258
This was our Hawkins.

249
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,259
Our home.

250
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,223
Four chimes.

251
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,351
Vecna's clock.

252
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:25,646
It always chimes four times.

253
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,816
Four exactly.

254
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,111
I heard them too.

255
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,660
He's been telling us his plan
this whole time.

256
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:40,703
Four kills.

257
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,205
Four gates.

258
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,068
End of the world.

259
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,586
If that's true…

260
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,865
He's only one kill away.

261
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,785
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

262
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,470
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.

263
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,968
- Anything?
- No.

264
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,760
Rang a few times,
then went to busy signal.

265
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,596
Maybe you punched it wrong.
Try again.

266
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,223
- I didn't punch it in wrong.
- Well, I don't know.

267
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:20,058
I think she knows
how to use a phone.

268
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,619
I'm just saying,
she could've typed it in wrong.

269
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,108
- Same shit.
- How is that possible?

270
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,862
Joyce has this telemarketer job.
Always on the phone.

271
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:32,320
Mike won't stop whining about it.

272
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:36,009
Yeah, but this phone's been busy
for, what, three days now?

273
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,594
That's not Joyce.

274
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,971
No way. Something's wrong.

275
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:41,913
She's right.

276
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,976
It can't be just coincidence. It can't be.

277
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:49,172
Whatever's happening in Lenora
is connected to all of this.

278
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,481
I'm sure of it.

279
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,903
But Vecna can't hurt them.

280
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,263
Not if he's dead.

281
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:01,349
We have to go back in there.
Back to the Upside Down.

282
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,185
- Whoa, no, no, no. What?
- Nope.

283
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,645
- Let's think this through.
- What is there to think through?

284
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,523
- We barely made it out of there.
- Yeah, because we weren't prepared.

285
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,943
But this time, we will be.
We'll get weapons and protection.

286
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,071
We'll go through the gate,
we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him.

287
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,365
Or he'll kill us.

288
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,451
The only reason you survived
is because he wanted you to.

289
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,204
- He's not scared of us.
- And for good reason.

290
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:25,458
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.

291
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,959
Sorry, what are we calling him now?

292
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,126
- One.
- Vecna.

293
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,420
- Henry.
- Right.

294
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:31,963
We've learned something new
about Vecna/Henry/One.

295
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,257
He's a number like Eleven,

296
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,635
only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering
version of her with really bad skin.

297
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,346
But my… my point is, he's super powerful.

298
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,391
Could turn us inside out with a snap
of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.

299
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:43,976
Then why fight fair?

300
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:47,395
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives us an upper hand.

301
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,147
We know Eleven's strengths.

302
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:51,275
And weaknesses.

303
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:52,692
Weaknesses?

304
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,237
When El remote-travels,

305
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,031
she goes into
this sort of trance-like state.

306
00:26:58,115 --> 00:26:59,407
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

307
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,618
That would explain
what he was doing in that attic.

308
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:04,079
Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,

309
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:07,625
I'll bet you he's back in that attic,
physical body defenseless.

310
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,794
Defenseless? What about the army of bats?

311
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,128
True. We'll have to find a way past them.

312
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:13,422
Distract them somehow.

313
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,967
- And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?
- No idea.

314
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,759
But once they're gone,

315
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,261
he doesn't stand a chance.

316
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,306
It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula
in his coffin.

317
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,974
That all sounds good in theory,

318
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,059
but there is no pattern
to Vecna's killings.

319
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,644
Not one that I can decipher.

320
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,814
We don't know
when he's going to attack next.

321
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,916
- Don't even know who he's going to attack.
- Yeah, we do.

322
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:34,777
I can still feel him.

323
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,337
I'm still marked.

324
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,673
Cursed.

325
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,885
I ditch Kate Bush,

326
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:44,869
I draw his focus back to me.

327
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:46,346
Max.

328
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,515
You can't.

329
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,351
He'll kill you.

330
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,961
I survived before.

331
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,856
I can survive again.

332
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:01,554
I just need to keep him busy long enough
so that you guys can get into that attic.

333
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:04,281
Then you can chop his head off.

334
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:08,144
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up
with some explosive Dustin cooks up.

335
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,480
I honestly don't care
how you put this asshole in his grave.

336
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,397
Just…

337
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,210
…whatever it is…

338
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,546
Whatever you do…

339
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,218
Try not to miss.

340
00:29:58,253 --> 00:29:59,296
Bam.

341
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,297
Durak.

342
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,840
Son of a bitch!

343
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,384
Sayonara!

344
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,393
Oh God! Oh God!

345
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,050
Son of a bitch!

346
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,099
- You okay? All right?
- Yeah.

347
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:56,203
- You okay?
- Okay? I'm great! Whoo!

348
00:30:56,604 --> 00:31:00,732
Oh, nothing like a little prison escape
to get your day started, am I right?

349
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,151
We're not out of the woods yet.

350
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:05,362
My people do not take kindly to escapes.
They'll be hunting us.

351
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:09,342
Yeah, well, we aren't exactly
planning on sticking around.

352
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:14,096
- Where's the plane you came in on?
- That plane? Um, that crashed.

353
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,957
- Crashed?
- His fault.

354
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,042
A word of warning.

355
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:23,087
That man is more slippery
than an eel dipped in baby oil.

356
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,839
I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth.

357
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:27,425
My tongue. My tongue!

358
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:28,885
I… I can't feel my tongue.

359
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,596
We need to get out of here,
back to the States.

360
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,848
Can you get us to another plane?

361
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:34,892
Now?

362
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,684
You're asking for Yuri's help

363
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,688
after dragging him through miles
of shit tunnel?

364
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:43,275
I could have told you
we are going wrong way hours ago.

365
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:44,692
You Neanderthal...

366
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,238
Watch your mouth, or I am gonna take this,

367
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,781
I'm gonna rub it along
the bottom of my shoe,

368
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:53,326
and I'm gonna jam it down your throat.

369
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,869
Well, go ahead!

370
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:57,957
But then you'll never
make it out of my country alive.

371
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,583
So you can get us out.

372
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:02,728
For a glass of water and hot steam bath

373
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:06,339
and five-inch stack of American dollars,

374
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:10,051
Yuri will fly you to moon.

375
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:13,029
You make another demand,
you double-crossing mudak,

376
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,766
I'll decorate the roof of this Van
with your brains.

377
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:19,144
Why so angry, comrade?

378
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,913
Rough couple of days for you, I'm sure.

379
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,941
But now you are free.

380
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,295
Everything works out.
Happy ending for everybody.

381
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:28,403
No?

382
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:33,925
For you, that will very much
depend on how you answer. Comrade.

383
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,287
Will you take us to America?

384
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,680
Yes?

385
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:41,791
Or no?

386
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,528
Check this out. The War Zone.

387
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:54,471
I've been there once.

388
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,431
It's huge.

389
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,451
They got everything you need for, uh…

390
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,728
Well, killing things, basically.

391
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:02,520
You think fake Rambo has
enough guns there?

392
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,190
Is that a grenade?
I mean, how is any of this legal?

393
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:07,233
Well, lucky for us it is, so…

394
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:10,194
This… This place is just far enough
outside of Hawkins.

395
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:12,323
As long as we steer clear of main roads,

396
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:15,742
we ought a be able to avoid cops
and, uh, angry Hicks.

397
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:17,744
If we're trying to avoid angry Hicks,

398
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:20,580
maybe we shouldn't go
to some store called the War Zone.

399
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:23,416
Normally, I'd agree,
but we need the weapons.

400
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,836
- So I think it's worth the risk.
- Me too.

401
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,006
But is it worth the time?
It'll take all day to bike there and back.

402
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:32,050
- Who said anything about bikes?
- You got some car we don't know about?

403
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,862
It's not exactly a car, Steve.

404
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,346
And it's not exactly mine,

405
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,032
but, uh… it'll do.

406
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:44,872
Hey, Red, uh, you got a ski mask
or a bandanna, something like that?

407
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,286
That was suffocating.

408
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,913
Go! Come on.

409
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,244
Where'd you learn how to do this?

410
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,248
Well, when the other dads were teaching
their kids how to fish or play ball,

411
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,918
my old man was teaching me
how to hot-wire.

412
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:52,338
Now, I swore to myself
I wouldn't wind up like he did,

413
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:55,050
but now I'm wanted for murder,

414
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,927
and soon, Grand Theft Auto.

415
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,847
So, uh, I'm really living up to
that Munson name.

416
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,224
Eddie, I'm not sure
I love the idea of you driving.

417
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,519
Oh, I'm just starting this sucker.
Harrington's got her.

418
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,079
Don't ya, big boy?

419
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:12,650
What the hell?

420
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,277
Hey! Open this door!

421
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,155
- Hey!
- They locked the door!

422
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,465
Shit! Go.

423
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,869
It's just a car.
Everybody, hang on to something!

424
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,454
Oh my God! Let's go! Let's go!

425
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,496
Drive, Steve! Drive!

426
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,789

00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:23,764
- They are not safe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

444
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:26,074
Uh, just give us a second, please.

445

Please.

Okay, okay, first… first things first.

447
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,940
We're not gonna let anything happen
to your friends, okay, kiddo?

448
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,210
I will personally make sure of that.

449
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:38,920
Did… Did you see where they were?

450
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,532
They were at… They were at Max's house.

451
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,367
They're planning to kill him.

452
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,492
To kill Henry.

453
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,804
Okay. Okay.

454
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,681
This… Does this Max have a last name?

455
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,126
Max… Max Mayfield.

456
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,043
Okay. So here's what's gonna happen.

457
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,090
I have people in Hawkins,
and I'm gonna send some to Max Mayfield.

458
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,925
- And they will stop him...
- Her.

459
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,302
Stop her. And the rest of them

460
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:04,847
from whatever foolish,
although well-intentioned, mission

461
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,222
that they're attempting, alright?

462
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:08,684
No. No, do not send your men.

463
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,684
Send me.

464
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:13,289
Your friends are not prepared
for this fight, Eleven.

465
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:15,356
And neither are you.

466
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,527
You must understand,

467
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,588
when One kills, he doesn't simply kill.

468
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,423
He consumes.

469
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:26,076
He takes everything from his victims.

470
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,012
Everything they are
and everything they ever will be.

471
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,639
Their memories, their abilities.

472
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,978
And we do not know
where he's been these lost years.

473
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:40,007
But if he has survived this long,

474
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,007
we can only assume

475
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,818
that he has grown in strength.

476
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,155
To underestimate him,

477
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,074
to act rashly,

478
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:50,909
would be very dangerous.

479
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,565
I don't want to upset you, Eleven.

480
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:59,443
What you've accomplished
is nothing short of a miracle.

481
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,672
You came to me broken.

482
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,509
And you've learned to walk again.

483
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:09,010
But if you want to stop One,

484
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,621
you will need to do more than walk.

485
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,724
You will need to do more than run.

486
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,768
You will need to fly.

487
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:19,230
And you're not ready.

488
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,650
My friends need me.

489
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,135
I've stopped him once. I will again.

490
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:28,239
I'm sorry. You can't.

491
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,639
It's impossible.

492
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,990
Nothing's impossible.

493
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,978
I can call Stinson. She's got connections
at Nellis. That's two hours away.

494
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,023
And if we hustle, I'll bet we can be
in Hawkins before nightfall.

495
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,525
That would be a grave mistake.

496
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:42,860
Waiting would be an even greater mistake.

497
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,278
What if One makes his move

498
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:46,489
before we've had a chance
to throw a punch?

499
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,115
Then what is the point of all this?

500
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,427
That's a risk we're going to have to take.

501
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:53,413
We pushed her before
and look what happened.

502
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:56,958
She lifted a 10,000-pound tank
into the goddamn air.

503
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,918
You don't understand what he's capable of!

504
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,880
Maybe you're right.
Or maybe you are overestimating him.

505
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:05,509
Either way, doesn't matter
because this is not our choice.

506
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,677
We agreed this was not gonna be a prison.

507
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,012
We'll show her what this is,

508
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,429
what we can offer,

509
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,016
and then it is her choice
whether she wants to stay or go.

510
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,326
Right, Doc?

511
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,896
You may not agree with it,

512
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,000
but here she is, standing before us,

513
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,835
making a choice.

514
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:26,505
You're sure you wanna do this?

515
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:32,802
Okay. Pack your things, say your goodbyes.

516
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,085
- How's it handle?
- Not half bad.

517
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,588
Considering that this is a…

518
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:10,699

It's silly, but I… I've actually…

522
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:25,755
I always had this dream that I'd have
this really… really big family.

523
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm talking, like, uh,

524
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,092
a full brood of Harringtons.

525
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:30,719
Like, five, six kids.

526
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:32,804
- Six?
- Yeah. Six little nuggets.

527

Three girls, three boys.

528
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:40,061
And… and every summer,
I figured all of us Harringtons,

529
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,981
we would pack into something like this

530
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:47,418
and… just see the country.

531
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,614
You know, the Rockies, Grand Canyon,

532
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,715
maybe Yellowstone.

533
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,871
End up in some beach side town
in California.

534
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:00,349
Spend a week parked in the sand.

535
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,603
Learn how to surf or something.

536
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,231
That sounds nice.

537
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,275
Yeah?

538
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,693
Yeah.

539
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,141
Well, uh, except for the six-kid part.

540
00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:21,143
That sounds like a total nightmare.

541
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,414
If only I had some practice.

542
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,666
All right. Fair.

543
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,918

549
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,382
So I've been thinking,

550
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:54,302
two of the three of Vecna's victims
were seeing Ms. Kelley, right?

551
00:41:54,385 --> 00:41:55,719
- Yeah.
- Okay.

552
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,641
So I figure there's a good chance
Vecna cursed another one of her students.

553
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:03,018
We go back to her office.
We read all of her files.

554
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,813
Look for mentions of headaches,
nosebleeds, nightmares.

555
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,525
- We identify his most likely next victim.
- Lucas.

556
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:10,474
- We stake out his house...
- Lucas, stop.

557
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:13,130
We don't have time for any of that, okay?

558
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,757
And even if we did,

559
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,717
even if your plan did work,

560
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,911
we'd be putting a total stranger at risk.

561
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,599
A stranger who has no idea
what they're up against.

562
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:25,099
I do.

563
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,144
He uses my memories against me.

564
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,340
But… only my darkest memories.

565
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:35,677
- Same with Chrissy and Fred, right?
- Right.

566
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,530
It's like he only sees the darkness in us.

567
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:43,869
So, I'll just run
in the opposite direction.

568
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,813
Run to the light.

569
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:51,251
And maybe he won't be able
to find me there.

570
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:54,922
Now, how exactly
do you plan on doing this?

571
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,632
I'm not sure.

572
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,260
But it's my mind.

573
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,639
Not his, right?

574
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,833
So I should be able to control where I am.

575
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:10,144
I just need to… push him away.

576
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:14,148
Find a happy memory and hide there.

577
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,193
Hide in the light.

578
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,949
You got a memory in mind?

579
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,284
Yeah.

580
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,829
It was a time when I was

581
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,456
the happiest.

582
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,300
Was I there?

583
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,329
That's presumptuous of you.

584
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:47,641
But yeah.

585
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,101
You might've been there.

586
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,065
Okay, but the second you start to lift,

587
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,527
I'm calling in Kate Bush.

588
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,737
- All right?
- Okay.

589
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,574
- Deal.
- Deal.

590
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,650
Heh, come on. This way.

591
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:44,847
If I get a whiff
of any funny business, smuggler...

592
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:46,724
I will not hesitate to kill you.

593
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,103
In fact... I am just looking for a reason.
Understand?

594
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:53,940
Are you a parrot, cop?
You keep repeating the same thing.

595
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:57,152
You were trapped in a cell
with this dull man

596
00:44:57,235 --> 00:45:00,030
and you didn't take opportunity
to smother him.

597
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,335
Beautiful, yes?

598
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,880
Please tell me this is another poor joke.

599
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:20,759
You said you had a plane.

600
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:22,635
- A plane!
- No, no, no.

601
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,197
I… I told you I could fly you home.

602
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,682
And Katinka can fly you home, little bird.

603
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:32,186
She was named Katinka
after my first lover.

604
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,483
Katinka also had
very beautiful, very round buttocks.

605
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,335
Uh, mu… much like this.

606
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:44,114
This cannot fly us to America.

607
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,367
Why not?

608
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,619
As long as winds are not too strong

609
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:51,373
and your military friends
do not shoot us out of sky,

610
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:52,831
we can make it to the coast.

611
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,876
There, while we refuel,

612
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,795
we skin dip in ice-cold water
and wash off this muck.

613
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,923
Then we fly her rest of the way.

614
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:02,217
Happy ending.

615
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,362
Okay, what is the furthest
Katinka has ever flown?

616
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,742
For me, she is still a virgin.

617
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:14,061
Uh, not real Katinka. Goodness, no.

618
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,108
That Katinka, no.

619
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,068
But this Katinka, pretty much unspoiled.

620
00:46:21,152 --> 00:46:25,072
But I'm sure she will soar
when given a chance.

621
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,842
She just need little tune-up.

622
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,789
- I did warn you, Jim.
- Okay.

623
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:35,708
Should I shoot him now? Or later?

624
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,210
What about Owens?

625
00:46:37,293 --> 00:46:42,257
He… He's gotta have contacts or spies here
that could help us.

626
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,692
Can we do that?

627
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,302
Can we make a call to the States?

628
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:59,123
Yes, hello, miss.

629
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,777
I'd like to place a call to
the United States. A very sick relative.

630
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,048
Correct. Yes... The number is...

631
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:10,159
- The number?
- It's 775…

632
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,786
…305…

633
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,681
…3450.

634
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,101
Da, spasibo.

635
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,173
- What are you doing?
- How exactly do you think this works?

636
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:27,177
They will make the call for us,
and then they will call us back.

637
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,862
How long's that gonna take?

638
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:31,947
Five minutes. Five hours.

639
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:34,117
Five days. Who knows?

640
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:36,686
And when we do get the call,

641
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:40,648
assume the KGB will be on the other line,
listening to everything you say.

642
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:41,956
So,

643
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:44,418
I suggest talking in code.

644
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:46,713
Say the wrong thing

645
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,382
and they will be on us like flies on shit.

646
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,344

- Yep.
- Definitely.

651
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,632
♪ Don't ya know
I'm never gonna lose that funky sound?… ♪

652
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,554
- How many of these do you think we need?
- Five or six.

653
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:47,757
What are you gonna do? Stand and gawk?

654
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,065
Shut up.

655
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,652
Ah!

656
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,179
Jesus, you scared me.

657
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,391
Whoa. You gonna mace me with that?

658
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:58,601
If it keeps you in line, yeah.

659
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:08,335
See? Not so scary.

660
00:49:17,244 --> 00:49:18,554
Robin. Robin!

661
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:21,014
Who's that?

662
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,434
Someone from band.

663
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,715
How much is this?

664
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,152
$120.99, but I'll throw in
20 rounds of buckshot for ya.

665
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:37,891
Hey, can I see
this real pretty .357, please?

666
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,702
Sure thing.

667
00:49:41,686 --> 00:49:44,039
- Here you go, son.
- Thank you.

668
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,126
Nancy Wheeler.

669
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:54,657
Wouldn't expect to find you here.

670
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:59,161
Yeah, well, it's just… scary times.

671
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:09,105
I'm… sorry about Chrissy.

672
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,277
Want my advice?

673
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:19,990
Shotguns are not good for much of anything
past killing small birds.

674
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:24,204
I mean, they got power, sure,

675
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:25,789
but not much range.

676
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,733
And that's just gonna force you
into close-range combat,

677
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,777
then someone can
just grab that barrel like this…

678
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:34,713
…and redirect it.

679
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,061
Well, you look nervous.

680
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:50,603
Like I said,

681
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,525
scary times.

682
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:58,405
Now, your brother, he, uh…

683
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:02,117
Is he here with you, by chance?

684
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,701
Mike?

685
00:51:03,976 --> 00:51:05,369
Mike.

686
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:07,036
No.

687
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,498
I only ask because he's…

688
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,295
He's in Hellfire, isn't he?

689
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:17,268
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What about his friends?

690
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,342
They here with you?

691
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:21,302
Would you let go?

692
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,264
Let go.

693
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:32,588
What the hell is taking so long?

694
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,298
- What happened?
- Gotta go.

695
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:37,652
- Your old friends are here.
- Shit!

696
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,887
- Let's go! Let's go!
- I'm going! I'm going! Sit down!

697
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,784
Should be up on our right.

698
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,411
There's nothing out here.

699
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:07,498
Mmm. We there already?

700
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:11,460
- Already? It's been nine hours.
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.

701
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,295
What are we looking for, my dudes?

702
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,173
- Some sort of facility.
- A fence. A building.

703
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:17,884
Any signs of life would be nice.

704
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:21,987
Since when did we decide Nina
was a building and not a small woman?

705
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,347
Sounds like a small woman to me.

706
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:25,807
It's not a small woman.

707
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:28,186
Small woman out in this desert
would be hard to see.

708
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:31,646
- How is he still high?
- Sure you got your measurements right?

709
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,690
Yes, they're right.

710
00:52:32,773 --> 00:52:34,233
- You're 100%, right?
- Yes.

711
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,402
Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.

712
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:39,655
- Are you really questioning Suzie?
- She's a genius, Jonathan.

713
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,782
- Even geniuses make mistakes.
- Well, she didn't.

714
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,286
If that small woman is small enough,
she could fit behind a small tree.

715
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:46,637
Stop! Just…

716
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,375
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

717
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,795
I am stopping us before we get more lost.

718
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,340
- Give me the coordinates.
- Um, okay.

719
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,802
Longitude is 116 degrees,
five minutes, and 17...

720
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,054
Slow down. Slow down.

721
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:06,657
Nina!

722
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:10,829
Nina.

723
00:53:12,396 --> 00:53:13,621
Nina?

724
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,001
Nina!

725
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,702
Holy macaroni.

726
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:30,722
All right. You just go straight down.
Like, straight… straight…

727
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,460
Right on the money, as I said.

728
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,813
- It just doesn't make sense.
- Yo, dudes!

729
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,715
My dudes!

730
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,842
Jesus Christ.

731
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,635
Come check this shit out!

732
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,054
What is it?

733
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:47,407
Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes!

734
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:49,599
Come on! Hurry!

735
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,619
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!

736
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:55,438
Okay.

737
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,400
So no small woman named Nina.

738
00:53:57,483 --> 00:54:00,318
But you said any signs of life,
am I right?

739
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:01,237
Right.

740
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,545
Well,

741
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,244
these are no regular
tire tracks, brochachos.

742
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:10,804
I mean, look at the tread
on these monsters.

743
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,000
They're fatties.
And you know what that means.

744
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,309
Military.

745
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,811
We gotta go.

746
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,295
Well, I wouldn't do it
if I didn't think she was ready.

747
00:54:59,378 --> 00:55:02,130
But either way,
I don't think we have any other choice.

748
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,548
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

749
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:04,634
Yeah.

750
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:07,344
- It might take me some time though.
- Just… As fast as you can.

751
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,389
It's gonna take us two hours
to get to Nellis as it is.

752
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:11,849
And, Ellen, one more favor.

753
00:55:11,932 --> 00:55:15,186
Can you send somebody over
to a Max Mayfield's house?

754
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,271
There are some kids there
that just need looking after, okay?

755
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,275
Ellen? Hello?

756
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:22,818
Sam? Hello?

757
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:30,175
Why the long face, Doc?

758
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,135
We just wanna talk.

759
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,844
No! Wait!

760
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:15,387
No! No!

761
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,224
What…

762
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:27,007
You can't leave, Eleven.

763
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,639
Where is Dr. Owens?

764
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,951
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.

765
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,646
I know you wish to go to him,

766
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,358
and there's nothing I can do to stop you

767
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,085
from forcing open that door.

768
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,130
But if my men hear you coming,

769
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,739
they will kill him.

770
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,929
And alone, you will never find your way
out of this desert to your friends.

771
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:00,807
Here's what we're going to do.

772
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,188
You and I are going to complete
our work together.

773
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:08,548
And when I decide that you are ready,

774
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:11,818
we will return to Hawkins, together.

775
00:57:12,177 --> 00:57:14,072
Papa and daughter.

776
00:57:15,722 --> 00:57:18,701
Why are you doing this?

777
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:20,728
Because there's no other choice.

778
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:22,246
There is a choice.

779
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,123
Only one that is right.

780
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,251
And you make the right choices?

781
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:29,778
I try.

782
00:57:29,862 --> 00:57:32,197
Did you make the right choice with Mama?

783
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,532
Four-fifty.

784
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:39,179
Your mother was sick, Eleven.

785
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:41,456
She was a danger to herself and to others.

786
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,293
She brought a gun into the hospital.
She killed a man.

787
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:46,061
Hospital?

788
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,063
No.

789
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,525
A prison.

790
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,969
Everything I have done
was for your own good.

791
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:55,612
For your own protection.

792
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,097
And Henry?

793
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:01,143
You kept Henry in that lab.

794
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:02,644
With the children.

795
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:04,063
Was that for our good?

796
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:05,856
Was that a right choice?

797
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,710
I had no idea what Henry would do.

798
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,485
I cared for you.

799
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,695
I loved you. I loved all of you.

800
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,005
Even Henry?

801
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,548
Yes.

802
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:19,429
I was trying to help Henry,
to understand him. Yes.

803
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,496
Yes, I cared for him.

804
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,351
Even after what… what he did?

805
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,918
Yes.

806
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,231
Because I knew I had failed him.

807
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,817
So this morning,

808
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:36,945
you said you believed
he was always alive in the darkness.

809
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,615
Is that why I was searching the darkness?

810
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,414
Was I looking for him? For Henry?

811
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:50,083
No. No.

812
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,777
We were focused on the Soviets.

813
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,778
You knew that.

814
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:56,173
"Papa does not tell the truth."

815
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:58,259
Henry said that.

816
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:01,012
And now you trust Henry?

817
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:05,224
Henry, who's manipulated you
like some puppet?

818
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,521
You are the one
who released him from his prison.

819
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:13,398
You.

820
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,342
And now you are angry with yourself

821
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,429
and you're taking your anger out on me

822
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:20,014
and you're risking everything.

823
00:59:20,097 --> 00:59:21,322
No.

824
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,824
No, you.

825
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:25,936
You have risked everything!

826
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:27,061
You have lied!

827
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,789
You made me look for him!

828
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,320
The gate.

829
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,699
The Mind Flayer.

830
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:43,036
So many dead.

831
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:47,123
And all because of you.

832
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,876
Because you could not stop.

833
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,811
You could not let him go.

834
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:56,108
I came here
to try and understand who I was.

835
00:59:58,385 --> 00:59:59,612
To see if I…

836
01:00:00,762 --> 01:00:02,405
If I was the monster.

837
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:07,369
Papa!

838
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,206
And now I know the truth.

839
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,583
It is not me.

840
01:00:15,193 --> 01:00:16,503
It is you.

841
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,130
You

842
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,675
are the monster.

843
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:26,722
I am going to open that door,

844
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,807
and I am going to leave

845
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,726
with Dr. Owens.

846
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,898
If you try to stop me, I will kill you.

847
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,561
You'll soon see the truth, Eleven.

848
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:27,199
Ah!

849
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,018
Is this legal?

850
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,898
Actually, I think it's a felony.

851
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,815
Right.

852
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,068
But it guarantees one thing.

853
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,364
I won't miss.

854
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,077
- How's she feeling?
- Light. But durable.

855
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,371
Deadly.

856
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,166
But reliable.

857
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,418
Hear me now.

858
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,047
There will be no more retreating…

859
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,242
…from Eddie the Banished.

860
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,804
Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle.

861
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,641
You get it?

862
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,018
"Bat-tle."

863
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,603
B-A-T.

864
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:41,465
No?

865
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:42,757
I thought I had a good one.

866
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,735
What are you doing?

867
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,134
You son of a bitch!

868
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:52,326
No wedgies! No wedgies!

869
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,034
Never change,

870
01:02:54,644 --> 01:02:55,996
Dustin Henderson.

871
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,164
Promise me?

872
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,460
I wasn't planning on it.

873
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:05,338
Good.

874
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,407
- Good.
- Good.

875
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,175
Hey, Sinclairs.

876
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,429
How are those, uh… those Spears coming on?

877
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,974
Flip that damn thumb around.

878
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:18,059
What?

879
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:21,295
It's too loose, Lucas.

880
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,797
This isn't a basketball game

881
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,735
where they blow the whistle
when your shoes fall off.

882
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,094
Okay, okay, for the record,

883
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,722
my shoes never fell off.

884
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,264
Okay, for the record,

885
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,351
it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off
when you're riding the bench.

886
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,311
Yet, for some reason,

887
01:03:36,394 --> 01:03:37,938
you show up to every game.

888
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:39,940
Mmm, except the one that mattered.

889
01:03:40,023 --> 01:03:41,692
Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.

890
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:44,652
Bull. Mom and Dad
can't force you to do shit.

891
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,447
Well, even though
you're a bench-riding loser,

892
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,090
you're still my brother.

893
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,592
Just the facts.

894
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,123
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?

895
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:59,668
That was Dan Shelter.
He graduated, like, two years ago.

896
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:01,795
- So?
- So he's in college.

897
01:04:01,878 --> 01:04:03,880
Which means he was visiting
on spring break.

898
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,217
Fast Times was returned,
like, I don't know, a week ago?

899
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,094
Right? Unless she's got
some horn dog brother we don't know about.

900
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,929
Which is possible.

901
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,349
Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?

902
01:04:14,432 --> 01:04:15,309
- Steve.
- Nah.

903
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,268
- What?
- I don't care.

904
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,980
I don't understand why you do either
with everything that's going on.

905
01:04:20,063 --> 01:04:24,126
Honestly, this feels like a perfect time
for that little pull of the rug because…

906
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:27,403
In the face of the world ending,
the stakes of my love life

907
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:29,422
feel spectacularly low.

908
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:32,742
Yeah. I mean, I get you there,

909
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,637
but… I still have hope.

910
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:41,518
- Not everything has a happy ending.
- Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know.

911
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:49,318
I'm not talking about failed romance.

912
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,277
I just…

913
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,447
I have this terrible,

914
01:04:54,764 --> 01:04:56,534
gnawing feeling that…

915
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,288
It might not work out for us this time.

916
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,416
You think we shouldn't be doing this?

917
01:05:04,733 --> 01:05:08,545
I think we're mad fools,
the lot of us, but…

918
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,824
…but if we don't stop him,
who will?

919
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,599
We have to try, right?

920
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,353
Yeah.

921
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,608
To killing Vecna.

922
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,322
Slash Henry.

923
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:38,617
Slash One.

924
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,760
It's only a precaution, Eleven.

925
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:01,764
I never intend to activate it.

926
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:06,519
I very much hope

927
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:09,231
our fighting has come to an end.

928
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:17,431
Shh.

929
01:06:17,514 --> 01:06:19,742
Shh.

930
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:22,393
I know.

931
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,121
You're angry with me.

932
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,440
But it was the only way.

933
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,295
The best way.

934
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,141
- What's going on?
- It's Sullivan.

935
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,934
They found us.

936
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:57,028
Go, go, go!

937
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,956
Three! Two! One!

938
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:36,009
- Go to the back!
- Get moving!

939
01:07:36,092 --> 01:07:37,177
- Move out!
- Go!

940
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,887
- Get 'em out of here!
- No more time!

941
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,239
Evacuate now!

942
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:02,494
Move!

943
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,512
Steady! Fire!

944
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,154
Eleven, we have to go.

945
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,157
- What is happening?
- They've come to kill you.

946
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,792
Evacuate immediately.
Please proceed…

947
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:45,470
- Clear.
- Clear!

948
01:08:46,663 --> 01:08:49,416
Quarter and search by twos.
Hicks, take the upper level.

949
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,725
Yes, sir.

950
01:09:09,435 --> 01:09:10,661
Sir?

951
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,582
We found something you're gonna wanna see.

952
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:19,630
Well, well.

953
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,382
And what happened here?

954
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,882
Hmm?

955
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:26,845
Are Mommy and Daddy fighting?

956
01:09:28,037 --> 01:09:29,262
Okay.

957
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,645
Let's try this again, shall we?

958
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,190
Where's the girl?

959
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:10,096
Where do you think you're going, Doc?

960
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,399
- Why don't you give 'em some lead?
- I got it.

961
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,707
Down he goes.

962
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:04,466
Victor-Two-Sierra,
this is Charlie-Lima-Golf.

963
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,110
Do you copy, over?

964
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,889
Victor-Two-Sierra, I copy, over.

965
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:10,681
We've got the target in our sights.

966
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:13,202
Requesting permission
to take the shot, over.

967
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,104
Jack, you don't have to do this.

968
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,189
It's over, Sam.

969
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,082
Wait! Wait! Wait! I can put her in a coma.

970
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,234
A medically induced coma.

971
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,445
We have the drugs.
We can do it right here.

972
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:27,615
And we'll see
if… if these murders keep happening.

973
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:30,743
If you're right, the killing ends,
and you can pull the plug on her.

974
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,162
In fact, I'll do it myself.

975
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,305
But if you're wrong about this,

976
01:11:34,872 --> 01:11:36,516
God, are we gonna need her.

977
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,100
Jack.

978
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:40,229
Don't do this.

979
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:41,979
I'm begging you.

980
01:11:49,095 --> 01:11:49,930
Take it.

981
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,264
You son of a bitch!

982
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:53,742
No! You son of a bitch!

983
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,644
Green light. Light her up.

984
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:02,167
Civvies. Five o'clock.

985
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:05,945
The hell?

986
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:08,030
- There she is! There she is!
- Where?

987
01:12:08,114 --> 01:12:11,033
- On the ground!
- What are those dudes doing on the ground?

988
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,577
- Is that blood, man?
- Shit.

989
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,539
Victor-Two-Sierra,
we've got a civvy headed our way.

990
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:20,167
Ignore it. Just take out the girl.

991
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,770
Copy that.
Ignore the civvy. Take the shot.

992
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,095
Found ya.

993
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,729
- Hell are you doing? Hold her steady!
- I don't know, man. Something's wrong!

994
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,543
Jesus Christ.

995
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:57,122
Holy shit!

996
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,681
Shit!

997
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,609
I'm losing her!

998
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,238
Shit!

999
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:25,333
- Shit!
- Shit! I can't! I can't hold it!

1000
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,560
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1001
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,278
Eleven!

1002
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,782
Eleven.

1003
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:43,560
Oh, Mike.

1004
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,087
It's really you?

1005
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,796
It's me.

1006
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,051
- I'm here.
- Okay.

1007
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,661
Everyone's here.

1008
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:15,527
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1009
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,110
Oh shit.

1010
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,989
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Shit!

1011
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:21,908
Eleven.

1012
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,411
You… Are you okay?

1013
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,037
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1014
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:30,542
Hey, guys. We gotta go.

1015
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,002
We gotta get you outta here.

1016
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:23,470
Papa.

1017
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:26,012
Eleven.

1018
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:33,479
I want you to know

1019
01:16:34,338 --> 01:16:35,564
I'm proud of you.

1020
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:38,193
So very proud.

1021
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,738
You

1022
01:16:43,222 --> 01:16:44,658
are my family.

1023
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:50,454
My child.

1024
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:04,051
I've only ever

1025
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,136
wanted to help you.

1026
01:17:07,788 --> 01:17:09,140
To protect you.

1027
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,688
Everything I did,

1028
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:17,356
I did for you.

1029
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,987
I need you to understand.

1030
01:17:24,055 --> 01:17:26,198
Please tell me you understand.

1031
01:17:41,614 --> 01:17:42,841
Please.

1032
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,877
Goodbye, Papa.

1033
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:48,908
- We need to get to Hawkins.
- I know. And we will.

1034
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:51,493
But we need to get you somewhere safe.
Gonna be people behind us.

1035
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,412
No, Mike,
we need to get to Hawkins tonight.

1036
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,707
We'll never make it.
That's over 2,000 miles.

1037
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,998
We need to find a way.

1038
01:19:57,082 --> 01:19:59,435
If we don't, they are going to die.

1039
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:01,186
Who's gonna die?

1040
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:04,524
El, who's gonna die?

1041
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:17,787
