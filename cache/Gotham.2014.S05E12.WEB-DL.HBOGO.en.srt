1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
We will create a legacy in this city.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,600
Gotham falls, we rise together.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,080
Why don't you understand?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,280
You need me!

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,040
I'm the answer
to your life's question.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,640
All this happened because of me.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,240
They were trying to hurt me
and the people I care about.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,080
With reunification underway,
and the bridges being rebuilt,

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,800
it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
the title of Commissioner.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,960
What do you mean you're leaving?

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,160
Gotham's in good hands.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,280
Thank you, Bruce.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,480
And you're the only son
that I will ever have,

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,280
and I could not be more proud.

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>Alfred,</i>

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,240
<i>I'm writing to let you know,
I'm okay.</i>

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,480
<i>And that you won't hear from me
for some time.</i>

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,080
<i>But I will return...</i>

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,400
<i>when I know I'm able to protect
the people I love.</i>

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>When Gotham needs me...</i>

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>I will return.</i>

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,560
{\an5}It began a few weeks ago.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,240
Someone attacking the gangs downtown.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,080
{\an5}No deaths so far, at least.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,400
{\an5}Hoods couldn't give a description,
but they did mention a growling.

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
{\an5}A growling?

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,560
{\an5}It's a rumor. Ignore it.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,640
{\an5}Oswald Cobblepot gets out
of Blackgate tomorrow.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
{\an5}One theory is, he's sending someone
to put the fear of God

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
into the underworld.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,600
{\an5}And you choose this moment
to hand in your resignation?

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
{\an5}I told you that months ago.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
{\an5}That's not the point!

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
{\an5}Look, things are unstable.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,600
{\an5}Isn't there some break in
at a government warehouse

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,880
{\an5}that you guys haven't solved yet?

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, because the feds
won't tell us squat.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,920
{\an5}I'm not looking for excuses!

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,880
{\an5}Look, you mean something
to this city.

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
You can't quit.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,120
{\an5}Not now.

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,040
Because of Wayne Tower.

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,360
{\an5}Bruce Wayne is returning home

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,640
{\an5}for the first time in a decade
for its opening.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,320
{\an5}The new Wayne Tower represents hope
for Gotham.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,960
{\an5}So yeah, I need you.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,360
Mayor James...

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,320
{\an5}I told you I would stay
until after the Wayne Inaugural.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
{\an5}Then I'm done.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
{\an5}If you'll excuse me,

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,760
I have a fundraiser
I have to get ready for.

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
{\an5}Good day, gentlemen.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Jim.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,480
{\an5}I've had ten years, Harv.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,280
{\an5}It's time for someone else
to have a chance.

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,600
{\an5}Did you wait for Bruce to come back
to hang it up?

59
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
{\an5}That's a coincidence?

60
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
{\an5}I'm late.

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,000
{\an5}- I have to meet Barbara.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
{\an5}The queen of Gotham.

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,920
Tell me something.

64
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,080
{\an5}Why didn't I buy up half of Gotham
on the cheap after reunification?

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,480
{\an5}Become a tycoon?

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,520
{\an5}Give a kiss to the little one
from Uncle Harv.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Will do.

68
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Hey, slugger.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Daddy.

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
I don't think the weight of the...

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
- Just do it.
- Yes, ma'am.

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
Hi, sweetheart.

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,120
So, did you hear from Bruce?

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,200
No.

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
Ten years, not a word.

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
But I'm assuming he'll be at the gala
for Wayne Tower tomorrow?

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,000
I wanna see the look on his face
when I tell him, in three months,

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,360
he won't have the tallest building
in Gotham anymore.

79
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,360
Think he'll recognize you with
that caterpillar on your top lip?

80
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,600
Okay, munchkin, I love you.

81
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
Don't let her stay up too late.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,480
- Ice cream?
- Yes.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
<i>Look. Look.
It's right under there, under my arm.</i>

84
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
<i>You guys, move!</i>

85
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,120
Bruce is back?

86
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Big deal.

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,400
I knew him.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,760
Back in the day.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,760
Saved Gotham together.

90
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
Oswald's being freed?

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,600
Hey! I've been in here ten years!

92
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,320
Ten years!

93
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,320
I deserve to read the newspaper,
you mouth breather!

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
Hey! Hey!

95
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,560
Hey!

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,200
Do you not know who that is?

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,720
Jeremiah Valeska.

98
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
And yeah...

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
he's been a vegetable for a decade.

100
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Can't think, can't feel.

101
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,240
But he is a legend.

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,440
And if you're gonna screw
with a legend...

103
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,440
do it properly.

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,360
This never gets old.

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
Hey, buddy, I got something for you.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,680
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,320
Come on.

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
Out of the way.

109
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
Whoa.

110
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,440
Yep. It was time to admit it.

111
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,760
I was trying something.
It didn't work.

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
You liked it, right?

113
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Totally.

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,920
At least now,
Bruce will recognize you.

115
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,120
That's very funny.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,240
I wonder how much he's changed.

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,840
Well, it's been ten years,
I'd imagine a lot.

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,960
Well, we haven't.

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm still a doctor.
You're still a cop.

120
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Not for long.

121
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
Are you having second thoughts
about leaving?

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,200
Well, I'm all for it.

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
But I know
how much this job means to you.

124
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,760
And how much the city looks to you.
It always has.

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,200
You know, that's just it.

126
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
I was hoping Gotham would outgrow me.

127
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,040
But it hasn't exactly happened.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
No one's stepped forward.

129
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,800
Well, maybe you need to step down
to allow someone to step up.

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Jim Gordon,

131
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,040
clean-shaven man of leisure.

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,960
Ten years.

133
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,800
I wonder what Bruce will think
of Selina.

134
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,200
She's become quite the it girl
around town.

135
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,280
So, they have no idea
when Nygma actually escaped?

136
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,280
He wasn't in his cell this morning.

137
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,520
This is where the guard lives.

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
The one that didn't show for work.

139
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
All right. I got it.

140
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Stay here in case something else
comes in.

141
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
All right.

142
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,800
GCPD!

143
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,120
- No! Okay, okay...
- Shut up!

144
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Talk to him.

145
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
This is Detective Bullock.

146
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
You understand?

147
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
Oh, my God.

148
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,280
You understand what you have to do?

149
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Oh, my God.

150
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,720
I don't have a choice!

151
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,680
What the hell happened, Harvey?

152
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
What did Harper say?

153
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
I wanna hear it from you.

154
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,160
We tracked down this Arkham guard
we thought maybe helped Nygma escape.

155
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,120
I shot him.

156
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,840
End of story.

157
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,960
You're confessing to killing
an unarmed suspect in cold blood.

158
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,200
It's what happened.

159
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,600
You got to let it go.

160
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,080
Harvey, I don't know if you think

161
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,800
you're protecting yourself
or someone else,

162
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,200
but you need to change your story,
otherwise you're going to Blackgate.

163
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,600
And you know what happens to cops
in Blackgate.

164
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,720
That's what happened.

165
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,480
So let it go.

166
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,280
<i>I just can't believe
he'd do anything...</i>

167
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,760
All right, first things first,

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
whoever here doesn't believe
Harvey Bullock is innocent can leave

169
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,720
right now.

170
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,400
Good.

171
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,200
- You think Nygma's behind this?
- Maybe.

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,480
But he's been inside Arkham
for ten years.

173
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
It's not like he suddenly decided
to break out.

174
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
He had help.

175
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
Penguin gets released today.

176
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
- You think?
- Yeah.

177
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
Put a tail on him.

178
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,160
In the meantime,
I want every other cop in the city

179
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,480
on the hunt for Edward Nygma.

180
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,960
We looked into the dead guard.

181
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,160
He used to be associated
with a south side gang.

182
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
Got an address. An old warehouse.

183
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,440
All right, you and I will hit it.

184
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,360
Rest of you have your orders.
Let's go.

185
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
Hello?

186
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,400
Anybody?

187
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
Anybody?

188
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,520
<i>"Dear Ed, My old friend.</i>

189
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,880
<i>Half of Gotham thinks you a madman.</i>

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,560
<i>The other half has forgotten you.</i>

191
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,600
<i>It's time to remind them
who the Riddler is.</i>

192
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,920
<i>I've given you all you need.</i>

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,760
<i>Follow the instructions. Oswald."</i>

194
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,880
Oswald, what are you planning?

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,920
Mr. Cobblepot, what's the first thing
you'll do as a free man?

196
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,520
I will lay flowers on the grave
of my beloved mother.

197
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,720
But what of Jim Gordon's role
in your incarceration?

198
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,960
Will you seek revenge?

199
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,280
The best revenge against Jim Gordon

200
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,640
will be a life spent serving the city
I love.

201
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,560
What do you say, young man?
How would you like an exclusive?

202
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,880
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

203
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
Your jacket and hat.

204
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,360
- What?
- Now!

205
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
GCPD!

206
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,120
GCPD.

207
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
This is the place.

208
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,320
Good God.

209
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,520
Did your lead say anything
about this?

210
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,440
About a gangland bloodbath?

211
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
No.

212
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,280
What the hell is going on?

213
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,720
Someone's covering their tracks.

214
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,240
There was a break-in at a government
warehouse last week.

215
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,120
Those crates have US Army markings.

216
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,800
Find the back stairs.

217
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,280
GCPD!

218
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,640
I know you're here.

219
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,640
Show yourself.

220
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,280
<i>I am not your enemy.</i>

221
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,400
<i>Don't touch the bodies.</i>

222
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,560
Don't move!

223
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,240
Grenade!

224
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,560
Bomb squad said the bodies
were rigged with C-Four.

225
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Whoever that was, saved our lives.

226
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,480
Suggesting that he wasn't the one
that killed them.

227
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,960
Could be he's hunting the same person
we're hunting.

228
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,320
Whoever's really behind all this.

229
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,480
- You're thinking he's on our side?
- Yeah, maybe.

230
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,600
That C-Four has to have been what was
stolen from the government warehouse.

231
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,320
Which means most of it's still
missing.

232
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
Just got a call.

233
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,280
Mayor James vanished
and our tail lost Penguin.

234
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,600
Sir, what the hell is going on?

235
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,760
First Nygma, now Penguin.

236
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,440
Keep it simple.

237
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Imagine all that C-Four.

238
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,280
What's the biggest target in Gotham
right now?

239
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,000
Double security for tonight's event.

240
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,040
I have to talk to Bruce Wayne
and Alfred Pennyworth.

241
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,240
Hello, old friend.

242
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
- Oswald...
- One more word,

243
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,480
and I will put a bullet in you here
and now.

244
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,160
Drive.

245
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,160
- Oswald...
- Don't talk!

246
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,440
Turn around!

247
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,920
Remember when we stood here, Jim,
all those years ago?

248
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,000
Don Falcone wanted you to shoot me,
you refused.

249
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,120
Now don't you wish you'd done it?

250
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Everyone will know you did this.

251
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Let them!

252
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,640
We both know that this has been
a long time coming.

253
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,040
Our story is over, old friend.

254
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,800
You wanna kill me? Fine.

255
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,120
There's no need to attack
the Wayne gala.

256
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,840
What are you talking about?

257
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Breaking Nygma out of Arkham,
the attacks on the gangs.

258
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,520
What? Do you think you're gonna
be able to destroy Wayne Tower

259
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,880
and no one's gonna notice?

260
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

261
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,280
You and I stood shoulder to shoulder
on those barricades,

262
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,480
ready to die for this city.

263
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,960
Six months later,
you locked me up like an animal!

264
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,640
This begins and ends with you and me!

265
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,280
You're telling the truth.

266
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,080
Goodbye, Jim.

267
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
Turn around!

268
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
You know, you made a mistake bringing
me out to this pier...

269
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,120
Don't talk!

270
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,680
Or maybe you just have
a short memory.

271
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
So this is Bruce's new Gotham?

272
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,640
I like the old one.

273
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
Selina?

274
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
How wonderful to see you again.

275
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,920
It's been far, far too long.

276
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,040
Where is he?

277
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
Well, I'm afraid travels abroad

278
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,400
haven't increased Master Bruce's
respect for punctuality, Miss Kyle.

279
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,520
I came here to tell him
to stop spying on me.

280
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
I don't understand.

281
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,200
I was out the other night
and I felt someone watching me.

282
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,720
I know it was Bruce.

283
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,880
Oh, I see. Right.
Well, that makes perfect sense.

284
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,160
So, you come here tonight,
dressed to the nines to tell him

285
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,920
that you want nothing more
to do with him.

286
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,040
Is that the kind of gist of it?

287
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,400
He left, Alfred.

288
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Everything we went through,
and one day he's just gone.

289
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,600
He doesn't get to come back
after ten years

290
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,400
and act like nothing's happened.

291
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,440
On this, we absolutely agree.

292
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,200
I do, however,
feel it might be something

293
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,760
that you wanna tell him yourself.

294
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,280
He needs to stay away.

295
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
Nygma?

296
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,920
Well, look at you.

297
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,440
I think Bruce is gonna regret being
gone all these years.

298
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,960
Follow me.

299
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,560
Credit to Bruce.

300
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,000
He did not skimp on the caterers.

301
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,520
Hungry?

302
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
Your loss.

303
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,360
Not long now.

304
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,760
<i>Bruce Wayne's first public appearance
in nearly a decade.</i>

305
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,080
- Lucius.
- Lee.

306
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,440
Heard about Harvey. How is he?

307
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
- How's Jim?
- I don't know.

308
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,680
I was hoping he would be here.

309
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
Ladies and Gentlemen,

310
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,640
my name is Alfred Thaddeus
Crane Pennyworth.

311
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,200
And I'd very much like to welcome you

312
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,040
on behalf of Wayne Enterprises
and Bruce Wayne,

313
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,160
to the future of Gotham.

314
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,280
<i>As you know, 10 years ago,
the battle...</i>

315
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,920
Oh, come on.

316
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,360
Where is that brat?

317
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
<i>- Bruce Wayne.</i>
- Hello, Ed.

318
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
Barbara Kean.

319
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,720
In red?

320
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,640
Oh, no.

321
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,840
Please tell me you're not here
to stop me.

322
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,160
Barbara, do you even remember
how amazing you used to be?

323
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,840
Honey, I'm still amazing.

324
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,120
I just made a choice.

325
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
You made a choice?

326
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,840
Some of us don't get to make choices.

327
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,800
I am the Riddler.

328
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,840
And tonight,
Gotham will remember that.

329
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,800
By blowing up this ding-dong?

330
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,960
Didn't you do that already?

331
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,480
It's a call back!

332
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,080
I was waiting for Bruce
to begin his speech.

333
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,200
You know, come out, present a riddle.

334
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,360
Only Bruce doesn't seem
to wanna show.

335
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
So, I think I'm gonna have to imp...

336
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,400
Sorry, Ed.

337
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,280
Not tonight.

338
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,520
Wayne Enterprises will devote itself
to making this future a reality.

339
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
Lee.

340
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
Gotham joining.

341
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
- Jim?
- I'm fine.

342
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Evacuate the building!

343
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,440
Get these people out of here!

344
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,760
Help!

345
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Gordon!

346
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
Help!

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,560
- Gordon!
- <i>Everybody, get down!</i>

348
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,160
Gordon, help!

349
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,000
This lunatic, he kidnapped me again!

350
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,640
He tried to blow me up! Again!

351
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,320
But we stopped him. You're welcome.

352
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Take care of the mayor, please.
Get that thing off him.

353
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Excuse me.

354
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,000
There were four crates of C-Four.
Where are the rest?

355
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,800
That's all he gave me.

356
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,280
He said Penguin broke him out.

357
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,000
No. It wasn't Penguin.

358
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
Get him out of there.

359
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,200
What?

360
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,840
Hey! Get off me!

361
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,840
Nygma's not just a patsy,
he's not even a real threat.

362
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,200
Which means there must be...

363
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,160
If this bomb goes off
and Wayne Tower falls,

364
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,400
it'll take out other buildings.

365
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,960
A lot of people are gonna die.

366
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
You all need to leave right now.

367
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
So you can stay? Absolutely not.

368
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,040
It's too late.

369
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,560
We'd never get far enough away.

370
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,040
Miss Kean is right.
This stops right here.

371
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,920
So, how do we defuse it?

372
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,160
We'd have to sever the connectors
to the detonator.

373
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,320
But the bomber must've hidden it.

374
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
The wires go up inside the model.

375
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
It must be in one of the buildings.

376
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,280
I tracked down a gang today.

377
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,560
They had bomb-making materials,
pictures of buildings.

378
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,480
One in particular.

379
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,480
Gotham clock tower.

380
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,080
Let's go.

381
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,840
In here.

382
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
Wait, wait, wait.

383
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Wait. This particular detonator
has a gyroscope,

384
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,480
which means someone
will have to hold it up and steady

385
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,200
while you detach the wires
from below.

386
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,400
I have doctor's hands. I can do it.

387
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,200
Fine. Lucius.

388
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
All right.

389
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
The trigger connection should be
different than the others.

390
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,320
Okay, I see two green wires.

391
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,320
I'm gonna cut this one?

392
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,200
- The other one!
- The other one!

393
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
- Yes, the other one.
- The other one!

394
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,840
I never doubted you for a minute.

395
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,200
Strange.

396
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,120
We'd designed a new clock tower,
but this is the old one.

397
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,480
That's the answer.

398
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,840
Who's behind all this, but...

399
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,960
it's not possible.

400
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Sir?

401
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,360
Sir, Nygma's vanished.

402
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,480
There's more.

403
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,320
Mayor James ordered Bullock sent
to Blackgate.

404
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,680
He's about to be moved.

405
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
Stop!

406
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,840
Stop!

407
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,200
The person who framed you,
the one behind Nygma's breakout.

408
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,440
Is it who I think it is?

409
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,360
- Has he been faking it?
- Jim, do not say his name.

410
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,160
Is it Jeremiah Valeska?

411
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Harvey!

412
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
- Check him for a wire!
- What?

413
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,040
Under his shirt! Check for a wire!

414
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,480
Oh, God. It's too late.

415
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,160
He's mic'd.

416
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,880
Jim, you don't know what he'll do.

417
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,520
I don't know about this.

418
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,080
How much is it again?

419
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,640
Ten bucks is a body punch.

420
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,960
Twenty, you get the face.

421
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,520
Stabbing him is a C-note.

422
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,840
Bad news, boss.

423
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Our cover's blownskies.

424
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
Edward Nygma.

425
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,000
It is very good to see you.

426
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,680
Oswald.

427
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,240
I thought you weren't behind this.

428
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm not.

429
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,600
But I thought you might
need some help and...

430
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
what else are friends for?

431
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,840
You look well.

432
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,120
You too.

433
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,480
A little thicker in the middle.

434
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,320
Damn, it's good to see you, Oswald.

435
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,640
What was that? What was that?

436
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,800
No!

437
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
What the hell was that?

438
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,280
Alfred.

439
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,760
When Bruce came to me the day
he got back

440
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,080
and told me what he was planning,
I didn't hesitate.

441
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,480
I believe in what he's doing.

442
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,120
But he's going to need some help.

443
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,760
Has he thought about telling Gordon?

444
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,800
Lucius, my old friend,

445
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,840
whoever Bruce decides to take
on this journey with him,

446
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,000
it's his decision.

447
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,040
Our role is to serve.

448
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,520
Let me go. I have to...

449
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,920
Down!

450
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
Get me down!

451
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,640
Something happened tonight,
didn't it?

452
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,920
Why won't you tell me?

453
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
Because everything worked out okay.
Didn't it?

454
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,480
So, why are we at your old club?

455
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,720
Because Mommy just needs
to get something.

456
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,560
Wait here, okay?

457
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,400
<i>But I think I could love her</i>

458
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,600
Turn around.

459
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,480
Turn around.

460
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,520
I won't ask again.

461
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,840
Surprise!

462
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,840
Easy. It's just a surprise party
for you,

463
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,240
Barbara Kean. Queen of Gotham.

464
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,840
Business titan.

465
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,880
How exciting.

466
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,360
But there was another you, I...

467
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,080
I seem to recall.

468
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,800
Wasn't there? Then again,
there was another me, too.

469
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,040
Oh, so hard holding
on to what's real.

470
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,040
It's enough to drive you mad.

471
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,640
Mom!

472
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,280
Cute.

473
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
She has your eyes.

474
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,040
For now.

475
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,960
No! Put me down!

476
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,240
I think she nicked me, Daddy.

477
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
I...

478
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,720
Oh, boy.

479
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
Oh, dear me.

480
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,560
My sweet Ecco no longer my echo.

481
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,800
There'll never be one like you.

482
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,520
Really?

483
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,000
But I suppose there are other fish
in the sea.

484
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,720
Let me down!

485
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Mom!

486
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,320
Little Barbara! Don't say a word.

487
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,920
Now we're going to play
a little game.

488
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,720
By now, James Gordon should
have made it to your apartment.

489
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,800
When he gets here I want you
to deliver a message. Okay?

490
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,480
Okay?

491
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,440
Okay?

492
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,800
Barbara?

493
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,280
I'll call an ambulance.

494
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,240
Barbara?

495
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,240
He took her!

496
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,520
That lunatic took her!

497
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
He said you have to come,

498
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,560
and if you don't come,
he's gonna kill her.

499
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,720
Where?

500
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,280
The place where he was born again.

501
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,360
He means Ace Chemicals.

502
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
You promise me.

503
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,480
I'll bring her back.

504
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,240
Come along, Commissioner.

505
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,400
We're waiting.

506
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,520
The party's raging,

507
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,400
but it's well past
the princess' bedtime.

508
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,720
It's funny being back here.

509
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,600
I can still feel my flesh sizzle
as it melted away.

510
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,200
Burns even now. Hold on.

511
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm here.

512
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,040
Everything's gonna be fine.

513
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,360
You think so?

514
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,040
Personally, I'd say things are about
as far away from fine

515
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,480
as they could possibly be,
Barbara Lee.

516
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
What do I know?

517
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,920
I did just spend the last ten years
in the funny farm.

518
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,360
What do you want, Jeremiah?

519
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,720
Is there a Jeremiah here?

520
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,600
So, what do I call you?

521
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
Well...

522
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,280
I don't know. Call me Jack.

523
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,880
No, no, no, that's not right.
Joseph. John. Jay...

524
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,120
I don't know. I just...

525
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,120
I feel something new crawling
from the primordial ooze that was me.

526
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,920
Something beautiful.

527
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,920
How long have you been pretending
to be brain dead?

528
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,760
How long have you been pretending?

529
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,680
That's a joke.
I know you're not pretending.

530
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,920
That's far enough, James.

531
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,440
But you still haven't told me.

532
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,120
Why?

533
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,600
Why keep pretending?

534
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,640
I was waiting for him to come home.

535
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
We're bound together, he and I.

536
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,720
It's the one thing I knew
for certain.

537
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,240
The one thing I knew was true.

538
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,920
And then he just abandoned us.

539
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,200
Do you know how it feels
to have the one,

540
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,000
the only thing you love
ripped away from you?

541
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,280
- Feels like this.
- No!

542
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,720
Disappointing as tonight was,

543
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,200
I will say it is fun carving up
Filet Commissioner.

544
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,000
Who's there?

545
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
What do you want?

546
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,720
Show yourself!

547
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,960
Show yourself!

548
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
You?

549
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,280
It's okay. It's all right.

550
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,320
I got you. Okay?

551
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,760
So, he comes out of nowhere,
saves you and Barbara Lee,

552
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,000
and just disappears?

553
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Yeah.

554
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,840
So, the dude's on our side?

555
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,000
I think so.

556
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,800
This old thing?

557
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,920
I thought we mothballed this
after reunification.

558
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,600
I had them dig it out
for old times' sake.

559
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,160
I sent a note to Wayne Manor.

560
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,040
I thought Bruce might wanna be here
when we light it.

561
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,920
Good evening, gentlemen.

562
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,360
Master Bruce sends his profound
apologies.

563
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,720
He's otherwise engaged.

564
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,120
He's been busy a lot
since he came back.

565
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,320
Yes, indeed.

566
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,840
And I hear that you're retiring.

567
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,200
I may stick around a while yet.

568
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,520
You're there, aren't you?

569
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,880
Do you have any idea what you did?

570
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,840
Just leaving?

571
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,960
You were all I had.

572
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,480
And I know you wanted to protect me.

573
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,200
But I didn't want to be protected,
I wanted you.

574
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
Say something.

575
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,040
Say something.

576
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
There was no other way, Selina.

577
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,120
I had to go.

578
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
So, what happens now?

579
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,640
I don't know.

580
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,960
But I'll never leave Gotham again.

581
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,280
Return the diamond.

582
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,600
Like hell.

583
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,720
Gotham is mine,
that's what he said.

584
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,080
I was there, Oswald.

585
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,840
I did not spend ten years
in Blackgate

586
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,480
to give my city to a man dressed
like a bat!

587
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Yeah.

588
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Go!

589
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,680
We have to find out who he is,
and show him that this is our city.

590
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,880
Agreed.

591
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,040
Tomorrow?

592
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,360
Tomorrow.

593
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,240
Yet in the darkness,
there will be light.

594
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,320
That's what you promised Master Bruce
all those years ago in the alley.

595
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,800
You saved him.

596
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,000
Gave him hope.

597
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,040
Holy mother.

598
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,320
Who is he?

599
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,320
Friend.
