1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,820
Don't you have siblings? 
-My brother studies in Stockholm.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,440
William is a Russ.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,820
When someone becomes a Russ, 
they don't want to have a girlfriend.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,340
Everyone knows that.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,760
Say that you don't like me, and I'm gone.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,860
You are so insanely selfish...

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,380
... and manipulative and self-involved.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,160
Was that all?

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,440
Are you looking at me while I'm sleeping?

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,080
No.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,780
Noora Amalie Sætre

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,740
Now you have to be careful.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,240
Because you're going to be so damn in love with me.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm not in love with you.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,500
You are in love with me.

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,700
You don't even have clothes on.

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,460
I do have clothes on!

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,820
Give me two weeks and they're gone.

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,100
That is not gonna happen.
-It is gonna happen.

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
I told you that I won't have sex before I get married, right?

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,460
Jesus..

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,920
It's true!

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,220
Okay.. We're going to get married then.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,040
Okay..

25
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,000
I mean it.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't get married...

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,460
... to someone called.. Willhelm.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,020
Stop calling me Willhelm.

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh my, but that's your name.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,140
Is that not what you're called?

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh that's awkward!
Oops! Oh god.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,980
Where are you going?

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,180
I'm going to get water.

34
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,820
There's no water today.

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,420
Today we'll just lay here.

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,680
We have to go to school.

37
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,940
Not yet.
We'll just lay here a little first.

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,520
But I'm thirsty
Shhh...

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,700
William!

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,860
You can say my name?

41
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,280
Just let me get water.

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,180
How do I know you're only going to get water?

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
Because I say so.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
Why should I trust you?

45
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,780
You ran away from me earlier, before I woke up.

46
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
Hey you..

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,640
Hm?

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,780
I'm just going to get water.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,780
I swear.

50
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,060
You have 30 seconds.

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll keep track of time.

52
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,260
Hi.

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,080
Sorry, did I wake you?

54
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
No.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,600
Nikolai, William's brother.

56
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,420
Noora.
-Noora, hello!

57
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,020
And there's William! Hello!

58
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,480
Niko, what are you doing here?

59
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm cooking.

60
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,960
In Oslo?

61
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,740
Yeah. Needed a little break.

62
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,860
Okay..

63
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,860
Are you perhaps hungry?

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,240
No.

65
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
No?

66
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,000
Ok. Little rude, right?

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Maybe your girlfriend wants something to eat?

68
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,000
She's not my girlfriend and she's leaving now.

69
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,480
Can you find the way out by yourself,
or do you need me to help?

70
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,720
Bye.

71
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,740
Was it a bad vibe, or?

72
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,900
No, she's nothing.

73
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,980
What are you making?

74
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,920
Damn, terrible pictures.

75
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
It looks so painful!

76
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,960
I'm getting chills.

77
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,460
It's my fault.

78
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,860
Had it not been for me,
Jonas would have never started fighting with him.

79
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,140
I didn't even know he was with Yakuza.

80
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,500
He isn't with them. 
But he's friends with quite a lot of them.

81
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,560
The Yakuza-guys are just looking for people to beat up.

82
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,000
He has to do something.
The Yakuza-guys have too much power.

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,260
They can't do anything. 
Won't they just fight each other forever?

84
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,540
Noora, you have such good morals.

85
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,280
No, but I mean it.
I really look up to you.

86
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,500
Thanks.

87
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,920
How is Jonas doing?

88
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,000
He's still ignoring me.

89
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,680
It's Isabel. She's the one who told him
he can't talk to me.

90
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,220
She seems really bossy.
As if she has him on a leash.

91
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,580
Smart of her.

92
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,300
Why is that?

93
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,980
To keep him away from you.

94
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm not going to sleep with Jonas.

95
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,680
No, but you always feel something for your ex.

96
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
You hold the advantage.

97
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,180
How?

98
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,060
You're not together with him anymore.

99
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,900
How is that an advantage?

100
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,180
When a boy is together with a girl,
suddenly all the others seem more exciting.

101
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Seriously?

102
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,680
Yes.

103
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,840
Boys are naturally like that.

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,820
Guys' instict is to spread their genes as much as possible.

105
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,900
That's why guys sleep around.

106
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,800
If you want to hold on to a guy..

107
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,680
You have to make sure his needs are covered

108
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,000
And keep others at a distance.

109
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,780
Isabel is just trying to be his girlfriend.

110
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,460
Can't blame her for that.

111
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,500
About spreading genes.. Anyone else excited
about the start of Russetiden this Friday?

112
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,040
Nice lipstick.

113
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,760
Thanks.

114
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
Where is it from?

115
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,640
Clinique, I believe.

116
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,060
It suits you.
Really sexy.

117
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,800
You're ignoring me.

118
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
William, you can't talk to me here!

119
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,120
I have to.. when you're not answering your phone.

120
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,580
I have math now.

121
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,780
We have to talk first.

122
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,920
Well, then talk!

123
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,820
That stuff yesterday didn't have anything to do with you.

124
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,360
It did have something to do with me. 
You treated me like crap.

125
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,900
The thing is that my brother was dumped by his girlfriend.

126
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,040
They were together for years.

127
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,260
He's really depressed.

128
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,380
So what?

129
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,500
It didn't feel right to introduce you.

130
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,260
And to rub it in.
-Rub in what?

131
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Us.

132
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,140
I'm just really bad at that kind of stuff.

134
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,620
Hey you..

135
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,880
I didn't mean to hurt you.

136
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,000
You didn't hurt me!

137
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm not hurt even a little bit.

138
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,880
Okay..

139
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,180
I just think you were a real asshole.

140
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah I agree. I was an asshole.

141
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,880
It won't happen again.

142
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,060
I promise.

143
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
It was actually really good that it happened.

144
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,760
I was afraid that you would go around thinking we were a couple.

145
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,580
But then at least I don't have to be afraid of that now.

146
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,460
We are together, though.

147
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,140
No.

148
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,360
Yes we are.

149
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,700
You have to fix your hair.

150
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,620
Those girls are so scary.

151
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,860
Should I delete the picture, Sana?

152
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,800
No.

153
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,780
What picture?

154
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:53,680
<i>(It smells of Noora on my pillow.
I had a dream about you last night)</i>

155
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,100
Don't delete the picture.

156
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,340
<i>(Did you get up? What did you dream?)</i>

157
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,500
<i>(That we had sex)</i>

158
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,060
<i>(You were so delicious)</i>

159
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,740
Did you just go and work out? During lunch break?

160
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,680
Russetiden season is approaching.
And bikini season.

161
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,860
Is anyone looking forward to the Penetrator concept?

162
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,300
I bet it's something kinky.

163
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,520
I wonder how many girls William will sleep with during Russetiden.

164
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,980
Is it okay with you that he's going to sleep with lots of girls?

165
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,980
Are you jealous?

166
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,240
No, I just have to accept it.

167
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,040
He has been working towards this for 3 years.
It's the most important time in his life.

168
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,400
I wonder if he will beat his brother's record.
He slept with 130 girls during his Russetiden.

169
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,060
He has a brother?

170
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,280
Yes, Nico. From '95. 
He left Nissen 2 years ago.

171
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,060
A true fuckboy.

172
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,840
So there are two of them?

173
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,620
My sister studies in Stockholm with him.
She told me he gave half the Stureplan chlamydia.

174
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,980
Seriously?

175
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,140
That's really nasty.

176
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,580
The Magnusson brothers..

177
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,640
"Begge samma ulla, alle skall bli knulla"

178
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,920
It's the Karpe Diem song.

179
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,500
This here is not going to work!

180
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,520
What's up?

181
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,940
If you want to sleep with loads of girls
during Russetiden, then that's totally fine.

182
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,400
But if you think I'm just going to sit at home and wait for you,
then you're wrong.

183
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,560
Where is this coming from?

184
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,320
You're going to be sleeping around.

185
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,380
Okay, then you know more than me.

186
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,500
Yeah, you know what?
Your brother never had a girlfriend.

187
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,620
That he was "terribly depressed"
was just bullshit!

188
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,280
Yeah true, that was bullshit.

189
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,360
So you lied?

190
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,580
Yes.

191
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,800
Why?

192
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,620
Because you were wondering why I behaved
like that in front of my brother.

193
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,600
Then what's the truth?

194
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,800
You don't always tell the truth either.

195
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,360
But that's to protect Vilde.

196
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,040
I do it to protect you.
What's the difference?

197
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,000
The difference is that I don't need to be protected.

198
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,820
Have you asked Vilde if she wants to be protected?

199
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,080
Noora what is this really about?

200
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,800
Do you really think I worked so hard to be together with you

201
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,340
if I was going to sleep with loads of random girls during Russetiden?

202
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,780
Isn't that illogical?

203
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,820
No but.. that's not what it's about.

204
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,800
How do I get to know you then?

205
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,180
How can I trust you?

206
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,520
When you don't even want me to meet your family members?

207
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,360
You don't need to know my family to know me.

208
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,820
What about your family?

209
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,280
You've never even talked about them.

210
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Oh we can talk about my family!

211
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,360
I am an unplanned only child.

212
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,840
My mom is a sexologist, 
my dad is a psychologist.

213
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,220
They never loved me. They were only concerned about 
one another and their sex life.

214
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,040
I come from a shit town called Mjøndalen,
and fled as soon as I was 15. Fled to Madrid.

215
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,360
I talk to them once a month.

216
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,520
They are happy without me. 
I am happy without them.

217
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,980
I don't have siblings.

218
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
I already told you that, so.

219
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,660
Your turn.

220
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,040
I actually have a hard time believing that.

221
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,020
That they don't love you?

222
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,520
That's practically impossible.

223
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,320
It's your turn.

224
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,520
Hey you..

225
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,840
Look at me.

226
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,320
I realise that it may be difficult to trust me.

227
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,880
That I can't tell you everything.

228
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,220
But I don't want to hurt you.

229
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,680
I swear.

230
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,100
If you really want to meet my brother
I'll introduce you to him.

231
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,440
Okay?

232
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,740
Yes.

233
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,120
Maybe that wasn't so crazy.

234
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,300
Are that Chris and Isak?

235
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,940
Isak?

236
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,240
Yeah, he's in the first year.

237
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,480
Okay.

238
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,820
Isn't that a little strange?

239
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,400
I just didn't know they knew each other.

240
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,540
Same.
