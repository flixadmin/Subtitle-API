1
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,882
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,300
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,520
Now, let's try something
different: a challenge.

4
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,023
Who knows the electron wave functions...

5
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:57,027
for Kryptonian convalent bonding?

6
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,029
Sorry.

7
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,031
Leya?

8
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:05,035
The cube root of the wavelength
over the natural log...

9
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,038
of the integral of the speed of light...
I think squared.

10
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,042
Well, maybe that was a bit too easy.

11
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,339
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

12
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,301
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

13
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,979
Oh, it is beautiful.

14
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,440
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

15
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,443
I think... a tree.

16
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,528
A tree.

17
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,614
What is a tree?

18
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,074
A lovely thing which grows on Earth.

19
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,619
Earth? You mean
where my cousin went?

20
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,746
Hmm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

21
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,873
I might venture as well.

22
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,667
I don't believe you. How?

23
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,047
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

24
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,233
But you'd never survive
the pressure. It'll destroy...

25
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,593
In that I can. Zip-zap and I'm gone.

26
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,595
But you'd never leave us, Zaltar.

27
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,431
- You'd never leave Argo City.
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

28
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,099
Too much of a good thing here.

29
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:13,938
Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.
Yes, I think I might.

30
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,441
Saturn is... is that
further away than Earth?

31
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,650
Silly question.

32
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,070
Didn't you study six-dimensional
geometry at school?

33
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,678
Do they not teach anything anymore?

34
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:26,116
Well, of course they do.
I know the equations.

35
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,872
I just can't see them in my head.

36
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,085
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

37
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,588
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hm.

38
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,715
Saturn and Earth are in outer space

39
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,469
but we, we are in inner space.

40
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,347
Our city has two great power sources.

41
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,599
This is one of them. Look.

42
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,399
An omegahedron.

43
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,568
The Guardians let you have it?

44
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,988
Not exactly. I borrowed it.

45
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,407
You stole it. Oh, Zaltar, they're gonna...

46
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:10,619
No, borrowed it... for the afternoon.

47
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,916
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

48
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,065
But I think that I shall never see

49
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,192
the branches of a living tree.

50
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,946
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

51
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,783
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

52
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,202
That's a fancy shadow of the real thing

53
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,205
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

54
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,790
Kara.

55
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,294
- Kara!
- I'm here, mother I...

56
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,342
Kara, I've been looking for you for ages.

57
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,593
Oh, I'm sorry, mother.

58
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,929
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

59
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,598
We're just inventing miracles.

60
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,810
Put your fingers here,
Kara, and press hard.

61
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,731
Good. Now try it.

62
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,944
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

63
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:28,489
Zaltar, my-my husband tells me you talk

64
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,825
of leaving Argo City. For where?

65
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,161
Parts unknown. It is, alas, a fact.

66
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,121
You and Zor-El have a life here.

67
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,790
You've each other and Kara.

68
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,669
But, Zaltar, you founded this city.
It's yours.

69
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,214
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack

70
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,050
and then what? What is beyond?

71
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,761
Alura, I cannot contain
myself to Argo City only.

72
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,097
My head is boiling with ideas.

73
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,016
My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.

74
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,727
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat

75
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,731
yourself here with
all this airy, glittery stuff.

76
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,527
Exactly. That's why I'm going to Venus.

77
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,072
Venus? When?

78
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,325
Tomorrow or the next day, at the latest.

79
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,661
Zaltar, have you thought about this?

80
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,705
It doesn't make sense to me.

81
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,042
I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.

82
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,342
Kara! The power source!

83
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:20,100
Oh, Zaltar! Save me. Please! Help!

84
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,853
- No!
- Kara!

85
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:27,900
Zaltar! Help! No!

86
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,581
You took the omegahedron.

87
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,917
That's not correct,
I lost the omegahedron.

88
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,835
- No, father, I did...
- Shh, Kara.

89
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,253
No matter who.

90
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,881
Without it this city can't
survive more than a few days.

91
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,259
Our lights will grow dim and
the very air we breathe so thin.

92
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,261
I know. So I shall find it.

93
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,431
I shall go right to the end of
inner space and I'll return it.

94
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,519
Impossible. How? No one can
leave Argo City and you know it.

95
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,355
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

96
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:10,109
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

97
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:14,822
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler.

98
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,283
Like a coward you choose
instant destruction

99
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,577
while the rest of us
are doomed to stay here...

100
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,728
Kara!

101
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,438
Kara, no!

102
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,582
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

103
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, no, she won't.

104
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,712
She will be safe, through the binary

105
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,006
through the warp, into another register.

106
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,007
Another what?

107
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,884
Gravitational radiation

108
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:20,554
a pathway from inner space
to outer space.

109
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,473
Then she'll never be the same, ever.

110
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,559
At least she'll be alive.

111
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,812
And my fate is sealed.

112
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,607
I've lost the omegahedron.

113
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,193
I must be sent to the Phantom Zone.

114
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,987
Your suffering will be short,

115
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,657
mine... forever.

116
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,570
Some more champagne,
my dear Selena?

117
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,116
What are you thinking about?

118
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,414
It's such a pretty world.

119
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:15,043
I can't wait until it's all mine.

120
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,254
The only way you can rule the world

121
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,840
is to become invisible, my pumpkin.

122
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,175
Invisible?

123
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:26,179
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

124
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,723
Oh, I do know.

125
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,976
Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man,

126
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,688
place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then...

127
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,732
Nigel, enough.

128
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:40,527
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

129
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,197
Nigel, how long have we been together?

130
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,616
Ooh. Months, darling.

131
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,786
Then why does it seem like years?

132
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,708
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

133
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,210
It's a lifetime to discover the secrets

134
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,213
of black magic from
the ancient grimoires.

135
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,050
More champagne, my sweetness?

136
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,056
Don't call me...

137
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,557
"Your sweetness."

138
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,561
I am not sweet.

139
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,564
I am Selena.

140
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:22,569
And I am a bitter, bitter pill to swallow.

141
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,366
Holy cow.

142
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,976
I wonder.

143
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:06,905
Immortality be upon this one.

144
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:12,494
She is a sharer
of the sun's everlasting life.

145
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,206
There will now be no danger of death.

146
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:21,002
This world will keep her forever.

147
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,879
What is it?

148
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,466
What's going on? Hey, what's going on?

149
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,302
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

150
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,096
These things happen.

151
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,765
You can't treat me like this, Selena.

152
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,268
Without me you'd
still be reading tea leaves

153
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,103
at Lake Tahoe.

154
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:47,154
Amsterdam and more. That's TWA.
Never has flying been easier.

155
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,867
You can't run out on me, Selena.

156
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,369
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

157
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,164
The president confirmed reports
that Superman has embarked

158
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:59,708
on a special peace-seeking
mission to a galaxy

159
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,293
scientists estimate may be

160
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,628
several hundred trillion
light-years from our own...

161
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,903
Whoo-whoo!

162
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,117
Now, here's the weather
from the general Chicago area

163
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,661
increasing cloudiness with
the possibility of showers.

164
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,164
Breezy but warm with a high of 62.

165
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,718
Bianca!

166
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:03,636
I'm home.

167
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,850
Bianca!

168
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,560
Wha-at?

169
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,480
Show your face.

170
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,735
I have a surprise for you.

171
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,494
They've turned off the hot water again.

172
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:31,539
I'm really gonna have to Kill
somebody down at the DWP.

173
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,209
The only way we're gonna
pay our bills next month

174
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,962
in this dump, is to just go
ahead and start our own coven.

175
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,964
No longer necessary.

176
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,133
I was reading in this book.

177
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,927
"The Witches Guide to Heaven and Hell"

178
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,679
if you start your
own coven all you've to do

179
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,288
is charge five bucks a head,
minimal admission. That's great.

180
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

181
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,521
What's in the Coffer of Shadow
there? Where's little Nigel?

182
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,940
Nigel, my dear Bianca, is history.

183
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,399
Oh, yeah? How so?

184
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,111
The water department is history.
The car payments are history.

185
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,905
The mortgage payments are history.

186
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:06,241
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

187
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,953
The world is at last my oyster.

188
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,996
If I can figure this thing out...

189
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:17,501
Would you mind letting Bianca in
on this unexpected bit of good luck?

190
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,504
Or whatever it is?

191
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,005
Ba-ad luck.

192
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:26,009
I have been chosen.
The powers of darkness...

193
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,013
I think may, at long last...
Have come to their senses.

194
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:33,016
You wanna hear some bad luck?
The phone company says...

195
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:36,520
unless we pay this bill today,
they're turning the phone off!

196
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,523
Shut up, shut up. Watch.

197
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,778
Learn something for a change.

198
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:57,166
Oh, my god.

199
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,044
Are you doing that?

200
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:04,298
It's a trick, right? It's a trick.

201
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,304
I think it's done. Selena, I think it's done.

202
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,941
Oh, my god.

203
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,445
It's gonna take a little practice.

204
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,073
Now, this I like.

205
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,744
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

206
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:40,496
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

207
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,249
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am?

208
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,627
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

209
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,089
You got it in one, Billy boy. Lovers' Lane.

210
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,051
Oh, no, you see, what I meant was is

211
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,428
well, those lights over there.
What are they called?

212
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:58,431
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

213
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,723
Ah!

214
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,184
Stop that.

215
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,563
You're, uh, Superman's best friend, huh?

216
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,777
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

217
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:14,447
It's a power source vital to
Argo City. That's where I live.

218
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:16,032
No kidding.

219
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,785
Eddie and me here

220
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:21,329
we're on a secret mission also.

221
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,998
We're out looking for a good time.

222
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,835
And you just won the brass ring, baby.

223
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:46,896
Oh, she works out, huh?

224
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,439
Why are you doing this?

225
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,442
It's just the way we are.

226
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:01,285
You shouldn't have done that, baby.

227
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,123
Come on.

228
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,756
Oh, I see.

229
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,969
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

230
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,596
Come on. Come...

231
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,805
Ow!

232
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,688
Huh?

233
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:34,068
Eddie, I think maybe we should

234
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,156
kinda keep this to ourselves.
What do you think?

235
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,455
Freddie, you little devil. How are you?

236
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,334
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

237
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,095
Try telling your wife. I need another.

238
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,514
Where is it? Where's
the little mystery ball?

239
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,309
Let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

240
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:07,310
I hate light.

241
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:09,812
Is it electrical? Is it hot to the touch?

242
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,106
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

243
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:15,067
Go mix. Leave me to my thoughts.

244
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,528
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad.

245
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,780
Who are they? Wrinkly little wretches.

246
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:22,700
These are my foot soldiers, Nigel.

247
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,328
My army of the night.

248
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,957
I'm considering nothing
less than world... domination.

249
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:33,251
World domination? So you start by
letting Bianca get on the phone

250
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,754
to the local psychical research
society and say,

251
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,757
"Hello, got anyone over there
wants to join a coven?"

252
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,260
There are time-honored ways
of doing this, honey bunch.

253
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:45,764
Centuries-old rules to follow.

254
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,766
I have a secret, Selena.

255
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,487
How exciting for you, Nigel.
Best write it down before you forget it.

256
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:52,146
After you left me in the lurch

257
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,357
I saw something that should
worry you greatly

258
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:57,026
if you're serious about
taking over this planet.

259
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,864
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

260
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,659
I've a secret too, Nigel.

261
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,536
I have the power.

262
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,622
Get that through your head.

263
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,291
Selena is through worrying.

264
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,294
The shoe is on the other foot
and it's their turn to worry,

265
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:20,299
All those who mocked me
when my chips were down.

266
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,261
Oh, I bet they're in for it now, eh?

267
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,263
Count on it.

268
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,312
I have in my time seen
a great number of things

269
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,814
even more impressive

270
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:37,817
than a human cigarette lighter, dear lady.

271
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:40,194
To wit.

272
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,993
What is that?

273
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:50,663
Overreaching ambition.

274
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:51,871
Take heed.

275
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,751
Touched a little nerve, didn't I?

276
00:29:58,045 --> 00:29:59,088
Hello.

277
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,798
Hello.

278
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,009
The red toad that lurks in the briars

279
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:05,261
and brambles is full of sorceries.

280
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:07,263
There's a little bone on the left side.

281
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,097
A little bone?

282
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,058
A little bone, which
if bound to a man stirs up

283
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,852
the greatest lust.

284
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,272
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

285
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:20,359
I was put on this earth to thrill millions.

286
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,738
Mmm, this is scrumptious.

287
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:27,366
Why don't we go somewhere else
and dance cheek to cheek?

288
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,128
Stop it, Selena! That's not fair.

289
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,838
Pick on me.

290
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,057
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

291
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,726
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

292
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,645
Get out of my house, Nigel

293
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,231
and don't come slithering back.

294
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:02,752
Listen, Selena, I'm the only one
who can save you from yourself.

295
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:07,239
- You need me.
- Like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower, kiddo.

296
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,117
I'm warning you, Selena

297
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,286
don't be so shortsighted.

298
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,254
Okay, folks. The show's over!

299
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:25,257
Let's party.

300
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,640
Freddie, darling, thank you for coming.
Goodbye!

301
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,642
- Good party.
- Thank you. Lovely to see you.

302
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,145
Bye!

303
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:47,529
Four people signed up. We got 20 bucks,
cash on the barrel head.

304
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,031
- Four people?
- They loved the food.

305
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:54,035
They were real impressed with that
spinning top number you did on that girl.

306
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:56,538
But when Nigel walked out
the way he did,

307
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,040
I gotta say it hurt us.

308
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:02,545
They thought he was giving you
a warning to slow down.

309
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:05,547
Rome wasn't built in a day.

310
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:10,553
A warning? A warning, they say?

311
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:16,058
Nobody gets a warning anymore.

312
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,740
Good morning.

313
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,459
Have you got it, Lucy?
Must be near that oak tree.

314
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,794
- Hurry up.
- Found it, guys.

315
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,673
What are you doing? You're
supposed to find the ball.

316
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,096
Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.

317
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,600
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go. Let's go.

318
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,685
Okay. Okay. Let's play ball.

319
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,604
Alright, batter.

320
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:13,491
I couldn't make it. I have to finish my...

321
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,305
Hey, toss the ball back, will you?

322
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,736
Come on, make it two in a row.

323
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,030
Play ball.

324
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,487
- Where have you been?
- With the principal.

325
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,054
Danvers is doing his usual number.

326
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,056
Jeez, another barfy new student.

327
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,976
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

328
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,062
Hang in there, Danvers.

329
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,689
Don't let them get to you.

330
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:31,402
Thirty days. Semester
just started. You'll be...

331
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,572
- Hello, I...
- Didn't knock.

332
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:37,074
Don't we teach you
manners around here?

333
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,963
Don't we try to impress
on our young ladies

334
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,869
that animals in the jungle never knock

335
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:44,206
but Midvale girls always do.
Where you going? Come back here.

336
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,291
Come in.

337
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,503
I forgot, I'm just not used to...

338
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,171
Wait a minute.

339
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,091
Wait just one second.

340
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,178
I have never before
in my life laid eyes on you

341
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,387
have I, young lady?

342
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,223
- No, sir, I'm new here.
- New here?

343
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,018
Obviously you're new if I've
never laid eyes on you before.

344
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:06,770
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

345
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,314
Umm...

346
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,569
On Earth, I'm Lee.

347
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,153
Linda Lee.

348
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
Where's your letter of recommendation?

349
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,198
Letter?

350
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:21,118
I must talk to you, principal.

351
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,288
- I am busy now.
- So are they, them.

352
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,665
All the little monsters
you admit to the place.

353
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,793
They have nailed my desk drawers shut.

354
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,796
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

355
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,005
Come, Danvers.

356
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,424
I will not be provoked.

357
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,010
I will not let him get to me this semester.

358
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:39,637
I'll be strong. Be strong.

359
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,263
Be like a rock.

360
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,421
What did you say your name was?

361
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,406
Oh, yes. Linda Lee, huh?

362
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,325
Yes, my cousin probably wrote you.

363
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:04,244
Umm, maybe you got
his letter under K for Kent?

364
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,704
In your files.

365
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,914
Kent?

366
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,207
Kent?

367
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,710
It doesn't ring any bells.

368
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:14,546
Doesn't even ring a...

369
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,801
Oh, here it is. Big as life.

370
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,856
“My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf

371
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,721
of a very special young lady.”

372
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,306
An orphan?

373
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,660
Don't expect to be treated any differently

374
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,768
on that account, Miss Lee.

375
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,353
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

376
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,146
One way or another, we're all alone

377
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,400
on this... miserable little planet.

378
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,443
Yes, sir, I know.

379
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,279
Since your school records were
obviously lost in the mail

380
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,323
you'll have to start at the bottom.

381
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,117
It's only fair to the other girls.

382
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:46,995
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing...

383
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,372
All at once?

384
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,707
And chemistry.

385
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:53,085
Idle hands are the
devil's playground. This way.

386
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,636
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

387
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,237
Open up, Lane, I know you're in there.

388
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,574
I'm not decent, Mr. Danvers sir.

389
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,326
And you never will be either.
You little liar.

390
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,540
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

391
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:33,000
No.

392
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,085
I'm supposed to have a single this term.

393
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,337
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

394
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,590
Disappointments thicken our skins.

395
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:41,717
Who wants thick skin?

396
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,179
I'm Linda Lee.

397
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,808
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

398
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:52,436
I'm Lucy Lane.

399
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,354
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

400
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,190
- No, it isn't.
- What?

401
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,567
- She's Linda Lee and I'm...
- Lucy Lane.

402
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,527
You two know each other.

403
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,404
Oh, no. We just met.

404
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,740
- When?
- Just now.

405
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:07,367
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

406
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,661
- Oh, gee, I don't think I...
- Oh, of course.

407
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,039
The Daily Planet, of course.

408
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:15,793
Linda's cousin works there. And
your sister, what's her name?

409
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,212
The one that's always
calling me and bothering me?

410
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,923
- Lois.
- Ah, yes, that's the one.

411
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,802
Anyway, show our new
Miss Lee around, Miss Lane.

412
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,430
Oh, by the way, she's an orphan

413
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,016
but don't let her play
on your sympathies, hmm?

414
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:49,076
So, who's your cousin?

415
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:50,284
Clark Kent.

416
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:53,539
You're kidding me.

417
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,458
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

418
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,836
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

419
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,504
Does my sister know him?

420
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:04,299
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

421
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,236
I guess, if they worked
at the same newspaper

422
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,427
they must know each other.

423
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,264
- Well...
- Is this where I'll sleep?

424
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:12,975
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

425
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,769
Nonstop excitement in this dorm.

426
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,940
All the real dementals are sent here.

427
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,569
So, when's the rest of your stuff arriving?

428
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,405
I don't have any other stuff.

429
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,282
What? It's all in that little bag?

430
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,454
Oh, well, you see, I have the
means to buy more, it's just...

431
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,790
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since...

432
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,393
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

433
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:59,771
My sister's got something
goin' with the big guy.

434
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,580
Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes

435
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:04,818
any time you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

436
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,321
Thank you. You're very kind.

437
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,784
He's a real character. A real hunk.

438
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,397
I'll introduce you to him someday

439
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,830
if we wind up getting along.

440
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,881
Well, you haven't had
a chance since, what?

441
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:29,050
- Did you have a fire at your house or something?
- Fire?

442
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,137
Well, you know.
How your parents got killed.

443
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:37,058
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Oh, sure.

444
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,562
I'm sorry. Me and my motor mouth.

445
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,607
Now, then, focus your tiny minds

446
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,943
on the kind of problem
that it used to take

447
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,862
weeks of thought before the computer.

448
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,989
Even now it can take a long time

449
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,325
without certain algorithms

450
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,954
which... if you behave for two seconds

451
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,456
I might reveal to you.

452
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,925
Love, hate, love, hate.

453
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,885
Love.

454
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,096
The cards have decided

455
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:17,265
people will do anything for love.

456
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,227
They'll jump off cliffs for love.

457
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:22,938
They'll drown themselves like lemmings.

458
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:28,652
So... I'll make everybody love me.

459
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,529
Oh, no chance.

460
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:33,031
You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

461
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,660
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

462
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:41,456
Why are we not moving?

463
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,876
Because I'm in love.

464
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,964
Come here, you beautiful thing.

465
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,801
He's cute.

466
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,598
Hey, what's going on?

467
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,893
Here's an exercise in
big numbers I want you to try...

468
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,605
It's trying to tell me something.

469
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,025
Well, what? That we're near danger?

470
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,860
I don't know. How do I know?

471
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:18,994
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

472
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,413
My prince has come.

473
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,874
Oh, no.

474
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:25,375
I saw him first, Selena.

475
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,711
That's not fair. I copied his number first.

476
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:30,255
Well done. Now, let's get out of here.

477
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,536
Average size of a Chinese family

478
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:39,222
average age of death
and marriage and pregnancy.

479
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,808
Use this equation to compute
the population of China

480
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,727
in the year 2040.

481
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:46,772
Linda... are you with us?

482
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,401
Umm...

483
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,863
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

484
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,281
Where, might I ask?

485
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,076
W-well, here, sir. On Earth... sir.

486
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,038
How fortunate for the rest of us.

487
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,999
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

488
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,795
and not at your terminal like
your other little friends here

489
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:12,130
you were in fact, hard at work

490
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,383
solving this little equation?

491
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:17,594
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

492
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,471
- I mean, I was...
- Excellent.

493
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:20,889
The answer, please.

494
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,726
Pay attention, class, Miss Lee
is about to enlighten us.

495
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,771
Five billion, two hundred
and seventy one million

496
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,022
nine thousand and ten.

497
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:37,114
Come on, let's get outta here
before he makes you stay.

498
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,157
Come on, hurry.

499
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,331
Miss Lee.

500
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,583
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

501
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,877
Have you been going
through my papers?

502
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,963
Of course not, sir.

503
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,215
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

504
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:57,425
- How?
- I guess, I just...

505
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:59,761
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

506
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,889
All the storms, shock waves,
electromagnetism.

507
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,142
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

508
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,601
We gotta go, sir.

509
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,535
Oh, boy, thanks. You know I gotta learn...

510
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,191
How did you know the answer?

511
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,361
I don't know. Six-dimensional geometry.

512
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,488
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

513
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,615
Well, you want some friendly advice?

514
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,660
Don't go showing it off
'cause nobody's gonna like you.

515
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,287
I'll see you later.

516
00:44:39,217 --> 00:44:42,219
Hey, Lucy, where's your roomie?
Out to lunch?

517
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,974
No, she heard you were gonna be here,
Myra, and she got sick to her stomach.

518
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,979
Hey, Linda, wait a minute.
Come on. Stay.

519
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,982
Yeah, aren't we good enough for you?

520
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:56,483
Can I have my books back, please, Myra?

521
00:44:56,484 --> 00:44:58,485
Say "please".

522
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:01,990
- I just did.
- Say it again.

523
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,496
Please, can I have my books back?

524
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,500
God, what a wimp.

525
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,004
Geography? You're not taking
geography, are you, Linda?

526
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:19,506
- "Midvale and its points of interest?"
- Good, short book.

527
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:23,510
I'm just trying to learn a little bit about...

528
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:27,015
More in the... in the place that I... I live.

529
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:29,516
I have to go study.

530
00:45:29,517 --> 00:45:33,520
"Oh, I have to go study.
I'm not boring enough yet."

531
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,524
- Shut up, Myra.
- Make me.

532
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,694
Bug off.

533
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:45,700
All right. All right!

534
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:54,042
Now, who's gonna clean up this mess?
Not me.

535
00:45:56,044 --> 00:46:00,548
- Why didn't anybody tell us she was coming?
- We didn't care.

536
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:08,889
Ah!

537
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,977
Nice going.

538
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:14,876
You know she tripped you on purpose?

539
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,483
Absolutely. She's retarded.

540
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,113
There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.

541
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,117
You take it, Myra.

542
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,246
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

543
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,335
Come on, team. Come on.

544
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,178
Hey, you guys alright?

545
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:50,356
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Yes. You alright?

546
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,766
Myra, how'd she do that?

547
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,685
- It hit her shoulder.
- I don't know.

548
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:08,866
Listen, you better keep an eye out for Myra now.
She's out to get you.

549
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:13,371
- Me? Why?
- Because she hates anybody who's not afraid of her.

550
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,255
Hey, you guys, did you see that
cute guy in the softball field?

551
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,548
Oh, yes.

552
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:26,343
With the black hair and the big muscles?

553
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:27,551
He was something else.

554
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:30,263
- Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.

555
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,806
Talk? Who'd waste time talking?

556
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,934
He's working on the trees,
could be around for a while.

557
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:39,439
- Are they in?
- Yes.

558
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,904
Myra, you sure you wanna
go through with this?

559
00:47:46,112 --> 00:47:48,239
Hey, what's with you? Chicken?

560
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,368
Oh, boy, I'm really gonna enjoy this.

561
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,870
I can't wait to hear them scream.

562
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,248
Why don't you shut off the hot
and give them an ice bath?

563
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,584
Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.

564
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,920
If you shut off the cold you'll scald them.

565
00:48:02,128 --> 00:48:04,506
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

566
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:07,050
I want to see them suffer.

567
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,260
A-ah!

568
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:17,894
I am wet!

569
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,228
Ow!

570
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,774
Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

571
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,903
I hate you!

572
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,571
You never looked better!

573
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,532
We'll get you all!

574
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:38,706
What do you think?

575
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:41,543
It looks the same to me. It's kinda dull.

576
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:46,339
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

577
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,133
I can do it free of charge.

578
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:49,843
My ears what?

579
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:51,928
Pierced. Like in you know,
I take a needle

580
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,515
I heat it up and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap.

581
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:57,142
All the guys go crazy.

582
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,811
Because I've holes in my ears?

583
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:01,604
What are you, putting me on?

584
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:04,190
Sometimes I can't figure you out, Linda.

585
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,112
So, where are you going this weekend?

586
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,321
Nowhere.

587
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,240
Nowhere? Well, you can't
stay around here.

588
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,908
This place is depressing.

589
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,869
I mean, like the tombs.

590
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:17,620
- Why?
- Why?

591
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,706
What, were you born yesterday?

592
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,958
This is a three-day weekend.

593
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,002
A three-day weekend.

594
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:27,505
So, listen. Why don't
you come home with me?

595
00:49:27,922 --> 00:49:30,425
I only live about five miles
from here and I got this guy

596
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,010
coming up from Metropolis.

597
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,345
I think he knows your cousin Clark.

598
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,473
His name's Jimmy Olsen.

599
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,100
I think he's real stuck on me.

600
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,937
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

601
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:46,816
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

602
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,025
Nothing.

603
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,529
No, I think I'm gonna stay here and study

604
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,490
get things organized.

605
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,910
Don't forget to call me Saturday.

606
00:49:57,535 --> 00:49:58,745
Just a sec.

607
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:01,663
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

608
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,625
I'll see you later at Popeye's then, okay?

609
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,878
- Alright, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

610
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:08,086
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

611
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,171
Have a good time.

612
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,549
Come along now, Lucy.

613
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:15,929
- Oh, mom, how are you doing?
- I've had a terrible week.

614
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:27,333
"Take a spider off his web..."

615
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,463
"And shut him up inside..."

616
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,634
"Two shells of a nut."

617
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:41,973
"Now, boil the nut in oil

618
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:44,267
"into which has been added

619
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,311
"some of the web.

620
00:51:47,353 --> 00:51:51,190
"With a silver spoon, put two drops...

621
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,776
"of the oil"

622
00:51:54,902 --> 00:51:57,864
"into some water."

623
00:51:58,531 --> 00:51:59,531
Right.

624
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,577
"He who drinks the water

625
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:06,873
"shall be in love
with the first person he sees.

626
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,877
"Uh, so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell.

627
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:13,921
"Or one day goes by...

628
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:16,591
whichever comes first."

629
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:18,635
Big deal, one day.

630
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,720
Why don't you just use, you know.

631
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:22,805
I'm saving it for bigger things.

632
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:25,642
Hi, folks, you're missing the big sale.

633
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,645
Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.

634
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:31,105
Now to start off the hour.

635
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,166
Bianca, get the door.

636
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,795
Bianca!

637
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,635
You rang?

638
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:01,843
Hey, you!

639
00:53:04,555 --> 00:53:05,556
I said...

640
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:07,725
you rang?

641
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:08,934
Oh, yeah.

642
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,353
How you doing?

643
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:15,858
Uh, I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

644
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:19,612
- Madame Selena.
- Oh.

645
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,449
And you found her, lucky boy.

646
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,910
Entrer.

647
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:31,708
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

648
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,835
I always see your truck parked around.

649
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:35,336
Oh, yeah.

650
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,840
Yeah, I get a lot of repeat
business. People like my work.

651
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:42,260
Yes, I'm sure they do.

652
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,807
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

653
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:51,519
Oh, yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, I don't mind if I do.

654
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:23,676
So, uh, where's the one... ha-ha at?

655
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:24,885
It dropped dead.

656
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,429
Where at exactly? Uh, out back?

657
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:29,056
We might get to know each other
a little more

658
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:34,145
before we dig in and talk real turkey.

659
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,733
Well, uh, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

660
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:41,444
I mean, I do my work, I go home.

661
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,446
- To your wife?
- No.

662
00:54:43,654 --> 00:54:45,782
At the present moment in time
I'm currently enjoying

663
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,825
a single status in my personal life.

664
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,076
Cheers.

665
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,245
Bottoms up, huh?

666
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,454
Bottoms up.

667
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:01,047
I, uh, I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

668
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:02,965
What I want...

669
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,677
are some houseplants inside here.

670
00:55:08,012 --> 00:55:10,973
Something that goes well with the house.

671
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,184
This is a house?

672
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:15,436
Of course, it's a house.

673
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:18,606
There's the bedroom over there.

674
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,945
I think it's getting dark in here.

675
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:29,909
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna...

676
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:32,245
grow in this dump?

677
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,913
I don't know.

678
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,249
Shade plants?

679
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,752
- Hmm.
- To us.

680
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:42,922
Yeah, I'll-I'll drink...

681
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,423
to that.

682
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,930
Hm, you probably killed him, you know.

683
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:57,395
Sleep well.

684
00:55:57,895 --> 00:55:59,188
And when you wake...

685
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:03,526
drown in my eyes and be all mine.

686
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,822
I'll get it.

687
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:16,914
Oh, hello, Nigel. It's you.

688
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:18,875
Nice suit.

689
00:56:20,084 --> 00:56:21,084
Subtle.

690
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,879
I want to see Selena.

691
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:25,298
She's indisposed at the moment.

692
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:28,676
Whoever it is, we don't want any.

693
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,220
It's Nigel and he's not going away

694
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,264
until he talks to you.

695
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:37,018
What the devil do you want?

696
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:39,353
I want to make a very serious proposal.

697
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,563
In that outfit?

698
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:44,317
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off

699
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:45,943
from those little beasts at Midvale

700
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,153
and I intend to let my hair down.

701
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:52,824
Let's talk. Together we could really
rattle some cages.

702
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:55,912
- Know what I mean?
- I'm listening. Make it snappy.

703
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:04,045
Uh-oh.

704
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,007
That ball will not operate at it's fullest

705
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,427
until you internalize your power, Selena.

706
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,472
Some mosaic invocations.

707
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,140
- Some what?
- Come again?

708
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,267
Exactly, that's my point.

709
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,521
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

710
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:06,524
Because we own the matches.

711
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:10,528
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

712
00:58:10,736 --> 00:58:11,779
Now, goodbye, Nigel.

713
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,198
- It was nice talking to you.
- No, it wasn't.

714
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,952
I hate to seem pushy,
my fairest of the fair but...

715
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,578
A word of advice, Nigel.

716
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,747
If I had your skin problems,

717
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,458
I'd stop bothering people,
put a bag over my head,

718
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,168
and go live under a bridge!

719
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,377
Ouch!

720
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:31,257
There's nothing wrong with my skin.

721
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,470
You know, some people.

722
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:39,473
Where is he?

723
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:42,143
Where is he?

724
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,029
Where is he?

725
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,157
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

726
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:57,950
What? For a day tops, right?

727
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:00,220
He was too young
for you anyway, you know.

728
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:03,289
No, I do not know. Where is he?

729
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:12,214
Hey, I know that guy.

730
00:59:18,262 --> 00:59:21,682
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

731
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,851
This is a mirror.

732
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:27,396
So, how come we could...

733
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,065
ever see him in it?

734
00:59:29,273 --> 00:59:31,567
That was magic, dammit.

735
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,486
The power.

736
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:36,238
Oh, so make it happen again, you know?

737
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:40,326
I... can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it.

738
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:41,577
Oh.

739
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:44,538
Maybe, you should let
that thing out of it's box.

740
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,458
Maybe, it's more powerful
if you let it out of it's box.

741
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:48,666
- The box.
- The box.

742
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:50,503
- Where is it?
- The box?

743
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:52,546
It's underneath the rug, where you left it.

744
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,173
Go ahead.

745
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:02,681
It's stuck.

746
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:08,062
This is not my day.

747
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:10,271
It's stuck?

748
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,565
How could it be stuck?

749
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,401
It's growing.

750
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,696
How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.

751
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Oh.

752
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,503
Too bad, there's no sound.

753
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,673
How come there's no sound?

754
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:38,551
Get off the road, turkey!

755
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:41,637
Hey, dummy, you wanna die?

756
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,681
Smoking, stupid?

757
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:45,641
You wanna kill yourself?

758
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,915
She saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.

759
01:00:58,028 --> 01:01:01,282
I told her to take him for
every cent, clean him out.

760
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,701
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

761
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:12,168
Here you go, everybody.
Who wants onion rings?

762
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:13,419
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

763
01:01:13,627 --> 01:01:15,713
- Some French fries?
- French fries are mine.

764
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:18,090
Chicken for myself. Thank you.

765
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,884
- Thanks.
- Side order tomatoes?

766
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:21,427
Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.

767
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:22,970
I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

768
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,431
- You want a root beer?
- Yeah, thanks.

769
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,475
Oh, there's Linda.

770
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,479
Hey, Linda!

771
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,982
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

772
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,525
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

773
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:38,109
Who's Clark Kent?

774
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:39,235
Is that Linda?

775
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:43,866
- Guess what.
- What?

776
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:45,954
There's this all-night party
tonight at Eddie's.

777
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,453
He's the guy with the tattoo.

778
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:49,038
His folks are out of town.

779
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,333
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

780
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,335
So, you wanna come?

781
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:56,921
I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

782
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:59,757
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

783
01:01:59,965 --> 01:02:01,926
Mrs. Murphy's drunk as a skunk by now.

784
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:03,636
Totally on another planet.

785
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:05,971
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

786
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,973
But that's why it'll be fun.

787
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,433
- Okay?
- Okay.

788
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,312
Get off the road, buddy.

789
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,605
Hey, stupid.

790
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,859
- Hey, you, space cadet, get out of the street!
- Hey, idiot!

791
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,405
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

792
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,032
He's probably on drugs.

793
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,576
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

794
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,412
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, I-I'm Kara.

795
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,789
- Who?
- Who?

796
01:02:31,997 --> 01:02:33,082
Oh, I'm...

797
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:35,000
concerned.

798
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,127
Well, that if we don't do something.

799
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,922
You go out there, try to help
a guy like that and he's

800
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:42,049
probably got a gun or a knife.

801
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,384
It's not too safe.

802
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,552
Hey, I'm starving. Let's eat.

803
01:02:45,886 --> 01:02:47,221
Come on, Linda.

804
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:54,603
Power of shadow.

805
01:02:56,313 --> 01:03:00,859
Bring him to me.

806
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:35,394
Whoa.

807
01:03:39,231 --> 01:03:41,692
Look at that.

808
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,824
Hey, get out.

809
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,998
Look out. Watch out.

810
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,592
My car!

811
01:05:14,868 --> 01:05:16,578
You've never seen a tattoo
before, Linda?

812
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,455
- Look!
- What's that?

813
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,249
There's somebody hanging out of it.

814
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:22,137
Doesn't look like there's anybody driving.

815
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:25,879
Oh, my God. It's a runaway.

816
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,904
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- Hey, what's she doing?

817
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:34,888
Lucy, be careful. Lucy!

818
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:37,975
- Come on.
- Lucy!

819
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:13,552
God, there's the pump?

820
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,251
She's still in there.

821
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,385
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

822
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:02,434
Are you okay?

823
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,229
It's gasoline! It's gasoline!

824
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:48,730
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

825
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,639
A storm dragon?

826
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,685
A Supergirl.

827
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:18,236
Oh, my God!

828
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:25,452
Don't. Don't look at her.

829
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,627
You're gonna be alright.

830
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,921
There's no broken bones.

831
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:43,637
I love you.

832
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:47,015
What did he say?

833
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:48,850
What did he say?

834
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,144
Looked like "I love you", to me.

835
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,189
No! No!

836
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,483
You love me?

837
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,112
With all my heart, forever.

838
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,489
A bird of free and careless wing

839
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,658
was I through many a smiling spring.

840
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:06,433
The cold repulse, the look askance.

841
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:09,371
The lightning of love's angry glance, stay.

842
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,457
Let me behold you.

843
01:10:27,472 --> 01:10:29,391
I-I have to go.

844
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,477
Like melting wax or withering flower,

845
01:10:33,478 --> 01:10:35,479
I feel my passion...

846
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,482
and thy power.

847
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:40,610
Oh, I-I have to go.

848
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:44,823
Everything's under control.

849
01:10:45,031 --> 01:10:46,199
Lucy!

850
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,535
Just go on, back to your homes.

851
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:49,744
Lucy.

852
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:51,830
- Oh.
- Thank God.

853
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,626
- You alright?
- I think so.

854
01:10:57,043 --> 01:10:58,086
I hit my head.

855
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,172
Nigel must know her.

856
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:03,633
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

857
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,094
No. I don't think that at all.

858
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,472
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

859
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,432
at the wrong time, right?

860
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,019
Materializing in a bulldozer, huh?

861
01:11:14,227 --> 01:11:15,395
She's a wimpy little thing.

862
01:11:15,645 --> 01:11:17,525
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

863
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:21,151
Because nobody gets in my way.

864
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,837
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

865
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,780
and worry about the other one that flies?

866
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:28,742
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

867
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,537
Oh, come on now. She's just a teenager.

868
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:37,292
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

869
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,003
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

870
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:43,715
The naming of names is not necessary.

871
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:47,010
Let us concentrate on her face.

872
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,514
And my Shadow will do the rest.

873
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,098
Your what?

874
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:54,434
Power of Shadow...

875
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:57,187
take shape.

876
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:01,733
Look like a vicious dark star.

877
01:12:02,442 --> 01:12:06,154
Seek out, that wretched young creature.

878
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:09,699
And destroy her wherever she...

879
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,411
are.

880
01:12:13,745 --> 01:12:15,163
Oh, God. That's awful.

881
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,832
That's never gonna work.

882
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:37,644
Oh, my God!

883
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,480
I'm scared.

884
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:07,549
Next time...

885
01:13:09,175 --> 01:13:11,094
remind me to do this outside.

886
01:15:54,632 --> 01:15:57,844
Leave this place and do no harm.

887
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,639
There she is again.

888
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:04,559
What did she say?

889
01:16:05,393 --> 01:16:06,811
No, this is not possible.

890
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,397
This is not right.

891
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,982
Where's the wimp?

892
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,608
Ah!

893
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:14,944
Argh!

894
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:25,497
Argh!

895
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,084
I think he can take care of her.

896
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:30,292
Ah!

897
01:16:31,544 --> 01:16:32,879
Argh!

898
01:16:52,273 --> 01:16:54,567
See? What did I tell you?

899
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:57,028
She quit, right?

900
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,237
Wrong.

901
01:18:04,053 --> 01:18:05,889
Every time!

902
01:18:06,097 --> 01:18:07,974
Every time!

903
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,144
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

904
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:15,565
Damn her eyes. Who is she?

905
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:18,818
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you.

906
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,737
Find out!

907
01:18:20,945 --> 01:18:24,782
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

908
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,831
Leave him alone. Let him.

909
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,791
Where have you been?

910
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,668
- Outside...
- Look at you.

911
01:18:36,502 --> 01:18:37,879
Look at those clothes.

912
01:18:38,087 --> 01:18:39,422
Oh, I'll go change. I-I'm sorry.

913
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:42,926
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

914
01:18:43,134 --> 01:18:45,637
And get out of that ridiculous costume.

915
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:46,845
Yes, ma'am.

916
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:49,098
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

917
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:52,143
Don't you "yes, ma'am" me.

918
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,603
No, ma'am.

919
01:18:56,272 --> 01:18:58,272
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

920
01:18:58,358 --> 01:18:59,359
if you want my opinion.

921
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,946
Oh, no. This box is
definitely getting bigger...

922
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,365
and uglier.

923
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:07,492
All I'm saying is you can't go nuts

924
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,370
over a landscape guy and a
teenager in a blue suit.

925
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:11,996
She flies.

926
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,749
Can you get that through your thick skull

927
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,460
and into your tiny brain, Bianca?

928
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,088
The girl can fly.

929
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:38,564
Okay.

930
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,024
Now.

931
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,986
Let's get serious.

932
01:19:44,028 --> 01:19:46,781
Come to mama.

933
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:50,201
- Oh.
- Oh.

934
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,497
Oh.

935
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:55,706
Whoa.

936
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,394
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

937
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,759
I think we're venturing where

938
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:32,929
you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

939
01:21:33,262 --> 01:21:36,265
I'm no angel.

940
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:27,024
It's the wimp again.

941
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:30,027
And she's trespassing.

942
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:33,905
First the school,

943
01:22:33,906 --> 01:22:36,908
Now here.

944
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:40,912
You know, this thing reacts
whenever she's around.

945
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:44,416
And whenever she shows up,
that girl that flies...

946
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,418
that "Supergirl"...

947
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:49,921
Isn't far behind.

948
01:22:49,922 --> 01:22:52,425
Maybe they're best friends.

949
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,487
Hello.

950
01:23:12,695 --> 01:23:15,031
Oh, no. Not now.

951
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:17,408
'Tis only but me, my love.

952
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:19,368
Please, you'll let everyone know.

953
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:20,912
What? That I love you?

954
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,663
I'd shout it from the highest hill.

955
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,499
Please don't.

956
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:27,460
I know you think me the fool,
at least tell me your name.

957
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,045
Linda. Linda Lee.

958
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:30,545
Linda.

959
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,715
Lovely Linda Lee.

960
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:35,843
These roses pale beside thee.

961
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:39,054
Oh.

962
01:23:40,264 --> 01:23:41,325
Well, thank you, but I'm...

963
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,684
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

964
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:46,395
Hm.

965
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:56,905
What are you doing?

966
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:00,535
Please?

967
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:03,746
Oh, no, I...

968
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:04,955
Please.

969
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,916
Well, alright. But just for a minute.

970
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:22,598
You hate me, don't you?

971
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:26,143
Hate you? I don't even know you.

972
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:27,645
I don't even know your name.

973
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,522
Ethan.

974
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:33,985
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

975
01:24:34,193 --> 01:24:35,444
- Look, Ethan...
- Huh!

976
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:39,991
Ethan.

977
01:24:41,867 --> 01:24:42,867
Ethan.

978
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:46,998
Your soft caress did at once renew

979
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:48,833
the beating of this broken heart.

980
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,294
Are you crazy?

981
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:55,756
Marry me?

982
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:08,102
Marry you?

983
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:11,230
- I don't...
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

984
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,439
I know.

985
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:13,773
What?

986
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,319
We're from different worlds.

987
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,822
- You mean, you know where I'm...
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

988
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:22,575
Love makes everything possible.

989
01:25:23,242 --> 01:25:26,829
A poor uneducated gardener can
indeed worship a rich debutante

990
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,831
and make her happy if she'd just...

991
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,499
Oh, Ethan.

992
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:32,835
I'm not rich. I'm just...

993
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:35,296
Well, then I'll support us both.

994
01:25:36,839 --> 01:25:38,883
You're nuts, you know that?

995
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:42,136
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

996
01:25:44,096 --> 01:25:45,264
Over you.

997
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,275
What a touching scene.

998
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:29,100
Round and round they go.

999
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:32,436
Where they stop.

1000
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:46,033
Boy, you're really getting the hang of this.

1001
01:26:47,743 --> 01:26:48,994
Oh.

1002
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:56,001
Where is she?

1003
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:01,424
Jesus.

1004
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,884
Who are you?

1005
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,762
I am Selena.

1006
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:09,432
Diadanus of Catania.

1007
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,561
Priestess of Sechnid.
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor

1008
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:19,567
and you, little lady, are
trespassing on private property.

1009
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:21,485
She means him.

1010
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:24,196
I am Kara of Argo City.

1011
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,323
Daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

1012
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,410
And I don't scare easily.

1013
01:27:29,618 --> 01:27:30,618
No?

1014
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:32,245
No.

1015
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,457
Try...

1016
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,168
this.

1017
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:58,230
This lady is improving by leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell you.

1018
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,940
You okay?

1019
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,817
No.

1020
01:29:26,902 --> 01:29:29,446
You want a hacksaw or somethin'?

1021
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:46,005
Now I am really upset.

1022
01:30:34,386 --> 01:30:35,638
What's going on?

1023
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,181
Oh.

1024
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:39,975
Put me down.

1025
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:50,861
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

1026
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:53,113
Safe? Where's Linda?

1027
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:54,949
Put me down.

1028
01:31:00,245 --> 01:31:02,164
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

1029
01:31:10,089 --> 01:31:11,089
Ethan.

1030
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,175
Ha-ha. Very clever.

1031
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,761
That ought to keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

1032
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:18,722
Clever? A cheap trick.

1033
01:31:22,851 --> 01:31:24,979
Power of Shadow.

1034
01:31:25,187 --> 01:31:28,774
Bring him to me.

1035
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:39,451
Bring him... to me.

1036
01:31:42,204 --> 01:31:43,204
Ugh!

1037
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,373
Didn't work, huh?

1038
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:45,916
Maybe they're too far away.

1039
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,961
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy.

1040
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:52,965
But I still can't control men's minds.

1041
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:55,426
Not with her around.

1042
01:31:55,634 --> 01:31:56,677
So maybe...

1043
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:58,887
Now, don't go through the roof.

1044
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:00,723
But maybe we ought to back down

1045
01:32:00,931 --> 01:32:03,726
and give old you-know-who a call.

1046
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:05,728
You-know-who.

1047
01:32:05,936 --> 01:32:07,604
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

1048
01:32:07,813 --> 01:32:09,398
I shall pretend you didn't say that.

1049
01:32:09,606 --> 01:32:10,774
But I did.

1050
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:12,526
All I'm thinking and forgive me

1051
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:14,695
for thinking out of turn here...

1052
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:17,114
is that he's been around.

1053
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,742
He knows things we don't.

1054
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,411
Plus, the way you wrap
him around your little finger

1055
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:24,413
I'm always amazed.

1056
01:33:03,952 --> 01:33:07,955
- You must think me a babe in the woods.
- Not at all.

1057
01:33:07,956 --> 01:33:10,459
Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours.

1058
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:12,294
What's in it for me?

1059
01:33:13,378 --> 01:33:14,421
Me.

1060
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,881
Ah-ha.

1061
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:20,593
Think of the combination, Nigel.

1062
01:33:20,594 --> 01:33:24,098
- The two of us.
- One more time, please.

1063
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:27,308
My dear Nigel, the way to
a woman's heart is through

1064
01:33:27,309 --> 01:33:29,394
the elimination of her rivals.

1065
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,048
Murder? Are you proposing that...

1066
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:34,441
Oh, certainly not. Leave that to me.

1067
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:37,861
You deliver the goods. Her.

1068
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:39,613
Her? How?

1069
01:33:40,322 --> 01:33:41,740
By getting me...

1070
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,325
him.

1071
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:46,161
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

1072
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:49,164
- Follow any of this, I mean...
- Put that down.

1073
01:33:52,584 --> 01:33:54,545
Nigel, I want one thing.

1074
01:33:55,003 --> 01:33:57,464
Time to master my new toy.

1075
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:00,174
So, we can rule the world?

1076
01:34:00,175 --> 01:34:02,511
We...

1077
01:34:04,012 --> 01:34:06,515
and she, I have become convinced,

1078
01:34:07,015 --> 01:34:12,020
poses some vague yet
potent and undeniable threat.

1079
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:16,899
She's authentic, then?
The suit is not a joke. It's not rented.

1080
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:22,406
- The cape flaps for real.
- We have every reason to believe it's legitimate.

1081
01:34:22,614 --> 01:34:24,449
And you want him here?

1082
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:26,160
Johnny Appleseed in your living room?

1083
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:28,328
Yes. In the flesh.

1084
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:29,913
So, she'll follow?

1085
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:32,958
- No other reason?
- None.

1086
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:35,460
You're sure of that?

1087
01:34:36,753 --> 01:34:40,716
Whoops, I'm sorry.
The little spider got out.

1088
01:34:41,383 --> 01:34:42,593
What?

1089
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,096
Where am I?

1090
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,559
- Who are you?
- Kara.

1091
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:52,143
Kara?

1092
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:55,522
What happened?

1093
01:34:55,731 --> 01:34:57,900
You got hit on the head by a coconut.

1094
01:34:58,567 --> 01:35:00,152
Huh?

1095
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:02,321
What's with the Halloween costume?

1096
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,326
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1097
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:08,619
What do you mean?

1098
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:10,871
Look, I-I have to go now.

1099
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:13,332
I'll come back for you later.
I've just gotta get back to

1100
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:14,625
the amusement park.

1101
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,960
Amusement park? Linda!

1102
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:21,089
I gotta find Linda, she was in trouble.

1103
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:25,052
Well, Linda's alright.
She can take care of herself.

1104
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,613
No, no. She can't. Something's wrong.

1105
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:28,513
She's in big trouble and I love her.

1106
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:30,891
I love her.

1107
01:35:32,726 --> 01:35:34,353
Yeah, I do love her.

1108
01:35:37,522 --> 01:35:39,233
I have to go, Ethan. Goodbye.

1109
01:35:39,691 --> 01:35:41,026
Yes, so do.

1110
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:43,737
Hey!

1111
01:35:48,867 --> 01:35:51,036
I told you Linda can take care of herself.

1112
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:54,289
- You just flew over my head.
- I'll take care of everything.

1113
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:57,167
I said you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1114
01:35:58,335 --> 01:35:59,335
True.

1115
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:02,130
Like Superman.

1116
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:03,674
He's my cousin.

1117
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,760
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1118
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:08,679
I shouldn't be telling you this though...

1119
01:36:08,887 --> 01:36:11,157
Wait one minute. I mean you can
do the whole number, leap tall

1120
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:13,576
buildings with a single bound?
And look right through things?

1121
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,894
Yes - Bend steel bars?

1122
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:18,563
- Yes.
- Whoa!

1123
01:36:20,482 --> 01:36:22,693
- Oh, Selena. I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

1124
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:24,337
- Selena has the Omegahedron.
- Please take me with you.

1125
01:36:24,361 --> 01:36:25,862
I have to find Linda.

1126
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,990
Well, Nigel. Are we in business?

1127
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:31,993
- I'm thinking about it.
- He probably can't even do it.

1128
01:36:31,994 --> 01:36:35,496
Oh, indeed I can, but I need
the little mystery ball.

1129
01:36:35,497 --> 01:36:39,501
- No way.
- No ball, no trick.

1130
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:43,005
Okay. But I keep hold of it.

1131
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:53,056
What is it?

1132
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,725
The Burundi Wand.

1133
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,061
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1134
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:00,522
Ready?

1135
01:37:29,468 --> 01:37:30,927
But how can you love her?

1136
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,430
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1137
01:37:34,264 --> 01:37:35,908
And she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1138
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:37,809
standing here, talking with you.

1139
01:37:38,393 --> 01:37:40,062
Even if you are what you say you are.

1140
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,522
Linda is not in trouble.

1141
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:45,817
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1142
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,195
You wouldn't stand a chance.

1143
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:50,322
Please trust me.

1144
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:52,699
Linda is alright.

1145
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:55,327
How do you know?

1146
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:57,537
I just...

1147
01:37:58,997 --> 01:38:00,082
know.

1148
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,678
Linda.

1149
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,732
Oh, my God.

1150
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,692
How did you do that?

1151
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:34,241
Ethan.

1152
01:38:37,035 --> 01:38:38,078
Ethan!

1153
01:38:41,748 --> 01:38:45,293
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1154
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:48,380
Pure genius.

1155
01:38:49,756 --> 01:38:51,383
You deserve...

1156
01:38:52,008 --> 01:38:53,260
me.

1157
01:39:16,616 --> 01:39:18,493
And something else.

1158
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:28,420
Now, let's get out of this dump.

1159
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:31,965
Did you see this thing? Look at this!

1160
01:39:32,632 --> 01:39:34,426
Hey, what's the matter? Catchin' flies?

1161
01:39:34,634 --> 01:39:36,344
Lucy, look.

1162
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:40,807
One minute nothing.
The next minute this.

1163
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:42,476
What is it?

1164
01:39:44,352 --> 01:39:46,480
It's a mountain, Lucy. Isn't it?

1165
01:39:46,688 --> 01:39:48,315
Tell me I'm not seeing things.

1166
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:49,643
How did it get there, Jimmy?

1167
01:39:49,816 --> 01:39:51,485
I don't know. It just appeared.

1168
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:53,653
How can a mountain just appear?

1169
01:39:54,237 --> 01:39:56,198
Hey, there's something on the top.

1170
01:39:56,948 --> 01:39:58,658
Looks like a castle.

1171
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:00,535
Looks more like a fortress.

1172
01:40:49,668 --> 01:40:50,668
Ethan?

1173
01:40:58,009 --> 01:40:59,010
Ethan.

1174
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,460
Ethan!

1175
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:34,421
Ah.

1176
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,824
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl...

1177
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:07,537
forever and ever.

1178
01:42:11,124 --> 01:42:13,043
No, Ethan!

1179
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,003
Don't do it!

1180
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:16,838
Ethan!

1181
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,264
Where am I?

1182
01:45:10,303 --> 01:45:12,305
You can't arrest me without a warrant.

1183
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,058
I'm calling my lawyer.

1184
01:45:23,775 --> 01:45:24,775
Slow down.

1185
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,361
We want Selena out.

1186
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:30,031
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1187
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,950
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1188
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,701
How much longer are the telephone lines
going to be closed?

1189
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:37,662
My wife's very sick in the hospital in Metropolis.
I've got to get through!

1190
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:39,706
When are you going to reopen the airport?

1191
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:41,292
Are we gonna stand up to her or not?

1192
01:45:41,501 --> 01:45:42,501
Yes.

1193
01:45:42,627 --> 01:45:43,753
Selena must go!

1194
01:45:43,962 --> 01:45:45,588
Who's this little twerpette?

1195
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:47,465
She's someone who believes in freedom.

1196
01:45:47,715 --> 01:45:49,555
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1197
01:45:49,717 --> 01:45:51,511
I don't know, who you are.

1198
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:53,304
Or what evil force you represent.

1199
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:56,641
But if you think you can get rid
of anybody who stands up to you.

1200
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,686
Just make them disappear.
Like my friend Linda.

1201
01:46:00,353 --> 01:46:01,353
Who?

1202
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:02,522
Linda, my roommate.

1203
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:04,774
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1204
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:08,987
The wimp.

1205
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,282
Seize them!

1206
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:16,160
Leave her alone!

1207
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:17,537
Drive off.

1208
01:46:17,787 --> 01:46:19,289
Leave her alone.

1209
01:46:19,622 --> 01:46:21,457
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1210
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:24,294
Now, let go of me. I'm with the press!

1211
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,151
Zaltar.

1212
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,361
Squirt.

1213
01:48:16,197 --> 01:48:18,992
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1214
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:24,038
Zaltar, it's me. It's-it's Kara.

1215
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:25,456
I know.

1216
01:48:27,709 --> 01:48:29,127
Squirt.

1217
01:48:34,298 --> 01:48:35,842
What is that?

1218
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:40,555
- Where are we?
- Where are we?

1219
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:47,270
- Here.
- But where?

1220
01:48:47,937 --> 01:48:49,480
Nowhere.

1221
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:53,901
The Phantom Zone?

1222
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:56,487
It's lonely here, my Kara.

1223
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,073
So sad.

1224
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,786
So long ago.

1225
01:49:04,787 --> 01:49:07,789
No, Zaltar, only days.

1226
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:10,792
And only days left.

1227
01:49:10,793 --> 01:49:12,794
Zaltar, we have to get back to earth.

1228
01:49:12,795 --> 01:49:15,298
We have to get the omegahedron
and get it back to Argo City.

1229
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:20,595
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

1230
01:49:23,806 --> 01:49:28,310
Zaltar, the person who has the
power source, she tricked me.

1231
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:32,814
- She sent me here and I have to...
- Stay here forever, too.

1232
01:49:32,815 --> 01:49:37,320
She sounds formidable,
someone to be reckoned with.

1233
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,821
She's a sorceress, a wicked and desp...

1234
01:49:39,822 --> 01:49:43,451
More powerful than the guardians, is she?

1235
01:49:44,952 --> 01:49:49,957
- But the guardians are good.
- Zaltar is bad.

1236
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:54,462
Worse than this wicked sorceress.

1237
01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:01,468
Self-pity.

1238
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:04,972
You always taught me
to have pride, Zaltar.

1239
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:07,099
Pride...

1240
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,101
Should a man whose foolish ambitions

1241
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:14,106
destroy all that he loves have pride?

1242
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:17,610
If you think that, then I am a fool
who has taught you nothing.

1243
01:50:23,616 --> 01:50:26,118
I guess our next move is
to take over the world, huh?

1244
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:29,622
- I'm ready when you are, honey.
- First things first.

1245
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:31,624
- Ethan.
- Yes, my darling?

1246
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,627
Don't call me your "darling",
you despise me.

1247
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:38,131
- Bring me the coffer of shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1248
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:44,637
I think we need something...

1249
01:50:46,681 --> 01:50:47,681
There.

1250
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:53,770
Oh, Jimmy.

1251
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:56,691
Oh, terrific.

1252
01:50:56,899 --> 01:51:00,236
The old dangling-in-a-cage routine.

1253
01:51:00,444 --> 01:51:02,530
Pathetic, Selena.

1254
01:51:04,323 --> 01:51:07,034
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1255
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:11,037
I would have thought a ceiling fan, myself.

1256
01:51:11,038 --> 01:51:13,040
But it's your house.

1257
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,543
What are they for?

1258
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,547
Insurance.

1259
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:24,594
But you can't just give up.

1260
01:51:24,802 --> 01:51:26,846
You founded a whole city.

1261
01:51:27,054 --> 01:51:29,765
I did, and then I doomed it to destruction.

1262
01:51:29,974 --> 01:51:32,226
That was an error. A tragic one.

1263
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:34,562
When you're my age
and you make as many

1264
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:37,565
tragic errors as I do, it is a different tune

1265
01:51:37,773 --> 01:51:38,773
that you will sing.

1266
01:51:38,941 --> 01:51:40,818
I will not. I'll never give up.

1267
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:43,571
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1268
01:51:43,821 --> 01:51:46,199
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1269
01:51:46,407 --> 01:51:50,119
There are worse things than
dying and I deserve every one.

1270
01:52:07,094 --> 01:52:10,765
- What is this?
- A horse... I think.

1271
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:15,853
On earth I think it's called a horse.

1272
01:52:16,562 --> 01:52:18,731
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1273
01:52:21,651 --> 01:52:24,111
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1274
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:26,614
Earth, Zaltar. Earth, a tree, a horse.

1275
01:52:26,822 --> 01:52:28,241
You keep making things from earth.

1276
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:30,660
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1277
01:52:30,868 --> 01:52:33,204
Certainly. When is the next train?

1278
01:52:34,705 --> 01:52:36,040
What is a train?

1279
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:42,505
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1280
01:52:43,798 --> 01:52:45,508
I'm only laughing at myself.

1281
01:52:45,716 --> 01:52:48,386
For you, I weep.

1282
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:51,430
Is this train a way out of here?

1283
01:52:51,639 --> 01:52:54,058
There is no way out of here.

1284
01:52:54,725 --> 01:52:57,228
That is the point of the Phantom Zone.

1285
01:52:57,645 --> 01:53:00,606
My neighbors now: the criminals,
the corrupt, the evil...

1286
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:01,857
they're here.

1287
01:53:02,066 --> 01:53:03,651
Over the hill there.

1288
01:53:03,859 --> 01:53:05,528
With no way out.

1289
01:53:06,404 --> 01:53:09,907
But, there's always a way out.

1290
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:12,785
If there's a way in, there's a way out.

1291
01:53:15,871 --> 01:53:17,540
There is a way.

1292
01:53:18,874 --> 01:53:21,294
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1293
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:23,504
No, it wouldn't work.

1294
01:53:23,713 --> 01:53:25,089
You'd be swept into a singularity

1295
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:26,590
if it didn't work. No.

1296
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:29,969
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1297
01:53:35,182 --> 01:53:36,892
I could do it.

1298
01:53:40,021 --> 01:53:42,732
Then, please. At least teach me how.

1299
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,859
There's nothing to teach.
You can't, as they say

1300
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:49,655
practice at the rift.
You get one chance only.

1301
01:53:50,364 --> 01:53:53,034
- The rift?
- Sure? You won't have a squirt?

1302
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:56,412
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

1303
01:54:02,918 --> 01:54:04,128
You're right.

1304
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:07,798
You are absolutely right.

1305
01:54:10,801 --> 01:54:13,846
There is enough doom
and gloom in the air already.

1306
01:54:14,055 --> 01:54:16,265
And it is better to accept defeat

1307
01:54:16,474 --> 01:54:18,976
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1308
01:54:19,268 --> 01:54:21,729
and save our city and all those
who we love there.

1309
01:54:21,937 --> 01:54:24,148
Plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1310
01:54:24,398 --> 01:54:27,193
is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers!

1311
01:54:31,781 --> 01:54:33,449
We could die trying.

1312
01:54:34,867 --> 01:54:36,452
But we won't.

1313
01:54:36,994 --> 01:54:38,996
Come on.

1314
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:17,118
Tomorrow.

1315
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:20,413
Thursday. Friday.

1316
01:55:20,621 --> 01:55:22,998
Just like here, we go
for the cops first, right?

1317
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:24,875
And the army.

1318
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:28,045
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States,

1319
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,214
Mexico, Canada.

1320
01:55:32,049 --> 01:55:35,552
- Wish we'd kept our mouths shut.
- I'm not afraid to die.

1321
01:55:35,553 --> 01:55:38,305
I'm proud of us.

1322
01:55:40,808 --> 01:55:44,812
Lucy, there's something I've always
wanted to say to you.

1323
01:55:45,312 --> 01:55:48,440
Guess I'd better say it now.

1324
01:55:48,441 --> 01:55:53,946
Um, I've been in love with you f...
for many years.

1325
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:58,951
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

1326
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:03,955
Remember when you used to visit
your sister in the newsroom?

1327
01:56:03,956 --> 01:56:06,458
You used to put your fingerprints on my lens.

1328
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:09,961
Remember? I was trying desperately
to get you attention.

1329
01:56:09,962 --> 01:56:12,465
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1330
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:18,471
You mean, we could have...
we could have been...

1331
01:56:18,971 --> 01:56:21,473
You know what... all this time?

1332
01:56:21,474 --> 01:56:23,976
You betcha.

1333
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:30,483
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You were supposed to guess.

1334
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,491
- Aah!
- Careful!

1335
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:42,494
Kara! Kara! My child!

1336
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:45,997
Where is it, Zaltar? Where's the rift?

1337
01:56:45,998 --> 01:56:49,001
- Where is it?
- Everywhere. And nowhere.

1338
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:54,005
We don't find the rift, we make it.

1339
01:56:54,006 --> 01:56:58,009
Zaltar, now of all times,
no double-talk, I beg you.

1340
01:56:58,010 --> 01:57:00,011
Double-talk?

1341
01:57:00,012 --> 01:57:04,015
Our life is too short to squander it
on double-talk.

1342
01:57:04,016 --> 01:57:07,520
Look. The Phantom Zone.

1343
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:12,024
Get up.

1344
01:57:24,828 --> 01:57:27,248
Oh, my God, Selena. It's the box.

1345
01:57:27,456 --> 01:57:29,708
- Hush it up.
- No.

1346
01:57:30,292 --> 01:57:34,046
What the box wants, the box gets.

1347
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:51,647
What is it?

1348
01:57:51,855 --> 01:57:53,524
Fascinating.

1349
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,945
I don't know.

1350
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:01,073
Is this it?

1351
01:58:01,282 --> 01:58:02,449
Is this the way out?

1352
01:58:02,658 --> 01:58:06,412
Not yet! This is the Quantum Vortex!

1353
01:58:07,121 --> 01:58:10,040
We must risk our destruction in it.

1354
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:14,920
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

1355
01:58:15,129 --> 01:58:17,047
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1356
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,925
Accept your fears.

1357
01:58:20,217 --> 01:58:22,344
Confront your demons.

1358
01:58:22,636 --> 01:58:26,181
Find your destiny in the maelstrom!

1359
01:59:16,607 --> 01:59:18,817
Zaltar, I can't. I can't.

1360
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:22,071
You... can!

1361
01:59:46,887 --> 01:59:49,139
Two specks. Look!

1362
01:59:55,437 --> 01:59:56,980
What do I do?

1363
01:59:58,023 --> 02:00:01,360
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1364
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:08,325
She's with some old guy, it looks like.

1365
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:11,120
Move, huh. Come on!

1366
02:00:11,328 --> 02:00:12,913
Calm down, okay.

1367
02:00:13,455 --> 02:00:17,209
Ah. This is what I want.

1368
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:21,255
The Salian Fireballs.

1369
02:00:21,463 --> 02:00:25,426
Page 321. Chapter 6.

1370
02:00:40,441 --> 02:00:41,442
Whoa!

1371
02:00:42,651 --> 02:00:44,153
What is that?

1372
02:00:48,657 --> 02:00:49,950
Watch out!

1373
02:01:17,936 --> 02:01:19,563
"Power of Rainmaking". No!

1374
02:01:19,772 --> 02:01:21,172
"How to separate husband and wife."

1375
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:22,816
No, not now. Not now!

1376
02:01:23,025 --> 02:01:25,903
Well, you better find something
fast, like an atom bomb.

1377
02:01:37,956 --> 02:01:38,999
I found it.

1378
02:01:40,876 --> 02:01:45,506
"Summoning... the demon storm."

1379
02:01:45,714 --> 02:01:48,050
Hurry... go.

1380
02:01:48,258 --> 02:01:51,595
Higher girl, higher.

1381
02:01:51,804 --> 02:01:55,766
- Come with me!
- I am with you!

1382
02:01:55,974 --> 02:01:57,476
On, girl.

1383
02:02:10,322 --> 02:02:12,199
I am with you.

1384
02:02:16,119 --> 02:02:17,746
Zaltar!

1385
02:03:11,258 --> 02:03:12,634
Oh, thank God.

1386
02:03:16,263 --> 02:03:19,600
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1387
02:03:19,808 --> 02:03:21,101
Hardly.

1388
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:24,396
One false step, bluebird.

1389
02:03:24,605 --> 02:03:28,775
And even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1390
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:32,946
Hey, no!

1391
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,370
I don't like this.

1392
02:03:42,039 --> 02:03:44,249
Don't worry, Lucy. Don't worry.

1393
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:48,253
I wouldn't if I were you.

1394
02:03:48,462 --> 02:03:50,839
Well, you're not me.

1395
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,764
- Oh!
- Ah!

1396
02:03:59,389 --> 02:04:02,100
Quick, get out of the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1397
02:04:02,309 --> 02:04:04,686
- Come on, out.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1398
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:11,234
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1399
02:04:11,443 --> 02:04:12,861
I want it.

1400
02:04:13,153 --> 02:04:17,783
Well, then, Supergirl. You shall have it.

1401
02:04:42,891 --> 02:04:43,891
Ah!

1402
02:04:51,024 --> 02:04:52,024
Ah!

1403
02:05:03,745 --> 02:05:05,580
Supergirl, above you. Look out!

1404
02:05:10,085 --> 02:05:11,085
Ah!

1405
02:05:19,803 --> 02:05:23,223
I think I'll be going. If you'll excuse me.

1406
02:05:28,478 --> 02:05:31,064
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1407
02:05:45,078 --> 02:05:47,372
You have no friends, Selena.

1408
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:49,916
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth

1409
02:05:50,125 --> 02:05:51,585
to serve you.

1410
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:54,212
More or less, I think they were.

1411
02:05:55,297 --> 02:05:57,299
You included.

1412
02:06:00,677 --> 02:06:02,763
Power of shadow.

1413
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,098
Appear!

1414
02:06:26,328 --> 02:06:28,246
Power of shadow...

1415
02:06:30,707 --> 02:06:33,460
destroy her!

1416
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:14,668
Ah!

1417
02:07:14,876 --> 02:07:15,876
Oh!

1418
02:07:29,224 --> 02:07:31,601
I... can't.

1419
02:07:33,145 --> 02:07:35,147
I can't!

1420
02:07:35,355 --> 02:07:37,607
You can!

1421
02:07:39,442 --> 02:07:41,695
On, girl.

1422
02:07:50,787 --> 02:07:51,830
Yes!

1423
02:08:02,007 --> 02:08:04,593
Confront her with it! It's the only way!

1424
02:08:20,317 --> 02:08:21,568
O-oh!

1425
02:08:35,624 --> 02:08:37,250
No, no, no!

1426
02:08:47,886 --> 02:08:49,304
Argh!

1427
02:09:27,217 --> 02:09:28,217
Oh!

1428
02:09:28,843 --> 02:09:30,178
I have to go.

1429
02:09:30,387 --> 02:09:32,180
I have to return this to where it belongs.

1430
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:33,932
And I must ask you all something.

1431
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:37,102
It's alright, Supergirl. We never saw you.

1432
02:09:37,310 --> 02:09:38,812
We never even heard of you.

1433
02:09:39,187 --> 02:09:40,313
Thank you.

1434
02:09:40,855 --> 02:09:42,774
Ethan, Linda, she...

1435
02:09:42,983 --> 02:09:45,110
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1436
02:09:45,318 --> 02:09:46,987
You don't have to say a word.

1437
02:09:47,821 --> 02:09:49,072
I know.

1438
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,038
I'll explain about Linda.

1439
02:09:58,623 --> 02:10:00,000
Thank you, Ethan.

1440
02:10:01,418 --> 02:10:03,044
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1441
02:10:26,401 --> 02:10:29,362
Wow! That was some kiss.

1442
02:10:29,571 --> 02:10:30,571
Wow!

1443
02:10:36,286 --> 02:10:38,787
Better get a shot of where
that mountain used to be.

1444
02:10:38,788 --> 02:10:42,792
Oh, Jimmy. Can't you stop thinking
of your career for a second?

1445
02:10:43,293 --> 02:10:44,794
Haven't we wasted enough time?

1446
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:53,802
Nigel! I'm so glad to see you.

1447
02:10:53,803 --> 02:10:55,805
I've been trying to find you.

1448
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:59,975
I wanted to know more about the little bone
in the right side of a frog.

1449
02:10:59,976 --> 02:11:02,979
Uh, it's a toad, my dear. A red toad.

1450
02:11:03,063 --> 02:11:06,816
And that little bone is
in the left hand side.

1451
02:11:09,319 --> 02:11:10,945
Goodbye, Linda.

1452
02:11:42,936 --> 02:11:45,020
- You guys take it easy, okay?
- Take care.

1453
02:11:45,021 --> 02:11:47,023
- Good luck!
- Bye. See you soon.

1454
02:11:47,315 --> 02:11:49,025
Take it easy.
