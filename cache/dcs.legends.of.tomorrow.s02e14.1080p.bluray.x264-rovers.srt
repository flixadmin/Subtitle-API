1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,218
RORY: <i>Seriously, you idiots
haven't figured this out by now?</i>

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:09,260
<i>It all started when we blew up
the time pigs, the Time Masters.</i>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,137
<i>Now, history's all screwed up...</i>

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,146
<i>And it's up to us to unscrew it up.</i>

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,479
<i>But half the time
we screw things up even worse.</i>

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,277
<i>So don't call us heroes.
We're something else.</i>

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,900
<i>We're Legends.</i>

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,566
RAY:
<i>Previously, on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,492
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>You're my grandfather.
You're more than that.</i>

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,652
You're a hero to me.

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,819
My quarters. Tonight.

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,203
<i>I'll give you something else
to think about.</i>

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,615
RAY: <i>You can't date Amaya.</i>

14
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,075
She has a destiny.
And so do her descendants.

15
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,291
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

16
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,080
COURTNEY: <i>The Spear
could alter reality itself.</i>

17
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,339
Who's coming for you?

18
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,001
It's not a who. It's a what.
And it's trying to kill me.

19
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,461
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>He has to keep moving</i>

20
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,176
in order for his own nonexistence
not to catch up with him.

21
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,386
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Captain Hunter
is the only one who can tell us</i>

22
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,975
<i>where Commander Steel
and the final piece of the Spear is.</i>

23
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,937
- Where am I?
- PROFESSOR STEIN: You're home.

24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,817
So, I've been told you were bumped up
to the prime crew for <i>Apollo 13.</i>

25
00:00:58,976 --> 00:00:59,977
Yeah, man.

26
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,028
We'll see about that.

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,279
Welcome to Manhattan, 1965.

28
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:15,497
I have been dropped off behind enemy lines
in cities all over the world.

29
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,744
Never been dropped off in the future.

30
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,373
RIP: Now, you have to disappear,
start a whole new life.

31
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,959
The Spear of Destiny
must be protected at all costs.

32
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,172
Roger that, sir.

33
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,799
I know this mission won't be easy,
Commander Heywood.

34
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,881
For me, or for Bettie?

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,095
She'll think I died in Leipzig.

36
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,102
Little Hank is barely a month old.

37
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,187
Your family's sacrifice

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,602
might just save the world.

39
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,690
Give this to my wife and son.

40
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,366
Godspeed, Henry.

41
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,044
DR. HEYWOOD: I don't see him.

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,214
Yeah, that is odd.
I dropped him off right here a moment ago.

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,763
Where could he have gone? Henry.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,440
- Oh, I'm sorry, my mistake.
- Where is he?

45
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,564
AMAYA: <i>We used to call Henry
"the Chameleon."</i>

46
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,148
He speaks seven languages like a local

47
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,564
and is a master in the art of camouflage
and concealment.

48
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,366
If you told him to disappear,
that's exactly what he did.

49
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,574
Don't worry. If it's hard for us
to find your grandfather,

50
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,079
it's hard for the Legion.

51
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,660
1965 was a bust.

52
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,416
RAY: Ah, sorry, buddy.

53
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,128
That's all right. Rip said he dropped
my grandfather off in 1965 New York,

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,792
and told him to assume a new identity.

55
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,926
- Well, he'd need to find work.
- RORY: Why?

56
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,385
Henry was a military man.
He wouldn't have become an accountant.

57
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,804
He would have wanted a job
that still offered adventure,

58
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,434
and yet was still somehow patriotic.

59
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,186
FBI? CIA?

60
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,689
He was a fighter pilot before
he was recruited by the JSA.

61
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,775
In the '60s, the fledgling National
Aeronautics and Space Administration

62
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,608
used to call upon test pilots
to apply to be astronauts.

63
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,570
Exactly. What could be more patriotic,
more adventurous than exploring space?

64
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,620
Nice. Gideon, pull up anything you can,
press clippings, newspaper articles,

65
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,121
re: NASA circa 1965.

66
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,452
GIDEON: <i>Certainly, Captain.</i>

67
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,414
Okay, okay, okay. Come on, come on...

68
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,287
Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop. Right there.

69
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,332
I'd recognize
that Heywood jaw line anywhere.

70
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,628
"April 13th, 1970.
Mission Control works to save <i>Apollo 13."</i>

71
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,422
Come on, could your grandfather
get any cooler?

72
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,141
I think I may have found a way
to track Commander Heywood.

73
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,176
Don't worry, Mr. Hunter.
We've already found him.

74
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,479
- You did?
- We're heading to Houston, 1970.

75
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,936
Ah, all of us to the Astrodome.

76
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,351
And then we're gonna rescue
my grandfather.

77
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,518
Then all of us.

78
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,484
We still need to figure out a way
of contacting Commander Heywood

79
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,114
without arousing suspicion.

80
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,155
- To that end, I suggest that we...
- SARA: It's simple.

81
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,111
We infiltrate NASA.

82
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,003
Today, NASA flight controllers
are monitoring Apollo 13,

83
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,342
NASA's seventh manned mission to the Moon.

84
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,182
We need to figure out a way
to get into Mission Control.

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,967
I don't think that's included in the tour.

86
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,057
RIP: <i>Commander Heywood
is not at Mission Control.</i>

87
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,220
How do you know that?

88
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,355
Because I'm looking right at him.

89
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,727
That's the Flight Director of NASA.

90
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,695
They're probably debating on
how to talk to the press

91
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,357
about the oxygen tank explosion
on <i>Apollo 13.</i>

92
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,076
Henry.

93
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,157
Great to see you.

94
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,214
You son of a bitch.

95
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,885
Sorry, folks.
He doesn't have the right credentials.

96
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,425
We take press access
very seriously around here.

97
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,390
Surprise.

98
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,770
We're back.

99
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,237
RIP: <i>Why are you doing this, Henry?</i>

100
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,195
I was never supposed to see him again.

101
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,571
So you punched him?

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,737
That's between him and me.

103
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,868
Now, what brings you to 1970?

104
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,997
Er, well, I suppose Nate
should probably tell you.

105
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,169
- Nathaniel's here, too?
- MAN: <i>Sir,</i>

106
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,672
they say they know you.

107
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,583
You could say that.

108
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,377
- Henry.
- Amaya.

109
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,927
As I live and breathe.

110
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,597
It's good to see you again, son.

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,979
Come here, man.

112
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,145
I thought I'd never see you again.
Look at you. You still got it.

113
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,401
Is that Rip?

114
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,895
Get him out of there.

115
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,282
As soon as one of you explains
what in tarnation is going on.

116
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,277
Er, we're here for your fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

117
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,747
See, there's a Legion of villains who are
hunting anyone who's trying to protect it.

118
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,703
We have Stargirl's fragment,

119
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,327
but Mid-Nite died trying to protect his.

120
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,878
I appreciate your concern,

121
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,965
but I hid my piece of the Spear
somewhere safe.

122
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,972
Believe me, there's no place on Earth
safe from these guys.

123
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,970
Exactly.

124
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,475
You old fox, you.

125
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,930
You wanna clue us in?

126
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,982
He hid the Spear

127
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,936
in the flag Neil Armstrong
planted on the Moon.

128
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,987
Well, that is pretty ingenious.

129
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,819
The whole reason
I worked my way up through NASA

130
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,325
was to make sure that my piece
of the Spear remains safe.

131
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,620
Speaking of, I really should be
getting back to Mission Control.

132
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,373
Yeah, I guess you've gotta figure out
how to save the <i>Apollo 13</i> astronauts.

133
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,159
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,956
The mission is textbook.

135
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,833
Didn't an oxygen tank explode
and the Moon landing get aborted?

136
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,339
No. Everything is going great up there.

137
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,803
Unless...

138
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,718
Unless

139
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,474
history's changed.

140
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,106
Houston, we're about to enter
the dark side of the Moon.

141
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,195
Loss of signal in 30 seconds.

142
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,160
MAN: <i>Roger that,
Odyssey. See you in 28 minutes.</i>

143
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,158
<i>Happy sailing.</i>

144
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,865
Over and out.

145
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,659
Time to sit back
and enjoy the view, fellas.

146
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
Sorry, fellas.

147
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,373
Change of plans.

148
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,900
We have to intercept <i>Apollo 13</i>
before it lands on the Moon.

149
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,531
But where's Commander Heywood?
He and I need to have a little chat.

150
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,163
He's introducing the rest of the team
to the Flight Director.

151
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,743
Interesting, why?

152
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,034
Because we need somebody monitoring
on the ground.

153
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,748
- These are flight controllers?
- Yes.

154
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,633
They're with the British Space Program.

155
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,669
<i>They're here to study our procedures.</i>

156
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,800
What's your area of expertise?

157
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,307
I'm a Booster Systems Engineer.

158
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,009
They call me the Rocket Man.

159
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,390
MAN: <i>And him?</i>

160
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,440
Uh, he's a man of few words,
but makes up for it with personality.

161
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,934
All right, fine.

162
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,565
But if any of you Brits
get in the way of my controllers

163
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,153
or jeopardize the safe return
of our astronauts, you'll answer to me.

164
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,607
Of course.

165
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,122
- All right. Good luck, fellas.
- You're not sticking around?

166
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,370
We might need you to run
a little more interference for us.

167
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,750
No can do.

168
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,001
I gave up my life for that Spear,

169
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,664
and I'll be damned
if I let anyone steal it now.

170
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,795
I'm going with my grandson to space.

171
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,638
Would you look at that?

172
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,308
Outer space. Never gets old.

173
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,726
Martin, how much longer before <i>Apollo 13</i>
should reestablish radio contact?

174
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,984
Seventeen minutes.

175
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,029
All right. We've got 17 minutes
to figure out what's going on

176
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,314
before the whole world is watching.

177
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,698
Yeah, you're not wrong there.

178
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,485
Gideon, pull up <i>Apollo 13's</i>
original flight pattern.

179
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,487
We need to find her first.

180
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,991
Uh, Henry, perhaps now
would be a good time to have a chat?

181
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,335
Actually, Captain Hunter,
I don't feel much like talking.

182
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,847
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

183
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,189
You know, in 2017,
men share their feelings.

184
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,358
I'm just saying.

185
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:10,444
My wife has spent the past 14 years
raising our son by herself.

186
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,872
And it is Captain Hunter's fault.

187
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,544
The man has a wife and son
and still he asked me to abandon mine.

188
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,663
He doesn't have a family.

189
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,750
I mean, he did. It's just...

190
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,007
They were killed.

191
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,465
I... I didn't know.

192
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,557
You know, I often wonder what
Hank would be like if you hadn't left.

193
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,557
Yeah, I call my dad Hank.
We don't have the best relationship.

194
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,562
But I don't need to tell you all that.

195
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,060
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

196
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,821
This is all my fault.

197
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,864
But once this is over, I'm getting
Captain Hunter to take me back to 1956,

198
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,947
to the day I abandoned Bettie and Hank.

199
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,908
Wait, I was...
I was just talking hypothetically.

200
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,583
Why?

201
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,870
I mean, this is a time ship, isn't it?

202
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,256
It'll be like
I never left my wife and son.

203
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,716
<i>Think of all the heartbreak
I can save them.</i>

204
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,793
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Huh.
I never thought of it that way.</i>

205
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,590
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we found Apollo 13.

206
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,641
Well, this isn't right. The spacecraft
shouldn't be in this position.

207
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,682
- Can the astronauts see us?
- RIP: No, no, no, we're cloaked.

208
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,016
What's our plan?

209
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,277
- Well, I thought we'd...
- All right, I've got Ray suiting up.

210
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,444
<i>He's gonna fly over there, shrink down,</i>

211
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,481
and let us know what's going on inside.

212
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,082
ATOM:
<i>I'm entering the Command Module.</i>

213
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,707
<i>I see Lovell and Haise,
but they're unconscious.</i>

214
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,921
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>What about Jack?</i>

215
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,293
<i>Dr. Palmer?</i>

216
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,128
ATOM: <i>Thawne's here.</i>

217
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,632
<i>I'm gonna follow him
into the Lunar Module.</i>

218
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,642
He's going to land on the Moon.

219
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,059
ATOM: <i>Well, I'll stop him.</i>

220
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,988
Who's Thawne? Where's Swigert?

221
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,323
Ray, whatever you do,
just don't let Thawne see you.

222
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,537
Yeah, about that.

223
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,332
Well, what do we have here?

224
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,035
Looks like a stowaway.

225
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,764
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>What's happening?</i>

226
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,601
NASA expects radio contact
in three minutes.

227
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,019
We ran into a problem.

228
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,183
If we come back online,
you're gonna have to cut the feed.

229
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,351
Yeah, I'm on it.

230
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,528
He doesn't have superspeed
without gravity.

231
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,064
Newsflash, Raymond,

232
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,908
I don't need superspeed to kick your ass.

233
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,142
What's the red button?

234
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,444
It separates the LEM
from the Command Module.

235
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,812
That's no good.

236
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,357
Dr. Palmer, you're gonna
have to fly the LEM.

237
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,746
Houston, we have a problem.

238
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,382
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

239
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,679
Jefferson, the entire world is about
to listen to Raymond crash on the Moon.

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,264
Wait, Haircut's on the Moon?

241
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,888
Guys, I'm gonna need more time.

242
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,266

What the hell are you two playing at?

257
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,916
Okay. I got it. I cut the feed.

258
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,461
Oh, it's, uh...
It's a British tradition, sir.

259
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,502
Flight, I had radio contact for a second
then I lost it again.

260
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,793
- Nice voice, Professor.
- Thank you very much.

261
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,086
- Guidance?
- It was the darndest thing.

262
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,504
The LEM appeared for a second,

263
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,049
but it looked like it was about to crash
on the lunar surface.

264
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,009
Where the hell is the Command Module?

265
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,596
It's spinning off course.

266
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,895
Ray, are you all right?

267
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,566
I'm alive at least.

268
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,772
I was able to salvage the descent,

269
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,775
<i>but it burned up too much fuel.</i>

270
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,281
There's no way the LEM
will launch into space.

271
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,574
What about your suit?

272
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,496
RAY: <i>My thrusters were damaged
in the fight.</i>

273
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,915
You guys are gonna have to pick me up.

274
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,703
NASA must be going berserk right now.
Fred and Jim.

275
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,456
Don't worry. We're gonna get <i>Apollo 13</i>
home in one piece.

276
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,549
Gideon, plot a course
for the Command Module.

277
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,967
GIDEON: <i>Right away, Captain.</i>

278
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,003
- Ray, we'll pick you up later.
- RAY: <i>Roger that.</i>

279
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,888
We landed near the Sea of Tranquility.

280
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,550
So I'm going to head out and retrieve
Commander Heywood's piece of the Spear.

281
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,183
Which is, needless to say, very exciting.

282
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,640
- Good luck, big guy.
- What about Mr. Thawne?

283
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,734
He's a little tied up at the moment.

284
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,147
Puns. The lowest form of humor.

285
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,566
- Can I talk to you?
- About what?

286
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,248
I overheard you and Henry talking about
returning him to 1956.

287
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,749
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say.

288
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,256
That you're a historian
as well as a Legend.

289
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,338
You know the consequences
of returning Henry to the timeline.

290
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,845
Yeah. My dad grows up with a father.

291
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,089
Look, my childhood was miserable.

292
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,224
My dad was a cold, disconnected jackass.

293
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,017
But maybe, just maybe,

294
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,352
returning Henry to that time
can change everything.

295
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,690
This is my chance to fix
three generations of Heywood men.

296
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,522
But you don't need fixing.

297
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,525
Your childhood made you
into the man that you are,

298
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,160
the person that you are today.

299
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,739
And without that man, then,

300
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,289
well, this ship would probably still be
stuck on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

301
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,710
That's conjecture.

302
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,964
My grandfather's happiness,
my father's happiness. That's real.

303
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,004
GIDEON: <i>Excuse the interruption.
But you might want to brace for impact.</i>

304
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,632
Good news, we found the Command Module.

305
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,305
Bad news, it's headed straight
for a bunch of space rocks.

306
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,644
Meteoroid belt.

307
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,804
Don't we have a tractor beam?

308
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,310
Can't we pull the Command Module
away from the meteorites?

309
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,316
No, the velocity of the Command Module

310
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,569
would merely bring us
closer to the meteoroids.

311
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,650
Which is why I'm swinging the ship around.

312
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,323
I'm gonna try and stop the trajectory
of the Command Module.

313
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,542
Sara, you need to abort.
We're going to hit the meteoroids.

314
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,921
Better us than the Command Module.

315
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,674
Could you at least
try to destroy the meteoroids,

316
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,010
rather than using my ship
as a human shield.

317
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,016
Worked before.
Back in 1942, you put the Waverider

318
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,177
in front of a nuke
and it absorbed the blast.

319
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,517
Well, at least I had the decency
to time-scatter you all first.

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,775
Decency? Did you ask any of us
if we wanted to be time-scattered?

321
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,436
- Sara.
- I was trying to save your lives.

322
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,363
You put me in a time period where
they wanted to hang me for being a witch.

323
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,523
Sara.

324
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,195
GIDEON: <i>Shield integrity at 63%.</i>

325
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,826
<i>34%.</i>

326
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,201
<i>Rerouting the reserve power
to the shields.</i>

327
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,922
<i>I'm afraid the Jumpship
has been critically impaired.</i>

328
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,290
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

329
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,004
<i>Our landing gear has...</i>

330
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,051
We're clear.

331
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,232
<i>Waverider</i> crew, we are now
the proud owners

332
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,814
of the last fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

333
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,273
SARA: <i>Copy.</i>

334
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,112
"Copy"? That's all I get is a "Copy"?

335
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,113
Guys, I'm standing on the freaking Moon.

336
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,123
Yeah, about that...

337
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,960
The, uh, the <i>Waverider</i> has sustained
major damage, Dr. Palmer.

338
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,255
<i>Same for the Jumpship.</i>

339
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,091
Wait, the Jumpship? But that means...

340
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,928
Unless you can figure out a way
to launch the LEM,

341
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,298
you're stranded on the Moon.

342
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,801
RAY: <i>And now I know
how Matt Damon felt.</i>

343
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,987
<i>I'm Dr. Raymond Palmer.</i>

344
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:34,367
<i>Time traveler, superhero,
and most recently, astronaut.</i>

345
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,945
<i>It's April 13th, 1970, at 2200 hours,</i>

346
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,490
<i>and I am stranded on the Moon.</i>

347
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,493
<i>Fuel on the LEM is close to zero,</i>

348
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,126
<i>the food and water provisions
were designed to last days, not months.</i>

349
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,750
So, yeah.

350
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,423
<i>I'm gonna have to science
the... out of this.</i>

351
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,841
EOBARD: <i>What are you doing?</i>

352
00:20:56,005 --> 00:21:00,260
<i>I'm, uh, filming us for posterity,
in case we don't make it back.</i>

353
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,936
<i>I'm not dying on the Moon. All right?</i>

354
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,267
<i>Signing off.</i>

355
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,979
Certainly not doing it in a tin can
with the likes of you.

356
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,025
And to that end, I propose an alliance.

357
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,488
You untie me and we'll figure out a way
to get ourselves off this rock.

358
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,987
And I'll play nice
until we get back to Earth,

359
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,532
- I promise.
- Yeah.

360
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,000
Not a chance.

361
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,545
And for your information,
I already have a plan.

362
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,547
All I've to do is transfer the fuel source
from my exo-suit to power the fuel cells.

363
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,672
Use the dwarf star to power the LEM.
Yeah, that should work.

364
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,013
Of course you've taken the gas
spectrometer into account.

365
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:48,228
Well, unless you adjust for
the relative volatility of the dwarf star,

366
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,851
then the LEM could explode mid-launch.

367
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,854
I'm a scientist from the future,

368
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,444
and I'm here to tell you
this is a two-person patch job.

369
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,071
Look at it this way.
If I'm lying, we're both dead.

370
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,958
We'll be over Ray's launch position
in 18 minutes.

371
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,747
We only get one chance at this intercept

372
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,417
before the Moon's gravity
slingshots us back to Earth.

373
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,584
Henry?

374
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,296
You need to understand
how time travel works.

375
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,344
My grandfather understands it just fine.

376
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,929
- You can't return to 1956.
- Amaya...

377
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,514
Why?

378
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,982
Every time we change history,
we create what we call an aberration.

379
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,439
Now, if your son grows up with you around,

380
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,774
he could become
an entirely different person.

381
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,572
Choose a different life.

382
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,408
That in turn, could change Nathaniel,

383
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,069
and the person he becomes,

384
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,737
<i>if he's even born at all.</i>

385
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,029
She doesn't know that.

386
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,208
But it's a possibility.

387
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:49,952
Yes.

388
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,093
Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,005
Because my dad needs you.

390
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,762
And as much as I want to protect history,
I want to protect our family more.

391
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,389
We both should have learned by now
the mission comes first.

392
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,728
Thank you for telling me.

393
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,080
I was just trying to protect you.

394
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,252
Nathaniel, changing your family's history
would have changed you.

395
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,673
In case I haven't made it clear,
I like who you are.

396
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,383
You and I don't have a future together.

397
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,169
What do you mean?

398
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,385
When you stowed aboard the <i>Waverider,</i>
we pulled you from the timeline.

399
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,097
Back in 1942,
you have a destiny waiting for you.

400
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,930
- How do you know all this?
- Ray told me.

401
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,814
He knows your granddaughter.

402
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,395
I don't think I should be hearing this.

403
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,356
Ask Ray what happens to your village.

404
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,947
Ask him what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter.

405
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,944
Then tell me...

406
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,366
Tell me you'll choose history
over your own family.

407
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,253
That offer to clear the air still good?

408
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,881
So long as it doesn't involve
punching me in the jaw again.

409
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,384
I'm sorry about that.

410
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,564
After five years, I found myself
blaming you for the choice I made.

411
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,480
Turns out that abandoning my wife and son,

412
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,353
even to save the world,

413
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,355
was a mistake.

414
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,070
Ah, it's the great irony of time travel.

415
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,328
But despite it, we still find ourselves
living with regret.

416
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,787
One of mine was that I couldn't find
a better way to protect the Spear.

417
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,995
One that would have
spared you such a personal sacrifice.

418
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,127
When you showed up,
I thought maybe I could go back...

419
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,590
Change history.

420
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,378
But what's done is done.

421
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,426
All we can do now is look forward.

422
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,604
Oh, I got to say,
you really turned this team around.

423
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,608
When I met the Legends in 1942,
they were constantly bickering,

424
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,948
unable to work together
in any cohesive way.

425
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,908
Actually, I'm not the one
who deserves your praise.

426
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,216
Menial labor without superspeed
is really quite tedious.

427
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,843
Then again, I've missed
working with a fellow scientist.

428
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:57,315
Cisco and Caitlin and I, as you know,
worked together for some time, and...

429
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,146
I miss the camaraderie.

430
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,690
Legion of Doom
doesn't have "Karaoke Fridays"?

431
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,032
I know it's easier for you
to think of me as a monster, but, um...

432
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,527
I've met some of
history's monsters, Raymond.

433
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,987
<i>And believe me,</i>

434
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,367
I'm not one of them.

435
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,499
You killed Barry's mother. Twice.

436
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,664
Rex Tyler?

437
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,495
Brainwashed Rip
into killing Dr. Mid-Nite...

438
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,084
Time travel has a way
of revealing the truth to you.

439
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,716
And you and I
have more in common than you think.

440
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,835
Pass me the pliers.

441
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,680
We're both scientists.

442
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,136
We're both obsessed
with achieving the impossible.

443
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,096
You've dedicated your life to learning

444
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,261
how to shrink yourself
down to the size of an atom,

445
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,022
and I spent mine learning
the secrets of the Speed Force.

446
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,683
I became the Atom to help people.

447
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:48,449
You could use the dwarf star
in your exo-suit to power an entire city,

448
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,951
but instead, you chose to become the Atom

449
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,536
because you weren't satisfied
with your small, pathetic life.

450
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:02,042
There is no shame in wanting
to be greater, to reach higher,

451
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,919
to walk on the Moon.

452
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,296
Is that why you want the Spear?

453
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,087
Reach higher? Become greater?

454
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,713
Run faster?

455
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,383
No.

456
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,643
I'm after something much more

457
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,638
elemental.

458
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,898
I want to live.

459
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,938
Surely you can sympathize.

460
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,570
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>One minute to the intercept, Raymond.</i>

461
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,858
Are you ready up there?

462
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,161
Yeah, we're ready.

463
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,411
- "We?"
- Long story. Let's do this.

464
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,335
Rip, how's our trajectory looking?

465
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,536
Keep her steady.

466
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,498
Martin, you sure about these calculations?

467
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,215
<i>I'm piloting manually, here.</i>

468
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,627
Did I, or did I not win six Carlins?

469
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,137
- No.
- Yes, I did.

470
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:53,965
<i>Twenty seconds to intercept.</i>

471
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,888
Jax, be prepared to restore the feed
on my signal.

472
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,139
Ten seconds.

473
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,560
You're just gonna have to trust me.

474
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,442
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>In three, two, one...</i>

475
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,173
Distance to target, 100 meters.

476
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,464
And closing fast.

477
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,400
Intercept successful.

478
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,069
Mmm! You, ma'am,
are a steely-eyed missile man.

479
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,696
I'll take that as a compliment.

480
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,573
Ray, I'm gonna dock with the LEM.

481
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,412
Be prepared
to get your ass back on the ship.

482
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,575
RAY: <i>Copy.</i>

483
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,875
Head up, son. We've got work to do.

484
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,419
I'm sorry, sir, but they're just

485
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,582
gone.

486
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,335
SARA: <i>Tractor beam disengaged.</i>

487
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,967
<i>Apollo 13</i> is headed home.

488
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,177
<i>Jax, restore the feed.</i>

489
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,430
Let's get history back on track.

490
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,146
MAN: <i>Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read us?</i>

491
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,394
<i>Come in, Odyssey.
Odyssey, this is Houston.</i>

492
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,437
<i>Houston, this is Odyssey. Do you read me?</i>

493
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,231
<i>I repeat, do you read me?</i>

494
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,028
<i>We read you, Odyssey.</i>

495
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,192
Loud and clear.

496
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,881
You don't seem happy, Professor.

497
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,132
The intercept might have been a success,

498
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,718
but the <i>Waverider</i> is on reserve power.

499
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,180
Not to mention the difficulty
of reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

500
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,056
What are you saying?

501
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,096
I'm saying that our crew

502
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,601
has an infinitesimal chance
of ever returning home.

503
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,729
By infinitesimal, I mean...

504
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,232
A snowball's chance in hell.

505
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,694
That would look rosy in comparison.

506
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,625
Welcome aboard.

507
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,885
Relax. I'm not gonna kill my ride home.

508
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,721
Yeah, we still don't trust you.

509
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,845
Rip Hunter. Good to see you.

510
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,598
I guess these morons figured out a way
to restore your original personality.

511
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,893
Enjoy the brig, Eobard.

512
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,441
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

513
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,655
Sara,

514
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,542
you have to power down every non-essential
piece of hardware on the ship.

515
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,128
Gideon's already shut down.

516
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,171
The <i>Waverider's</i> using
gravitational inertia

517
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,331
to float back to Earth.

518
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,549
What? I know science.

519
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,635
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>It isn't enough.</i>

520
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,637
If you want to activate the heat-shields,

521
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,800
and survive reentry,
you have to conserve more power.

522
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,057
- Now.
- RIP: <i>Stein's right.</i>

523
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,561
We need to shut down the water-filtration,
and the heating systems.

524
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,727
Right, 'cause clean water and heat,
we don't need those to survive.

525
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,981
You got a better idea?

526
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,559
At the moment, no.

527
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,280
Well, bundle up.
'Cause it's about to get chilly.

528
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,024
HENRY: <i>Actually,
if the shields don't work,</i>

529
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,613
atmospheric reentry
will burn us all to a crisp.

530
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,870
Science.

531
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,871
You lost, son?

532
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,379
No, sir. I won a contest
to see <i>Apollo 13</i> land.

533
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,498
I'm Hank. Hank Heywood.

534
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,213
MAN: <i>This place has turned
into a damn circus.</i>

535
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,095
SARA:
<i>Stein, we're ready for reentry.</i>

536
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,431
What's the status
of your secondary thrusters?

537
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,681
It's sporadic.

538
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,934
She's still got a couple of pushes
left in her.

539
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,637
We just need to point her
in the right direction.

540
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,306
There's been a rather interesting
development down here on the ground.

541
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,065
RORY: <i>Nate, you there?</i>

542
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,475
Yeah, Mick. What's up?

543
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,317
There's some kid in Mission Control
calling himself Hank Heywood.

544
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,356
That's your son.

545
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,197
I fixed an essay writing contest
so Hank would win.

546
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,036
I should've told you earlier.

547
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,366
I had to meet him.

548
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,413
Well, our guidance system failed
to power back up.

549
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,993
Can we enter the atmosphere without it?

550
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,003
We'd need to figure out a reentry angle.

551
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,789
If it's too steep, the ship will burn up.

552
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,749
If it's too shallow,
we'll bounce off the atmosphere

553
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,258
and go into orbit around the sun.

554
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,089
SARA: <i>Stein, little help here.</i>

555
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,424
I'm working as fast as I can.

556
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:47,262
But I need a supercomputer,
which is not readily available in 1970.

557
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,641
We have a supercomputer.

558
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,847
Gideon's offline.

559
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,387
I'm not talking about Gideon.

560
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,102
Thirty-eight degrees.

561
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,984
You don't even know my question.

562
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,188
At what angle do we need
to reenter the Earth's atmosphere?

563
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,027
Thirty-eight degrees.

564
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,116
I'm from the 22nd century.

565
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,740
I learned astro-navigation
in grade school.

566
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,621
Thirty-eight degrees.

567
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,622
Or don't you trust me?

568
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:22,005
The reentry angle
needs to be 38 degrees.

569
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,259
How do you know?

570
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,794
Thawne.

571
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,717
He wants to get back to Earth,

572
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,423
same as the rest of us.

573
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,095
So that he can kill us when we land.

574
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,973
I'm with Amaya, grudgingly.

575
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,100
- I don't trust him.
- Agreed.

576
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,108
Professor Stein,
does 38 degrees sound right to you?

577
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,270
It could be, but without more time,
I can't be certain.

578
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,900
We haven't got any time.

579
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,651
Someone needs to make a decision.

580
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,615
Ms. Lance,

581
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,291
<i>you're the captain.</i>

582
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,422
Do you trust Thawne about this?

583
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,457
After everything that he's done?

584
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,126
I do.

585
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,216
And I trust Ray.

586
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,465
Let's go.

587
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,892
<i>Stein, we're a go for reentry.</i>

588
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,651
If we don't adjust the angle,
we'll burn up.

589
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,482
The thrusters, they're toast.

590
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,617
In a few seconds,
we're all gonna be toast.

591
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,613
We need to blow the cargo-bay door.

592
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:33,989
- What?
- He's right.

593
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,662
The depressurization
will correct your angle of descent.

594
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,247
RAY: <i>The air pressure's too great.</i>

595
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,336
If anyone opens up the door mid-descent,

596
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,830
they'll die.

597
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,632
- I'll go.
- No.

598
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,676
I'm captain. I'll go.

599
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,007
Where's Henry?

600
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,428
I'm in the cargo bay.

601
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,184
<i>It's the only way to right this ship.</i>

602
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,095
Talk me through this.

603
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,231
You have to secure
the inner door first.

604
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,986
Check.

605
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:08,115
Right, there should be a lever
to your, uh, to your left.

606
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,862
I see it.

607
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,031
Hank! Hank! Hank! Don't... Don't do this.

608
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,827
- I am so sorry, Nathaniel.
- No.

609
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,207
No, you open that door,

610
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,243
the explosive decompression
will suck you out.

611
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,957
If I don't, you will all die.

612
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,673
I can do it. Let me do it.
I have powers now.

613
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,217
No. No, I won't let you risk your life.

614
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,546
I have fulfilled my duty
protecting my piece of the Spear.

615
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,051
But I'm just a grunt.

616
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,014
Now, it's your turn.

617
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,685
You can figure out a way
to destroy the Spear.

618
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,808
Don't let it ruin another person's life.

619
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,898
Your son is at Mission Control.
He's there. He's waiting for you.

620
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,266
Come on.

621
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,894
Don't.

622
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,281
Give him a message for me.

623
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,614
Tell him,

624
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,195
"I'm sorry for leaving."

625
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,155
Don't. Please don't. Please don't.

626
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,082
It's working.

627
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,587
<i>Thirty degrees.</i>

628
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,798
<i>Thirty-six.</i>

629
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,504
Thirty-eight.

630
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,561
Commander Heywood's done it.

631
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,352
We're gonna make it.

632
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,688
Yes, we are.

633
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,785
Nathaniel...

634
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,694
It's a funny thing about Rip Hunter's
anti-speedster weapons.

635
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,067
I invented them.

636
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,365
I knew you'd escape.

637
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:15,984
You're on the run.

638
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,362
Because you're a time remnant.

639
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,831
You should have died
when Eddie Thawne killed himself.

640
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,409
And now something's chasing you.

641
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,786
Trying to correct the aberration.

642
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,748
One of history's worst monsters.

643
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,668
Speak of the devil.

644
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,556
Well, guess you won't have time to search
the ship for the Spear now, will you?

645
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,593
Till we meet again, Raymond.

646
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,642
MAN: <i>Reentry successful.</i>

647
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,371
It's pretty cool, huh?

648
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,369
You got to witness history.

649
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,534
You an astronaut?

650
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,374
No. No, I'm...

651
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,705
I wish I was that brave.

652
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,923
They made it home.

653
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,043
Not all of them.

654
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,055
They're my dad's.

655
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,891
They... They were.

656
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,600
He was gone before I knew him.

657
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,393
I'm sure he was sorry he left.

658
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,358
My dad wasn't really there for me, either.

659
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,852
But I knew he loved me.

660
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,278
He just, um...

661
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,944
He just couldn't show me.

662
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,566
It's not fair.

663
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:39,943
No.

664
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,244
No, it's not.

665
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,489
But, if you can accept that,

666
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,417
you'll be a better man for it.

667
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,411
You and your son.

668
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,004
Drinking alone?

669
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,013
Only as a metaphor.

670
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,426
You in here feeling sorry for yourself?

671
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,930
Oh, no, I've got more than one way
of feeling sorry for myself, surely.

672
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,608
Thanks for backing my play earlier.

673
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,938
Uh, I wasn't

674
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,274
entirely supportive on this mission.

675
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,485
Indeed.

676
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:18,857
But still,

677
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,703
must be hard coming back to your ship
and finding someone else in charge.

678
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,288
No, that was the easy part.

679
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,624
The hard adjustment was seeing that

680
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:33,630
you are a much better captain
than I ever was.

681
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,796
So, that's why you're in here
feeling sorry for yourself.

682
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,718
I'm in here trying to figure out
what my place is

683
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,470
if I'm not this team's captain.

684
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,393
So, you're saying you don't fit in?

685
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,558
You're an outcast?

686
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,396
A misfit?

687
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,391
Let's assume.

688
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,478
Sounds to me like you're a Legend.

689
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,738
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

690
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,790
This was my fault.

691
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,827
If I hadn't have told Henry
that he shouldn't return home...

692
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,621
He still would've thrown himself
off the ship to save us.

693
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,382
It's just who he was.

694
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,591
Maybe destiny has plans
for all of us.

695
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,383
Not just me.

696
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,802
Yeah, um...

697
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,095
About that.

698
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,562
I am so sorry I said those things.

699
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,065
No one should know
too much about their future.

700
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,900
I'm not afraid of the future.

701
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,575
Whatever's supposed to happen
is bigger than just me.

702
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,535
I know this is cheesy,

703
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,453
but once you see Earth from outer space,
you realize how small we all are.

704
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,254
In a good way?

705
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,543
Yeah.

706
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,177
In a good way.

707
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,563
Gideon, I need you to
help me with something.

708
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,114
GIDEON: <i>Of course, Ms. Jiwe.</i>

709
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,203
I need you to show me
the historical record on Zambesi.

710
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,911
Starting with my return home.

711
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,451
GIDEON: <i>You're asking for me
to show you your future.</i>

712
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,878
<i>I must counsel you against doing this.</i>

713
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,964
Please, Gideon.

714
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,154
