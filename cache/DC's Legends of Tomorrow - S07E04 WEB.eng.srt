1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,911
All right. We gotta ditch Hoover's car.

2
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:18,179
APB's probably already out
on the Bullet Blondes.

3
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:19,184
It's fine.

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,353
From here, we'll just
hop a train to New York.

5
00:00:21,377 --> 00:00:23,618
Ugh. Another train, must we?

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,987
By my math, we should have
enough left for three tickets.

7
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,456
The other half can hang out in
John's portable phantom house.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,725
I mean, it's technically
my portable phantom house.

9
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:33,628
But, more importantly,
does your math account

10
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:35,830
for Gary's overly generous tipping?

11
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:38,032
He gave our last waitress 20 bucks.

12
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:41,102
$20... that's over a quarter
of our entire budget, Gary.

13
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:43,404
$20 for a six top seems fair to me.

14
00:00:43,428 --> 00:00:44,772
Okay, so what's the damage?

15
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,474
Do we have enough to get to New York?

16
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:49,243
$35, that's enough
for one ticket and a few meals,

17
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,246
tipping like a normal person in 1925.

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,149
All right, I call phantom
house 'cause I'm over trains.

19
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:57,318
We still have to get
across town and on that train,

20
00:00:57,342 --> 00:00:59,105
without anyone recognizing us.

21
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,910
Well, then we stopped
at the right place.

22
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:14,502
I think, yes.

23
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,802
Yes, it's very cute.

24
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,405
But we need to hide the blonde, babe.

25
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:20,007
- How about this?
- Yes.

26
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,375
Ah, yes, it worked.

27
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,378
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We're in the 1920s.

28
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,813
That is not the look. Okay.

29
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,803
Sir, can we see all your wigs
that are bobs?

30
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:35,623
Um, hello? Potential customer here.

31
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:36,724
I asked you a question,

32
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:38,760
which any good salesman
would take as an opportunity

33
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:42,664
to upsell your finest wigs?

34
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,566
Is he...

35
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,400
Um, hello?

36
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,470
Yeah, she asked you a question.

37
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:50,204
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

38
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:52,106
I didn't realize she was with you.

39
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,007
These are the only bobs on display

40
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,777
since most of you ladies
chop and style your own.

41
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,211
That's not happening.

42
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:01,181
Well, of course,
not with those gorgeous locks.

43
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,210
Let me see what I can find in the back.

44
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:09,089
Racist dick.

45
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:10,624
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,727
Let's just get these disguises
and get outta here, yeah?

47
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,481
Yeah, it's okay. Sorry.

48
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:22,134
Is it just me, or...

49
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,803
We probably should have
ditched Hoover's car

50
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:24,871
before entering the city.

51
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,939
Yeah, come on. Come on.

52
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,175
Hey, hey, hey.
The police found Hoover's car.

53
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,411
They are onto us.
We got to get out of here.

54
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:32,778
I've got bobs in the three
different shades,

55
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,780
a brunette, a redhead...

56
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:35,916
We'll take them both.

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,350
Oh, there's also a blonde.

58
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:38,651
No blondes.

59
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:42,054
Okay, how much for the two wigs?

60
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,557
Wait a minute.

61
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,159
- Are you two...
- No.

62
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:49,481
They are definitely not the...
whatever you were gonna say.

63
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,235
Guys, we gotta hustle.

64
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,170
Okay. Here's what's gonna happen.

65
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,172
You're gonna help us
sneak out of here unnoticed,

66
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:03,201
and we will buy these wigs
at double wholesale.

67
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,010
Triple.

68
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,445
That is robbery.

69
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,974
Look, who's talking, Bullet Blondes.

70
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,272
They're crossing the street.

71
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:20,724
- You gotta be kid...
- Aves.

72
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:21,961
- Are you serious?
- Give him the money.

73
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,681
Go, just go, come on.

74
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,606
- Wig, wig, wig, wig, wig.
- Yeah, here you go.

75
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,741
Here you go. Put it on.

76
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,709
- Thank you.
- Good, good, good, good.

77
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:40,212
He said they were the Bullet Blondes!

78
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,700
They couldn't have gotten very far!

79
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,254
This is literally our only option.

80
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:50,922
Great, then put the key in.

81
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,977
We can hide out here
until the coast is clear.

82
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:01,132
- Hey.
- Hey.

83
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:05,342
You looking for the Sapphire String?

84
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:08,345
- Maybe.
- You got the password?

85
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:11,748
- Wh...
- Uh...

86
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:14,742
Swordfish.

87
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,410
- So he meant salamander.
- Satellite.

88
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:17,415
Sword fighter.

89
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,783
Are we doing this?

90
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,518
Are we really fishing
for a stupid password

91
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,320
so we can get out of garbage alley?

92
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:26,323
Gang, we're screwed.
We have no money, no allies.

93
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:28,625
This time period sucks for anyone

94
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:30,427
who's not white, male, and rich.

95
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,329
And only one of us... it's you...

96
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,964
is at least two of those things.

97
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:37,134
You said the password. Come on in.

98
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:40,771
- Wait, what was it?
- Password.

99
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:44,408
Ah, I see what you did there.

100
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,930
- Password.
- The password is "password"?

101
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,315
Welcome to my club. Name's Eddie.

102
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,151
Sorry it's a little quiet right now.

103
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:57,187
Running a little low on the drinks.

104
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,156
We're at a speakeasy.

105
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,792
A very inclusive one, considering.

106
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,027
Considering what?

107
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,595
Well, the mob had a tight grip

108
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,663
on these establishments
and kept them segregated.

109
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,831
But it looks like we stumbled
into one that caters

110
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,767
to everyone, which is rare.

111
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:14,304
I guess that's why
the password is "password".

112
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:16,806
- You play brother?
- I noodle.

113
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,875
Come make us some pasta.

114
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,629
Well...

115
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,116
What have we got here? E flat?

116
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,417
- E flat, brother.
- Classic.

117
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,138
Yeah.

118
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:52,842
This is so degrading.

119
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,243
This is so exciting.

120
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,913
Okay, look, we got through
step one, sneak onto the train.

121
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,948
Step two is the ride to Chicago.

122
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,650
Steps? Who died and made you Ava?

123
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:04,053
We're going to New York
to prevent that from happening.

124
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,188
And that reminds me,

125
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:07,223
don't talk to anyone
any more than we have to.

126
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,658
We can't mess up the timeline.

127
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,760
Okay, Captain Sharpe.

128
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,294
That's Spooner Cruz.

129
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,230
The most important thing
is to avoid any suspicion

130
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,464
for sneaking onto the train.

131
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,199
- Tickets, please.
- Crap.

132
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,701
Let's go, let's go.

133
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,657
Tickets... hey, hey,
I need to see your tickets!

134
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:27,043
You trying to sneak on my train
without a ticket?

135
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:32,213
What... no, I just had it in my hands.

136
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:34,216
Yeah, maybe I dropped it
while we were moving.

137
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,884
You're off the next stop.

138
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:39,087
Stella, why are you
bothering this nice ticket man?

139
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,891
I apologize if these three
have given you any trouble.

140
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,693
These ladies are with you?

141
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:48,497
You're looking
at the best pianist, bassist,

142
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,899
and clarinetist you'll ever hear.

143
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:54,055
Just ask my boyfriend, Mr. Bottoni.

144
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,609
Of course, our train tickets are

145
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,313
all in our manager's pocket.

146
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,811
You're welcome to wake him
from his beauty rest.

147
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:06,915
But I have to warn you,
he has quite the temper.

148
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,603
You all enjoy your trip.

149
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:14,922
I'm Maude.

150
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,725
And we're The Masqueradies.

151
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,246
Welcome to the band.

152
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:33,964
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

153
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,784
Any mention of an exploded Hoover?

154
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,789
According to this,
he's still alive and well

155
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,149
and ready to take on the most
notorious criminals,

156
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,657
Capone and the Bullet Blondes.

157
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:52,593
It's only a matter of time, babe.

158
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:54,595
He's after us.

159
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,496
So there's a new
and improved Hoover-bot?

160
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,399
Great. What else does the paper say?

161
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:02,803
Oh, that we're bootleggers and robbers.

162
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,905
And, worst of all,

163
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:06,306
we're sisters.

164
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,476
Sisters?

165
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,045
We can't go on like this.

166
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:12,446
And we can't rob another bank

167
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,848
because it'll call too much attention,

168
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:16,102
and we have no money.

169
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:20,140
What are we gonna do?

170
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:27,386
Well, maybe it's time to give
our other enterprise a shot.

171
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:40,006
Wow, you made this yourself?

172
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,742
Plenty more where that came from.

173
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,578
All we ask is access to your
storage room for the night

174
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:46,446
and 25% of the bar.

175
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,048
What do you want with my storage room?

176
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:51,918
20%, no questions.

177
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,254
We got a deal.

178
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:57,142
All right, let's move some booze.

179
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:08,701
The car was impounded an hour ago.

180
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:12,172
Your ears to the ground, boys.

181
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:14,073
Bullet blondes are in Chicago,

182
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,932
and they're bound
to make their move soon.

183
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,013
You really got us out of
a sticky situation back there.

184
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,248
Oh, it was plain as day
that you needed a hand.

185
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:27,916
Believe me, I've been there.

186
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,885
Gals help gals and make new pals.

187
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,119
That's how I see it.

188
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:34,156
If we don't look out
for one another who will, men?

189
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,758
Men don't look out, they look at,

190
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,860
if you know what I mean.

191
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,561
You're referring
to the rampant commodification

192
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,564
of females by males
that is a societal norm

193
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,751
of this decade.

194
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,437
You talk funny.

195
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,142
I like it. My name's Susie Spencer.

196
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,609
Susan Spencer.

197
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,812
Marries Colin Baker in 1928,
has four children,

198
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:00,548
retires in Florida, and dies peace...

199
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:02,383
That's enough talking, Gideon.

200
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,005
You're supposed to be resting
your voice, remember?

201
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,791
Time to play the quiet game.

202
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,525
Oh, the game invented
by parents to quell

203
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:14,461
their irritating children, got it.

204
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:17,998
So you're a jazz band
called the Masqueradies?

205
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,632
I know it's a silly moniker.

206
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:23,170
We wear fancy masks
as part of our shtick.

207
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:24,671
Not that it made a lick of difference

208
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:25,839
on our East Coast tour.

209
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:27,440
We barely broke even.

210
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:30,032
You know how it is,
being musicians yourselves.

211
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,048
She's resting her voice?

212
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,482
Right, yeah.

213
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:40,711
Gideon here is the Lark of London.

214
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:45,997
Uh, Spoo... Esperanza is
her vocal coach.

215
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,967
And I am her manager,

216
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:51,798
A manager?

217
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, my, they do things
differently in London.

218
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,502
- Don't they?
- Yeah.

219
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,903
Between us gals,
I would kill to have a woman

220
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,190
managing our business.

221
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:04,783
Donny over there is just
an overpaid bodyguard really.

222
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,052
Is that so?

223
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:09,115
Can I take a look at your contract?

224
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,703
Sure, I have it right here.

225
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:26,532
That's a strange-looking compact.

226
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:27,537
Oh, yeah.

227
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,903
It's from California by way of China.

228
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:35,173
You know, business is
really picking up in here.

229
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:36,442
Yeah, it's 'cause the word got out

230
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,010
that we got the good stuff.

231
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,345
What can I get for you?

232
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:40,913
Whiskey or the rocks or straight up?

233
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,915
Oh, neither. I don't drink.

234
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,784
For health or faith?

235
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:48,054
- Faith.
- Okay.

236
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,090
Soda water with lemon on the house.

237
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:54,793
Thank you.

238
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,329
Salamati.

239
00:11:57,353 --> 00:12:00,017
Salamati.

240
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,337
Helps to know cheers
in different languages.

241
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:09,540
- I get all kinds in here.
- Yeah.

242
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,510
- That your brother?
- Yeah, it is.

243
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:16,180
I've actually never heard
him play like that before.

244
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:18,716
And you never will again.

245
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,552
Because what's going on up
there is a one-time special.

246
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:22,820
Oh, right.

247
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,689
Those three guys are feeling the vibe,

248
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:27,391
riffing off what the other guys
are bringing to the moment.

249
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,059
You can't recreate that.

250
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,495
Yeah, well, where I'm from,
we have a saying,

251
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,297
"Pics or it didn't happen".

252
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:36,467
A picture couldn't describe
the here and now.

253
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:40,496
Here, now, it forces you
to pay attention.

254
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:43,826
Just let it roll on
over you like a wave.

255
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:55,284
This is a catastrophe.
When did you sign this?

256
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,555
About three years ago
when we first formed the band.

257
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,092
Okay, good. Hey, blubber butt, wake up!

258
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,527
You don't wanna do that.

259
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,096
It says here that you're taking 60%.

260
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,331
Criminal, mind you,

261
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,132
and yet you still don't
have these ladies riding

262
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,968
in first-class accommodation?

263
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,889
Are you lazy or stupid or both?

264
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,306
You're telling me how to do my job?

265
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,810
What's a colored girl like you
know anything about contracts?

266
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,647
Where I'm from, managers and
producers are a dime a dozen.

267
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,316
I learned from Phil Spector himself.

268
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,853
There's a clause here
that says these terms expire

269
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,187
after 24 months.

270
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,456
This paperwork is defunct.

271
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,025
So I suggest that you
draw up a new contract

272
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,662
that will actually benefit
your clients, not exploit them.

273
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,565
You can't make me do anything.

274
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,167
True, I can't.

275
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,456
But she can.

276
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,611
You're fired.

277
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,113
What do you mean, fired?

278
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,282
You are out of a job, you low life.

279
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:05,453
So we'll be taking these.

280
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,682
Permuto.

281
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,826
Would you look at that?

282
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,329
These are for the first-class cabin.

283
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,584
Grab your gear, girls,
you just got upgraded.

284
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,238
Cheers!

285
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,168
Where's my wife?

286
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,970
I want to brag to her about
how I solved all our problems

287
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,039
with some good old fashioned bootlegging.

288
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,707
She is taking a siesta in the mansion.

289
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,177
She said her wig was too itchy,
probably synthetic.

290
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,779
I kinda wish we could stay longer.

291
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:08,181
Well, no can do, B.

292
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,082
Train for New York leaves at 8:00 a.m.

293
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:12,118
We gotta find this Gwynn Davies guy,

294
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:14,553
so he can invent us some time
travel, and boom.

295
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:16,089
Here's the rest.

296
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,991
We got all we need you. You keep it.

297
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,292
Thanks.

298
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,527
Hey, you sure you
all can fit back there?

299
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,930
No questions.

300
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:29,159
Well, tonight was eye-opening.

301
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,337
You all are welcome back anytime.

302
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:33,838
And I know you mean that.

303
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:36,593
Good luck, Eddie.

304
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:56,728
Been a while.

305
00:15:56,752 --> 00:16:00,098
Evening, Mr. Bottoni.

306
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:02,134
When I rented you this place

307
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:05,936
it was just a bunch
of curtains and a gramophone.

308
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,138
Now look at it.

309
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:11,774
Looks good, almost classy.

310
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:14,210
Thank you.

311
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,746
Things sure do change.

312
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,150
For example, I told you,

313
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:23,119
you could rent
my little space for cheap,

314
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:26,322
and I'd supply you with your liquor.

315
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:30,551
And what do I hear
but you got another source.

316
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,311
Eddie?

317
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,080
My God.

318
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:53,315
Oh, my God, are you okay? Help!

319
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,816
Help, we need help in here!

320
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,685
Zari?

321
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,755
He's hurt.

322
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,326
What? You're the Bullet Blondes?

323
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,128
Oh, no.

324
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:09,251
- Eddie, what happened to you?
- Yeah, who did this to you?

325
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,753
You did.

326
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,594
We can explain.

327
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,095
I think I understand just fine.

328
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,397
You conned me.

329
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,175
You put me in the middle
of a damn mob war.

330
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,476
And now, because of you,
I don't own this bar anymore.

331
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,579
- How does that work?
- My landlord, he's a mobster.

332
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,949
He found out I worked with you
and took the whole thing back.

333
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,284
Everything I had was
in this bar, and now it's gone

334
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,385
'cause of one night with you.

335
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,954
- Eddie...
- No, just go.

336
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,776
The mob will be here soon,
so you better not be.

337
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,030
You're just going to
let him leave like that.

338
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:52,297
What are we supposed to do?

339
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,066
We can't take down
the entire Chicago mob,

340
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,467
our train leaves in a few hours.

341
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,669
A train we'd have no way of affording

342
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,404
if it weren't for his help.

343
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,640
He's the only one
who's opened his doors to us.

344
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,808
In fact, he's the only
open-minded person

345
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,544
we've met on this entire trip.

346
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,045
We have to fix this.

347
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,080
Yeah, but how?

348
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:12,584
Money, money. Money can fix anything.

349
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,653
If you hand me the reins for 24 hours,

350
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,688
I will help Eddie make enough money

351
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,091
to get back on his feet, and then some.

352
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:22,561
It's just, we said small
footprints to the timeline.

353
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,463
Aves, we can't keep leaving the timeline

354
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,030
worse than we found it.

355
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,899
This place is one of
the few safe spaces that exist

356
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:31,635
in this entire crummy time period.

357
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:32,970
I'm not gonna be able to sleep

358
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:37,199
knowing we had a hand
in destroying it, are you?

359
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,243
Let's do it.

360
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,545
Thank you.

361
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,848
Zari's really wearing
the pants on this mission.

362
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,903
I think I like it.

363
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,491
What could you possibly show me

364
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:55,993
that's gonna change anything?

365
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:58,362
Just patience, please.

366
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:00,630
You know, it's locked.

367
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:02,064
Can you help me find the key?

368
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:03,599
Maybe over there?

369
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:05,668
- A key?
- Mm-hmm.

370
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:08,693
- Just around?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:15,667
You know what? I found it.

372
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:26,222
What is with you people
and storage rooms?

373
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:29,392
It's a fair observation,
but just give it a chance.

374
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,683
Okay?

375
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,405
Okay, picture the main dance floor here,

376
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,074
a more exclusive lounge over here.

377
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:49,478
No smoking of course,
but darker, sexier.

378
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,313
The bar over there.

379
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,634
Whoa, give me a second here.

380
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,086
Eddie, can I be real with you?

381
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,022
I know a thing or two about
throwing an excellent soiree,

382
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,758
and I'm going to throw
you the biggest fundraiser

383
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,327
of the season.

384
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,382
Buddy, you are going
to get a Zari party.

385
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:17,571
All aboard!

386
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,907
Ms. Beaumont, telegram for you.

387
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:22,997
Thank you.

388
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,452
Hurry up, ladies.

389
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:32,620
My honey's got a new club,

390
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:34,022
and he wants us to perform tonight.

391
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,409
Ain't it great?

392
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,793
You okay, hon?

393
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,096
Yeah, just feeling a bit queasy.

394
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,664
You know, what'll help?

395
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:45,365
A big plate of eggs,
bacon, and hotcakes.

396
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,434
There'll be breakfast
at the new club, I'm sure.

397
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,936
We should probably be
on our way to New York.

398
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,305
Well, shucks, the train
to the Big Apple leaves

399
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:53,440
once a day at 8:00 a.m.

400
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,208
It's half past already.

401
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,843
Damn it.

402
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,878
Don't fret. You can just come with me.

403
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,246
No, we don't want to impose...

404
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,248
That sounds perfect.

405
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,717
There's nothing else to do

406
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:06,553
other than wait around
at the station, right?

407
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,441
Well, aces, follow me.

408
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,895
My stomach's telling me
something off with these guys.

409
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,116
Your stomach is telling you
to get some free food.

410
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,238
Okay, Zari, things are coming
right along.

411
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:28,774
That is good.

412
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,243
Need better than good. I need epic.

413
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:34,499
I need a gimmick, a hook of...

414
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:41,253
I need a show.

415
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:42,855
B, Eddie?

416
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:46,958
Okay, I need you guys to get
out there and spread the word.

417
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:49,795
I have the one thing that's
going to set this party off.

418
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:51,829
For one night, and one night only,

419
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,799
the Bullet Blondes are going
to put on the greatest show

420
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:57,535
this town has ever seen, what?!

421
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,125
Wait, we're gonna do what?

422
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,162
So you're saying we can get
the word out with just one guy?

423
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:08,630
More than sure. You want a secret kept?

424
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,374
You make sure Ricky is
the last one to know.

425
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,902
Eddie, heard about the club.
Are you doing all right?

426
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:15,070
Peaches, Ricky.

427
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:17,525
Say, can you keep a secret?

428
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,820
The Bullet Blondes.

429
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,116
Really. The password is Rutabaga.

430
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,418
- Rutabaga.
- Rutabaga.

431
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:30,753
- Rutabaga.
- Rutabaga.

432
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:32,343
Rutabaga.

433
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:39,660
Ain't this Eddie's place?

434
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:42,129
Rehearsal in five, ladies.

435
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,432
Now let's see about
getting you some breakfast.

436
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:47,461
Maude!

437
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,239
Hi, baby cakes. We're home.

438
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:53,841
A nice new spot you've got here.

439
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:55,342
Can't wait to get a wiggle on.

440
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,965
What's this I hear
about you firing Donny?

441
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,149
Donny was not a very good manager, baby.

442
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,251
See here, Ms. Astra here

443
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:07,354
helped me draw up new terms
for a proper manager.

444
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:10,291
Give me that.

445
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:11,859
Garbage.

446
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:14,929
This is what happens
when you do things without me.

447
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:17,431
I knew that the whole tour
was a bad idea.

448
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:22,960
Your manager is whoever
I say it is, understood?

449
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:28,075
Yes. I understand.

450
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,377
New band member? Put her up front.

451
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:32,612
Give the audience something to look at.

452
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:36,841
Tonight is a big night, baby.

453
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:41,413
Mr. Williams from RCA will be here.

454
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,959
So get those getaway sticks
to rehearsals so you

455
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:49,188
can sing open his checkbook
and get us a record deal.

456
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:57,971
Maude, wait.

457
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,639
Hey, what was that?

458
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:02,208
What do you mean, hon?

459
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:06,237
In front of your boyfriend,
you just disappeared.

460
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,681
I know he can be
a little rough sometimes,

461
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:10,883
but he's just got his preferences.

462
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,351
You know how it is.

463
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,474
No, tell me.

464
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,524
He found me when I was
nothing but a string bean

465
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:20,693
with an undisciplined set of pipes.

466
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:23,162
I'm thankful. I really am.

467
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:24,497
You heard.

468
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:27,633
Even RCA is coming to see little old me.

469
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:30,668
When he says "sing", I ask what song,

470
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:34,473
What happens when you don't
feel like singing?

471
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:36,793
You just don't get it.

472
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,736
Ross loves me, and I owe him everything.

473
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,989
Ross?

474
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:53,711
Ross Bottoni.

475
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,412
Maude's boyfriend, I know him.

476
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:16,047
Ross Bottoni. I met him in hell.

477
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,949
He talked about my getaway sticks,

478
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:21,085
so I covered him in his worst
fear, a thousand tiny spiders.

479
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:24,422
That man is a monster.
We have to help her.

480
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:26,590
Astra, if we try to rescue every woman

481
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:29,060
in a bad relationship
from here to New York,

482
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:31,228
we'll never get a mile out of Chicago.

483
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:33,064
Maude chose this. This is her life.

484
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:35,533
- She said so.
- Nobody chooses this.

485
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:37,000
They find themselves in too deep,

486
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,669
and they have to grab onto
whatever they can

487
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:40,071
to keep from drowning.

488
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:43,525
That is not a choice.
That is survival, Spooner.

489
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,478
You know, maybe she'll be okay.

490
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:52,282
Gideon? What happens to Maude?

491
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:53,951
Is this a test?

492
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:55,552
I'm meant to be playing the quiet game.

493
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:58,555
Forget the quiet game.

494
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,810
Will she be okay?

495
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,762
The body of Maude Beaumont
will be found floating

496
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:09,399
in the Chicago River
December 18th, 1925.

497
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:11,802
Her death is ruled as a homicide,

498
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:13,923
but no charges are formally brought.

499
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:19,843
Astra...

500
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:22,764
I don't care if this is how
it's supposed to happen.

501
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:24,781
I'm gonna save Maude,

502
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,068
and there is nothing
you can do to stop me.

503
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:39,595
Gary, I need you to make sure
the silks are secure.

504
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,664
We can't have it falling down
during the big show, yeah?

505
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:43,365
Absolutely, Zari.

506
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:45,935
And can I just say, I think
you're doing a fantastic job

507
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,769
leading us on this mission.

508
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:50,090
I know.

509
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,474
It's pathological with you, isn't it?

510
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:56,177
- What are you talking about?
- You have a crush on Zari.

511
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,211
- What, no.
- Gary.

512
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:00,014
You know what's happening here.
It's not a real crush.

513
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:02,517
Zari's triggering your
attraction to powerful people.

514
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,553
Think about it, Kayla, Ava, John...

515
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:09,124
Shh! She might hear you.

516
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:12,761
You get off being bossed
around, you little sicko.

517
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,328
You're just figuring this out now?

518
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:16,531
Gary, don't you want to be with someone

519
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:18,834
who respects you for the alien you are?

520
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:21,002
No, not really.

521
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:23,304
I'm worried about you, Gare.

522
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,739
I'm worried about you, too,

523
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:27,041
but I don't go around
shaming your pathology, do I?

524
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:28,809
My pathology? What pathology?

525
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,907
That you find yourself
in these relationships

526
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:31,912
that can't go anywhere.

527
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,147
So you don't have to put yourself

528
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:34,182
in the vulnerable position

529
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:35,918
of really giving yourself
to another person

530
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:37,985
because you have the excuse
of timelines or totems

531
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:40,854
holding you back.

532
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:42,256
What?

533
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,891
Okay, gang!

534
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:46,126
The Blondes have been
rehearsing like crazy.

535
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,595
The mood is set.

536
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,798
And the whiskey is literally
all you can drink.

537
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:52,433
Are we ready to party?

538
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:53,767
I'm ready to party all night long

539
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,469
because I'm in a relationship.

540
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:57,505
You do need to define
what that means though?

541
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:59,106
Define whatever you needed to define,

542
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,809
but I needed to do it
as a doorman with good vibes.

543
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,977
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

544
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:06,847
Hey, remember. Good vibes.

545
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:08,916
No, great vibes.

546
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,441
Yeah, great vibes.

547
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:15,655
I can fix that. I think.

548
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,790
Hey, Zari, do we have
to do this in heels?

549
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:20,660
Yes, it's a whole...

550
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:23,696
Is everything good?

551
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,100
Eddie, everything is perfect.

552
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:28,520
It's a Zari party.

553
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:37,411
Hiya, Ross Bottoni.

554
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:39,212
You're here to hear my gal, Maude.

555
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:41,881
She's got the best pipes
in the business.

556
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:42,886
Come this way.

557
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,004
We got a table for you in the front.

558
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:52,125
Maude, you have to leave.

559
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,860
Leave it be, will you?

560
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,795
Can't believe I'm the first
broad you ever met

561
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,264
with a grumpy guy.

562
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:00,166
Besides, I'm not gonna hit the road

563
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,168
right before
the greatest show of my life.

564
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:05,938
If you stay, he will kill you.

565
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:08,007
Save the drama for the stage, honey.

566
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:10,576
It ain't gonna work on me.

567
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,479
Look, you know it's true.

568
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,448
You feel it in your gut
every time you think of him.

569
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:19,986
It twists your insides
every time he speaks.

570
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,588
You wanna vomit every time
he touches you.

571
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:24,623
You're terrified.

572
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,344
And you should be.

573
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,568
There's a better life
for you out there, Maude.

574
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:38,389
Trust me, I know.

575
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,880
This is crazy.

576
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,782
What about the performance?

577
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:53,119
He's gonna know the second
the curtain rises

578
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:54,620
that something's up.

579
00:29:54,644 --> 00:29:58,590
And the girls, he's gonna
take it out on them.

580
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:00,458
We'll take care of Ross.

581
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,946
Just go, please, before it's too late.

582
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:16,394
Oh, thank you.

583
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:18,743
You know, I always said

584
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,412
gals help gals and make new pals.

585
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:24,501
You gals are some of the best
I ever met.

586
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:36,460
- Thank you.
- For what?

587
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:39,163
She knew you were right.

588
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:42,752
And I guess I knew you were right, too.

589
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:48,705
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I announce to you

590
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,934
the lovely and mysterious, Masqueradies.

591
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:02,152
Okay, uh, maybe I can put
a glamour on you,

592
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:03,520
and then you can look like Maude,

593
00:31:03,544 --> 00:31:04,988
which means you can sing, and then...

594
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,724
I don't know the words
to this corny song.

595
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,359
Why can't you do it?

596
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:12,448
- Wait.
- Where's Gideon?

597
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,038
It sounds like she knows the words.

598
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,331
Zari, what's with the face?

599
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,667
- Look around, everyone's here.
- Yeah, I know.

600
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:32,302
I just, I know I'm missing something.

601
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:35,939
What am I forgetting?

602
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:38,208
Me, me. I'm forgetting me.

603
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:40,978
I should've been in hair and makeup.

604
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:43,046
Definitely done an outfit change.

605
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,581
Who cares?

606
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,151
Look, what's happening tonight
is a one-time special.

607
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:51,306
Be in the moment, here, now.

608
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:58,562
Let's dance before
some blondes steal the show.

609
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,550
Okay.

610
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,926
Rutabaga.

611
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,445
Ladies and gentlemen,

612
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,113
the silver shooting sinners themselves,

613
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:20,401
the Bullet Blondes!

614
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:40,054
- Rutabaga.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:46,107
Last time you saw Zari,
how did you end things?

616
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,909
We're still together.
We didn't break up.

617
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:49,544
Yeah, but how's that working out?

618
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:50,979
What is the plan there?

619
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:52,847
Oh, my God, we love each other, Gary.

620
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:54,215
You're not answering my question.

621
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,236
It's not the... not now, Gary.

622
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:19,307
You can't put it off forever, Nate!

623
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:21,942
You need to discuss
what it means to be all-in.

624
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:25,679
Otherwise, you will have one
foot out of the door or totem.

625
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,400
Shut up, Gary!

626
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,268
Whoo-hoo!

627
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,689
Wait, where's Hoover?

628
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:03,894
We're not sisters.

629
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,076
Yo, that was incredible, Gideon.

630
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,612
Way to put those pipes to use.

631
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,513
My voice was well-rested.

632
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:24,349
Way to croon, sweet cakes.

633
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:28,359
Come out front so the nice man
can meet you.

634
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:31,462
What's the big idea?
Where the hell is Maude?

635
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:33,182
Far away from here by now.

636
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:36,261
Who the hell are you,
and what happened to my girl?

637
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,597
I'm Astra Logue, you idiot.

638
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:41,533
And Maude is gone.
You'll never see her again.

639
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:44,703
You think you're clever, huh?

640
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:46,571
She'll come crawling back.

641
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:48,706
You know, where I grew up,

642
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,009
we had this knack of finding out

643
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:53,912
what people are most afraid of
in the entire world.

644
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:57,381
And you think
you're so tough and strong.

645
00:37:57,405 --> 00:38:01,410
But I know the truth,
what you're really afraid of.

646
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:05,590
Spiders, wasn't it?

647
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:07,377
Yeah, right.

648
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:17,001
Really?

649
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,737
You're not afraid of an infinite amount

650
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:20,958
of tiny little spiders
all over your body?

651
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:24,975
Crawling under your skin,

652
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:27,864
scurrying into your nose,
ears, your mouth?

653
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:32,683
You've seen what my friend
and I can do, Ross.

654
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:37,193
So if you ever go after Maude,
if you even think about her...

655
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:40,782
Spiders everywhere forever.

656
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:45,396
Gals help gals, you jerk.

657
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,099
No!

658
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:51,435
Hey ladies, we're gonna try
to make it to the end

659
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,070
of the Blondes' set, do you wanna come?

660
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:55,573
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear?

661
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:57,842
The Bullet Blondes are putting
on a performance right now

662
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:58,909
at Chapeaux's.

663
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,711
We're gonna try to catch
the rest of the party.

664
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:03,465
- Legends, vamanos.
- Go, go, go, go!

665
00:39:08,975 --> 00:39:10,787
You're right about me and Zari.

666
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,622
We are a bit stuck.

667
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:14,324
But I've been okay with it

668
00:39:14,348 --> 00:39:18,353
because, well, I'm afraid
of what comes next.

669
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:22,532
Well, it sounds like you
and Z need to have the talk.

670
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:27,561
And then Gare-Bear, he's here
to talk after the talk.

671
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:31,226
Thank you, Gary.

672
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:37,571
It's enough for a small
place, but that's all I need.

673
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:40,683
And I don't know how
I'll ever repay you.

674
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:43,485
Oh, you just keep your doors
open for all Chicago's misfits,

675
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,889
and we will call it even.

676
00:39:46,913 --> 00:39:50,812
No, no, no.

677
00:40:04,564 --> 00:40:08,163
Guys, check the doors.

678
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:23,444
They were here.

679
00:40:37,462 --> 00:40:39,307
Don't worry, Legends.

680
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:41,996
We're on our way to the Big Apple.

681
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,285
So I mean, technically speaking,

682
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:53,254
using you two as bait
to lure Hoover-bot here

683
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:56,158
was an inadvertently brilliant
stroke of genius on my part.

684
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:58,326
Well, you still got
a couple of hours left

685
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,761
of calling the shots, so...

686
00:40:59,785 --> 00:41:02,597
I do appreciate the trust, Captain,

687
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:04,899
but when it comes to robots,

688
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:07,435
you're talking to the wrong Zari.

689
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:09,236
Oh, while I'm gone,

690
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,273
will you guys keep an eye out
for my cell phone?

691
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:13,630
Bye.

692
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:22,850
Oh, what's up, guys?

693
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:25,107
Huh. What'd I miss?

694
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:48,326
Greg, move your head.

695
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:54,050
