1
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:14,880
AND IF YOU GAZE LONG INTO AN ABYSS,
THE ABYSS ALSO GAZES INTO YOU.

2
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:29,463
JUNE 21, 1921

3
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,213
The beginning

4
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:07,671
and the end.

5
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,713
A strange idea

6
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:15,171
that both should be the same.

7
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:19,255
Sic mundus creatus est.

8
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,088
Thus the world was created.

9
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,380
Sic

10
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,338
mundus

11
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,463
creatus est!

12
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:56,838
You no longer believe the prophecy?

13
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,546
I believe in the irony of fate.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,671
Adam says that all things must happen
as they've always happened.

15
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,838
We have to bear the cross,
no matter how heavy it seems.

16
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:22,338
In six days paradise begins
and hell on earth will end.

17
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,421
Sometimes I wonder

18
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,963
if paradise and hell

19
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,505
are not one and the same thing.

20
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,713
Adam was right.

21
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,046
You've lost faith.

22
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,713
Is that why he sent you?

23
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:50,796
I've waited a long time for this moment.

24
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,963
It's interesting that it's you.

25
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,838
I hope that the day comes

26
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,338
when you don't believe
everything Adam tells you.

27
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,463
Ask him...

28
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,130
why he took you in.

29
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,880
And why he called you Noah.

30
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,671
JUNE 27, 2020
BEGINNING OF THE LAST CYCLE

31
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,463
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

32
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,588
I think we're a perfect match.

33
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,671
Never believe anything else.

34
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:54,255
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 p.m.

35
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:22,005
JUNE 2020

36
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,671
27

37
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,005
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

38
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:55,463
I am one of the few survivors
of the apocalypse of June 27, 2020.

39
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:58,338
Almost three months
have passed since the catastrophe.

40
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:02,505
It's still unclear
what exactly led to the events in Winden.

41
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:04,755
But the God Particle...

42
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:09,046
If we can stabilize it,
maybe it is a way back.

43
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,963
Back to the past.

44
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:14,630
Maybe we can save them.

45
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,088
All of them.

46
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:22,880
JUNE 21, 2020

47
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:26,588
SIX DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

48
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,255
Wake up, late risers!

49
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:32,213
It's the first week of summer vacation
and it is perfect beach weather.

50
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,296
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

51
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:34,796
Local news.

52
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,671
Over six months after the mysterious
disappearance of four teenagers,

53
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:43,005
a senior citizen and a local
police officer from the town of Winden,

54
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:47,755
there are no clues as to their whereabouts
or the circumstances.

55
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:51,755
A federal police task force
will now assist with the investigation.

56
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:58,213
How do you feel today?

57
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,796
Still having joint trouble?

58
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:03,213
Nausea?

59
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,921
To be honest, your lab results worry me.

60
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,963
We should treat you in the hospital again.

61
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:09,921
No.

62
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,213
Absolutely not.

63
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,046
- I want to stay here.
- Fine.

64
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,421
We'll wait for the next MRI results.

65
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:22,338
We may have to switch
from hormone treatment back to chemo.

66
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,713
MARTHA: COME TO THE BRIDGE.

67
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:28,963
He that has eyes to see...

68
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,713
and ears to hear...

69
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,838
may convince himself that no mortal...

70
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,546
can keep a secret.

71
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,046
If his lips are silent,

72
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,963
he chatters with his fingertips.

73
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,171
Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

74
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,046
That was Freud.

75
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,963
I'm Clausen,

76
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,380
head of the Winden task force.

77
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,421
Today I take charge of last year's
unsolved missing persons cases.

78
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:02,921
The task force's aim
is to reopen these cases entirely,

79
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:07,255
to review all evidence and clues
until we have unearthed the secrets

80
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:11,421
that lie hidden below the surface.

81
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,005
Recently, some of you should have received
summons for renewed interrogation.

82
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:22,713
- Yes?
- You said "we." Who do you mean by that?

83
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,755
Myself and Ms. Doppler,

84
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,171
who is still assigned to these cases.

85
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:28,713
That's no task force!

86
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:33,463
Six people have been missing for months.
And that's what they send us?

87
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,296
One person?

88
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,505
And the woman who found nothing?

89
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,588
Ten people

90
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:55,088
who look at an elephant
from ten different angles

91
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,630
will give ten different statements...

92
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,338
about its shape and appearance.

93
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,421
A single person

94
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:08,755
who sees that same elephant
from those ten different perspectives...

95
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,296
will be able

96
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,671
to piece together those observations

97
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:16,880
and to draw the only possible conclusion.

98
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,796
My son is missing.

99
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,713
The next time I need to find an elephant,
I'll let you know!

100
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,296
Right!

101
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:30,171
Does your mom talk at home?
About the investigation, I mean.

102
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:32,421
Not to us.

103
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:35,880
We sit around and wait.

104
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,880
And nothing happens.

105
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:41,421
We know as little as we did
eight months ago.

106
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:47,213
Sometimes I think it'd be better
if they were dead.

107
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:52,755
Don't say that.

108
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:15,213
I have to go.

109
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:18,088
Where to?

110
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,505
To pick up Elisabeth at a friend's.

111
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:22,671
I'll call you later, okay?

112
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,838
I've been trying to reach you for days.

113
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,921
A lot was going on.

114
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,463
I wanted to talk to you.

115
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:31,296
- I've wanted to for a long time.
- Save your breath.

116
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,421
It's probably better that way.

117
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,005
So...

118
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,588
that's it then.

119
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,171
Because of him?

120
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,421
- Because of Jonas?
- What?

121
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,046
What's that got to do with it?

122
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,713
We hardly ever see each other.

123
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,713
I don't know...

124
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,630
You've changed.

125
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,505
I...

126
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,463
I feel like you're hiding something.

127
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,213
- I don't know what's up with you.
- What's up with me?

128
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,005
What the fuck? My mom is dying!

129
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,505
And...

130
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:32,296
- There's stuff I can't tell you.
- Why not?

131
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,005
I just can't.

132
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,713
Okay?

133
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:38,296
If you knew the crap I'm going through...

134
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,880
The crap you're going through?

135
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,296
In case you forgot,
my father and brother have disappeared.

136
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,838
My mom is crazy
and couldn't care less about me.

137
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:50,005
And you want to tell me about your crap?

138
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:10,921
It's better this way.

139
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,671
FROM UNKNOWN SENDER:
THIS EVENING.

140
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:39,338
Energy creates community.

141
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,338
Nuclear power was, is,
and will remain the only alternative.

142
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:45,671
Nothing is cheaper,

143
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:47,588
safer, more reliable.

144
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,671
But the outside world insists on progress.

145
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,838
In six days our plant
will be decommissioned for good.

146
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:02,671
This is a dramatic event for all of us.

147
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,713
I would like to thank you
for your loyalty.

148
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:11,005
Without you the Winden nuclear power plant
as we know it

149
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,088
could never have existed.

150
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,963
Let us, during these last six days,

151
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,630
fill it with life
in the spirit of the community.

152
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:44,588
Everything has been prepared for transport
as planned.

153
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,463
And the demolition plans?

154
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:52,380
Everything at ground level will be left
and become part of the greenfield.

155
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:56,130
The radiation of the barrels
will be traced to the pool's previous use.

156
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,380
PASSPORT

157
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,213
Hello?

158
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:52,130
Who are you?

159
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:54,546
What do you want?

160
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,713
Why do you have a key?

161
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,296
It's my key.

162
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,880
What do you mean, it's yours?

163
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,338
I know it sounds like it makes no sense.

164
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:16,380
But hear me out.

165
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,421
Do you remember the yellow bike?

166
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:25,921
The bike you and dad gave me
on my eighth birthday.

167
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,755
I rode it into a ditch the very first day.

168
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,463
I gashed my arm open. Here.

169
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:38,838
Get out.

170
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:42,671
Here.

171
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,713
Dad was making pancakes here.

172
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:54,130
He dropped the pan
and spilled the hot oil here.

173
00:22:57,213 --> 00:23:00,005
I vanished from your life six months ago.

174
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,796
You found me over 33 years ago.

175
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:06,630
I knew it was you right away.

176
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,921
It was raining, remember?

177
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,921
Grandpa and you wanted
to take me along in the car.

178
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:15,338
You said it was still acid rain
because of Chernobyl.

179
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:18,421
I was wearing my yellow coat.

180
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:26,755
Mom.

181
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,213
It's me.

182
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:41,588
Jonas?

183
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:47,963
But that's impossible.

184
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,005
There is no coincidence.

185
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:11,296
Every path is predetermined.

186
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:15,630
Everything happens when it must.

187
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:18,213
At the right time.

188
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:20,755
In the right place.

189
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,755
As if the world was a carpet

190
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,380
made up of an endless network
of endless threads.

191
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,088
Each in its place.

192
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,380
CAVE ENTRANCE

193
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:38,005
But very few of us know
where the journey takes them.

194
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:46,963
You've taken your first step.

195
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:50,380
Adam will be proud of you.

196
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:55,005
I felt the same way.

197
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:58,005
It will pass.

198
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:03,630
Adam.

199
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,588
Why did he take us in?

200
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,713
Things are still hidden from you.

201
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:12,713
But they will come to light.

202
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:14,588
Bit by bit.

203
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,880
When the time is right.

204
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,546
How do we know what's right
and what's wrong?

205
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:30,005
What is good and what is evil?

206
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,296
By heeding our inner voice.

207
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:38,838
By not following anyone else
but ourselves.

208
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:44,713
Our true nature reveals itself not only
in our deeds but also in their purpose.

209
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,046
I am you.

210
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,921
I am your voice.

211
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:53,505
Never forget that.

212
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:56,088
Everything is connected.

213
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,255
You.

214
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:00,463
Me.

215
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,796
The past.

216
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:06,296
And the future.

217
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,546
No, no!

218
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:28,921
Stop!

219
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,130
Who are you?
You are hiding it!

220
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:35,088
There, behind the wall! We saw it!

221
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:37,713
We followed the signal.

222
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:41,963
Till the dead zone.

223
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:43,963
You're hiding God!

224
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:46,213
You mustn't hide God.

225
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:47,880
He's not yours alone!

226
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:53,713
You mustn't hide God.

227
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:54,880
No!

228
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,588
No one can enter the dead zone.

229
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:16,213
Any attempt will be punished by death.

230
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:18,255
Those are the rules.

231
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,421
We are the future.

232
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,463
Sic mundus creatus est.

233
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:26,671
Sic mundus creatus est.

234
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:45,921
Where were you?

235
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,921
There's nothing out there.

236
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:59,088
The passage is our only hope.

237
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:01,171
The faithless are dead.

238
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:03,671
The prophecy will come true,
the passage will open

239
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,713
and we will be led into paradise.

240
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,380
The faithless are dead?

241
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,838
Everyone is dead, my family, my friends.

242
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:14,755
Everyone dies in six days, in my time!

243
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:17,213
I don't need your damn paradise.

244
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,838
I just want to go home.

245
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:25,213
What did they want behind the wall?

246
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:52,255
Why did Mom keep it all?

247
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:55,171
Great-Grandpa died ages ago.

248
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:58,171
I think because it's the only thing

249
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,838
that reminds her of her family.

250
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:03,713
Some things are hard to let go of.

251
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
It's a shame
I never met Grandpa and Grandma.

252
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:11,213
Does Mom remember them?

253
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,088
Your mother was still little
when they died.

254
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,630
Come on.

255
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,046
Were you born here?

256
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,630
My grandfather was.

257
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:53,296
I grew up with him.

258
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:56,213
Is your grandfather still alive?

259
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,463
No.

260
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:01,630
Have you thought it could have been him?

261
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:04,088
- Who? My grandfather?
- No.

262
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:05,921
Your colleague, Ulrich.

263
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:07,463
No.

264
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:09,296
Why?

265
00:30:09,838 --> 00:30:11,880
He called you shortly before he vanished.

266
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,213
The call lasted exactly 12 seconds.

267
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:17,630
Probably a voicemail message.

268
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:19,755
What did he want?

269
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:21,963
Nothing.

270
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:23,921
He misdialed.

271
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:27,046
Do you still have the message?

272
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:29,088
No.

273
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:31,380
Of course not.

274
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,713
These are the parents' statements.

275
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,463
Thanks, Wöller.

276
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:49,505
You're welcome.

277
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,213
I had an office set up for you.

278
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:09,213
Just down the hall.

279
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,005
Disappointments are the result
of false expectations.

280
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:20,713
"Have hope," my mom always said,
"and no expectations,

281
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,255
then you might get a miracle
and not a disappointment."

282
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:32,630
Maybe you expected someone different

283
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,630
and got me.

284
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:35,838
Coincidence?

285
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,421
I don't believe in coincidence.

286
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:41,463
I think things come together
because they belong together.

287
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:54,963
Shall we?

288
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:06,838
Mom?

289
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,505
INVESTIGATION FILE

290
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:12,088
STEEL DOOR?

291
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,338
It's remarkable people don't crack,

292
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:47,171
given the futility of their own existence.

293
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:52,421
An endless cycle of life and death.

294
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:57,838
Where is the origin of all this suffering?

295
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,338
Did you tell Bartosz?

296
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,921
And he didn't get at all suspicious?

297
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,380
He has always been naive by nature.

298
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:34,213
The apocalypse has to happen.

299
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:38,588
Are you having doubts?

300
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:45,588
What do you do with an old forest
so new trees can grow?

301
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,005
You burn it down.

302
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,630
There isn't much time left.

303
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,588
The missing pages...

304
00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:56,880
you must find them.

305
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:03,713
Adam?

306
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:05,963
They're waiting for you.

307
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:12,921
Six more days.

308
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,130
I'm on my break.

309
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:04,588
Oh, well... Blow job 40 euros, anal 85.

310
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:07,588
Kinky stuff costs extra.
But I need to eat first.

311
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:12,338
Get undressed.

312
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,880
You could say I exist infinitely.

313
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:30,546
I'm here now.

314
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:34,338
And I'm in every second
between my birth and my death.

315
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:36,838
I'm always Jonas.

316
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,213
I'm the same.

317
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,671
And yet not the same.

318
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:45,421
Like you're not the same person
who came through that door an hour ago.

319
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,130
But where is Jonas?

320
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:50,921
Where is my Jonas?

321
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:55,963
He's in the future.

322
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,005
In the future?

323
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,713
Yes.

324
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:04,796
But he can't come back.

325
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:08,380
I tried to destroy the passage,
but I only closed it.

326
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:10,755
That's why he's still there.

327
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,755
Why are you here?

328
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,671
To put an end to it all.
Once and for all.

329
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,546
That's the man!

330
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,421
Which man?

331
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:29,546
The man with the watch. That's Noah!

332
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:31,171
Noah?

333
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,296
POLICE

334
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,255
Watch out for the tiniest deviations
in their statements.

335
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:03,713
Every detail is important.

336
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,088
PETER: I'VE FOUND NOAH.
COME TO THE BUNKER.

337
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:13,713
Something wrong?

338
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,421
I have to go.

339
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,005
I don't have a driver's license.

340
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:22,505
I assume it's okay
if I ride with you tomorrow?

341
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:23,671
Yes.

342
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:26,296
Mom didn't lock it.

343
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:28,588
What's that?

344
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,796
Dad's stuff.

345
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:36,130
Police documents and maps of the cave.

346
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:39,505
That's why Mom goes in there every day.

347
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:43,838
I think she's looking for this.

348
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:54,588
A door. In the caves?

349
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,088
It goes to the nuclear power plant.

350
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:02,505
They all know something
we're not supposed to know.

351
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,005
Mom, Bartosz.

352
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,463
The police.

353
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:12,838
Each with their own shitty secret.

354
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:54,630
Are you ready?

355
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:28,088
Thanks for the coffee.

356
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,630
I'm glad to get rid of that thing.

357
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:00,588
Call Mom again. Okay?

358
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:19,588
Bye.

359
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,005
Bye.

360
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,046
That's Noah.

361
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:13,588
Elisabeth found it, at the store.

362
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:15,755
It was in a book.

363
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:18,796
She said that's the man
who gave her the watch.

364
00:45:21,796 --> 00:45:24,546
"January 8, 1921.

365
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:28,463
Sic mundus creatus est."

366
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:31,338
Charlotte, who are these people?

367
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:34,213
Why did your grandfather have this?

368
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,671
