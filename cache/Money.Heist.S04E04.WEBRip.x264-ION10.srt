00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,580
BANK OF SPAIN
5 YEARS BEFORE D-DAY

2
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:50,878
Hello.

3
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,125
Good morning, miss.

4
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,043
I have an appointment
with Mr. Mario Urbaneja,

5
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,998
governor of the Bank of Spain.

6
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,575
Alfredo Kesmann,
from Rating Trust Corporation.

7
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,328
Take a seat.

8
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,825
You're very kind. Thank you.

9
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,288
- Excuse me, where are you going?
- Hello.

10
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:26,995
And you?

11
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,038
- Have we met before?
- I'm asking you where you're going.

12
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,168
I'm here to see the governor.

13
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,246
Where are you going? For a walk?
It's a beautiful day.

14
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,918
They'll have told you to wait there.
They'll come for you.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,790
No one was coming,
so I came up. I know the way.

16
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,665
- Mr. Kesmann.
- That's me.

17
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,670
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,080
Sorry about the wait.

19
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,246
- He'll be right with you.
- Great.

20
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,963
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

21
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,248
- Have a good day.
- I'll come with you.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,750
Please do.

23
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,710
Rest, dear.

24
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,666
You?

25
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,375
I'm in charge of intensive care.

26
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,711
Don't worry, I was a nurse.

27
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm going to the bathroom,
but I'll be here.

28
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,751
Thank you.

29
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,501
Mutt.

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,325
I told you I was going to kill you.

31
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,165
Which way did he go?

32
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,501
Rio, which way did he go?

33
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,293
For fuck's sake.

34
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where did he go?

35
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,710
Up the stairs.

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,750
Stockholm, Denver, stay here.

37
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,583
Don't let him get near the door.
If the hostages escape, we're fucked.

38
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,206
- Understood.
- Let's go.

39
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,075
- Helsinki, Bogotá, come with me.
- Let's go.

40
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,168
Everyone, stand the fuck up, now!

41
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,501
What's happening?

42
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,333
Nairobi. Something's wrong. Run!

43
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,496
Nairobi!

44
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,916
- Nairobi, hold on!
- Nairobi!

45
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,956
Nairobi!

46
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,381
Nairobi, hold on!

47
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,333
He tried to smother her.
Her pulse was 162 bpm.

48
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,916
- Nairobi.
- Nairobi.

49
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,213
Easy.

50
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,915
Easy, breathe.

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,670
- Breathe, Nairobi.
- Gandía is on the loose.

52
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,628
Bogotá!

53
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,996
You stay with Nairobi.

54
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:48,173
If he comes back in,
blow his brains out, understood?

55
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,213
Helsinki, go after him.

56
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,133
- Look after her.
- My friend...

57
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,330
From now on, the rules have changed.
Nobody gets up,

58
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,495
nobody moves, nobody eats
without direct fucking orders.

59
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,213
You're fucked, Denver.

60
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,376
Really fucked.

61
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,828
- I don't believe it.
- Did you say something?

62
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,746
Yes.

63
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,498
You're not invincible anymore.

64
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,293
No. You're not invincible.

65
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,205
They're not invincible!

66
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,631
Arturo, shut up!

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
Or what?

68
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,788
Or I'll empty the gun
into your fucking head.

69
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,125
- Things have changed around here.
- Yes.

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We're here,
and now we're the Resistance.

71
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,041
Amanda, Miguel,
we're the Resistance, hey?

72
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,705
We're the Resistance. Resistance!

73
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,461
Resistance!

74
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:57,711
Resistance!

75
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,171
Resistance!

76
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,831
Resistance, my ass.

77
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,673
Everyone, on the fucking ground now!

78
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,495
That's right, Sergio.

79
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,713
We need to know
how the bodyguards will react.

80
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,631
How they react,

81
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,578
how long they'll take
to get the governor to safety,

82
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,166
how they'll spread out...

83
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
- It's all in the protocols.
- We have the protocols,

84
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,826
we have the theory,

85
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,536
but we could do with a bit of practice.

86
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,631
And how do you propose
we get that practice?

87
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,503
By creating a minor security crisis
and watching it from inside.

88
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,460
- You're going into the lion's den?
- And the lion will protect me.

89
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,415
Who will you impersonate?

90
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,540
They'll think he's a genius, a big name.

91
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,036
A risk analyst

92
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,955
from Rating Trust Corporation.

93
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:23,955
Before that, he was at Bacher & Bacher,
and at Standard and Risk before that.

94
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:29,498
We're going to steal the identity
of someone truly brilliant.

95
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,790
A Spanish guy who has been living
in New York for more than 20 years.

96
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,461
Alfredo Kesmann.

97
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,331
A real genius.

98
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,711
And we have a few great suggestions
for the country's economy.

99
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,131
- The governor will appreciate them.
- Right.

100
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,578
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

101
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,168
But you could also
remain standing for the governor.

102
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,081
- You're the governor's head of security?
- Affirmative.

103
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,923
In a way, you and I do the same thing.

104
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,631
We're both risk analysts.

105
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,381
- We're very similar, don't you think?
- No.

106
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,583
We're not at all alike.

107
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,248
I analyze risks to save lives.

108
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,785
You do it to make money.

109
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,578
It's not the same.

110
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,420
Yes, we're similar.

111
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,210
What's more,
you're very clearheaded and... observant.

112
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,711
What risks do you see
here and now in this office?

113
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,131
Just out of curiosity.

114
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:07,708
If I could see any risks in this room,
they would no longer exist.

115
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,748
Don't you think?

116
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:13,923
Mr. Kesmann.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,790
- Good morning.
- How are you?

118
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,705
- Good, thank you.
- Shall we sit down?

119
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,631
Let's.

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,960
Would you like some coffee, sir?

121
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,463
A Ceylon tea
with cardamom would be great.

122
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,751
- If not, any black tea is fine. Thanks.
- Of course.

123
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,463
If I had a coffee now, I would go crazy.

124
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,876
You can start your statement.
Go ahead.

125
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,326
Before I start,
I'd like to clarify something.

126
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,630
I don't know if it's important, but...

127
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,326
I've been thinking,
and I wanted to ask you something.

128
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,001
- Shoot.
- What's it like when you get home?

129
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,581
I mean, you get home from work,

130
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,995
after torturing a kid like Rio,

131
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,326
who you've had standing up
for days and days

132
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,128
in a cell that's smaller than a closet,

133
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,918
shitting and pissing himself.

134
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,126
And then you go back home, to Germán.

135
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,833
I don't get it.

136
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,958
You don't mind
being called a torturer in the press.

137
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,383
But Germán...

138
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,126
Germán is a good person.

139
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,251
What does he say when you get home?

140
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,253
Does he ask you,
how was your day, darling?

141
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,253
And you kiss him...

142
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,165
and you hug him.

143
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,288
What about him?
Does he kiss and hug you back?

144
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,578
Do you fuck?

145
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,501
I think you must make him sick.

146
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,995
The truth is, it has been two months
since Germán hugged me.

147
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,543
He doesn't hug me, or kiss me,
or make love to me.

148
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,498
Not since I had him cremated.

149
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:26,921
They covered him with a white sheet
and took him down to the hospital morgue,

150
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,166
and that's when the embraces stopped.

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,750
What are you talking about?

152
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,251
He's dead.

153
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,036
Cancer...

154
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,748
of the pancreas.

155
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,168
The kind where they give you two months,
and it is two months.

156
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,003
I put on weight, and he lost it.

157
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,828
I was pink, and he was yellow.

158
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It consumed him.

159
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,541
Life grew in me.

160
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,075
Death grew in him.

161
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,826
That's cancer.

162
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:41,378
Do you know the last thing he said to me?
Can you believe his last words were...

163
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,960
Turn on the news?

164
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,250
I thought he was going to give me
one of those talks of his

165
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,293
because, as you know,
he was quite eloquent and so imaginative.

166
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,751
And he said, turn on the news.
He was high as a kite on morphine.

167
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,133
So I guess he just lost it.

168
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,038
Then he just died.

169
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,496
I'm really sorry.

170
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,830
- Alicia, let's go outside for a second.
- Yes, coming.

171
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,956
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.
Don't let anyone in.

172
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,960
For God's sake,
why didn't you say anything before?

173
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,708
What would I have gained?
A bit of pity?

174
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,626
Oh, Alicia...

175
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,245
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you're up to leading this case.

176
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,331
I'll take this.

177
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,460
This too.

178
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,041
Easy.

179
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,915
Try and die quietly.

180
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,168
Helsinki!

181
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,168
Hold on! Bogotá!

182
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,380
Bogotá, come to the library!

183
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,995
Helsinki, hold on, please.

184
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,083
- Hold on. Bogotá.
- Go!

185
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,538
Bogotá! Hold on, please.

186
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,125
The library, Bogotá!

187
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,166
Bogotá, quickly!

188
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,381
Help me!

189
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,251
Hold on, Helsinki.

190
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,996
- Quick.
- Come on.

191
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,003
Hold on. Come on!

192
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,503
Hold on!

193
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,383
Cut the rope!

194
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,498
Hold on!

195
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,038
Come on! Cut the rope, dammit!

196
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,671
Hold on.

197
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,631
Gandía!

198
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,668
You son of a bitch!

199
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:30,416
Silence, for fuck's sake!
I said, nobody talk! Nobody talk!

200
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,963
Amanda.

201
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,078
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

202
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,830
- I feel a bit calmer now.
- Good.

203
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,961
If you want,
we can go back with the others.

204
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,831
There's no rush.
The main thing is for you to get well.

205
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,036
- OK.
- Let me take your pulse.

206
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,463
No, it's still really fast, Amanda.

207
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,461
This is a major anxiety attack.

208
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,001
Do you have fluttering in your chest?

209
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,963
- Well, a little bit.
- That's normal. It's one of the symptoms.

210
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,543
Luckily...

211
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,133
I got something for you.

212
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:20,828
Here.

213
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,246
This works wonders.

214
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,253
Take three.

215
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,418
- It's not too strong, is it?
- No. A bit stronger than valerian.

216
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,580
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. I've taken four.

217
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,420
- OK.
- Go ahead.

218
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,080
One at a time.

219
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,503
- Thanks.
- It's OK.

220
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,326
Everyone, listen up, please.

221
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
Let's see.

222
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,328
Many of you didn't know my husband,

223
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,543
Germán.

224
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,003
But the colonel thinks this concerns you.

225
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,083
He's passed away.

226
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,330
Tamayo thinks I'm not up to this task.

227
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,710
But the truth is,
there's no one better than me for this.

228
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,461
No one.

229
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,210
Because I don't fucking want to go home.
Or open the fridge.

230
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,291
Or the mailbox...

231
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,460
in case I see his name.

232
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,883
Or the boxes of photos.

233
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,291
So, I'm like fucking Deep Blue,

234
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,035
calculating 200 million moves a minute
against the Professor.

235
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,923
That's what this heist needs.

236
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,830
And it's what I need.

237
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,460
Anyone got anything to say?

238
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,076
No?

239
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,083
Then let's all cheer up a bit.
Back to work.

240
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:18,955
Rio.

241
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,955
Why the hell didn't you shoot?

242
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:24,746
I don't know.

243
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,173
I froze.

244
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,460
- And why did you freeze, Rio?
- Because I'm not a fucking killer.

245
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,461
You don't need to be a killer.

246
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,126
I couldn't shoot him in the chest
and pretend nothing happened.

247
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,288
Then shoot his leg!

248
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,495
- I can't!
- Then shoot at the ceiling!

249
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,633
Or the floor!
Wherever it takes to keep him still!

250
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,208
I'm telling you, I couldn't.
I froze!

251
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,250
He said he had a family.

252
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,165
He was unarmed. I couldn't.

253
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,285
Why couldn't you?

254
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,630
Tell us why.

255
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,330
He couldn't, because he is traumatized.

256
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,746
I told you, and you fucking ignored me.

257
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,713
And now, because of you,
Helsinki and Nairobi were nearly killed.

258
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,131
Denver, enough!

259
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,666
Rio raised the alarm.

260
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,330
Helsinki and Nairobi are alive.
That's what matters.

261
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,326
You know what matters more?

262
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,421
How did he get free?

263
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,133
- You took Gandía to the bathroom.
- Yes.

264
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,748
- Did you put the cuffs on right?
- Obviously.

265
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,503
Obviously.

266
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,673
Then obviously,
something doesn't fucking add up.

267
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,710
Tokyo, how does
a guy who is handcuffed escape?

268
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,538
Any ideas, Nairobi?

269
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,041
Any ideas? What?

270
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,753
Nothing, right?
Something smells very fishy to me.

271
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,668
Are you saying I'm a traitor?

272
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,460
- I don't know. You tell me.
- No. You tell me.

273
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,040
It's our fault.

274
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:18,133
We shouldn't have left
the kid on guard with PTSD.

275
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,415
Rio is no traitor.

276
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,883
We have a more urgent problem.
Listen to me.

277
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:28,078
The biggest risk is Gandía making contact
with the outside...

278
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:32,205
and them launching a coordinated attack,
from inside and outside.

279
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,001
What's the plan?

280
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,543
He has to be killed.

281
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,330
Who?

282
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,538
That guy.

283
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,171
We are not murderers.

284
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,750
Then we'll be corpses.

285
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,503
We'll get rid of the bodyguards
during the first hour.

286
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,171
They'll be the ones
who leave with the state secrets.

287
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,923
Problem solved.

288
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,040
Get the fuck out!

289
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,245
That bastard won't go out
with the secrets.

290
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,673
Nobody move.

291
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,290
He won't follow orders.

292
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,501
And Santiago?

293
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,170
- Did he get out after raising hell?
- Yes.

294
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:23,415
- It looked like an accident.
- The blast was magnificent.

295
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:30,831
I've brought my agency's
latest reports on country risk.

296
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,290
But...
they don't come out until next month.

297
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,665
We're still working on them,
but these are practically final.

298
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,171
And not encouraging.

299
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,000
They'll damage the risk premium
on your public debt.

300
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:48,793
- Any suggestions?
- Officially, liquid assets in the bank,

301
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,826
anti-inflationary measures, the usual.

302
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,920
But if I may give you my opinion,
which won't appear in the report...

303
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:58,881
Gold.

304
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,673
- Excuse me?
- Increase your gold reserves.

305
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,630
It's the only safe-haven asset.
And bring it here...

306
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,125
to the vault in the Bank of Spain.

307
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,578
Only that will support you in the market.

308
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,075
Look...

309
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,793
what happened in 2008 was a joke.

310
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,041
The real debt crisis is coming.

311
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,996
Are you telling me...

312
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,833
to bet the entire national reserve
on a single color?

313
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:37,131
No, I'm telling you
to bet on the winning horse, gold.

314
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,540
What's happening?

315
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:47,126
- Don't worry.
- Was that an explosion?

316
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,958
Security to the governor's office.

317
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,376
Exterior security, it's Gandía.

318
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:55,788
Activate protocol red.
Close the building.

319
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,875
- Anything outside?
- I can't see anything.

320
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:58,958
Where was the blast?

321
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,171
In the basement, sir.
It may have been a gas pocket.

322
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,130
Copy that. Don't close anything.
We may need to evacuate.

323
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,418
Maximum security alert!
Everyone with their vests on!

324
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,630
Everyone!

325
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,745
They have military weapons in there.

326
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:30,633
I think he caresses them in the evenings,
longing to pull the trigger.

327
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,458
He was a green beret.
He's been on the job for three years.

328
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:38,631
He was the minister of the interior's
personal bodyguard before that.

329
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,746
He was deployed on special ops
in Iraq and Lebanon.

330
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,833
Those are just the official ones

331
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:47,576
because during the six years
he was in special ops,

332
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,791
there are no records of his movements.
That means...

333
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,883
clandestine operations,
secret missions...

334
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,788
He's a killer, Sergio.

335
00:27:58,916 --> 00:27:59,826
He's a killer.

336
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,668
- Have you found the gun rack?
- We can't find it.

337
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,790
We've looked everywhere,
but there's no sign of weapons.

338
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:15,035
I don't know about the guns,
but his cuffs were in the library.

339
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,541
The bastard escaped from them by himself.

340
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,165
Like a child at Disneyland.

341
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,996
We kill him, or he kills us.

342
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,915
I saw him too.

343
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,291
I could see right through him.

344
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:35,331
If he gets the chance,
it'll be like he's playing a shoot-'em-up.

345
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,878
Faced with the slightest risk,
act decisively.

346
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,713
In self-defense...

347
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,463
but without hesitation.

348
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,665
Because he won't hesitate.

349
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,921
He's an unscrupulous ex-combatant.

350
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:08,208
He's merciless.
And he's trying to kill you.

351
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,706
What about the command center?

352
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll make sure their hands are tied
so they respect the truce.

353
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,080
And also...

354
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,583
I'll make them see
that we're better than ever.

355
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:30,923
Right.

356
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,960
You need to take long, deep breaths.

357
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,793
Very good.
Tell me something you love.

358
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,038
The sea.

359
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,250
The sea is perfect for this exercise.
Close your eyes.

360
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,625
Good. Now, Amanda,

361
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,078
imagine it's a hot summer's day.

362
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
You're on the beach,

363
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:59,673
at the water's edge,
with the waves lapping at your feet.

364
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,920
- Can you feel it?
- Yes, I can.

365
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,080
Now we're floating
on an air mattress in the water.

366
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,878
The sea breeze...

367
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,578
on the shore.

368
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,330
And the smell of summer.

369
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,326
I'm getting sleepy.

370
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,036
Let the sound of the sea carry you away.

371
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,205
Let the sea rock you to sleep.

372
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,245
The sea...

373
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,963
Amanda...

374
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,293
Amanda...

375
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,288
Come.

376
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,791
If you're calling to negotiate, press one.

377
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,625
If you're calling to surrender, press two.

378
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:33,325
If you're calling to ask what I'm wearing,
press pound.

379
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,286
- I caught you at a good time.
- Yes.

380
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,205
It's a beautiful day.

381
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:41,125
I'm glad. I wasn't sure how
you'd take the news I'm about to give you.

382
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,958
I just sent an exclusive
to a national newspaper.

383
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,710
They'll call asking you to confirm
that there's a truce. I hope you do.

384
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,708
Why would I do that?

385
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,881
Because if you don't, I'll leak
that you pretended to kill Lisbon,

386
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:00,915
that she's been illegally held since then,
and you're refusing to take her to court.

387
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,290
Those are trifles.

388
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:07,166
I also have a recording
of the supposed execution.

389
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,080
Bastard.

390
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:11,881
I can also tell them you're negotiating
by threatening to arrest

391
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,418
her daughter and mother.

392
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
But between you and me...

393
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,133
you're too late for that.

394
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:23,883
Those three CNI agents
at Katipunan police HQ in Mindanao,

395
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,748
and the Spanish consul,
Mr. Leopoldo Gis Bornay,

396
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,833
arriving in Manila
to coordinate the operation...

397
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,378
Save the taxpayers' money,
and while you're at it,

398
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:37,578
- save yourselves the embarrassment.
- You love hearing yourself talk.

399
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,496
You're like a radio host.
Get to the point.

400
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,286
What do you want?

401
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:48,248
I need to be sure about the truce.
I have someone fighting for their life.

402
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,205
Your word isn't enough anymore.

403
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,080
Confirm it with the press.

404
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:04,705
And in order to prove your goodwill
and boost the morale of everyone inside,

405
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,171
including the hostages,

406
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,830
I'd like to ask for one more thing.

407
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,378
News of the truce
was all over the press in minutes.

408
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,958
The headline was good.

409
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,748
But the photo was better.

410
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,710
The police leaving us eight paellas,

411
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,580
14 loaves of bread
and two cases of wine.

412
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,130
It looked like the start of a party.

413
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,753
This smells so good.

414
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,503
But inside,
it felt like the buildup to a funeral.

415
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,790
What you don't see is usually
more important than what you do see.

416
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,125
And Gandía,
on the verge of screwing our lives up,

417
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:13,956
was invisible.

418
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:17,956
Stockholm and Rio swept the first floor.
There's no sign of him. Listen.

419
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,961
The basements are my blind spots.

420
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,878
Helsinki to the east basement,
you to the west.

421
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,830
Tokyo.

422
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:41,378
I've just lost the cameras
inside the bank. All of them.

423
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:45,745
You're on your own.

424
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:56,208
What we don't see affects our lives
much more than it seems.

425
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,958
Nurse.

426
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,171
Let's see how you're doing.

427
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,630
And to think I didn't trust you before.

428
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:21,995
Why not?

429
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,830
Because you're
from Palermo and Berlin's gang.

430
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,918
And because you act like an Iberian male.

431
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,625
Macho, but a big, strong fellow.

432
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,498
Built like a castle.

433
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,541
He's sensitive is what he is.

434
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,670
I'm going to give you a shot,
Nairobi, honey.

435
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:45,786
Another one?

436
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,171
- Can't you give her a break?
- They're antibiotics.

437
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
She's at risk of infection.

438
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,421
You're awesome, Paquita.

439
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,038
I told her to give me another shot.

440
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,003
Well, if it's on the patient's orders...

441
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:10,921
You know how I said...
I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole?

442
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,130
I'm reconsidering.

443
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,830
That was a very clear
declaration of your intentions.

444
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,460
Am I wrong, Paquita?

445
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:38,041
When you said that...
ten-foot pole thing...

446
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,253
you already had me.

447
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,415
Now I can picture you...

448
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,293
all dressed in white.

449
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,955
I do.

450
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,251
- Wait...
- The reception, the friends,

451
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:57,043
- the boozing...
- Don't get your hopes up.

452
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,208
You're not having your eighth kid with me.

453
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,833
What we don't see is also
what haunts us the most.

454
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:21,881
He's not here.

455
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,250
Because once the doubts start...
it's not easy to stop them.

456
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,173
Rio.

457
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,916
Why don't you have scars
from the torture?

458
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,833
You haven't even lost weight.

459
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,881
How did Gandía break free?

460
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,963
Why are you asking me that?

461
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,245
Because you lied.

462
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,210
You didn't tell the Professor everything,
and he said to be precise.

463
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,330
Why did you only tell me?

464
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:13,705
Why?

465
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,580
Why?

466
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:19,963
Why me?

467
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,165
Because there's so much shit in my head,
I can't sleep.

468
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,080
I didn't want to remember it
or be pitied even more.

469
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,746
I didn't want to describe

470
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,133
how I cried hopelessly in that coffin

471
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:35,038
and that the only thing I wanted
was to be in my bedroom

472
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,625
and to hug my mother,

473
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,208
who I thought would never know
what happened to me

474
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,501
because she wouldn't have
a grave to visit.

475
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,883
- Rio...
- I cried so much

476
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:46,078
that I had spasms
and hit my head on the coffin lid.

477
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,496
Sand fell into my eyes,

478
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,043
- and I kept crying.
- Stop.

479
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:52,251
Is that it?
Is that what you wanted me to tell you?

480
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,916
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

481
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,131
It's OK.

482
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:06,631
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,416
Easy.

484
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,206
It's all right.

485
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,960
No, it's not.

486
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,246
Sorry. I'm scared.
I don't know what I'm saying.

487
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,001
I'll make you trust me.

488
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:25,713
Rio.

489
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:29,963
What are you gonna do?

490
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,831
I'm going to kill Gandía.

491
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
You look for what you don't see.

492
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:43,376
But sometimes, you forget
the invisible might be watching you.

493
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,955
And then you're in trouble.

494
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,625
Yeah, that's better. Right, babe?

495
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,998
Now we're all cheered up.

496
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,633
Look at those faces.

497
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:21,708
No one else is going to rebel now, babe.

498
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,791
How wonderful!
What an amazing transformation

499
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,915
with a simple paella and a beer.

500
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,580
A round of applause for the bank robbers.

501
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:32,376
Stop screwing around
and shut the fuck up, now!

502
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,875
You have to let me go.

503
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,416
I smashed his head in.

504
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,130
Leave me here, tied up,

505
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,748
and it'll be worse than murder.
Free me.

506
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,205
Why would he kill you now?
He didn't before.

507
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,626
Don't worry.

508
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,920
We're looking for him now.

509
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:55,333
Great. You're looking for him.
That's good to know. Very good.

510
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,503
And it's also good to know

511
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,833
that they put you in charge
of the kids in the nursery.

512
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:06,711
What a wise decision, huh?
Who made that decision?

513
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,381
She chose Rio.

514
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,830
She chose the IT genius

515
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,996
to go hunt the most dangerous
professional killer in all Spain.

516
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,706
That's brilliant.

517
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:30,461
A traumatized little boy
who can't even bring himself to shoot.

518
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,630
And he's hand in hand with your ex,
crying in corners around the bank.

519
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,128
What a beautiful story.

520
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,503
He'll kill them, one by one.

521
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,793
When are you going to understand
that Tokyo's in charge?

522
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:49,035
This isn't about operating on Nairobi.
This is about survival, brother.

523
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,833
- Come here, moron, come here.
- What is it? What do you want now?

524
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,995
Listen, I know you really love Tokyo.

525
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,460
You've been through a lot together.

526
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,455
But do you think
she's the leader we deserve right now?

527
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,923
With your hand on your heart...

528
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,833
do you trust Tokyo?

529
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:31,036
You have to free me, brother.
You know it's the right thing to do.

530
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,583
You have to take me upstairs.
You have to free me.

531
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,078
Come on. Hey.

532
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:39,626
Shut up!

533
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,500
Matías, you're in charge.

534
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,745
Almost.

535
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,328
Rio!

536
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:55,416
- Where are you going?
- To kill that son of a bitch.

537
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,670
Rio, stop. I said stop!

538
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,378
Sorry about before.

539
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,380
I've got a lot going on.

540
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:12,495
But let me be clear,
I know you're an honorable man.

541
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,996
I know you'd never betray us.

542
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,291
Let's get that bastard together.
Let's go.

543
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,746
Hello, National Police.

544
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:57,583
This is César Gandía, head of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

545
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:00,376
I'm calling on
a Ministry of the Interior secure line.

546
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,918
Can you see that?

547
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,880
- Yes, it's a line from the Bank of Spain.
- Yes.

548
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,788
Get me the command center
outside the bank.

549
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,245
Top priority.

550
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:16,043
- Hello?
- This is a top-priority call.

551
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,665
- This is César Gandía.
- Who?

552
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,420
The governor's head of security.
Let me speak to Colonel Tamayo.

553
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,290
Yes, of course. Colonel!

554
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:29,326
It's the governor's head of security.

555
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,786
- Clear the room.
- Clear the area, please.

556
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,376
Colonel Tamayo speaking.

557
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,500
Colonel, I managed to break free.
It's Gandía.

558
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:41,583
- Where are you calling from?
- From the panic room.

559
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:45,126
I can monitor all their movements
with the internal CCTV.

560
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:48,878
I've cut all external connections
so they can't see us from outside.

561
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,668
I'm awaiting your instructions.

562
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:56,575
For now, remain inactive.
We have a truce.

563
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,538
What truce, Colonel?
How long is the truce?

564
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:04,003
There are more than 24 hours left.
I can't get out of it.

565
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,333
It's in the news.

566
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:08,456
In 24 hours,
these bastards will be in Singapore.

567
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:11,671
Let's launch a coordinated attack.
We'll take them by surprise.

568
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,630
It'll be over in ten minutes.

569
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,785
My hands are tied.

570
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,875
The Presidency doesn't want
more battles in Madrid.

571
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:22,876
Sir, I've got automatic weapons,

572
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,288
grenades, everything.

573
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,955
I won't wait for them to escape.
I haven't signed any truce.

574
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:30,131
Do you understand what I'm saying?

575
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,333
Officially,
I can only command you to wait...

576
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,706
even if that's not
what I'd like you to do.

577
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,826
What does that mean?

578
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:52,576
Whatever you do
will be considered self-defense.

579
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,416
There will be no legal issues.

580
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,420
If you eliminate them all,
you'd be a hero to me,

581
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,130
to the investigators,
and to the government.

582
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,746
Copy that.

583
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,880
Good luck.

584
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,291
The most important moments

585
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,075
are when we realize
there's no going back.

586
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,876
That you've crossed a line,
and there's no way back.

587
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,995
The point of no return.

588
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,540
Everything is about to change,
and you cling to the present...

589
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,075
as if you could stop the disaster.

590
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,173
How are you doing?

591
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,830
I guess it won't come as a surprise...

592
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,708
but we arrived in Mindanao,

593
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,171
and your mother and daughter
were no longer there.

594
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:43,876
I'd congratulate you...
but you know what?

595
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:46,881
I won't.

596
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:51,206
Because Rio,
before he went into the bank,

597
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,380
gave up all the carriers.

598
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:03,625
He didn't tell the Professor.

599
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,133
I was listening.

600
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,670
How quickly do you think
he'll give me your mom and daughter?

601
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,916
- Professor.
- Yes, Antoñanzas?

602
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:47,078
I know I shouldn't tell you this, but...

603
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:50,788
But what?

604
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:06,248
There will be casualties,
Tamayo's orders.

605
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,883
- In cold blood. It's a crime.
- What's going on?

606
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,285
Gandía, the head of security,
called the tent.

607
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:16,205
- He has a panic room and military weapons.
- Where is the room?

608
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:20,285
I don't know, but it has cameras.
He can see everything.

609
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:34,963
Tokyo.

610
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,498
- Tokyo.
- Professor.

611
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:42,383
Listen to me.
Gandía is armed. He has a panic room.

612
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,250
- What?
- He has a panic room.

613
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:50,293
He's watching. He knows where you all are.
Get everyone together.

614
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:54,205
Tokyo?

615
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:05,921
Tokyo?

616
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,828
Tokyo?
