1
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:42,798
Please...

2
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:52,516
Please...

3
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:39,808
-Careful.
-Yes, sir.

4
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,150
Were you shot?

5
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,193
No.

6
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,320
Get him out.

7
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,449
-You're scaring him.
-Out!

8
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:03,749
What happened last night...

9
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,542
someone pays.

10
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,713
We took care of Calderón,

11
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,091
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

12
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,845
Where the fuck were the guards?

13
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,015
Where the fuck were our men?

14
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,604
How the fuck did they know where you were,
Dad? How the fuck...?

15
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,901
We have a rat.

16
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:33,069
An informant.

17
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:36,198
They found my ledger.

18
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,660
Hey, what about Enrique?

19
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,414
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

20
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:34,005
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

21
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,219
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

22
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:46,017
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

23
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,323
-Hello?
<i>-Salcedo.</i>

24
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,368
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

25
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,703
<i>David.</i>

26
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:12,419
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

27
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,338
but I'm monitoring my radio.

28
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,884
-Have you talked to Enrique?
<i>-Why?</i>

29
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:24,556
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

30
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,642
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

31
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,604
Do you have any problem with that?

32
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:33,940
I'll find him.

33
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:35,984
<i>Good. Bring him in.</i>

34
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:38,194
<i>And Salcedo, you come, too.</i>

35
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:28,531
Did you find her?

36
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,285
Sure you don't want something?

37
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:35,080
-The <i>picada</i> here is the shit.
-You have what I asked for or not?

38
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,336
Pretty girl.

39
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,880
Long way from home.

40
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:03,858
I'm imagining the headline...

41
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:07,195
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle." Fuck.

42
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:15,078
-Thanks for the info.
-Wait.

43
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,958
I'm going to help you rescue
the Barbie doll.

44
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,629
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

45
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,176
They can help us.

46
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:34,139
They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

47
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,863
What's it going to cost?

48
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:52,031
Cheap.

49
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,910
You just have to make me a promise, Peña.

50
00:10:56,703 --> 00:11:00,456
When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list...

51
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:03,751
you pick up the phone and call me.

52
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:07,881
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

53
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:10,175
I see now.

54
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,188
To us, Peña.

55
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,650
Enrique!

56
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:30,653
Boss.

57
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,447
Open the door. Quick.

58
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,078
-Boss...
-What are you doing? Get in.

59
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:43,708
-What happened?
-David has been calling.

60
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,711
What for? He never called before.

61
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,881
-I wanted to talk to you first.
-Last night was a big fuck up.

62
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,801
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

63
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:59,432
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

64
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:02,769
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

65
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:05,897
I should just run, bro.

66
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,233
Like Córdova?

67
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,068
What? It doesn't matter!

68
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:13,404
Stay, run. It's the same fucking thing!

69
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,490
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

70
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,200
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?

71
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,702
Nobody is going to die.

72
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:23,957
But right now,
let's just get you to tomorrow, Enrique.

73
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,582
Why the fuck do I have to hide here?
I didn't do anything.

74
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:08,459
I know you didn't do anything.

75
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,713
This is David being an idiot.

76
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,342
But... trust me. Have some patience.
I'll handle it.

77
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:22,015
Jorge...

78
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,228
last week, when you told me
to not say anything...

79
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:31,774
-about the DEA and their safe house...
-Hey.

80
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:35,737
That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up? Okay?

81
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:36,988
Stay focused.

82
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:38,656
Sit down.

83
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:40,116
Sit down.

84
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,957
It's very important you do what I say.

85
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,084
Don't leave this room.

86
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,670
And don't call anyone.

87
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:55,840
Not your mother, your brother
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

88
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,346
Hey, look at me.

89
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,265
We'll get you through this.

90
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:06,976
I promise.

91
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,152
Thank you, Jorge.

92
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:18,946
Seriously.

93
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:28,456
-Jorge.
-Fercho, how's it going?

94
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:34,087
Don Miguel.

95
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:37,006
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

96
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:42,970
I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

97
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:45,098
but trust me, I'll find him.

98
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:48,059
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

99
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,811
He's a man we can trust.

100
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:54,023
The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.

101
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,443
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

102
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:01,614
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

103
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,242
I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

104
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,160
and we don't know them, David.

105
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,038
I find that funny, you know?

106
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:13,709
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

107
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,629
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge.

108
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:21,676
When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

109
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:25,596
Don Miguel, I've been investigating
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

110
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:31,936
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

111
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:32,979
Dad...

112
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:36,899
Dad, please.

113
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:39,152
It could be.

114
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,237
It could be.

115
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,823
But you know what, Jorge?

116
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:48,327
That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

117
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,622
Yes, sir.

118
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,961
Someone sang and I want to know
who the fuck it was.

119
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:02,258
Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

120
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,927
We fucking fix this once and for all.

121
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:28,701
Hi, fellas.

122
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:31,787
Hello.

123
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:41,380
Great machine.

124
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:45,718
You people know how to build
a fucking assault chopper.

125
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:26,634
Nice look, Berna.

126
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:29,053
You're coming on the raid?

127
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:31,055
Thanks, but no.

128
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:34,684
I'm coming to make sure all goes well
with our friends.

129
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,185
Look at me.

130
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:38,938
Do you think an important man like me...

131
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,608
is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

132
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,617
You don't know how to take a joke.

133
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,386
I'll go in.

134
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,138
Sure.

135
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,016
But they go with you.

136
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:38,289
What about you, brother?
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

137
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:41,167
Calm down, Gilberto.

138
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:44,170
<i>Franklin Jurado's in US. custody.</i>

139
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:47,340
You don't want to surrender,
and you let them get the goddamn ledger!

140
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:53,095
Since you were a kid, I had to tell you
what to do and what not to...

141
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,221
<i>You know what, Gilberto?</i>

142
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:57,391
Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.
Why don't you just shut up?

143
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:03,105
He's fucking lost his mind.

144
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,067
All these acts of violence
in the North Valley

145
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,277
are straining our friends' patience.

146
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:11,572
Any surrender deal's hanging by a thread.

147
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,491
Uncle Miguel has to see that.

148
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:15,951
I told him, no violence.

149
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,497
Is this all my fault?

150
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:23,501
Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

151
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,005
Franklin Jurado.

152
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:32,718
I need to reach out to Chepe. Or Pacho.

153
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,845
But how the fuck...?

154
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,932
There's no one else I can trust with this.

155
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:39,809
Let's see...

156
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:43,813
Dad.

157
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:55,658
Nicolàs...

158
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:01,706
I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

159
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,385
Hello.

160
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:17,513
Any news?

161
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,807
He has a girlfriend
on the other side of town.

162
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:23,185
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

163
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,148
Thanks.

164
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,442
I think I'll wait here.

165
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:33,612
You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

166
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:36,949
So now what?

167
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,454
Now you go to Toro Negro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

168
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,581
He'll give you an assignment
from my father.

169
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,001
Why didn't he call me?

170
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,088
I'm going to explain something to you.

171
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:54,258
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

172
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:58,679
Yes, sir.

173
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,683
Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

174
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,793
<i>Coming up to coordinates Kirk 5-7,
manoeuvrer incoming.</i>

175
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,775
Gentlemen. So good to see you again.

176
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,277
Third generation night vision goggles.

177
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:58,447
The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

178
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:05,120
Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

179
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:32,439
This one has AFCS.

180
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,775
And the 701 engine.

181
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,365
-Not like last time.
-Last time?

182
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:43,200
The CIA.

183
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:46,537
They had us out here hunting commies
on Christmas day.

184
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:49,415
-That's real dedication.
-It is God's work.

185
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,042
Merry Christmas.

186
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:12,605
<i>My dad trusts him, but... did you see him?</i>

187
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,982
<i>That son of a bitch looks nervous, right?</i>

188
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:18,152
<i>Never stopped adjusting the mirror,
staring.</i>

189
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:22,239
<i>I kind of love how much
this motherfucker hates me.</i>

190
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:27,161
<i>Our man in Bogotà confirmed
there must be an informant.</i>

191
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:31,540
<i>Salcedo has to be the one
the gringos are calling "Natalia."</i>

192
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:34,376
<i>I'm going to love killing
that motherfucker.</i>

193
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:38,047
<i>You know who else I am going to kill?
His arrogant wife.</i>

194
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:40,841
<i>I'm going to leave
those poor girls orphans.</i>

195
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:42,384
<i>Poor things.</i>

196
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,719
<i>You can adopt them.</i>

197
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:46,305
<i>You son of a bitch...</i>

198
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,403
Answer.

199
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,451
<i>This is Paola, leave a message.</i>

200
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,036
Hello, love, it's me.

201
00:24:09,203 --> 00:24:12,373
Paola, listen, I need you to call me back.

202
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,083
It's very important.

203
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,024
3 NEW MESSAGES

204
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:41,026
DELETE?

205
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:42,903
CONFIRM

206
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,405
0 NEW MESSAGES

207
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:38,167
Take me to where you stashed him,
Jorge Salcedo.

208
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:42,588
Stashed who?

209
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:46,258
Pallomari.

210
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:51,013
Are we taking him some-place?

211
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:56,310
I see.

212
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:09,114
What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

213
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:12,618
I have a business to run, Guillermo.

214
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:13,869
A meeting with who?

215
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:17,664
With Fredy. We're meeting a new client.

216
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:20,834
Fredy? Patricia,
the police almost caught Miguel yesterday.

217
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:24,213
For fuck's sake.

218
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,507
What's the problem?

219
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:28,967
You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

220
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:31,386
-No.
-No. What are you worried about?

221
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:34,473
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

222
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,558
Yes, but always within limits.

223
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:39,186
You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

224
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:42,898
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organization...

225
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:46,068
None of that matters, Patricia, none,
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

226
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,573
You're giving me a headache.

227
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:55,202
Listen to me.

228
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:59,832
My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

229
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:14,221
It's just a couple hours.

230
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:19,685
Call me if there's a problem.

231
00:27:40,164 --> 00:27:41,999
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

232
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:48,255
What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

233
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,842
Hope that we don't.

234
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:59,349
We'll need to be quick.
I have some-place to be.

235
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:04,897
The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

236
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:11,737
That's great.

237
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,364
When was the last time you saw her?

238
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:16,283
Eight years.

239
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:19,828
Eight long years.

240
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:23,665
Why so long since last time you saw her?

241
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:27,586
You know, she was abroad.

242
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,756
-In Japan.
-Japan?

243
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:33,175
Working?

244
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:37,888
She fucked a police captain.

245
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,349
Then tried to turn me in.

246
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:44,603
All these years, I've been hanging around
her parents' house

247
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,480
waiting for her to come back.

248
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,983
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

249
00:28:53,195 --> 00:28:54,279
She came back.

250
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:01,954
Beautiful day. Right?

251
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:06,959
How many tents, give or take?

252
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,711
I think around 20.

253
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,132
The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

254
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,302
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

255
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,764
Sun sets in three hours.

256
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:24,393
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

257
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,230
Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

258
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:30,774
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

259
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:34,069
Once the lights go, they'll use guidelines
strung into the jungle.

260
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:38,949
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

261
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:42,119
Once we find one of those ropes...

262
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,835
It's a fucking slaughter.

263
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:50,961
Berna.

264
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:12,357
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

265
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:14,860
Listen to me, Peña.

266
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,237
You want the girl...

267
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:19,948
there will be a body count.

268
00:30:20,115 --> 00:30:21,908
This is a war zone.

269
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:26,830
But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

270
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:31,960
I need to get her back.

271
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,840
Just to be clear...

272
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:40,719
something goes wrong...

273
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:44,848
you still keep your promise.

274
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:09,956
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

275
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,003
-Then I come in.
-Okay.

276
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:22,636
Pallomari.

277
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:25,722
Pallomari!

278
00:31:57,337 --> 00:31:59,506
He's not here, of course.

279
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:04,886
No luggage.

280
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,517
Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

281
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:15,439
You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.

282
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:19,401
Guess that's why he's the accountant.

283
00:32:19,568 --> 00:32:20,944
And not a thug.

284
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:26,116
Hey, Salcedo.

285
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:29,286
You'll need to find him.

286
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:31,955
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

287
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:33,039
I'll take care of it.

288
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,001
Let me know when you have him.

289
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,840
I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

290
00:32:43,884 --> 00:32:44,885
Sure.

291
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:49,556
Good luck then.

292
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:15,582
<i>-Hey, it's me.</i>
-Salcedo! Busy today.

293
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:16,583
<i>Listen...</i>

294
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,044
any chatter from Pallomari?

295
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:22,214
None I've heard. But we got him.

296
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:26,343
-Who?
<i>-Enrique.</i>

297
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:30,180
He called his brother, the idiot.

298
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:32,182
<i>David's on his way to get him.</i>

299
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,935
That's great news.

300
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,604
Miguel must be pleased.

301
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:08,593
-David?
-We <i>have him.</i>

302
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,388
Yes?

303
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:13,890
<i>He showed up at the house?</i>

304
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:17,561
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

305
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:31,658
You ever hear anything from Judy?

306
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,577
Not since you sold her out.

307
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:37,289
Who would've thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

308
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:39,958
They give you a nice place in Bogotà?

309
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:42,460
It's good.

310
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,045
You should see my house.

311
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:47,215
I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week. My wife loves it.

312
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,136
Your wife?

313
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,973
I'm a family man.

314
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:59,352
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

315
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,939
Guess catching guys like me...

316
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,943
makes it all worth it. Right?

317
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:17,746
Don't forget the suitcase.

318
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,165
Keep going!

319
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:23,376
Come on. Let's go! Assume position!

320
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:39,476
<i>Be advised, team: five minutes to LZ.</i>

321
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,393
Let's see how our new toys work.

322
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:09,858
Get ready.

323
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:51,524
Our guest of honour's arrived.

324
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,405
What's going on here?

325
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:05,121
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

326
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:21,888
Alpha in position.

327
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:24,015
Tell him what you told us.

328
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:29,813
Salcedo knew about the DEA.

329
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:34,025
You're going to talk to me like a man,
motherfucker.

330
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:35,735
Salcedo works with the DEA!

331
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:38,488
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

332
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:43,409
He knew where they were at
and he told me to watch them.

333
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:45,787
And he told me not to tell you.

334
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:55,088
<i>Charlie in position.</i>

335
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,301
Bravo in position.

336
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:04,681
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

337
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:06,766
<i>Copy that. We're going to push them out.</i>

338
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:09,686
<i>We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.</i>

339
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:12,856
Is that true, Jorge?

340
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,315
Tell me.

341
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:16,526
Tell me.

342
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:19,195
Are you working with the DEA?

343
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,867
Sir... it's true I've been successful
tracking the DEA.

344
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,661
But saying that I knew
where their safe house is, that's absurd.

345
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:27,829
That's absurd.

346
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:31,249
<i>Rotor ETA five seconds. We have visual.</i>

347
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,262
<i>FARC is on the move. They're going dark.</i>

348
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:49,767
<i>Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.</i>

349
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:57,567
Let's move.

350
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:00,403
They're about to kill me because of you,
motherfucker!

351
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,489
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

352
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:06,659
If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

353
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:10,997
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

354
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:12,457
You son of a bitch!

355
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:14,709
-Get off him!
-I'll kill you, motherfucker!

356
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:17,921
-Let it go, motherfucker!
-Sir, that bastard is lying!

357
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,965
What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, motherfucker!

358
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:22,216
Cut the bullshit!

359
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:30,016
<i>All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.</i>

360
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:34,062
<i>And don't be pussies. This is easy.
Get ready.</i>

361
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,356
<i>This shit is on!</i>

362
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,737
I'm tired of this, Dad.

363
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:43,780
Sir, no.

364
00:40:44,781 --> 00:40:47,450
David, please. What is this?

365
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:50,578
-Sir, I have no idea...
-Dad...

366
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,964
What the fuck is that?

367
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:10,098
What the fuck is that?

368
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:14,477
Is that you, motherfucker?

369
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,813
-No.
-What the fuck is that?

370
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:26,406
-What the fuck is this?
-I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

371
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:29,909
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

372
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:34,914
<i>Let's give those fucking guerrillas
a rain of bullets!</i>

373
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,875
<i>They're in the river! Give them lead!</i>

374
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:41,963
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

375
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,589
It's American high-end tech.

376
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,926
-Don Miguel, please.
-Shut up.

377
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:48,720
What the fuck does it say?

378
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:52,181
These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

379
00:41:52,348 --> 00:41:55,643
Motherfucker, you're going to have
my family killed dragging me into this!

380
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:57,937
It's not yours?

381
00:41:58,104 --> 00:41:59,147
It's not yours, Enrique?

382
00:41:59,313 --> 00:42:01,983
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

383
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,319
I swear on my mom
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel.

384
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:06,946
Can they track us with this shit?

385
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:08,573
I think so, sir.

386
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,866
Motherfucker!

387
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,494
-No.
-Don't move.

388
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,664
-Please! Don Miguel, no!
-Don't move.

389
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:19,542
No!

390
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:24,130
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

391
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,382
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

392
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:28,509
Don Miguel!

393
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:36,392
Look, Jorge.

394
00:42:37,185 --> 00:42:38,186
Your friend.

395
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:45,651
Stay where you are.

396
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:46,611
Put the gun down!

397
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:48,237
Don't move.

398
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:52,325
One more step and I'll...

399
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:11,594
The rat is dead.

400
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,270
What's wrong?

401
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:23,272
Start.

402
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,552
Yes, I know my signature.

403
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:38,890
-Hi'
-Hi, Dad!

404
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:39,849
Where's Mom?

405
00:44:41,184 --> 00:44:42,018
Jorge?

406
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:44,270
She doesn't want to see you.

407
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,230
Paola!

408
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,149
Paola!

409
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,775
Paola!

410
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:51,944
Have some respect. This is my mom's house.

411
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:57,033
What's going on?

412
00:45:00,912 --> 00:45:01,913
What is it?

413
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:06,500
What's going on?

414
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:09,337
Breathe.

415
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:15,176
What happened?

416
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:18,721
What's going on? Come here.

417
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:27,034
That phone doesn't work.

418
00:48:27,993 --> 00:48:29,620
Try number five.

419
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,131
You're Colombian.

420
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:42,383
Right?

421
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:45,219
I'm from Cali.

422
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:24,049
Yes?

423
00:49:24,216 --> 00:49:26,719
<i>It's been taken care of.</i>
