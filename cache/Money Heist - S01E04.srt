1
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:09,986
Son of a bitch.

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:11,778
You're dead, anyway.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,523
Alright.

4
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:31,479
Get on your knees.

5
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:33,469
No. No.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,200
<font color="#b20000">SATURDAY
12:30 PM</font>

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,320
Don't look at me.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Don't look at me.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,320
- Please, don't.
- Don't fucking look at me.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,120
Don't fucking look at me.

11
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:03,209
Oh my God!
Shut up!

12
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:05,947
<font color="#b20000">26 HOURS OF ROBBERY</font>

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,865
What happened?

14
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:09,118
Calm down, God damn it!

15
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:10,325
Calm down.

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,706
Keep it together, or
we won't get out alive.

17
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,720
You got to show
a little courage.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,993
Thank you.

19
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,455
Shut up, shut up.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,643
- Thank you.
- Be quiet.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,356
Tell them you killed me and
got rid of the body. I'll hide.

22
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,776
And where the hell
are you gonna hide?

23
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:44,852
In the second safe.

24
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:48,381
I have access. They can't get
in. Pretend that you killed me.

25
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,256
- Tell them you killed me.
- There's no fucking blood anywhere, though.

26
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:54,271
- Not a single drop. Don't you get it?
- Shoot me here, come on.

27
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:56,459
- Just shoot me here.
- Don't say dumb shit like that.

28
00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:58,225
You're fucking crazy!

29
00:01:58,257 --> 00:01:59,301
Come on, do it.

30
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,123
- Shoot me in the shoulder.
- Your shoulder is too close to your lung.

31
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:02,520
Not happening.

32
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:05,040
In the thigh, then. It
bleeds a lot. I've seen it.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,280
They stabbed my sister there,
she bled a lot. Let's go. Come on.

34
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:13,722
Bite my hand if you want to.

35
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:05,234
Two gunshots...

36
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,984
Do you have bad aim or do
blondes make you nervous?

37
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,291
It's not easy when she's
begging you not to kill her.

38
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,149
Why didn't you do it?

39
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,014
You're a fucking bitch, you know.

40
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:25,622
You don't want blood on
your hands, so you used mine.

41
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,120
If you ever put your hands on me
like that again, you're a dead man.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,444
There's a coal furnace in the
basement. Throw her in there.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,457
And afterwards, this mess needs cleaning.

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Paula?

45
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,643
Paula, sweety?

46
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,596
Where are you?

47
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,536
Where are you, Paula?

48
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:25,039
Paula, sweety!

49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,266
Paula...

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,239
"I don't live in Almazán but in Madrid."

51
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:38,247
"The bus that goes
downtown is the number 21."

52
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,459
"I have two daughters.
The keys are by the door."

53
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,577
I live with Raquel and Paula.

54
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,356
"I'll never go to a home."

55
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,060
"I have two daughters."

56
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:49,671
Paula always gets her way.

57
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,676
There's a restraining
order against Paula's father.

58
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,154
"Never let Paula go with her dad."

59
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:17,080
Yes?

60
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,240
Professor, I'm sorry.
Your time is up now.

61
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,379
I need to know
if you'll surrender.

62
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,843
What games did you
like to play as a girl?

63
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Uh, jump rope,

64
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,069
kick the can,

65
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,472
pin the tail on the donkey...

66
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,735
I played with dolls.
I was good at that.

67
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:42,880
I used to play cops and robbers.

68
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,076
Do you know it?

69
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:46,901
The idea was the cops
had to catch everyone.

70
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:48,552
If you got caught,
then you were out.

71
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,487
But I don't remember
a single kid giving up

72
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,028
before getting caught.

73
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,290
The kids at the schoolyard

74
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,548
aren't risking going
to jail for 8 to 16 years.

75
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,548
You're right. You're absolutely right.

76
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,595
And that's why I've talked to my partners.

77
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,600
We voted, and you know what?

78
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:10,748
We're very confident here.

79
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:13,560
In fact, we think we'll go
to prison for zero years.

80
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,653
Hi, this is Raquel.
I can't answer right now.

81
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,417
Please leave a message after the tone.

82
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,240
A lot of people are suffering.
What are you gonna to do?

83
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:30,621
Grab a pen and paper.

84
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,908
I need a truck

85
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,787
with 3 axles,
and an 18 ton trailer,

86
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,291
two tank trucks,
with propane to escort it

87
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:41,722
and the Malaika ship
with the Saint Vincent flag.

88
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,764
Sound familiar?

89
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,470
You seized it eight months ago

90
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:47,288
with 6,173 tons of cocaine.

91
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,560
It's at the military base in Ferrol.

92
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,560
Getting the green light for
your requests won't be easy.

93
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,352
For... logistic reasons and
safety concerns...

94
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:58,731
Picture this:

95
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,051
a building collapses

96
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:05,080
and there are 67 people inside.

97
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:10,403
Do you really think the media would agree
that you should have saved those people?

98
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:12,840

Look, inspector, let's be frank.

99
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,411
You only have two choices. One:
you come after us. Or two...

100
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:18,404
You save lives.

101
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:19,960
But I'm afraid
you can't do both.

102
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:22,570
You have one new message.

103
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,840
Mom, I'm done. I'm on my way.

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,971
To call back, press 1.

105
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,868
I'll make you a promise.

106
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:39,284
If you don't come after us,

107
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,129
I'll hand over the 67 hostages

108
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,771
safe and sound, once we
get to international waters.

109
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,509
And I assure you, it wasn't
my first choice. I hate the ocean,

110
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,236
and basically
everything about it.

111
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,626
Life don't always give you
an easy way out, does it?

112
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:02,255
I got a voicemail from my daughter
this morning, from this phone.

113
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,334
And I don't... I'm
Raquel Murillo's mother.

114
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,507
And I can't reach her.

115
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,576
Please, do you
know where she is?

116
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:10,600
It's an emergency.

117
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,419
We'll bring the truck
to get them out of hiding.

118
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,941
It'll be a lot easier on an open field.

119
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,400
We'll fill the trucks
with sleeping gas.

120
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,312
They won't leave.

121
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:23,996
How do you know that?

122
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,396
They opened the safe,
but they didn't want the money.

123
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:29,738
They waited for the police.

124
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,391
They began shooting.

125
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:36,592
They casually dropped two open bags,

126
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,520
scattering the money on the streets.

127
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,040
- So?
- They pretended to be trapped

128
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,063
so they'd get two days to negotiate.

129
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,689
But they meant to go in.

130
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:49,320
With a Browning machine gun,
masks, red overalls and God's will.

131
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,400
They activated the alarm
a few hours after going in.

132
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,520
And that's when they first opened the safe.

133
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,323
They used the money inside to make it look
like a robbery.

134
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:00,729
It was intentional.

135
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:02,263
The ambassador's
daughter is in there.

136
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,000
That's why he's not hesitating.

137
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:07,052
He's confident, because
everything is going according to plan.

138
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,440
But what better plan than to leave with
the eight million that's inside the safe?

139
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,269
They're printing their own unmarked bills.

140
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,160
- It's here, right?
- Yes.

141
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:25,462
Careful.

142
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:32,227
- It won't open?
- There's blood.

143
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,832
You don't have to wait
like the other one?

144
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
No.

145
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,640
There. let's go.

146
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,174
You can't go in.

147
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,760
I have a call for inspector
Murillo, Raquel Murillo.

148
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,779
- Alright.
- It's urgent and personal.

149
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,112
- It's an emergency.
- Step in.

150
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,602
Stretch out your arms.

151
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,680
Alright, follow me.

152
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,920
- There's an incoming call on the repeater.
- Record it. Now.

153
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,377
It's recording.

154
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:46,351
A civilian is approaching mobile command.

155
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:48,980
He wants to see the inspector,
he says it's urgent.

156
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,765
I'm sorry, officer, but I have
your mother on the phone.

157
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:59,000
I guess you called her from my phone.
Excuse me.

158
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,800
But I think it has to
do with your daughter.

159
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,542
- Yes?
- Sweety.

160
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
- Mom, what is it?
- Stop recording.

161
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,408
Paula left with her dad.

162
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:21,526
- He took her to lunch.
- What?

163
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:24,047
- He said it would be quick.
- Mom, what did you do?

164
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:26,680
- "They're not back yet."
- Alberto has a restraining order.

165
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,976
He only sees Paula every 15 days
and he can't come in the house.

166
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,056
- I don't know what to say.
- Stop recording, god dammit!

167
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,230
- We can't.
- Then turn it down!

168
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,437
Mom, mom.

169
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:39,040
- When did they leave?
- Two hours ago, I think.

170
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
Alright, wait for me there.

171
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:57,400
- What a setup you've got here, huh?
- Almansa, please escort the gentleman out.

172
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,661
The shots you heard came from
an encounter with the police.

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,675
Caused by a hostage who
chose not to follow my rules

174
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,440
and tried to contact the outside

175
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,588
using this cellphone.

176
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:41,301
And I wonder...

177
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,739
Since I have Miss Gaztambide's phone...

178
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,240
Whose is this, then?

179
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,560
Anybody recognize this ringtone?

180
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,291
What happened?

181
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:01,803
What?

182
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,412
We all heard the gunshots.

183
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,357
I'm asking you what
the hell happened.

184
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:08,402
Not here.

185
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,320
We said no victims.

186
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,992
She had a cellphone.

187
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,040
What do you think I would do?

188
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
Scare her, damn it,
not kill her.

189
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:17,114
Cut her ear off, in the
movies they always do that.

190
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,019
If she had told the police
who and where we are,

191
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:22,043
you'd be the one dead right now.

192
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,531
But at least you'd have your ear.

193
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Who pulled the trigger?

194
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:28,836
Denver.

195
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,007
He's too hot headed.

196
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,149
The Professor said there
wouldn't be any blood, it was a rule.

197
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,536
Yes, well, there's been a change in plans.

198
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,903
As to who controls the hostages.

199
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,075
Got it?

200
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:48,320
Don't get nervous, the public is on
our side and that won't change a bit.

201
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,566
We'll be gone by the time
they realize someone's missing.

202
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,080
We'll be very far away.

203
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,920
Does the Professor know? Huh?

204
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,390
Does he know that you broke
the main rule of the plan?

205
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:59,880
You're not one to talk here.

206
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,265
I mean, you almost kill an officer
cuz he shot the idiot you had sex with.

207
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,882
The Professor has to know.

208
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Hush, boy.

209
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:18,440
Call him, Rio.

210
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,075
No answer.

211
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:42,855
He can't control
everything all day in here.

212
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:46,451
He has to eat, get sleep,
go to the bathroom.

213
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,797
That's why in here I'm in charge.

214
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,654
To escape, we have
to be professionals.

215
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:54,290
Hey, what the hell is going on in here?

216
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,160
I could hear you all outside.

217
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,309
Berlin ordered a hostage killed.

218
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,467
Who did it?

219
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,720
Your son.

220
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,920
A thief is, by definition,

221
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,560
an arrogant optimist.

222
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,065
They think everything will work out,

223
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,480
but Moscow was the first to fall.

224
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,030
He was one of those decent
men who are trustworthy,

225
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:45,121
and look after you
and tell you bad jokes.

226
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,546
I thought he was sweet.

227
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,920
Hey, what is that?

228
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,791
Great song.

229
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,720
Do you know how music was first invented?

230
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,960
- No.
- On a train.

231
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,464
I think it was a
dad and his son,

232
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,900
his name was Patxi.

233
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,735
And the boy was worried about whether
the train was gonna stop in the right town.

234
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:14,065
And Patxi was a fat kid.

235
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:16,762
And he would go:
"Will it stop, papa?"

236
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:17,992
It will, Patxi.

237
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:20,579
- Will it stop, papa?
- It will, Patxi.

238
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,380
Will it stop papa? Patxi, Patxi...

239
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,336
So you and Denver?

240
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:30,280
You're like family
and heist partners?

241
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,120
Yes, we're like the Sharpener Duo,
but we're burglars. You know.

242
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,360
That afternoon

243
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:42,080
Moscow told me how he got
his son to join this insane heist.

244
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,908
My son shouldn't be here, you know.

245
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,402
But when the Professor
told me the plan, well,

246
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:50,004
I dragged him along.

247
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Hey!

248
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:05,886
Alright.

249
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,437
Hey.

250
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,037
Give me a hug.

251
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,110
You don't mind prison food, huh?

252
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:20,000
- Knock it off, this is just gas.
- Yeah, right.

253
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,387
And the saturated fat
they give you in there.

254
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,084
- Yeah.
- Give me a cigarette, huh.

255
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,866
I have it ready for you, pop.

256
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,993
What about you? How's life?

257
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,760
Pretty good. It's going.

258
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,816
What is it?

259
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:40,400
What are you talking about?

260
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,054
I'm excited to see you.

261
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:43,620
Alright, don't lie to me, son.

262
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,763
This is the sixth time and
you've never had that face before.

263
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,700
So what's going on?

264
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:53,171
I messed up.

265
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,247
Oh. What did you do?

266
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,868
It seems he'd lost 800 pills.

267
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,800
Of some Polish guy, a damned
drug dealer from Alcorcón.

268
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,436
Apparently, those bastards
stole them from his car.

269
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:08,699
And his boss.

270
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,368
He's a son of a bitch.

271
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,080
They start by breaking your legs,
and turning you into a cripple.

272
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,315
So everyone knows
you stole from the wrong guy.

273
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:26,225
Papa...

274
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:30,371
the deadline is tonight
and I don't have it.

275
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:33,308
I swear to God I don't have it,
they can look in my car,

276
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,677
They stole it, not me. I didn't
take it either. Pills make me sick.

277
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,675
And, since they were going
to smash his bones, you thought:

278
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll just print the money.

279
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,800
We've done every other crappy job:

280
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,682
furriers, savings banks, cargo vans...

281
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,684
And now... we need a big one.

282
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,531
And, if it works out, I'm
taking my son to a country

283
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,913
well, one we can't even pronounce.

284
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:11,223
Without Polish men, without
debts, to start from scratch.

285
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:15,050
And with a mojito and a nice beaches.

286
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:18,520
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

287
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,275
You're sorry. Can't you
see that we're mopping here?

288
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,840
Well, I left my notes, dad.

289
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,584
You got your notes,
son. Go on, leave.

290
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,240
I'll just be a second.
Let me through.

291
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,270
- Would you stop already?
- I left my notes...

292
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,557
- I have to study. I'm going. I'm going.
- Hurry, come on.

293
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,830
Moscow!

294
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Moscow, stop.

295
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,704
Last time, go back to your post.

296
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:01,960
What will you do?

297
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:03,800
Shoot me?

298
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,387
And who will be next?

299
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:08,577
Everyone?

300
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:12,277
Do that and you'll
be alone in this place?

301
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:42,814
Son.

302
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:49,822
You killed that woman?

303
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,880
Papa.

304
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,153
- I can't breathe.
- Papa.

305
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,261
Papa, what is it?

306
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:18,169
What is it? Is it
a heart attack?

307
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,804
Papa. Papa, what is it? No, no.

308
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:24,360
It's a panic attack.
Lay him down. Lay him down.

309
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:26,960
- Papa.
- That's it.

310
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,261
Laying on that bloody floor,
Moscow knew there wouldn't be any drinks

311
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,978
or a country they couldn't pronounce.

312
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:37,363
That he didn't save Denver from something,

313
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:41,843
He'd thrown him in a hole, from
which he would only escape in chains

314
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:44,349
or with a bullet in his chest.

315
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,212
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

316
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,091
Those gunshots that we heard...
Did they hurt anyone?

317
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,018
Just take it easy, all right?

318
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:58,442
Nobody got hurt. Okay?

319
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,683
We did it to prevent the
cops from coming in. That's all.

320
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:04,858
Ok, kids.

321
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,426
You heard him. Let's all stop
imagining the worst, alright?

322
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,793
Those men are...
they're thieves,

323
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:13,467
they're not jihad
or anything like that.

324
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:19,144
Mom.

325
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:21,551
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

326
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:28,056
- So, did you have a good time.
- I liked the rides.

327
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,499
Oh really, which one did you like?

328
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:33,574
I liked the boats. The boats that spin.

329
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,345
Oh, yeah. The boats that spin.

330
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:36,973
Look who's here.

331
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,352
Mommy! We went to the theme park.

332
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:42,080
It was so much fun, too.

333
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,356
Of course, sweety.

334
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:48,676
Mom, could you take her upstairs
to put the teddy bear in her room?

335
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,070
Of course.

336
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:54,080
Come here, honey.

337
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:56,627
I'll see you later.

338
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,640
You violated the restraining order.

339
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,200
Turn around. Up against the wall.

340
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,047
Raquel, I'm her father.
You can't keep me from Paula.

341
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:14,721
There's a restraining order. You're in
violation. Now, turn around and obey.

342
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,404
You already ruined my life.
Isn't that enough?

343
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:18,640
- I said turn around and face the wall!
- Hey!

344
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:21,611
Really?

345
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:24,207
You're gonna point a gun at me now?

346
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:55,757
Yes?

347
00:24:55,782 --> 00:24:58,779
Raquel, this is Salva.
I'm calling you from the cafe.

348
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,123
You took my phone during all the commotion.

349
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,018
Raquel?

350
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Papa. Papa.

351
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,440
How are you feeling?

352
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:12,588
It's cold.

353
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:13,331
Cold?

354
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,759
- Bring a blanket.
- Yes.

355
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:16,080
And something sweet.

356
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:17,520
Let's go, Helsinki,
go get sugar.

357
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,800
Don't just stand there.

358
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,477
I don't know what happened.

359
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:25,312
I guess it's because I've

360
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,443
been digging all day.

361
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,765
And all I had to eat was
one of those stale sandwiches.

362
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,828
You should rest, Papa. Rest.

363
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:42,095
You know what you need right now?

364
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:44,397
A nice stew, the kind you like.

365
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:47,131
With lots of chickpeas and pork.

366
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,665
Here you go, Moscow.

367
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:54,065
Four angels
watching over you bed.

368
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,960
Two at the foot
and two at the head.

369
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,235
Just relax, okay?

370
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,675
What are you doing here, Papa?

371
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,078
I wake up at 4:00 in the morning
and you're not in bed.

372
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:26,160
It was nothing, I couldn't sleep, so,

373
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:28,920
I came out to look at
the stars for a little bit.

374
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:30,680
The stars...

375
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,320
The sky is so big.

376
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,320
Where do you think it ends?

377
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,680
- What is it?
- Nothing.

378
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:46,973
- You know why I left the mine?
- Of course I do.

379
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:50,085
Because of what was eating your lungs.
The "synphilis."

380
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,815
The "synphilis"?

381
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,472
- What?
- You're so dumb.

382
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,160
- It's silicosis.
- Whatever.

383
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,840
But that's not why.

384
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,671
It's because I had claustrophobia.

385
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
- You?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,920
I couldn't stand
being in that little hole.

387
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,160
That's when I started with the
robberies to get out of that hole.

388
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:18,480
Then I ended up in jail. Trapped.
Like I've always been.

389
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,766
Are you alright, Papa? You seem weird.

390
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Weird? No.

391
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,771
I feel amazing, outdoors,

392
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,760
here, in the country.

393
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,752
I'm not worth it.

394
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:36,718
I don't deserve all of this.

395
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:37,808
We're doing great here, right?

396
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:38,431
Yes.

397
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,803
And we'll be even better
when we leave. I know it.

398
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,320
Screw the Maserati and the gym, okay?

399
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,819
You know what we're gonna do?

400
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:49,366
We'll buy an island.

401
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:53,429
That way you can sleep
naked under the palm trees.

402
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,360
In a hut. Or you in
one, and me in another.

403
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:56,978
Yeah.

404
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:59,152
No more sleeping
together, because you snore.

405
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,139
What are you
saying? I don't snore.

406
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:03,839
Papa, you snore so much, I'm telling you.

407
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:06,360
- I do not snore.
- Oh yes, you do.

408
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,285
- I don't snore.
- You sound like a buzzsaw, Papa.

409
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,265
Here you go.

410
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,716
There. It's okay, Papa.

411
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,520
We'll let him rest.

412
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,600
Finish cleaning the bathroom.

413
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,000
And then trade with Helsinki
watching the hostages.

414
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Hello.

415
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:02,095
I'm sorry. I'm a mess.

416
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,220
No, don't worry. Besides, I
don't think anyone called me.

417
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,850
Look, not even a sad text. See?

418
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,940
Of course not.

419
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,908
Forgive me, it's none
of my business, but...

420
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,020
is everything okay
with your daughter?

421
00:29:20,145 --> 00:29:20,786
Okay.

422
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,141
I stole your cellphone,
I searched you, I nearly arrested you,

423
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,360
and you still worry about me?

424
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,488
Look...

425
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:31,400
you took the phone
accidentally, and...

426
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,866
you were nervous, and all that.

427
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,288
And as for the search...

428
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,611
It was fun. What can I say?

429
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:39,760
It was exciting.

430
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,400
"The recorder. Where is it?"

431
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,800
- My arm was like that...
- I'm so sorry.

432
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,226
- I'm sorry.
- Antonio was petrified, I swear.

433
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,280
But then you turn around and
invite me here. So we're even.

434
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:53,179
Everything's fine, thank you.

435
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,480
Good. Yeah.

436
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,575
We worry about so many things

437
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,040
and we shouldn't, right?
In the end...

438
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,160
Actually...

439
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:02,600
nothing is fine.

440
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:06,560
No. Everything is bad.

441
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,339
In fact...

442
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:10,698
It couldn't be much worse. No.

443
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm sorry, but... I...

444
00:30:17,244 --> 00:30:20,294
It's just, the emergency...

445
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,080
my ex-husband had just taken my daughter...

446
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
There's a restraining order
against him due to abuse.

447
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:30,560
Thank you.

448
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Thank you.

449
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:01,840
I got stuff to help you.

450
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,880
- Does it hurt a lot?
- A bit.

451
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:06,904
Let's fix that tourniquet, alright?

452
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,563
Alright.

453
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:12,298
Come on.

454
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,200
Maybe you should...

455
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,040
- Alright.
- Be better.

456
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Need help?

457
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:31,683
Slowly.

458
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,152
That's it. That's it. That's it.

459
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,667
Okay.

460
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:49,761
There.

461
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,692
Careful.

462
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,451
Okay, that's it.

463
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,760
Oh, man.

464
00:32:05,738 --> 00:32:06,632
What's that for?

465
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,899
We should really remove the bullet.

466
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,657
No. No, there's muscles and bones.
It's no good. You can't.

467
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:18,040
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

468
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:20,197
- How will you get it out?
- I'll use this.

469
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,520
- You can't use that.
- I'm telling you, we need to get it out.

470
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:26,802
No. Some people have bullets
in them and they're alright.

471
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:29,240
I saw it on TV.
It's fine.

472
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,513
- Alright, alright, alright.
- We leave it in.

473
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:34,920
Let's stop the bleeding
and then we'll see, okay?

474
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
- Alright?
- Yes.

475
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
That's it.

476
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:46,048
Easy. Easy.

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,395
I'm almost done. I'm
almost done. Hold on.

479
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:07,040
Just like when we were kids, right?
You know, playing doctor.

480
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,364
Alright.

481
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:14,040
Okay.

482
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:15,080
I have enough antibiotics
for a whole boarding party.

483
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,484
Painkillers, muscle relaxers...
Everything.

484
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:19,395
Isn't that bad?

485
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:22,400
See if it has any side effects.

486
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,827
Well, more side effects
than a gunshot wound?

487
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,240
The baby, you know.

488
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,083
Right.

489
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,843
Okay.

490
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:38,533
I'll uh...

491
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,131
read the instructions
then we'll decide from there.

492
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,571
Is that okay?

493
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:49,962
Let's see.

494
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,320
"Read the entire leaflet
before using this product."

495
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:56,800
"Save this leaflet in case
you need to refer to it again."

496
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,716
"If you have any questions,
ask your doctor or pharmacist."

497
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:05,360
"This medication has been..."

498
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:51,691
Oh man.

499
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:22,537
No.

500
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Hey. Any more noodles?

501
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,480
Noodles, no. I have rice.

502
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:43,227
That's fine.

503
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,723
Moscow.

504
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
What's he doing?
Moscow!

505
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:58,293
Moscow, what are you doing?

506
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,880
What are you doing? Hey!

507
00:37:00,623 --> 00:37:02,297
Where are you going?
Wait!

508
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,015
What is this? What's wrong?

509
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:05,885
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

510
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,299
Don't open the door!

511
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:08,640
Moscow!

512
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,978
- The doors are opening.
- Alright. Heads up.

513
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:16,760
- Go, Go, Go!
- Go to the main entrance!

514
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,162
Stop!

515
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,217
Snipers on the ready.

516
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,480
- Alpha 1 ready.
- Alpha 2 ready.

517
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,677
Everyone! On the ground!

518
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,280
Get on the ground now!

519
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,023
I have a clear shot.
On my count.

520
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:35,693
- Three, two, one.
- Papa!

521
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:38,120
Cover your face! Cover your face!

522
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:39,891
- He's not wearing a mask.
- They're fighting.

523
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,255
- No, papa.
- I have to get out.

524
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,320
- Come on, tape it.
- I can't see their faces.

525
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
- I have to get out.
- What! Why?

526
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,920
Waiting for the green light!

527
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,357
It's my fault. You
shouldn't be here.

528
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,520
You shouldn't
have killed anyone.

529
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,811
- Awaiting orders.
- Give me the green light.

530
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:01,169
You were gonna surrender
to take the fall for me.

531
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:03,467
We don't know if it's a
fight. We're waiting, sir.

532
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,864
- I have to get out.
- I didn't kill her.

533
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:11,237
I didn't kill her.

534
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:12,962
She's alright.

535
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:19,600
The doors are closing, sir.
Three seconds.

536
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:21,211
Everybody stand down.

537
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
God dammit.

538
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:31,858
- I need some air.
- We'll go out, papa.

539
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:33,800
We'll go outside, so you
can get some fresh air.

540
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:35,240
- I need some air.
- Okay.

541
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,160
I'm so sorry you had to go through...

542
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,234
something like that.

543
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:51,164
I mean, uh...

544
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:54,783
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help you out,

545
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:56,840
 I can get you a...

546
00:38:57,227 --> 00:39:00,600
A new cellphone, or a
bodyguard with sunglasses...

547
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,212
Forgive me. I shouldn't
be making jokes like that.

548
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:06,490
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry.

549
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:07,861
I look at you and...
it just doesn't add up.

550
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:10,376
It doesn't make sense.

551
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,171
You're not what
comes to mind when...

552
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,563
I know. A battered woman, is that it?

553
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,439
Why? Because I have a gun?

554
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:24,371
Yeah,

555
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,975
the reality is that...

556
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,495
it doesn't always
start with a hit.

557
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:33,971
If it did, no one would
be with a violent guy.

558
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,180
Actually,

559
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,691
You...

560
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,190
fall in love with a guy

561
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:44,716
who is sweet, intelligent...

562
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,400
you feel like you're
the center of the universe.

563
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,657
And when he asks you to change

564
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:53,693
the photo on your profile
for one of your daughter,

565
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,437
you think it's so cute.

566
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:00,605
And when he tells you not
to wear a miniskirt to work,

567
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:01,824
you think...

568
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:05,739
I'm a woman working
in a man's world,

569
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,972
he's actually being
protective, you know.

570
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:15,280
And then one day...
he yells at you...

571
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,840
- You don't have to tell me all this.
- Yes, yes. I have to.

572
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:22,214
I mean, it's like...

573
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:25,517
It's like going down one step at a time

574
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,192
Like in those scary movies

575
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:29,860
and when someone goes downstairs

576
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:33,115
and everyone goes:
"Don't go down. Don't."

577
00:40:34,094 --> 00:40:34,727
Yeah.

578
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:35,720
But you do it.

579
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,640
That's when the hitting first started.

580
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:44,265
And then the second time,
and then the third...

581
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:48,022
And then we got a divorce.

582
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,621
But you didn't report it?

583
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:58,000
No. He's a cop and...

584
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:01,808
he was the most
popular guy in the district.

585
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:03,800
I thought I better just leave.

586
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,390
I suppose that

587
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:11,832
I was embarrassed of
sitting with my boss and

588
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:16,347
telling him about a year and a half
of humiliation and blows.

589
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:20,940
I have a 9mm out in the car, but...

590
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:25,029
the truth is I have no idea
how to take care of myself.

591
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,387
Don't say that.

592
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,448
But...

593
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:33,480
the real problem was
a few months later.

594
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:38,133
Because my sister
fell in love with the guy.

595
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,893
and they started
dating, and traveling.

596
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:49,640
And then I reported him,

597
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,650
late and without proof.

598
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:59,960
Because I didn't want my sister
to go through all that hell.

599
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:01,864
You know?

600
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:06,643
But, of course, I
ended up looking like

601
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:09,860
a jealous pyschopath
making false accusations

602
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,213
The agent who
didn't report him until..

603
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:16,675
after he started dating her sister.

604
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,864
But, Raquel, the police

605
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:24,260
or the judges have to believe
you, it's impossible not to.

606
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,332
I can feel your helplessness.

607
00:42:27,357 --> 00:42:28,825
There must be someone who can help you.

608
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,840
- Yeah, right. Who can help me with this?
- Me.

609
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:37,634
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I can do, but...

610
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:42,960
Thank you.

611
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:47,562
Raquel.

612
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:51,120
- Raquel.
- Ángel.

613
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,455
There's been movement.

614
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,378
The door opened for a few seconds
and there was some kind of fight.

615
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,512
- We think it's a hostage.
- Let's go.

616
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,680
Look, I want you to know
this isn't a threat,

617
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm asking you this as a
personal favor, not as a thief.

618
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:22,040
I want you to put your
masks and hoods on

619
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,059
and go out on the roof
without doing anything stupid.

620
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,179
Just for 10 minutes, alright?

621
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:30,600
Go out, get some air
and go back in, all right?

622
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:36,268
What do you want, to distract the cops?

623
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:37,840
They're already distracted,

624
00:43:38,037 --> 00:43:40,122
so stop it and don't get everyone riled up.

625
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:44,609
The bait. They want us to be the bait.

626
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:45,792
What are you saying?

627
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,600
They'll throw us to the
lions while they escape.

628
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:50,900
We're doing this out
of kindness, got it?

629
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:54,132
One of our partners
needs some air,

630
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:56,378
and I won't tell you
again, motherfucker.

631
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:00,000
Relax, it'll be okay.

632
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,864
What kind of world
do we live in here?

633
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,700
Nobody's willing to do
anything for anyone?

634
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,081
Our partner had an
anxiety attack

635
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:13,520
and you're only thinking
about yourselves as bait.

636
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:15,800
It'll be alright.

637
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,843
Everything wil be fine,
because I'm coming with you.

638
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,179
Why did he have an attack?

639
00:44:22,512 --> 00:44:24,163
It was because of the gunshots, right?

640
00:44:24,188 --> 00:44:25,926
It was because of
the damn gunshots

641
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,651
Who did you kill?
Who did you kill?

642
00:44:29,744 --> 00:44:30,962
Open your mouth, Arturo.

643
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,619
Open your damn mouth, Arturo.

644
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:37,856
Open it.

645
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,987
Now raise your left hand if you're
going to keep busting my balls.

646
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,221
And if you're going to shut the fuck up,
then raise your right hand instead.

647
00:44:51,552 --> 00:44:52,146
Good.

648
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,196
Come on, put it down.

649
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:56,916
Put it down.

650
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,040
Stop fooling around, I'm begging you.

651
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,080
- Wasn't a hostage.
- Why do you say that?

652
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:10,029
Because, unless they're saints,

653
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:12,236
they wouldn't let them go to
the door without shooting them.

654
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:15,320
I'd say he wanted to surrender.

655
00:45:19,677 --> 00:45:20,917
There you go, papa.

656
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,114
Get some air.

657
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:27,826
You don't have to do this for me.

658
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:32,247
I remember when mom left,

659
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,407
you had trouble breathing,

660
00:45:35,714 --> 00:45:38,050
you would go out on the
balcony every night for air.

661
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:40,760
So pretend that you're
going out there right now.

662
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:43,800
You'll get some air and when
you're feeling alright, we'll come back.

663
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,824
Everyone put your
masks and hoods on.

664
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,570
Arturo, you're next to me.

665
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:02,680
This is Condor 3 to headquarters.
We have movement on the roof.

666
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:07,197
Suárez, tell your snipers
to get ready to act.

667
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,095
Condor 1, everyone ready?

668
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,036
Ready. We have a visual.
They're walking.

669
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:15,716
Dad, calm down.

670
00:46:15,919 --> 00:46:16,568
How?

671
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:18,087
Look, at this beautiful day.

672
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:21,320
- Sure.
- Look at the sun.

673
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:23,117
Just breathe and relax.

674
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,987
It's a big group. They're still walking.

675
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,587
They're headed to the ledge.

676
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,883
Yes?

677
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:33,805
What are they doing out on the roof?

678
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:35,990
Moscow went out for some air

679
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:37,918
with hostages holding fake guns.

680
00:46:38,238 --> 00:46:41,800
As you know, I never
would have permitted this,

681
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,794
but actually my
partners are all telling me

682
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:46,504
that it was a very good idea.

683
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,972
I don't want any
improvisations.

684
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:50,429
Keep me informed.

685
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,099
They're still moving. They're
getting closer to the ledge.

686
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:56,824
If you don't keep a cool head,
you can forget about the money

687
00:46:56,848 --> 00:47:00,000
Acapulco and the kids,
because you'll ruin all of it.

688
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,000
You only had to do one thing:

689
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:04,917
act professionally.

690
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,560
This doesn't look professional, huh?

691
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:11,415
Well?

692
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,568
Beautiful.

693
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:14,693
No, not beautiful.

694
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:17,517
It's even better than
the ones the banks have.

695
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:19,760
You can't even trace it.

696
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:22,802
This is a work of art, okay?

697
00:47:23,973 --> 00:47:25,024
And do you know why?

698
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:26,867
Enlighten me, Nairobi.

699
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,323
Because I was slow and purposeful.

700
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,520
Just like a professional.

701
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:39,680
What I don't know

702
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,307
is what to do when one of us
stresses out in the middle of it.

703
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:44,483
Act like you don't care.

704
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:46,760
Huh, Berlin?

705
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,003
Like you're not human.

706
00:47:52,987 --> 00:47:54,971
Well, it's easy for an asshole like you

707
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:58,417
but I... wouldn't know.

708
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:07,640
- You didn't kill the girl, right?
- No.

709
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,741
- Tell me the truth.
- No!

710
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,853
Berlin found a phone,

711
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:17,335
he ordered me to kill her and I had
to shoot her, I didn't have a choice.

712
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,483
You're talking about Mónica.

713
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,856
Stay out of this.

714
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,490
What did you do to Mónica? Where is she?

715
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:23,947
Step back.

716
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:26,120
This is not a courtesy call, Professor.

717
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:29,099
If you want me to be honest
and not hide things from you,

718
00:48:29,124 --> 00:48:30,206
you should do the same.

719
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,494
Everyone has a right to
stretch their legs, inspector.

720
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:37,459
Don't you think it's nice of me to
let the hostages out for some air?

721
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:41,433
I don't want to hurt
anyone or scare anyone.

722
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:44,800
I want to return them safe and sound.

723
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:47,520
As soon as I get what I want.

724
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:51,453
That's all.

725
00:48:51,758 --> 00:48:54,860
They're armed, take cover.
I repeat, everyone take cover.

726
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,059
Requesting orders.

727
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:57,403
What the hell did you do?

728
00:48:57,428 --> 00:48:58,480
- Calm down...
- Where is Mónica?

729
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,320
- Tell me what happened.
- Shut the fuck up.

730
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:03,627
Something's happening.
Requesting instructions.

731
00:49:03,688 --> 00:49:06,922
You killed Mónica, God dammit.
She was innocent.

732
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:10,040
This is Condor 1. I have a
visual. Requesting permission.

733
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:11,560
- Get on your knees.
- What?

734
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,736
She was pregnant.

735
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:14,104
Dammit, snipers.

736
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:16,043
Let them think that
we're hostages. Hands up.

737
00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:17,944
Don't mess with me, get up.

738
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:19,171
I'm talking to you.

739
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:21,506
Something is happening.
They're kneeling down, sir.

740
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:23,896
They're gonna
execute them up there.

741
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:25,155
I need orders.

742
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,203
There are snipers.
Get down. Get down.

743
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:29,548
Get down. Get down.

744
00:49:30,415 --> 00:49:32,800
Where is Mónica?
Tell me what happened to her.

745
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,543
- There's movement.
- This is Condor 3.

746
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:37,196
The suspect is pointing his weapon.

747
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:40,880
- I can see him clearly.
- Requesting instructions.

748
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,619
- I need authorization.
- They're still kneeling, sir.

749
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,692
- Awaiting orders.
- Awaiting orders.

750
00:49:45,835 --> 00:49:48,579
- They're gonna execute them.
- I have a visual on the kidnapper.

751
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:50,226
- There are snipers.
- What have you done?

752
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:51,961
Tell me what happened to Mónica?

753
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,338
- What the fuck have you done?
- They're pointing at each other.

754
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:56,708
- Give me the green light.
- They're going to execute them, sir.

755
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:58,081
Requesting permission.

756
00:49:58,106 --> 00:49:59,920
Get down!

757
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
Do it then.

758
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:05,240
Condor 3, open fire.

759
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:06,532
Arturo!

760
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:21,360
Target down, sir. Target down.

761
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:22,379
Target down.

762
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:23,715
We have a visual.

763
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,813
Damn it. He's the factory
director, Arturo Román.

764
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:29,920
- Hold your fire.
- Condor 3, hold your fire.

765
00:50:30,178 --> 00:50:31,459
Tell all the units.

766
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:36,349
We hit a hostage.
