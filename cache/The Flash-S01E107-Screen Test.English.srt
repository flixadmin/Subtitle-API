1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,546
You're gonna run over there,
you're gonna come back at me...

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:05,839
...and get hit with an arrow.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,050
-No, I'm not.
-Heh, heh.

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,760
Ready?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,227 X1:0
I think I may be the fastest man alive.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,898
BERLANTI: The purpose of the screen test
was to see if somebody could come in...

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,817
...to a moving train that was <i>Arrow</i>
and be the Flash.

8
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,987 X1:0
It was a real burden
for someone like Grant to bear.

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,238 X1:0
Because you have to come on...

10
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,866
...and you have 75 years of history
of this character that everybody knows.

11
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,953
You have to feel like there's a whole show
behind you that could happen...

12
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,703
...and we'd be interested.

13
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:47,504 X1:0
I broke the sound barrier.

14
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:50,382 X1:0
I mean, air couldn't get out of my way
fast enough.

15
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:52,758 X1:0
My clothes caught fire.

16
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:56,595
From the second Grant came in on his own,
we kind of knew he was Barry.

17
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:00,057
And not because he looked obviously
like Barry from the comic book...

18
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,392
...because he kind of didn't.

19
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,229
And not because he felt old enough
as the part we were imagining in our head...

20
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,981
...because he kind of wasn't,
but he had the heart.

21
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:10,817
And Grant had the acting chops
to carry this role.

22
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:14,487
All my life I've wanted to just do more.

23
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:17,197
What if I'm not a hero?

24
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:20,909 X1:0
When you're making a pilot,
every milestone means the world.

25
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:23,912
Like, it's-- When you pitch it,
when you finish the script....

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,623
Every step along the way feels so huge.

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,918
And we felt strongly
that if Felicity loved Barry Allen...

28
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:31,795
...the audience would love Barry Allen too.

29
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,590
Because the audience trusts and knows
and loves Felicity.

30
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:36,967
-Who are you?
-Do your parents know that you're here?

31
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm Barry Allen.

32
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:44,391
I'm from the Central City Police Department.
I'm with the Crime Scene Investigation Unit.

33
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:47,603
-What did you say your name was again?
-Barry. Allen.

34
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,313
Felicity. Smoak.

35
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,816
You can't predict or count on chemistry.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,527
And there was just magic between them.

37
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:58,405
I was serious about not being able to dance.

38
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:02,117
But I'll hold your hands and sway.

39
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:04,077
Sold.

40
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:07,456
KREISBERG: Emily Bett Rickards
was generous enough to let us fly her down...

41
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:11,627
...and do the screen test, and you could
just see it between the two of them.

42
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:13,128
They just had chemistry.

43
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:15,380
It's hard to talk about, because it's--

44
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:18,800
If it was quantifiable,
everybody would be doing it.

45
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,970 X1:0
The vigilante. I read that he saved you.

46
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,929 X1:0
What is he like?

47
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:27,058 X1:0
-He's green.
-He's green. It's interesting. Right?

48
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,392 X1:0
Why green?

49
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,811 X1:0
Black would be better for stealth
and urban camouflage.

50
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:36,359 X1:0
Me personally, I think that he trained in
some sort of forest or jungle environment...

51
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,486 X1:0
...and the green is a nod to that.

52
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,614 X1:0
I don't give the vigilante much thought.

53
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:47,702
-Why are you so interested in the vigilante?
-When I was 11, my mom was murdered.

54
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:51,456 X1:0
They arrested my dad. Put him on trial.

55
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,625 X1:0
And I told the cops
that my dad was not the man...

56
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,543 X1:0
...that I saw running away from my house.

57
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,421 X1:0
But the court-appointed shrink
said I was too traumatized...

58
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:00,882 X1:0
...to be a reliable witness.

59
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,344 X1:0
He was sentenced to life in prison.

60
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,014 X1:0
The killer ended my mother's life...

61
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:12,769 X1:0
...but it was the law that ended my father's.

62
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,313
You could see in the words
and see in the actors...

63
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,482
...and see in the chemistry
and see in the world...

64
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:20,610
...that were even created
in that little bit of screen test...

65
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,529
...that there really was a show there.

66
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:27,200 X1:0
I'm not your stereotypical superhero.
I'm not one of the Hemsworth brothers.

67
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,827 X1:0
So, yeah, I....

68
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:30,953 X1:0
And the, you know--
The breakdown said:

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,622
"Late 20s to early 30s, blond hair."

70
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,333
I knew what Barry's build was
in the comics...

71
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,627
...and it wasn't something I was like,
"I'm gonna book this."

72
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:41,296
But it went my way.

73
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,215
I can't believe I have this opportunity...

74
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:46,969
...and this is happening to me, just as Barry
can't believe that this has happened to him...

75
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,721
...and he's now this superhero,
and he has this responsibility...

76
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,472
...and as Barry has become the Flash...

77
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,350
...I've become more confident with Barry
and with being the Flash.

78
00:03:55,517 --> 00:04:00,147
And it's been kind of a nice journey
for Barry and myself...

79
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:03,233
...to kind of have a little parallel journey.
It's been fun.

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,361
He really did feel like the kind of actor
you could build a show around.
