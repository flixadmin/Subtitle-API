he could lead us to Valeska.

other's backs tonight, right?

00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:04,530
I'll alert the press.

Stick with me here.

We both listened to Tetch on the phone.

182
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:13,506
What if he hypno'd us
into coming down here alone?

183
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,374
That would be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

184

How do I save them?

kept me from saving her.

You gave me no choice!

So no more choices for you, either.

for some supper.
