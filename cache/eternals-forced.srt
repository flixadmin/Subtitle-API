1
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,315
It's coming! Run!

2
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:15,986
Father!

3
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,154
Run!

4
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,368
Good fight.

5
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,828
You, too.

6
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,537
Do not fear.

7
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,790
Quickly, inside the gate!

8
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:01,457
The wonders of the world await you.

9
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,711
Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu into battle.

10
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,091
Be forever inspired
by their bravery and strength.

11
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,719
You and your fellow man...

12
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,764
...will go on great adventures.

13
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,017
And become legends of your own!

14
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,689
I needed to get enough artifacts
to make a good trade.

15
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,403
Just lie to her.

16
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,370
I can sense vibrations.

17
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,247
Even the tiniest movement.

18
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:28,044
Including your voices when you speak.

19
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,131
Did you two just waste my time?

20
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,176
The Emerald Tablet you're searching for...

21
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,344
...is a myth!

22
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,361
When humans have conflict,

23
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,906
Ajak tells us not to interfere.

24
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,998
If you don't tell,

25
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,500
I won't tell.

26
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
See you.

27
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,119
Let me help you.

28
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,066
You are very kind.

29
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,911
I am very beautiful.

30
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,017
May the gods hereby
bond you in matrimony.

31
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,269
Congratulations.

32
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,221
We had to split up.

33
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,237
Stay strong.

34
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,981
But she won't be Thena
anymore.

35
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,976
Welcome.

36
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,564
Legend of Ikaris

37
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,967
The world is ending.

38
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,594
You need to go home.

39
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,867
Good afternoon.

40
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,504
Hey. We're looking for Druig.

41
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:26,672
Is he here?

42
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:27,631
...Yes.

43
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,049
How do you know Druig?

44
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,968
We're friends...

45
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,303
...from college.

46
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,097
Miss?

47
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,557
You're ok?

48
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,625
What's happening?

49
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:06,006
Quit procrastinating, Phil, and take
care of your business.

50
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,705
Ready to go home?

51
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,025
So you mean...

52
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:16,405
I've been waiting for centuries
to go back to Olympia,

53
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:18,198
and now you're telling me...

54
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,117
...it doesn't exist?

55
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:23,537
And the world is ending.

56
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,331
At last my boredom is ending.

57
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:29,293
Have you seen my movies?

58
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,754
I don't have a DVD player.

59
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:01,742
Miss me?

60
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:05,996
Are you two...

61
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,877
Get ready for it.

62
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:15,399
So suppose Druig can, say...
put Tiamut to sleep--

63
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:16,692
Then what?

64
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:25,039
I found Tiamut.

65
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:25,766
Why did Sprite go with Ikaris?

66
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:10,728
We need you.

67
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:29,872
Thank you for all you've done...

68
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:33,209
...for humanity.

69
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:36,962
It's been a great honor.

70
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:41,509
I will miss you all.

71
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:10,246
You've never been able to do it before.

72
02:14:15,964 --> 02:14:18,466
By being connected to the Celestial
as it emerged.

73
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:34,023
We became one...

74
02:14:36,193 --> 02:14:38,945
...even Ikaris and Sprite

75
02:14:39,822 --> 02:14:45,159
all because of Tiamut.

76
02:17:55,309 --> 02:17:56,642
The kid is ten...

77
02:17:57,144 --> 02:17:58,602
...not stupid!

78
02:17:59,229 --> 02:18:00,269
When are you guys leaving?

79
02:18:47,277 --> 02:18:55,277
...because the truth will
set them free.

80
02:25:56,206 --> 02:25:58,248
It's been weeks.

81
02:25:58,416 --> 02:26:01,210
We haven't heard from any of them.

82
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,378
It's like...

83
02:26:03,546 --> 02:26:04,546
they've disappeared.

84
02:26:21,189 --> 02:26:22,397
I feel it, too.

85
02:27:04,274 --> 02:27:05,274
Thanos' brother?

86
02:35:10,092 --> 02:35:11,676
Death is my reward.
