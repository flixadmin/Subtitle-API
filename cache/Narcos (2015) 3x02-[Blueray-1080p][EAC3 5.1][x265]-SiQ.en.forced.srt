1
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,151
Careful. You already lost one.

2
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:26,365
Good.

3
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:30,118
-Faster, gentlemen, please.
-Yes, sir.

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,623
How's it coming?

5
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:36,708
This is fucking cool.

6
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,127
What did I tell you, motherfucker?

7
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,507
Stop fucking around.

8
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,676
I don't want to be here all night.
Understood?

9
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:46,885
Yes, it's all good.

10
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,637
Let's go.

11
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:52,307
Fucking idiot.

12
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:57,688
My dad had 20 years in this shit.
I only have six months.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,149
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

14
00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:07,447
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

15
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:10,158
How much fucking money
do you want to make?

16
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,660
A fucking lot.

17
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:08,920
Mrs. Salazar?

18
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,509
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

19
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,554
-Come back later, please.
-As you wish.

20
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:39,159
If you want something done right...

21
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,287
you have to do it yourself.

22
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,248
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

23
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:48,168
If you don't play,
you're going to watch others score.

24
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,590
My organization has four partners,

25
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:55,884
but only one leader.

26
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,929
I wanted to meet with you

27
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:02,933
to make sure there are
no misunderstandings in the North Valley

28
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,770
regarding the restructuring,
and the necessary house cleaning.

29
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:11,066
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

30
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,404
I will be honest with you.

31
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:18,824
Salazar never contributed a thing.

32
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,408
He never gave anyone work.

33
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,953
He made more noise than money.

34
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,747
Better said, too much noise.

35
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,005
We are moving forward with the plan,

36
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,968
and we would like to know
if our friends are in agreement.

37
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,389
Your message about the surrender
was very clear,

38
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:45,892
and was very well received
by all of us in the North Valley.

39
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:49,062
Have a safe trip home.

40
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:52,858
Henao... thank you for your friendship.

41
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:54,609
Excuse me.

42
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:58,822
Pacho.

43
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:05,370
Pacho.

44
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:09,416
Let's take advantage of this window
to maximize our profits.

45
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,168
I'd like to double our output
through Mexico.

46
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:14,129
Why don't you go there?

47
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:17,591
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

48
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,135
Make one last deal.

49
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:24,806
We both know that isn't the only reason
you're sending me there.

50
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:28,518
Pacho.

51
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:31,479
Look, Pacho...

52
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,775
I think it would be best
if you left Cali for a bit...

53
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:38,945
while things cool off.

54
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:43,742
Remember, Pacho, we're going
to walk away from this happy and rich.

55
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,927
WHAT IS THE DEA DOING IN CALI?

56
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,065
Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era?

57
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,691
Take a look.

58
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,694
-Just like the Cauca River, right?
-Identical.

59
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:11,407
Dad, where are we with the government?

60
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,039
They won't let us use the drug stores
as collateral for the Centenario property

61
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:20,333
until they're cleared through surrender.

62
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,585
I know, but eventually they will be.

63
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,842
And that's all you can tell me?

64
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:32,887
You know the rule.

65
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,515
You can't be a part of this.

66
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:38,434
I didn't send you to law school
so you could worry about our surrender.

67
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:39,561
That's already been planned.

68
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:43,606
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

69
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,901
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

70
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:51,656
You're reading it again?

71
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:55,160
You should read it once in a while.
Wise words.

72
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:57,453
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

73
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,123
You have a call
from our friend in the capital.

74
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:10,049
Hello?

75
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:14,888
<i>Four people, including three children,
are dead and thousands more injured</i>

76
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:19,809
<i>in a mysterious gas leak
in the area of Yumbo in Cali.</i>

77
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:22,145
<i>Investigators are at the scene
of the incident,</i>

78
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,857
<i>but have not yet discovered
the source of the gas leak.</i>

79
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:29,027
<i>State officials told residents
there will be a</i> formal <i>investigation.</i>

80
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:42,916
Silvio.

81
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:44,834
Can I burn a smoke?

82
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,551
Isn't it dangerous?

83
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,804
No more than it ever was.

84
00:11:57,388 --> 00:12:00,391
If it was a natural gas leak,
I want to know before lighting up.

85
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,855
Unless it's not.

86
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,651
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

87
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:12,153
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

88
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,116
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.

89
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,409
Off the record.

90
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,412
I don't know, Carolina.

91
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,082
Why don't you talk to him?

92
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:26,793
He is the district safety inspector.

93
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,879
He'll issue the report.
Why don't you ask him for a comment?

94
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,051
Silvio!

95
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:36,302
Excuse me.

96
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:37,971
Careful picking it up.

97
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,724
Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.

98
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,731
That's good. A little bit more.

99
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,569
<i>If they connect us to this,</i>

100
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:56,698
our friend doubts the government
will honour our deal.

101
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,867
We'll be seen as no different
than Escobar, killing women and children.

102
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,498
Months of negotiations and money
down the drain.

103
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,209
Just like the poison you monkeys dumped.

104
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:12,422
There's a reporter asking questions
in Yumbo.

105
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:15,300
And there's this safety inspector
in charge of the investigation.

106
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:19,345
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.
We have lots of reporters.

107
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:22,140
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

108
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,684
Dad, let me take care of it.
I said I would handle it.

109
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,187
You've demonstrated very clearly
that you can't handle it.

110
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,691
Take care of it. Discreetly.

111
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:35,028
Without any violence.
That's the last thing we need.

112
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:38,323
What? You have another bright idea?

113
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,418
That's why I didn't want our children
in the business.

114
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,297
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

115
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,844
Let go. Turn. Run.

116
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,389
You need to let out some string.
Careful with Grandma.

117
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:05,099
You see?

118
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,770
This is the bedroom.

119
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:10,897
No, sorry, Dad.

120
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,024
No, this is the living room.

121
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:14,108
The living room.

122
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:16,277
It's big, Jorge.

123
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,614
And the pool will go here.

124
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:21,991
And there, the kitchen.

125
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:24,994
And look...

126
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:29,290
Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

127
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,666
A jacuzzi?

128
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:37,298
I always thought your brother
would have...

129
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,051
the house on the hill.

130
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:44,639
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

131
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,060
What was the last one?

132
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:51,229
Bio-diesel.

133
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,190
Bio-diesel.

134
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,069
Vegetable gas?

135
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,321
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

136
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:01,906
Well...

137
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,326
Very good.

138
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:08,996
Better late than never.

139
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,166
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

140
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,711
-Thank you.
-Jorge, the girls are calling you.

141
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:17,004
Yes, I'm coming.

142
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:17,964
Paola.

143
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,468
You'll be very happy
when you build the house here.

144
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,680
-It's all very nice.
-Affirmative, General.

145
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:35,523
You impressed him.

146
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,985
I don't care what he thinks.

147
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:42,196
That's why you haven't told him
who you work for?

148
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:47,034
It was always temporary.

149
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,578
Temporary?

150
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:50,288
Right.

151
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:54,167
You know this lot is bigger than we need.

152
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,335
Yes, but it's the one we want.

153
00:15:58,296 --> 00:15:59,797
It's the one you deserve.

154
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:05,261
Six more months.

155
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:08,181
Okay?

156
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,224
I promise.

157
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,401
Go.

158
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,528
I'll go with your parents.

159
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,071
I'm sorry, honey.

160
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,571
<i>-Hello?</i>
-It's me.

161
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:06,697
<i>Chepe!</i>

162
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:10,284
-How's everything going, brother?
<i>-All right.</i>

163
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,871
We're about to beat
our profit record, brother.

164
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:17,041
Good. Keep me posted.

165
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,627
<i>You should be happy, Gilberto.</i>

166
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,838
<i>Chepe, do me a favour.</i>

167
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:26,008
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

168
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:31,639
I got a lot of stuff going on up here
at the moment.

169
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:35,601
I just need more ether
to reach the numbers we talked about.

170
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:38,104
<i>Why? Is everything all right?</i>
You sound weird.

171
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,232
I'm dealing with a problem
that is stressing me out.

172
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,067
It's our fault.

173
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,486
Actually, it's David's, the dumb-ass.

174
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:46,571
<i>Is it bad?</i>

175
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,489
I hope not.

176
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,242
<i>But it could complicate our surrender.</i>

177
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:53,494
Okay.

178
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:54,912
<i>I'll be careful.</i>

179
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,416
So good you're coming back, brother.

180
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,544
You'll leave behind the hustle
and shit of that city.

181
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,337
<i>It's not so bad.</i>

182
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:06,424
I love the trees in fall.

183
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,302
The park looks gorgeous.

184
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:12,597
<i>I love you, brother. Talk soon.</i>

185
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:14,015
Okay.

186
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:26,068
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

187
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,529
-I see. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

188
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,198
-Maria.
-Luisa.

189
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:34,076
What's happening? Claudio hasn't returned?

190
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,078
No. And Diego?

191
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:40,082
Diego dragged his drunk ass in
at six in the morning.

192
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,709
Okay.

193
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,002
-Bye.
-Bye.

194
00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:33,297
I got your message. What's going on?

195
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:36,926
We have a problem
with the fucking safety inspector.

196
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:38,719
He won't accept the money?

197
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,264
He has three crucifixes in his office.
Three.

198
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:45,768
Reasoning with him is impossible.
-I see.

199
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:51,982
Tell me, what the hell was David doing
with the chlorine gas?

200
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,276
Do you really want to know?

201
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,823
About a year ago, Don Miguel
and Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

202
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:04,537
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the US.

203
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:09,291
They don't check it at Customs...

204
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,752
because it's a poisonous gas.

205
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:18,467
So that's why David
spilled the gas in Yumbo?

206
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,016
We should let him clean up his own mess.

207
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:29,436
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

208
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:32,606
If the fucking inspector doesn't say
what we need him to say, we're all fucked.

209
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,111
Do you think they're going
to honour the pact?

210
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:39,196
Do you think there's really
going to be a surrender

211
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:41,156
between the cartel and the government

212
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:43,284
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

213
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,660
Never.

214
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,290
What do we know
about the safety inspector?

215
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,836
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,
his home and office addresses,

216
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:59,174
bank accounts, income tax, properties.

217
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,386
And the only thing we're sure about?

218
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,347
This motherfucker is clean.

219
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:13,856
There's no one clean in this world,
Córdova. No one.

220
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:18,527
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

221
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:21,405
Gentlemen!

222
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:26,243
We're going to put all our assets
on this man.

223
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,123
<i>We have to watch his wife, his kids,</i>
even <i>his fucking</i> dog.

224
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:37,338
We need to watch his house,
from the inside and out,

225
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:40,716
every single corner, 24/7.

226
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,512
I want to know what he does at work,
who he meets and where.

227
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:48,724
<i>I want to know his agenda.</i>

228
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,896
Whatever he does, we're going to find out.

229
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:57,483
<i>We will be in charge of his fucking life!</i>

230
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:02,071
And of course,
we have to tap all his phones.

231
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:05,574
At home, at the office,
and his cell phone.

232
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:07,534
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir!

233
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:15,417
Come to my house this Saturday
after soccer.

234
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,503
My dad gave me permission.

235
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:19,880
<i>Awesome, I'll see you there.</i>

236
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:21,340
<i>Cool, bye.</i>

237
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:24,468
<i>End of call.</i>

238
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:32,768
<i>Recording number two... 2:16 p.m.</i>
-Yes.

239
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:37,147
The company is registered under
one of the Rodriguez's fake companies.

240
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,946
<i>Recording number three... 4:32 p.m.</i>

241
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:46,699
<i>I want to suck your dick.</i>

242
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:48,701
Tomorrow.

243
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:50,703
At the same place.

244
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:02,256
<i>Ma'am, I'm so sorry to bother you.</i>

245
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:05,217
It's Maria. Is Claudio there?

246
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,971
No. Isn't he with you?

247
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,557
No. He didn't come home last night.

248
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:13,475
<i>I'm worried.</i>

249
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,354
You're fighting again.

250
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:20,190
<i>You're the reason
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.</i>

251
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,734
Nobody's seen him.

252
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,237
No one's seen him?

253
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:28,866
What did you do, Maria?

254
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:30,743
-No...
-I'm sending the boys.

255
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,204
No, that's not necessary.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

256
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,134
Mrs. Salazar,
will you be checking out today?

257
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:16,580
Hello, sir.

258
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:19,374
They're always in room 105.

259
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,794
Very good, thank you.

260
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:55,095
What a woman.

261
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,266
This was well done.

262
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,560
Thank you, sir.

263
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:04,813
The inspector has a press conference
scheduled this afternoon.

264
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:10,277
Someone needs to talk to him.

265
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:11,778
Finish the job.

266
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,116
Don Gilberto, he knows me.
They won't let me in.

267
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:18,285
Jorge.

268
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:22,372
Jorge... you should handle it.

269
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:26,293
You've done such great work.
Great work so far.

270
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:29,296
And no one knows who he is.

271
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,052
I appreciate that.

272
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,304
But I only gather information.

273
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:41,975
Sir, the truth is, I'm a man of...
few words.

274
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,023
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest
companies depend on a small outcome

275
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,777
to determine their future.

276
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:54,321
Like the success of one operation...

277
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:59,159
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

278
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:02,537
This is the final stretch.

279
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:06,875
We all have to do our part. Understood?

280
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:08,210
Yes, sir.

281
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,574
Was there a problem with your last order?

282
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:40,909
No. No problems.

283
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:44,705
I need to add another 300 barrels
to my next order.

284
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,042
300 barrels? Mr. Crespo,
that's nearly double. I can't do it.

285
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:53,338
How come?

286
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,592
There's a new buyer. Their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

287
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,012
We're already stretched very thin.

288
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,433
I've been your most important client
for years.

289
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:07,728
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

290
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:11,440
-However, this other organization...
-Isn't.

291
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:12,983
I'm sorry.

292
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,278
So who are they?

293
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:19,740
They're kids.

294
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,410
Dominicans.

295
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:27,164
Running out of some beauty parlour
in Queens.

296
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,458
I see.

297
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,961
They'll probably end up dead or locked up.

298
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:36,965
You know, it's a young man's world.

299
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:40,719
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

300
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:46,558
This beauty parlour in Queens,
give me the address.

301
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:50,479
But...

302
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:47,929
Thanks for the cigarette.

303
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,564
Transportation came out
to $5 million each.

304
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,109
You can see here
that the product loss was very little.

305
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:02,694
And the bribes?

306
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,239
Well, the payoffs...

307
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:09,159
they went up this week.

308
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,455
Went up this week to six million, sir.

309
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,293
-Guillermo.
-Yes, sir?

310
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,422
What happens in six months
when these people stop receiving money?

311
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,264
No more friends.

312
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:35,769
This is everything, right?

313
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,105
This is everything
down to the last penny, sir.

314
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:43,318
And we have here
coded pages for all the politicians,

315
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:46,363
the senators, congressmen, all the cops.

316
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:49,616
I want an exact copy of this book.

317
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:50,534
Yes, sir.

318
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,703
It's our insurance
if they try to fuck us afterward.

319
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:58,083
You think someone would dare
do something to you?

320
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:02,337
Anything can happen.
If you're a pussy, they fuck you.

321
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:10,220
Any news about Salazar's wife?

322
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:12,347
Yes, Don Miguel.

323
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:16,643
The bitch has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

324
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:22,566
You want me to handle it?

325
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:06,067
<i>I understand you have information
on the Yumbo incident.</i>

326
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:07,110
Yes, I do.

327
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:09,321
Good. Tell me.

328
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:36,097
Your wife... at the Palace Motel
at 3:45 pm.

329
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:42,020
After she dropped the kids off
at soccer practice.

330
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:48,902
So?

331
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,324
At your press conference this afternoon...

332
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,786
you will announce that the gas leak
was a municipal accident.

333
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:02,582
We have video and audio as well.

334
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,295
Look... you bought off monkey...

335
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,590
take these pictures and fuck yourself.

336
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:14,219
At the press conference this afternoon,
I'm going to tell the truth,

337
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:16,763
so that the world will know
what you people do.

338
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:20,266
And don't worry about my wife.
I already knew.

339
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:24,145
Sometimes, we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

340
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,860
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

341
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:34,989
However, you're not understanding me.

342
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:38,159
The men that I work for don't care
about your relationship with your wife.

343
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,664
They care what your children might think,

344
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:45,625
what their classmates might think.

345
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:49,045
And your distinguished family.

346
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:53,216
Think of what they would say
at your church.

347
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,970
If you don't do what I tell you,

348
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:01,433
the men I work for will make sure

349
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:05,854
that the whole world
will have a copy of this tape.

350
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:13,737
Thank you.

351
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:20,160
Mrs. Salazar.

352
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:03,912
So you've never had
a relaxation treatment before?

353
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:06,164
I've never heard of it.

354
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,417
Relaxation treatment?

355
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:11,711
That sounds nice.

356
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,173
You have a funny accent.

357
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,009
-Where are you from?
-Colombia.

358
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:22,055
-Colombian.
-This guy is Colombian, too.

359
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:25,934
-Check it out. Both.
-Really?

360
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:43,868
And I suppose that guy at the door
is also Colombian?

361
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,831
What a small world, right?

362
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:54,379
All right. What do you want?

363
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,551
I want you to go through that door.

364
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:02,095
The one with the English writing
I don't understand.

365
00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:06,516
Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

366
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:09,811
is getting a relaxation treatment

367
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,938
and would like to speak with them.

368
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:14,524
Go.

369
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,447
You stay.

370
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,876
Cool.

371
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:47,033
Please, take a seat.

372
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,868
It's better if I stand.

373
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:55,124
-A drink?
-No. Thank you.

374
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,462
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

375
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,259
I understand you have a question.

376
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:09,263
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

377
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,182
And you think I know the truth?

378
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:12,350
Yes.

379
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,478
And I don't think
you are afraid to tell me.

380
00:41:16,062 --> 00:41:17,146
And if I don't tell you?

381
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:19,065
Then I was wrong.

382
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:20,775
And you are a coward.

383
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:32,787
Your husband is dead.
He was killed by an associate of mine.

384
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,207
For a personal injury he caused.

385
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:08,925
This market, we made it ourselves.

386
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:10,927
It's ours.

387
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,179
We can't just give it up to you.

388
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,349
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

389
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:18,935
Say what you got to say.

390
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,522
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

391
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:26,400
and never come back.

392
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,111
Oh, yeah?

393
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:30,196
And the second? What?

394
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:31,781
Second...

395
00:43:33,366 --> 00:43:36,452
There is no second. Just the first thing.

396
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:44,043
-So you think this is a joke?
-Gentlemen.

397
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,213
Part of being an adult is accepting things
that you wish weren't true.

398
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:53,678
Recently, I have had to accept
some things that I don't like.

399
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:59,433
I advise you to do the same.

400
00:44:02,895 --> 00:44:05,898
Look, you and your fucking hair
have ten seconds to get out of here.

401
00:44:10,153 --> 00:44:11,696
-Ten.
-Nine.

402
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:14,949
-Nine.
-Eight.

403
00:44:16,242 --> 00:44:18,452
You think this is funny, motherfucker?

404
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:20,371
Seven.

405
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,002
-Seven.
-Six.

406
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:31,674
-Six.
-Five.

407
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:33,593
-Four .
-Four.

408
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:34,802
Three, two, one.

409
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:20,556
-Check on him.
-Got it.

410
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:37,114
"So then the crow flew up
as high as he could,

411
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:39,909
losing sight of the dogs,

412
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,786
and returned to the flock.

413
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,497
The crow went to find his friend the cat,

414
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:48,167
whom he had saved from danger,

415
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:51,337
and lived with him
in peace and happiness."

416
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,591
And that's where we'll leave off
because it's time for bed.

417
00:45:58,719 --> 00:45:59,804
You too.

418
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,015
Very good.

419
00:46:06,102 --> 00:46:08,312
-Did the girls go to sleep?
-Yes.

420
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:09,814
How's the book?

421
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:12,066
I think they understand it
better than I do.

422
00:46:12,942 --> 00:46:15,820
<i>The municipal safety inspector
dosed his investigation</i>

423
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:18,030
<i>into the tragedy in Yumbo today.</i>

424
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:21,200
<i>Hundreds were injured in a leak,
some are still in critical condition.</i>

425
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:29,292
<i>Four died, including three children.</i>

426
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:32,461
<i>The deceased were two seven-year-old boys
and a six-year-old girl.</i>

427
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:37,258
-Can you believe this horrible news?
<i>-One of the boys was about to celebrate</i>

428
00:46:37,425 --> 00:46:41,304
<i>his first communion
at the Santa Maria church.</i>

429
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,390
<i>-Now, instead of celebration...</i>
-Fuck. This is terrible.

430
00:46:44,557 --> 00:46:47,310
<i>-...there will be tears at their funerals.</i>
-It's terrible.

431
00:46:47,476 --> 00:46:49,395
I can't find my binoculars.

432
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:52,773
-Dad, let's go, we're gonna miss the game.
-Sir.

433
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:56,444
Flaco. You're my fourth wife, buddy.

434
00:46:57,653 --> 00:46:59,155
I love you, man.

435
00:46:59,322 --> 00:47:01,407
Sir, they want to make an announcement
at tonight's game,

436
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:03,868
in honour of the victims
of the Yumbo tragedy.

437
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:05,369
Good idea.

438
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:08,789
And tell them to say we'll donate
half the ticket sales to the victims.

439
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:11,542
-You got it.
-Now, let's see if we win.

440
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:13,461
If we get to the game on time.

441
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:17,548
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll keep this brief.</i>

442
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:21,135
<i>After a thorough investigation,
we've reached the conclusion</i>

443
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:27,933
<i>that the Yumbo chemical exposure</i>

444
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,103
<<i>i>was caused by a faulty valve
in a natural gas line in the area.</i>

445
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:37,068
<i>And because of that, from now on,</i>

446
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:40,237
<i>the gas company will be responsible
for the expenses.</i>

447
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:43,991
<i>Now...</i>
