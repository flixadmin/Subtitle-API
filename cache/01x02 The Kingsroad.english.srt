1
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,250
You need to drink, child.

2
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,630
And eat.

3
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,680
Isn't there anything else?

4
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,850
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

5
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,190
People can't live on grass.

6
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,830
In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

7
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,290
they say there are fields of ghost grass

8
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,620
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

9
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,170
It murders all other grass.

10
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,710
The Dothraki believe that one day

11
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,920
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

12
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,770
It'll get easier.

13
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,520
Khaleesi!

14
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,480
Your hands.

15
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,040
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

16
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,540
Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

17
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,330
You'd be more comfortable there.

18
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,210
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

19
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,590
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.

20
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,970
As you wish, Your Grace.

21
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,340
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

22
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,640
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

23
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,310
What did Ned Stark want you for?

24
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
Buying from a slaver?

25
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,650
Selling to one.

26
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,690
Some poachers I caught on my land.

27
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,200
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

28
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,160
You can rest assured of that.

29
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,430
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

30
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,270
My mother's been looking for you.

31
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,570
We ride for King's Landing today.

32
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,650
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

33
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,120
and offer your sympathies.

34
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,620
What good will my sympathies do them?

35
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,330
None. But it is expected of you.

36
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,370
Your absence has already been noted.

37
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,460
The boy means nothing to me.

38
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,920
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

39
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,050
One word and I'll hit you again.

40
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,760
I'm telling Mother!

41
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,260
Go! Tell her.

42
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,430
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

43
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,480
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

44
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,400
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

45
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,730
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

46
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,030
You can't...

47
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,610
Do you understand?

48
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,660
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

49
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,710
I hope so.

50
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,130
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,050
Ah. Time for breakfast.

52
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,270
Bread. And two of those little fish.

53
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,640
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

54
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
And bacon, burnt black.

55
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,360
Hyah.

56
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,320
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

57
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,660
Is Bran going to die?

58
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,660
Apparently not.

59
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,420
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

60
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,560
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

61
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,430
Only the gods know for certain.

62
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,940
All the rest of us can do is pray.

63
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,980
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

64
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,780
I still can't believe you're going.

65
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,940
It's ridiculous, even for you.

66
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,780
Where's your sense of wonder?

67
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,990
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

68
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,370
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

69
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,580
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

70
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,580
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

71
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,590
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

72
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,800
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

73
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,710
and piss off the edge of the world.

74
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,800
The children don't need to hear your filth.

75
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,470
Come.

76
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,270
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

77
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,860
Give me a good, clean death any day.

78
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,740
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

79
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,620
Death is so final, whereas life...

80
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,910
ah, life is full of possibilities.

81
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,540
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

82
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,920
My dear brother,

83
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,720
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

84
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,970
My dear brother, you wound me.

85
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,550
You know how much
I love my family.

86
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,120
Please.

87
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,540
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

88
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,960
This is your home. I'm your guest.

89
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,340
Handsome one, isn't he?

90
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,590
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

91
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,590
He was a fighter too -

92
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,800
tried to beat the fever that took him.

93
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,890
Forgive me.

94
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,890
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

95
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,020
I never knew.

96
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,020
It was years ago.

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,030
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

98
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,490
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

99
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,500
The boy looked just like him.

100
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,000
Such a little thing.

101
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,210
A bird without feathers.

102
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,380
They came to take his body away

103
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,140
and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

104
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,190
That little bundle.

105
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,400
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

106
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,860
Never have visited the crypt, never.

107
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,500
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

108
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,750
that she return your child to you.

109
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,590
I am grateful.

110
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,510
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

111
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,640
A sword for the Wall?

112
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,860
- I already have one.
- Good man.

113
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,650
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

114
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,280
At someone, I mean.

115
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,410
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

116
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,710
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

117
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,630
and some bone to keep it all standing.

118
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Let me thank you ahead of time

119
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,880
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

120
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,510
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

121
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,770
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

122
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,980
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

123
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,240
Is it "we" already?

124
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,200
Have you taken your vows, then?

125
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,700
Soon enough.

126
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,370
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

127
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

128
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,000
it's only for life.

129
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Thank you, Nymeria.

130
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,160
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

131
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,990
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

132
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,080
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

133
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,370
It's good you've got help.

134
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,080
Watch.

135
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,130
Nymeria, gloves.

136
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,510
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

137
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,600
Nymeria, gloves!

138
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,770
I have something for you.

139
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,230
And it has to be packed very carefully.

140
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,940
A present?

141
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,020
Close the door.

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,910
This is no toy.

143
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,420
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

144
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,380
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

145
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,550
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

146
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,890
It won't hack a man's head off,

147
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,890
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

148
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,680
- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

149
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,600
How does it feel?

150
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,810
Do you like the balance?

151
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,440
I think so.

152
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,320
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

153
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,320
I know which end to use.

154
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,870
I'm going to miss you.

155
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,830
Careful.

156
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,010
All the best swords have names, you know.

157
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,310
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

158
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
I've got a needle of my own.

159
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,830
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

160
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,580
You've said it.

161
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,310
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

162
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

163
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm taking the black.

164
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,370
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

165
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,120
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

166
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,750
I'll know my way around by then.

167
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,210
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

168
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,300
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

169
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,860
I want you...

170
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,650
to leave.

171
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,920
17 years ago

172
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,470
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

173
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,010
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

174
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,230
And now you're leaving again.

175
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,690
I have no choice.

176
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,690
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

177
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,160
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

178
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,160
You do have a choice.

179
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,830
And you've made it.

180
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,920
Cat...

181
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,470
I can't do it, Ned.

182
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,390
I really can't.

183
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,970
You can.

184
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,690
You must.

185
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,000
You've said goodbye to Bran?

186
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,130
He's not going to die. I know it.

187
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,430
You Starks are hard to kill.

188
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,970
My mother?

189
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,640
- She was very kind.
- Good.

190
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

191
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,850
It was always my color.

192
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,820
Farewell, Snow.

193
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,570
And you, Stark.

194
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,120
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

195
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,750
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

196
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,670
And you are a Stark.

197
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,880
You might not have my name,

198
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,010
but you have my blood.

199
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Is my mother alive?

200
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,940
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

201
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,650
Does she care?

202
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,950
The next time we see each other,

203
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,110
we'll talk about your mother.

204
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,990
Hmm?

205
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,580
I promise.

206
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,160
Gods, this is country!

207
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,460
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

208
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,920
I've half a mind to go with you.

209
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,760
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

210
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,180
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

211
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,970
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

212
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,850
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

213
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,230
we never had the chance to be young.

214
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,980
I recall a few chances.

215
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,490
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

216
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,530
That common girl of yours?

217
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,450
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

218
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,790
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

219
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,580
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

220
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,290
And her tits.

221
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,750
Yours was, er... Aleena?

222
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,760
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

223
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,840
Your bastard's mother?

224
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,800
- Wylla.
- That's it.

225
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,010
She must have been a rare wench

226
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,020
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

227
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,190
You never told me what she looked like.

228
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,480
Nor will I.

229
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,980
We were at war.

230
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,900
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

231
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,030
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

232
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,200
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

233
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,670
The worst thing about your coronation -

234
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,790
I'll never get to hit you again.

235
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,590
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

236
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,600
There was a rider in the night.

237
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,190
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

238
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,150
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

239
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,570
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

240
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,690
and a bold man to wield it.

241
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,610
She's little more than a child.

242
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,990
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

243
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,750
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

244
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,170
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

245
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,580
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

246
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,710
the woman I loved.

247
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,880
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

248
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,970
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

249
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,680
This Khal Drogo,

250
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,680
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

251
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,560
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

252
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,270
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

253
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,350
They have no ships, Robert.

254
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,440
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

255
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,280
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

256
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,070
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

257
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,910
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

258
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There's a war coming, Ned.

259
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,260
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

260
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,840
but it's coming.

261
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,660
Sit.

262
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,540
You'll be fed.

263
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,340
Untie them.

264
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,680
Ah, rapers.

265
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,640
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

266
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,020
Most choose the knife.

267
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,570
Not impressed by your new brothers?

268
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,320
Lovely thing about the Watch -

269
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,740
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

270
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,630
Why do you read so much?

271
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,880
Look at me and tell me what you see.

272
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,090
Is this a trick?

273
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,930
What you see is a dwarf.

274
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,220
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

275
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,480
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

276
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,560
Things are expected of me.

277
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,110
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

278
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,280
Until your brother killed that king.

279
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,790
Yes, until my brother killed him.

280
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,370
Life is full of these little ironies.

281
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,130
My sister married the new king, and...

282
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,710
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

283
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,590
I must do my part for the honor of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

284
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,310
But how?

285
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,180
Well, my brother has his sword

286
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,600
and I have my mind,

287
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,730
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

288
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,530
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

289
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,450
And you?

290
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,700
What's your story, bastard?

291
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,870
Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

292
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,710
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

293
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,260
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

294
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,180
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

295
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,930
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

296
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,390
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

297
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,020
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

298
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,440
You're a smart boy.

299
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,990
You don't believe that nonsense.

300
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,450
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

301
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,030
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

302
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,960
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

303
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Talk to Poole about it.

304
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,710
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

305
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,340
We need a new steward,

306
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,550
and there are several other
appointments that require

307
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,560
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!

308
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,810
I'll make the appointments.

309
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,570
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

310
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,690
Very good, my lord.

311
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,400
My lady.

312
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,750
When was the last time you left this room?

313
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,340
I have to take care of him.

314
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,170
He's not going to die, Mother.

315
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,090
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

316
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,260
What if he's wrong?

317
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,810
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

318
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,640
He's six.

319
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,980
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

320
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,400
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

321
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

322
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,910
Fire.

323
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,160
You stay here. I'll come back.

324
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,390
You're not supposed to be here.

325
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,140
No one is supposed to be here.

326
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,520
It's a mercy.

327
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
He's dead already.

328
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,980
No!

329
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,800
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

330
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,760
Everywhere? Even in the East?

331
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,890
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

332
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,940
- It is known.
- It is known.

333
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,940
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

334
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,190
The moon?

335
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,940
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

336
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,610
that once there were two moons in the sky.

337
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,660
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

338
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,750
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

339
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,710
and they drank the sun's fire.

340
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,790
Moon is no egg.

341
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,670
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

342
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,340
- It is known.
- It is known.

343
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,760
Leave me with her.

344
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,650
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

345
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,320
Men like to talk when they're happy.

346
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,490
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

347
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,820
How old were you?

348
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,490
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

349
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,200
Nine?!

350
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,250
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

351
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,210
First you must learn.

352
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,550
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

353
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,720
Yes.

354
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,600
Will it take three years?

355
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
No.

356
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,830
Welcome.

357
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,300
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

358
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,390
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

359
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,640
I think he was thrown.

360
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,730
The boy was always
surefooted before.

361
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,690
Someone tried to kill him twice.

362
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,650
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

363
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,440
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

364
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,200
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

365
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,030
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

366
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,450
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

367
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,790
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

368
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,210
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

369
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,590
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

370
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,550
Someone gave it to him.

371
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,550
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

372
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,140
If it's war they want...

373
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,430
If it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.

374
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,690
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

375
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,310
Hmm?

376
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,400
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

377
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,530
We don't know the truth yet.

378
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,990
Lord Stark must be told of this.

379
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,910
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

380
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,910
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

381
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,200
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

382
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,120
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

383
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,790
I must.

384
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,500
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

385
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,090
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

386
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,340
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

387
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,970
Let me accompany you at least.

388
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,090
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

389
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,230
What about Bran?

390
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,810
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

391
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,400
Bran's life is in their hands now.

392
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,250
No, Khaleesi.

393
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,220
You must look in his eyes always.

394
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,430
Love comes in at the eyes.

395
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,850
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

396
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,810
with nothing but her eyes.

397
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,140
Finish a man?

398
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,900
Oh.

399
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,610
Kings traveled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

400
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,360
Magisters sold their palaces.

401
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,910
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

402
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,580
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

403
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,750
and she refused them all.

404
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,080
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

405
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,880
I... I don't think

406
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,460
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

407
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,840
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

408
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,010
Men want what they've never had.

409
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,470
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

410
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,850
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

411
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,360
Then don't make love like a slave.

412
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,330
Very good, Khaleesi.

413
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Out there he is the mighty khal,

414
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,460
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

415
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,670
I... I don't think

416
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,300
that this is the Dothraki way.

417
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,470
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

418
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,430
why did he marry you?

419
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,230
No.

420
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,700
No!

421
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,700
Tonight I would look upon your face!

422
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,100
Pardon me, ser.

423
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,230
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

424
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,820
Or is it him there making you shake?

425
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,360
He frightens me too.

426
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,990
Look at that face.

427
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,660
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

428
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,460
Why won't he speak to me?

429
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,550
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

430
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,630
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

431
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,510
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

432
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,100
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.

433
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,730
The Royal Executioner.

434
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,190
What is it, sweet lady?

435
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,110
Does the hound frighten you?

436
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,700
Away with you, dog.

437
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,240
You're scaring my lady.

438
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
I don't like to see you upset.

439
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,000
The sun's finally shining.

440
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,670
Come walk with me.

441
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,800
Stay, Lady.

442
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,690
I probably shouldn't have any more.

443
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,110
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

444
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,190
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

445
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,380
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

446
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I'll get you!

447
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,390
Arya!

448
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,680
Ow!

449
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,470
What are you doing here?

450
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,600
- Go away.
- Your sister?

451
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,320
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.

452
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

453
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,900
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

454
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,330
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

455
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,990
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

456
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,750
I'm your prince, not your lord,

457
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,630
and I said pick up your sword.

458
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,960
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

459
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,920
And you're not a knight.

460
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,510
Only a butcher's boy.

461
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,550
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

462
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,930
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

463
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,140
I won't hurt him...

464
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,270
much.

465
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,990
Arya!

466
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,410
Filthy little bitch!

467
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,370
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

468
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,160
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

469
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,330
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

470
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,250
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

471
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,250
Arya!

472
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,840
Nymeria!

473
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,680
No.

474
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,270
No. Please don't.

475
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,680
Arya, leave him alone.

476
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,790
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

477
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,290
Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

478
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,590
Then go!

479
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,710
Don't touch me.

480
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,800
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

481
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,770
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

482
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,980
Go on. Run.

483
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,240
Go! Leave now!

484
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,780
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

485
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,960
I think I heard a noise.

486
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,130
Go!

487
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,940
Arya!

488
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,270
Arya!

489
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,940
Arya!

490
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,940
Arya!

491
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,650
Arya!

492
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,950
Arya!

493
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,160
My lord!

494
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,330
My Lord! They've found her.

495
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,960
- She's unharmed.
- Arya!

496
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,420
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

497
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,330
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

498
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,590
- Arya!
- Right, get back.

499
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,340
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

500
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,720
Back! Back to the inn!

501
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,470
All back!

502
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

503
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,770
- Are you hurt?
- No.

504
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,320
Oh, it's all right.

505
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,820
What is the meaning of this?

506
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,950
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

507
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,870
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

508
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,370
Quiet, woman.

509
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,660
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

510
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,080
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

511
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,880
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

512
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,130
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

513
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,130
That's not true!

514
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,840
She just... bit him a little.

515
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,310
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

516
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,640
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

517
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,270
That's not what happened!

518
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,560
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

519
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,860
- Liar!
- Shut up!

520
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,360
Enough!

521
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,400
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

522
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,780
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

523
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,740
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

524
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,870
She's not.

525
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,370
Sansa, come here, darling.

526
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,220
Now, child...

527
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,180
tell me what happened.

528
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,350
Tell it all and tell it true.

529
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,980
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

530
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,660
I don't know.

531
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,780
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

532
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,200
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

533
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,790
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

534
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,170
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

535
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,750
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

536
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

537
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,420
whip her through the streets?

538
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,590
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

539
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,350
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

540
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,430
You let that little girl disarm you?

541
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,650
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

542
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,530
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

543
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,780
And what of the direwolf?

544
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,990
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

545
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,420
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

546
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,210
We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.

547
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,510
No? So be it.

548
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,720
We have another wolf.

549
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,720
As you will.

550
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,100
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

551
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,350
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

552
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,230
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

553
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,940
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

554
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,150
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

555
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,200
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

556
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,700
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

557
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,530
Is this your command?

558
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,160
Your Grace?

559
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,130
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

560
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,220
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

561
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,720
No.

562
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Jory...

563
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,270
take the girls to their rooms.

564
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,980
If it must be done,

565
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,070
then I'll do it myself.

566
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,230
Is this some trick?

567
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,400
The wolf is of the North.

568
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,370
She deserves better than a butcher.

569
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,400
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

570
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,530
He ran.

571
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,240
Not very fast.
