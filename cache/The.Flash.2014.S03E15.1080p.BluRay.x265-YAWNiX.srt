1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,768
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,605
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,121
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,051
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,446
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,568
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,161
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,401
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,604
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,485
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,404
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,640
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,809
The Philosopher's Stone has been
the key to everything.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,083
So we destroy the stone
and Savitar is gone for good.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
There's only one thing we can do with it.
Throw it into the Speed Force.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,007
I have to do what I can to help.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,527
I'm the guy
who avoided his dying mother for weeks.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,125
I have a whole lot to make up for.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,288
I like you, Julian,
but I'm also afraid of my powers

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,921
<i>and what they could do to anyone
who gets close to me.</i>

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,681
I didn't ask for these powers, just like
you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,809
I think we should be terrified together.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,161
Sure, together it is.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,522
It's crazy how fast I've gotten
in such a short time.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,921
And I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,447
<i>I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar,
you are.</i>

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,282
Iris West, will you marry me?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,571
And Wally just beat his personal best.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,531
Barry's putting him
through the ringer today.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,404
"Barry"? Excuse me?

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,201
Yeah, I suppose it could be Barry,
or it could be his genius coach

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,244
whose sole purpose on this Earth
is milking epic greatness

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,641
from those around him.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,365
Thank you very much.

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,371
- It could also be Jesse.
- What?

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,483
Come on, Wally doesn't wanna get beat
by his girlfriend.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,649
Also, please, just refrain from using
"milk" as a verb from now on, please.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,364
<i>I'm getting kind of dizzy.</i>

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,090
You're supposed to get dizzy, Wallace!

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,561
<i>You're supposed to get exhausted
on this route.</i>

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,206
It's supposed to simulate the stress
that you're going to feel

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,603
when you finally confront Savitar,
so my suggestion to you is,

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,205
suck it up, buttercup!

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,885
Milking epic greatness.

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,161
Yeah. No kidding.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,686
Why don't you take it down
a little, Tiger Mom?

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,886
Barry and Jesse are at the final mark.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,247
Get ready.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,686
<i>Wally's at the home stretch.</i>

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,406
Come on.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,561
Guys?

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,921
.21 seconds.

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,008
.21. Just fast enough to save Iris
from Savitar.

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,801
You did it!

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,931
- You did it!
- We did it.

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,610
- You did.
- You did it.

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,647
<i>You okay?</i>

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,122
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm just happy.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,647
We all are, Wally. We all are.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,642
- Julian! Hi!
- Ah, Caitlin!

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,041
- How are you?
- How are you?

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,883
Did you come straight from the airport?

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,728
Uh, yes, yes. Barry said he had something
to tell me. Is he here?

64
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,803
He'll be here any minute, I'm sure.

65
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,166
- Shall we?
- Yes, we shall.

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,646
We shall.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,851
- Look who I found.
- Hey, guys.

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,041
Clsco: Oh!

69
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,482
- How we doing?
- Julian.

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,648
It's good to see you. Good to see you all.

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,007
Jesse, I thought you were
heading back to Earth-2.

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,687
I actually decided to stick around
for a little while.

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,360
Does anybody know what's going on?

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,688
I mean, I've got a mountain of paperwork
back at the office.

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,161
No, not the foggiest. I was gonna ask you.

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,322
Ah! Welcome home, James.

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,531
Can I brew you a proper cup of tea
or a robust pick-me-up for you, mate?

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,728
No need. We hit Jitters on the way.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,161
Got everybody something. You guys are...
You're in there somewhere.

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,566
I thought you were on a deadline.

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,561
I am.

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,328
You ready?

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,251
- For you.
- Thanks.

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,682
Okay, what is going on with you two?

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,886
- Do you want to?
- Mmm-mmm.

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,003
This is all you.

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay, here goes.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,685
Um...

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,770
- No!
- Congratulations, that's so exciting!

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,884
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, man.

91
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,885
You did it. This is fantastic.
Well done, Joe. Congratulations.

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,443
Dad, say something, please.

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,611
My baby girl.

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,808
You have grown into a beautiful woman.
You're marrying the best man I know.

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,722
You two bring me nothing but joy.
I'm so happy for you.

96
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,169
Okay, this cuteness right here,
I cannot...

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,605
- Congrats!
- Thanks, man. Thank you.

98
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,128
And speaking of best man...

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,083
I'll do it, of course.
When Barry and I first met...

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,084
- H.R.
- You mean him. Okay, good.

101
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,921
I...

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,250
I'd be honored. Really.
I mean, as long as I can get that plus-one

103
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,005
'cause, you know, me and Gypsy,

104
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,844
we about to tear up
the dance floor for you guys.

105
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,447
- Barr, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.

106
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,282
Yeah, I wanted to be sure that you heard
what I said in there.

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,925
I couldn't be happier.

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,281
Okay, all right.

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,128
So why didn't you ask my permission?

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,166
I mean, I told you the story

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,445
of me asking Francine's dad's permission,
like, 100 times.

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,807
At least, yeah. And that's a great story.

113
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,042
But you missed the point?

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,442
Yeah. I don't...

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,685
It was spontaneous. I knew you'd say yes,
and I wanted to surprise you.

116
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,724
Yo, there's a three-alarm fire
in the Raab building.

117
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,564
Fire department's evacuating it now.

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,371
Jesse is a little preoccupied
with the ring, so it's just you and me.

119
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,686
- Okay.
- What are you two waiting for? Go.

120
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,041
Yeah.

121
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,686
Wallace. Wallace West.

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,001
Wally.

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,841
What the hell?

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,005
Wally.

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,205
What's happening? What's wrong?

126
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,680
Where'd he go?

127
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,242
- Who?
- Where is he?

128
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,851
Who? Where is who?

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,601
Savitar.

130
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,601
<i>I feel fine.</i>

131
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,808
So now Savitar is mind-punking you?

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,288
Oh, boy! This never stops never stopping.

133
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,881
- How long has this been going on, Wally?
- Like a week.

134
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,081
A week.

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,850
Wally, why didn't you say anything before?

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,044
Because I didn't know what this was.

137
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,969
I thought that this was just
maybe in my head, you know?

138
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,128
I wasn't looking at it
like I was keeping it to myself...

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,810
That's exactly what you did though, Wally.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,890
You did keep it to yourself, and with
Savitar, that's not something we can do.

141
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,560
- This is Iris' life we're talking about.
- Yes, I know that.

142
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,489
- Do you though, Wally?
- Yes!

143
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,967
Okay.

144
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,726
Until now, you only saw him, right?

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,161
Yeah, this was the first time
it was physical.

146
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,806
He wasn't there, okay?
You weren't fighting him.

147
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,327
He was messing with your head.
He was all in your mind.

148
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,602
I've been there, done that.
It's miserable.

149
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,968
Okay, why don't I run a brain scan
on Wally,

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,561
see if he was similarly affected
to when Julian was possessed.

151
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,883
Yeah, that's fine. Why don't we do that?
Wally shouldn't be in here anyway.

152
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,761
- What?
- Barry, he knows he messed up.

153
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,724
That's not what this is about, okay?
Look, it's...

154
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,321
If Savitar is using Wally the same way
he used Julian,

155
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,005
how do we know he's not spying on us

156
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,201
through Wally right now?

157
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,965
Wally, we don't know how this works!

158
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,561
How do we know he can't see
and hear everything we're doing?

159
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,528
- Look, you're out.
- I'm out?

160
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,404
- I'm sorry, Wally.
- Yeah, you don't sound real sorry.

161
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,125
<i>All right, fellows,
let's take a quick 10?</i>

162
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,164
We're all still the Four Amigos
here, right?

163
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,647
- What?
- You don't have that movie on this Earth?

164
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,808
- I'll go talk to him.
- Yeah, talk some sense into him.

165
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,690
- All right.
- So what now?

166
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,289
Mmm. Well, we know from the future
that Savitar gets out of wherever he is,

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,562
but for now, he's still trapped, so...

168
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,566
I need to talk to him again.

169
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,246
No. I knew you were thinking this,
all right, and I won't do it.

170
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,920
I'm not gonna be
your personal walkie-talkie to him.

171
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,566
Guys, we can't. We don't have the Stone.

172
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,446
Actually, we can.
We still have Savitar's spatial frequency

173
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,406
from when we plugged in Linda Blair here,
so I think we can work without the Stone.

174
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,284
Julian, I'm sorry, man.
We don't really have a choice.

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,486
We do have a choice. I have a choice,
and I choose to decline. Sorry.

176
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,366
- We're starting to fray.
- Well, we can't, all right?

177
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,167
Everybody just needs to trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

178
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,326
Come to talk me into it, then?

179
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,567
No.

180
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,322
Barry's lost his bloody mind
if he thinks I'm gonna volunteer to be

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,926
abused again.

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,690
He's just trying to protect Iris.

183
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,646
We all are! But not like that.

184
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,282
Is the reason you don't wanna do this
because you don't want me to see it?

185
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,001
I just think,
hearing his voice coming out of me,

186
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,449
it just makes it impossible for you
to see me as a normal...

187
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,641
Hey.

188
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,641
I've had somebody else's voice
coming out of my mouth,

189
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,247
and you were still able
to see the real me.

190
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,522
How about trusting
that I can do the same thing?

191
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,970
Sorry. I just wanted to do that
in case you changed your mind later.

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,126
Quite all right.

193
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,164
Julian, you're gonna be okay.
You know the drill.

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,691
Just let your mind go blank.

195
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,008
We'll take care of the rest, okay?

196
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,963
Just let Savitar back in the driver's seat
once more. Brilliant.

197
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,208
- Thank you.
- Let's just get this over with, yeah?

198
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,528
Bow before my greatness.

199
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,965
Be in awe as you are
in the presence of the Almighty.

200
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,568
Enough with the religious nonsense.

201
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,728
You're just a man, like me.

202
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,331
I'm nothing like you, Barry.

203
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,530
<i>You're cruel. You're selfish.</i>

204
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,889
From my perspective, you're the Big Bad.

205
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,561
Stupid.

206
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,286
Still here, pretender?
Still trying to find your place?

207
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,930
I found my place. It's standing here
with these people, against you.

208
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,444
You know, the sad thing is that you live.
You survive my wrath.

209
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,723
The coward. Irony.

210
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,367
Where are you? You said that I trapped you
in the future. Where?

211
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,089
The only place that you could think of,
the only place that could hold me.

212
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,248
How long have you been imprisoned?

213
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,324
Long enough to lose my mind
several times over.

214
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,121
It's only my will that keeps me
on this side of sanity.

215
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,408
You know, it's funny,
when I think of sanity,

216
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,841
I don't necessarily think of Savitar.

217
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,691
Well, that's because you're small, Cisco.

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,769
<i>You've always been small.</i>

219
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,647
Reverb told you
that you could've been a god,

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,765
but instead you'd rather work
as tech support.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,128
You wanna tell me why we're enemies?

222
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,881
Because we had to be.
Only one of us could live.

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,123
You thought that Thawne and Zoom
were your biggest foes, but...

224
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,041
But it's me.

225
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,808
It's always been me, Barry.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,809
Man, what did we ever do to you?

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,321
You took everything from me!

228
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,170
I never asked for any of this, Joe.

229
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,689
I am only this way because of you.

230
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,761
All of you.

231
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,281
When do we meet?

232
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,643
Not long now.
You're there when I become who I am.

233
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,283
You're saying I caused you
to get your speed? I created you?

234
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,206
Oh, no, I created myself, Barry.

235
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,521
Only I can bring out my greatness.

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Your greatness! Well, you're
still trapped, wherever you are,

237
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,208
and I don't know how you're gonna escape.

238
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,482
I mean, we got rid
of the Philosopher's Stone.

239
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,646
Did we?

240
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,810
I am closer to my freedom
than I have ever been.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,767
Every step, every move that you make,
it only brings me nearer to it.

242
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,164
I only need one more thing.

243
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,050
Man, do you love to hear yourself talk!

244
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,001
<i>Iris, trying to show
that you're not afraid,</i>

245
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,610
but I know you are.
I'm sorry that you have to die,

246
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,291
but it's you or me.

247
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,927
And despite your feeble efforts
to change the future, you can't

248
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,929
because I am the future, Flash.

249
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,722
Barry, you've had to suffer
worse than anyone.

250
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,161
You've endured pain your whole life.

251
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,121
Your mother.

252
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,401
Your father.

253
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,410
Trust me, you'll never get over this.

254
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,291
Well, good chat, was it?

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,241
I don't know if I can take another one
of those seances.

256
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,171
Anyone else with me?
I almost filled my drawers.

257
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,371
Okay, so other than Savitar taking

258
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,164
"scaring the bejeezus out of us"
to a whole new level,

259
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,091
- did we actually learn anything?
- Please say yes.

260
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,328
Maybe. When I mentioned the Stone,

261
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,562
he questioned whether or not
we'd really gotten rid of it.

262
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,321
We did! We threw it into the Speed Force.
That's like throwing it into outer space.

263
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,488
Maybe we didn't.
I mean, maybe there's more to it.

264
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,761
A second Stone?

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,088
Or maybe the Stone that we had
was part of a larger piece.

266
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,800
How about the Acolytes?
Maybe they know something we don't.

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,889
- What about that one guy?
- Craig?

268
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,249
Yes, the Acolyte that you dropped in on
when you went all cold?

269
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,571
His car's GPS has him located
somewhere near Mount Buccelato.

270
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,883
Buccelato? That's miles away.
Well, what would they be doing up there?

271
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,366
There's one way to find out.

272
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,891
Talk to us. What do you see?

273
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,681
Some serious <i>Temple of Doom</i> stuff.

274
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,927
They have a box.

275
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,165
God of Speed, soon your enemies will fall,
and you will rise once more on Earth.

276
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,084
It looks just like the last,
when they held the Stone.

277
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,322
- You were right, Barr.
<i>- What are you gonna do?</i>

278
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,010
I'm gonna go see what's in it.

279
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,607
What exactly were you guys doing up here?

280
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,131
Worshipping His Greatness.

281
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,963
Let's see how far he gets without this.

282
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,402
<i>He's 10 steps ahead of you.
There's no stopping Savitar.</i>

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,126
If I were you,

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,481
I'd move up the wedding.

285
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,609
So far, not so good.
Can't get any readings off of it.

286
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,168
- That's the same as the last time.
- Are we sure this isn't the same box?

287
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,324
Well, it can't be. I mean, I threw
the other one into the Speed Force.

288
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,727
Yeah, but you said the explosion sent you
to the future.

289
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,605
What if it did something to the box, too,
you know?

290
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,565
I hate to say it, Barry,

291
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,603
but, after all my years of research,
I've never heard

292
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,804
or come across another box or Stone.
I think this is it.

293
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,486
If that's true, we need to consider
the possibility

294
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,091
that Savitar has that Stone.

295
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,409
I'm gonna check for radioactive isotopes
or gravimetric force residue

296
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,250
'cause if it's the same as the last time...

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,646
We're in big trouble.

298
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,883
You can go faster than that, Wally! Run!

299
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,890
And time.

300
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,767
Yeah.

301
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,645
Yeah, that was good.

302
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,847
We need to go again.

303
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,122
I don't understand.
I was fast enough this morning.

304
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,442
- Now, all of a sudden, I'm too slow?
- You're in your head!

305
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,961
You've got to get out of your head, man.
You've got to just run.

306
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,725
You've got to push everything else
to the side.

307
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,729
Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it.

308
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,803
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

309
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,441
All right. Why not?

310
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,601
I don't know.

311
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,886
I do.

312
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,281
You're afraid,

313
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,369
which is... I totally understand.

314
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,131
I mean, if I were in your shoes,
I'd be terrified,

315
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,768
but you can't run from a place of fear.

316
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,204
All right? Nobody can do anything
effectively coming from a place of fear.

317
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,131
- Trust me, I know.
- Savitar can get inside my head.

318
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,642
What am I supposed to do if he does that
at the wrong time?

319
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,323
It sure would be a lot easier if I just
knew exactly how that night went.

320
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
Would it ever.

321
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,288
- Are you picking up what I'm putting down?
- Uh-huh.

322
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,241
Let's go.

323
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,245
No way! I'm not gonna vibe you there
for you to watch your sister die!

324
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,011
Cisco, Cisco, Cisco.
This is to help Wallace!

325
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,482
To help him see what happens
so he knows what to do in the moment!

326
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,848
Come on, Cisco, please.
If Savitar's coming back,

327
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,411
and I'm the only one that can save Iris,

328
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,529
I have to do everything I can
to make sure that happens.

329
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,000
And you're sure you wanna do that?

330
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,607
Because this is not something
you can un-see, Wally.

331
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,609
If this is gonna help me
save my sister, yeah,

332
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,326
I have to see it. Please.

333
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,523
Okay, if you have to see it,

334
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,763
come on down, be my guest.
H.R., you know how to work this, right?

335
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,371
I know how to work this, yeah.

336
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,522
Anything goes wrong,
you get Caitlin down here stat.

337
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,888
I know what I'm doing.
I was here last time. I saw what you did.

338
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,851
All I've got to do is do this.

339
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,805
- It's the other button.
- It's the other one.

340
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,123
Bit of a lighter touch next time,
please, H.R.!

341
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,368
<i>- Copy, lighter touch.</i>
- This way.

342
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,520
<i>Don't!</i>

343
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,201
This is it.

344
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay, so that's the distance
I need to cover.

345
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,881
Don't do this!

346
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,051
Now, finally, I am free of you.

347
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,890
Barry, I love you.

348
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,845
No, don't say that, all right?
You're gonna be all right.

349
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,560
I'm begging you!
I'm begging you! I'm begging...

350
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,086
Barry.

351
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,243
You lose, Barry.

352
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,686
No!

353
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,091
No!

354
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,606
<i>Iris.</i>

355
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,086
Iris, Iris.

356
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,441
Look.

357
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,851
Come on.

358
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,443
What did you see?
Was it good? Did that help?

359
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,046
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

360
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,401
Helped a lot.

361
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,121
Wally.

362
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,409
Why does nobody ever listen to me!

363
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,125
You're so full of it.

364
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,441
What?

365
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,883
Railing at me for not telling everyone
about Savitar?

366
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,048
<i>What about
what you're not telling everyone, Barry?</i>

367
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
What are you...

368
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,644
Cisco vibed me into the future.
I saw what happened.

369
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,120
Tell my sister
why you asked her to marry you.

370
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,721
Go on. Tell her the real reason, Barry.

371
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,961
What is he talking about?

372
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,161
Barry?

373
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,167
The night that Savitar kills you,
you didn't have a ring on your finger.

374
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,085
We weren't engaged yet.

375
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,321
So you thought that if we were...

376
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,010
That it might change the future.

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,001
Iris.

378
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,330
Iris...

379
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,682
Iris! Hey. Come on.
Hey, hey. I love you, okay?

380
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,200
I love you more than anything.

381
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,328
That part has never changed.
It never will.

382
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,049
Barry, we moved in together after some
rash decision that you made at Christmas,

383
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,645
and then a couple weeks later,
you propose.

384
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,649
You didn't even ask
for my dad's permission.

385
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,326
I know. I don't know.
I guess I got caught up in the moment. I...

386
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,328
That is exactly what I am afraid of.

387
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,041
- Iris, please.
- Barry, I just...

388
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,645
I need time to think.

389
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,201
Hey.

390
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,402
- You okay?
- I'm worried.

391
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,244
Yeah, I understand.

392
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,090
I keep coming back to the thought
that I could be the cause of all this.

393
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,961
What do you mean?

394
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,930
Savitar's prophecy.

395
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,041
"One will betray you."

396
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,803
You may well have invited
Judas into the group, Caitlin.

397
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,045
- It's not you.
- It's impossible to tell.

398
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,926
Savitar could be controlling me,
and none of us would know about it.

399
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,246
None of us, not even me.

400
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,044
But this time we know who it is.

401
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,281
How?

402
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,801
Because I'm the one who betrayed everyone.

403
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,966
How long have you had this?

404
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,166
Ever since you threw the box
into the Speed Force.

405
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,006
It's such a small piece.
I didn't think it would really matter.

406
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,846
Why would you even risk it?

407
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,451
Because I thought I could use it
to get rid of my powers.

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,682
And? Can you?

409
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,091
I don't know. I haven't been able
to figure out how to use it yet.

410
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,805
Okay, well, look, gang,
I think we can all agree

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,005
that this is a simple case of the other
side, the Killer Frost side of Caitlin,

412
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,651
clouding her betterjudgment, so...

413
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,083
No, H.R., this wasn't her. It was me.

414
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,606
I'm really sorry, guys.

415
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,488
Right now, we just need to figure out
where Savitar is.

416
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,765
Yes, I think that's a fantastic plan.
How are we gonna do that?

417
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,841
Uh...

418
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,280
- No!
- One more time?

419
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,851
- No!
- No! No!

420
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,451
<i>You wanna summon Savitar again?</i>

421
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,847
I'm not a human Ouija board, Barry.
You can't just...

422
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,042
It's the last time, all right?
And only long enough to see

423
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,282
if maybe we can track his location.
Is that possible?

424
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
- Yes.
- No! No.

425
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,044
Julian, I mean, we've got to end this,
for everybody's sake.

426
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,642
- I'll see you downstairs.
- Oh!

427
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,365
Okay, well, you guys can count me out,
all right?

428
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,722
'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply
of boxers to this planet.

429
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,848
Julian, please.

430
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,841
I should have told you.

431
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,921
I can't believe
you would keep part of that Stone.

432
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,563
Do you not remember
what Savitar had me do with that?

433
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,247
- Yes, I do.
- But you're not concerned, are you?

434
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,081
You just want
your own personal meta-human specialist

435
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,526
to try and find you a cure.

436
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,524
Julian, I don't want these powers.

437
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,728
I can't spend
the rest of my life wondering

438
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,204
if or when I'm gonna lose this battle
and become Killer Frost.

439
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,923
I thought you, more than anyone,
would understand that.

440
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,208
You know what I understand?

441
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,926
I understand the real reason
that you invited me on this team.

442
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,446
That's not the only reason.

443
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,723
Yeah, I wish I could believe that.

444
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,921
Dad.

445
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,410
I heard what happened.
Thought you might need a pick-me-up.

446
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,449
- Worked like a charm when you were a kid.
- Smaller problems.

447
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,447
Yeah.

448
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,651
So...

449
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,087
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- I don't know what I want, Dad.

450
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,446
Iris.

451
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,331
Whatever you may be feeling right now
about Barry,

452
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,483
that man does love you.

453
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,005
That kind of love is rare.

454
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,329
Dad, I wish it were that simple.

455
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,443
"Simple".

456
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,250
Look,

457
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,609
only you know what's good for you,

458
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,846
but with the kind of lives
that you two have,

459
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,960
that love between the two of you,

460
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,007
that is the one thing
that should stay simple.

461
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,164
Oh, baby girl.

462
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,481
<i>We'll be here
if you need anything.</i>

463
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,121
Okay.

464
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,523
Back to worship me once again?

465
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,127
We just wanted to let you know
that we're gonna defeat you.

466
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,367
Unlikely.

467
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,490
You told us that you're trapped,
imprisoned for all eternity.

468
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,684
You're never getting out of wherever
my future-self locked you up.

469
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,047
<i>You'll never know freedom again.</i>

470
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,369
All will be revealed soon, Flash.

471
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,326
You will face my wrath.
You will beg for mercy.

472
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,289
And you will get none.

473
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,405
- Did it work?
- Did it work?

474
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,010
Yeah, we got a hit. It's just that
that hit is all of Central City.

475
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,561
- That's not a hit. The whole city?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

476
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,007
God.
Well, can we get a little more specific,

477
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,043
pinpoint a location at least, something?

478
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,850
I think maybe we can get
a little bit more precise,

479
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,530
but I'm gonna have
to give it the old meta-human try.

480
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,207
Okay. It's Iris.
All right, I'll be right back,

481
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,402
but just let me know
if you get anything, all right?

482
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,767
All right.

483
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,441
Hey.

484
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,604
You going somewhere?

485
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,571
Yeah, I just wanna get back
to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.

486
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,525
Seeing as how you exploded on Barry
in front of everyone,

487
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,245
might wanna wait on it.

488
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,442
Well, the truth had to come out, so...

489
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,086
Yeah, it did, just maybe not that way.

490
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,880
I mean, we all have to help each other,
not point fingers.

491
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,046
You're right. I...

492
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,806
I'll make it up to them. It's just,
this whole thing is messing with my head.

493
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,087
- Don't let it.
<i>- You don't get it, Jesse.</i>

494
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,091
When you got your powers,
you were walking down the street.

495
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,451
Me? I touched the Philosopher's Stone.
I got trapped in some cocoon.

496
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,444
I just feel, because of all of that, I...

497
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,410
There's something wrong with me.

498
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,162
I feel like Savitar has
some kind of hold on me.

499
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,001
Look, I know, okay,
but you're strong, Wally.

500
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,605
You can fight this.

501
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,969
You know,
all I ever wanted was to have powers.

502
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,169
To do some good. But now?

503
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,927
Now, I'm the one responsible
for saving Iris' life.

504
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,811
I don't know if I'm gonna be fast enough
to save her, so...

505
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,962
Hey, Wally, you're not alone.

506
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,361
Okay.

507
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,846
She's right, Wally.

508
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,641
You're not alone.

509
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,121
Mom?

510
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,963
You're never alone, Wally.

511
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,285
- <i>I've missed you so much.</i>
- I've missed you, too.

512
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,686
Wally?

513
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,403
I'm so proud of you,
of what you're trying to become.

514
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,530
That's all I want.
I just want you to be proud of me.

515
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,050
Wally, you're really freaking me out.

516
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,887
I am, son. I'm so very, very proud,
but you have to stop.

517
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,084
What? Why?

518
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,049
You're working so hard.

519
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,687
You don't see how dangerous it is.

520
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,490
Son, you're not fast enough.

521
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,686
You never will be.

522
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,921
But I can't stop.
I have to save Iris. I have to.

523
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,406
Wally.

524
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,324
You're in my head again.

525
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,446
You were always so smart.

526
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,210
Weren't you, Wallace?

527
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,684
But not smart enough.

528
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,770
I have what I need
to escape my hell, Wallace.

529
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,242
No, not everything,
we still have a piece of that Stone.

530
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,410
Not for long. And once I have it,

531
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,246
you and everyone you love will perish.

532
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,765
- Wally!
- I have to go. I can't let him get out.

533
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,286
- What are you talking about?
- It's Savitar.

534
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,050
You need to tell Barry, okay?

535
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,447
No, I can do this by myself.
Jesse, please, just wait here.

536
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:32,471
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

537
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,050
- Hey.
- Hey.

538
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,086
I got your message.

539
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,285
Come, sit down.

540
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,646
Iris. Uh...

541
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,451
I know you're mad, but...

542
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,726
No, Barry, that's not it.

543
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,928
I just want you to listen, okay?

544
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,010
I need you to let me say
what I need to say.

545
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,327
Okay.

546
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,487
I'm not angry at you.

547
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,122
I understand that you...

548
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,126
You wanna keep me safe, and us
getting engaged could change the future.

549
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,845
I get all of that.

550
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,450
Barry, when you proposed to me,

551
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,643
I said yes because

552
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,530
I love you more than anything,
and I wanna be your wife.

553
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,887
But I thought that you were asking me
purely out of love, not fear.

554
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,490
And, Barry, whether you realize it or not,

555
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,286
now there's always gonna be a part of us
that's tainted.

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,809
Iris, I'm trying to save your life.

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,684
I know, and that's the problem.

558
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,561
I wanna be your wife, Barry.

559
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,522
I don't wanna be someone that you're
trying to save for the rest of eternity.

560
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,806
Eternity.

561
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,886
I can't see anything.

562
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,366
Give me those. Are those things
even working?

563
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,527
Yep, can't get through...

564
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,524
- Stop it!
- I just wanna see if they're working!

565
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,165
- What are you doing?
- What are you seeing?

566
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,885
I'm seeing these white flashes.

567
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,570
- It's like...
- Flashes?

568
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,047
Yeah, it's like Savitar's
speeding through, like, a storm.

569
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,329
No, it's not a storm.
It's the Speed Force.

570
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,446
He's in the Speed Force. That's why
only speedsters were able to see him.

571
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,405
Why is Savitar hiding in the Speed Force?

572
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,250
He's not hiding.

573
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,131
- That's where the future you trapped him.
- That's right.

574
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,767
And that's why Savitar only appears
for a few moments at a time

575
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,771
because the Speed Force just sucks him
back in. That makes sense.

576
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,964
But we threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force.

577
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,248
And we gave him the very thing
he needed to escape.

578
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,409
Except he said he still needed one thing.

579
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,366
I don't think he can come out
because he doesn't have the whole Stone.

580
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,211
Guys, Wally went after Savitar.

581
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,401
- What?
- What?

582
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,601
He started hallucinating.

583
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,569
He thought he was talking to his mom.

584
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,411
- No, that's not her. That's Savitar.
- Where'd he go?

585
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,329
I don't know. Okay, he was freaking out.

586
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,803
He said he needed to stop Savitar
from getting out. Then he sped off.

587
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,161
The Stone.

588
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,441
It's gone?

589
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,483
- It's gone.
- Barr, we have to find Wally.

590
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,609
Yeah.
If Savitar gets a hold of the Stone...

591
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,326
- He'll escape for sure.
- I can't find him.

592
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,971
He turned off the suit's telemetry.

593
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,770
Oh, come on!

594
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,962
Poor Wallace. Can't even open a portal.

595
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,603
You can't get rid of that Stone, Wallace.

596
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,124
Like you can't get rid of me.

597
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,329
Shut up, shut up.

598
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,971
You know it's true.

599
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,330
You're not fast enough to throw it
into the Speed Force by yourself!

600
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,601
Shut, up!

601
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,127
I'm gonna get out of here, Wallace,

602
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,769
and then I'm gonna come for you
and Barry and your sister,

603
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,526
and I'll kill everyone you love.

604
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,684
No, you're not real!
You're just in my head, just...

605
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,166
Oh, I am real,
and I know the limits of your speed.

606
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,483
After all, I'm the one who gave it to you.

607
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,011
And that,

608
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,844
<i>giving me speed,</i>

609
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,164
that was your biggest mistake.

610
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,205
<i>There's a massive power surge.</i>

611
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,361
Where?

612
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,567
The old Kob Factory.

613
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,041
I'm pulling up security footage.

614
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,321
Oh, my God.

615
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,361
Wally!

616
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,161
Ahhh!

617
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,207
<i>No! Help me, Barry!</i>

618
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,285
I'm free!

619
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,286
Ground.

620
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,286
<i>Air.</i>

621
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,126
I can feel again. I can breathe again.

622
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,921
<i>I've beaten you, finally.</i>

623
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,603
Where's Wally? What just happened to him?

624
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,124
Like the Greek myth of Atlas,
who could not put down the sky

625
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,129
until someone took his place,

626
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,841
<i>Wally has taken my place
in the Speed Force.</i>

627
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,450
You know me. I love a good myth.

628
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,769
He took your place? What...

629
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,008
When you created Flashpoint,

630
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,165
you unwittingly provided me
with the means for my return.

631
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,521
Wally.

632
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,482
You gave me the idea to turn Wally
into Kid Flash,

633
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,361
<i>to make him fast enough
to replace me in your prison.</i>

634
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,211
His youth and ego were my allies.

635
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,966
<i>So taken with his fame and speed,</i>

636
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,801
he never saw
he was running right into my trap.

637
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,648
- How do I get him out?
- Wally's gone.

638
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,291
How do I get him out?

639
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,201
Suffering in an endless void
for all eternity,

640
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,286
another victim Barry Allen failed to save.

641
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,006
I'm gonna kill you.

642
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,688
If you had the strength to end my life,
you would have done it in the future,

643
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,646
but Barry Allen doesn't kill.
He's the good guy,

644
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,526
the boy Joe raised, the man Iris loves.

645
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,651
You have everything
and deserve none of it.

646
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,041
I'm going to destroy this city
like I did in the future

647
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,208
so you can see the truth, Barry,

648
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,405
and then you'll treat me like a god.

649
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,080
You're not a god!

650
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,925
- Who are you?
- I am the future, Flash.

651
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,445
Show your face!

652
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,611
I want so badly to kill you, and I will,

653
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,247
but you have to live
a little while longer,

654
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,131
long enough to see Iris die.

655
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,649
The blade didn't hit your organs,

656
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,086
but it did shatter your clavicle.

657
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,281
Hang in there, man. Hang in there.

658
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,562
- We have to take it out.
- Do it.

659
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,444
Any medicine I give you,
your metabolism would burn through.

660
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,768
- All right. Just do it, okay? Just do it.
- Hold him down.

661
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,922
Okay, okay. You're gonna be okay, mate.
You're gonna be okay.

662
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,286
Bite down on this.

663
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,127
I'm so sorry.

664
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,084
Three, two, one.

665
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,122
- How long was I out?
- Not long.

666
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,241
Are you in much pain?

667
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,210
I might be able to do something with this.

668
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,487
Joe, I'm sorry.

669
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,646
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,170
Not your fault.

671
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,006
Where is he?

672
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,165
I mean, is he in pain? Is he...

673
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,047
"One will suffer a fate worse than death."

674
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,486
Jesse.

675
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,521
I...

676
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,927
I'm not like your dad. I don't really know
what the right words are...

677
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,446
What are we gonna do?

678
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,204
We have to bring him back.
We have to save him.

679
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,369
I can't lose Wally, Barry.

680
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,887
I'm sorry.

681
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,209
I'm gonna work on this.

682
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,561
Yeah.

683
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,561
I'll see you soon.

684
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,243
I'm sorry. I should've never...

685
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,164
- I was afraid.
<i>- I know.</i>

686
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,640
Believe me, I know.

687
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,081
Fear makes us do a lot of things
that we shouldn't.

688
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,003
My fear's the reason for all of this.

689
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:54,027
