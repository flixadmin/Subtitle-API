1
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:00,529
-Honey!
-Mom?

2
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,404
Do you remember everything
you have learnt?

3
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:03,362
Yes, I do.

4
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:04,571
Do well in the exam.
-Okay.

5
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:08,362
By the time you come back in the evening,
your dad would bring you a big cake.

6
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,237
-But you should do your exam well.
-Okay, mom.

7
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:13,529
Happy birthday!
-Give your friends some chocolates, dear.

8
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:14,737
Happy birthday!

9
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,321
Happy birthday!
-Thank you very much.

10
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:17,696
Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

11
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,987
Hey, the bus is here.
-Happy birthday!

12
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:22,071
Give your other friends in the bus, okay?
-Okay, mom.

13
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,404
Bye, dear.
-Bye!

14
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,446
Bye! Bye!

15
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:27,987
Bye!
-Bye!

16
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:32,571
[all]: Happy birthday to you!

17
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,737
-Put some sambar!
-Come! Come on!

18
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:49,862
Come!

19
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,904
Sir, buy at least one, sir.

20
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,404
My baby is hungry and crying.

21
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:02,446
Okay, give me one.

22
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,487
Hey!

23
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,154
Watch out for the baby!

24
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:31,987
Hey!

25
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,666
At the Morampudi junction near Rajahmundry,

26
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,625
toxic gas caught fire in a drainage
leading to a serious accident.

27
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,333
On behalf of the Opposition,
we strongly condemn this mishap.

28
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,541
This is an unforeseen accident.

29
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,625
I announce ex-gratia for the deceased.

30
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:03,375
The Hyderabad High Court has ordered
the government to hand over this case to CBI.

31
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:08,458
To consider this as a special case
and initiate fast track investigation,

32
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,541
…High Court also instructed the CBI.

33
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,666
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

34
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,333
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

35
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,291
Samaikyata Party’s Mahanadu
was a great success.

36
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,125
It witnessed large attendance of party
activists from all over the state.

37
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,458
Chief Minister Dakshayani is overjoyed
with the success of Mahanadu.

38
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,625
CM has stated that Mahanadu
has doubled her enthusiasm.

39
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,791
She expressed her gratitude to the
party activists who made it happen.

40
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,166
CM’s convoy has started.

41
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,083
Stall the public.
Set up barricades!

42
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,291
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

43
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:52,333
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

44
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,208
Side! Side!

45
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,625
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

46
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,750
Move! Move!

47
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,333
Give way!

48
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,500
Give way!

49
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,791
Hey! CM, man!

50
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:27,750
Hail! CM Dakshayani!
Hail! CM Dakshayani!

51
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,916
Hey! Move!

52
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,125
Come! Come!

53
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,833
Come on!
-Hey, stop! CM, man!

54
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,000
-Sir…
-Hey!

55
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
What are you doing?
-Ambulance!

56
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,083
Hey! How can you disrupt the convoy
for an ambulance?

57
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,750
Sir, when an ambulance comes through,
the way must be cleared, sir!

58
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,833
-Hey! CM, man!
-Sir, it’s a life, sir!

59
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,500
Hey!
-Sir, it’s little girl, sir.

60
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,541
She is covered in blood.

61
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,125
So, would you stop the CM’s car?

62
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,291
Ma’am…

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,750
Tell me.

64
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,583
Will you stop the CM’s car for that?

65
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,916
No, ma’am. Sorry.

66
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,125
You should stop.

67
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,333
CM’s life is never above
the life of a citizen.

68
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,000
Before blocking the road, don’t you check
if there are any emergency vehicles stuck?

69
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,000
Sorry, ma’am.

70
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,208
Check the girl’s condition
and keep me updated.

71
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,208
Okay, ma’am.

72
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,208
A SHIVA

73
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,125
Shiva?

74
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,791
Yes, ma’am.
Constable Shiva, Sakinetipalli.

75
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,541
Good job, Shiva.

76
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,125
What you did is right.

77
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,291
You, me, and everyone else is here
to serve the public.

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,500
If it’s going to help the public,
don’t think twice to confront anyone.

79
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,125
Be it the CM or the PM.

80
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,083
Don’t worry. Hmm?

81
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,125
Hmm. Good.

82
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,125
“Head up high”

83
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,958
“Looking fly”

84
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,125
“Got the feel that
the world is mine”

85
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,125
“From the street
Dreaming big”

86
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,708
“Aint no longer dreaming
This legit!”

87
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,833
“For safety and security
it’s a symbol, this khaki”

88
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,333
“Even in mufti
my power knows no bounds”

89
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,750
“On duty round the clock
I am too smart to handle”

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,583
“A journey with lathi
Such a life is so lucky”

91
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,291
“Rose filled felicitations
For every day common service”

92
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,708
“Not needed, not at all needed”

93
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,166
“Patting my back when says the public
well-done or bravo”

94
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,500
“That will do
to keep me happy all through”

95
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,125
“Peace mantra is our slogan”

96
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,833
“We gel with the public in a jolly way”

97
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,125
“Giving up sleep, we stand guard”

98
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,375
“Your safety is our responsibility
that’s what we say”

99
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,208
“No matter what problems
Beckon us snapping their fingers”

100
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,125
“Like Lord Vishnu
we appear to say hello”

101
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,208
“No matter what time at night
there is a disturbance or fight”

102
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,583
“With wheels for our shoes
We say let’s go”

103
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,791
“It does exist
but never comes in our family time”

104
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,791
“The first wife of course
is what we wear as uniform!”

105
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,375
“This is every policeman’s life
same to same”

106
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,791
“We find no difficulty too hard”

107
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,125
“Head up high”

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,125
“Looking fly”

109
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,125
“Got the feel that
the world is mine”

110
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,125
“From the street
Dreaming big”

111
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,125
“Aint no longer dreaming
This legit!”

112
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,541
“Head up high”

113
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,458
“Looking fly”

114
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,833
“Got the feel that
the world is mine”

115
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,500
“From the street
Dreaming big”

116
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,166
“Aint no longer dreaming
This legit!”

117
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,125
Hey! Ouch!

118
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,541
Oh god! Wait!

119
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,125
I will come back and deal with you.

120
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,291
Sorry…sorry… sorry.

121
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,333
What sorry?

122
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:49,125
No. I mean, she is a lady driver.
She is just beginning to learn. Sorry.

123
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,125
What if she is a lady?
You think you can do anything and get away?

124
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,500
Brother! Do you know
what I would do if I were in your place?

125
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,958
What would you do?

126
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,500
I would say ‘It’s okay. It happens.’

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,208
And then leave.

128
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,583
Hey! You made a dent in my car.

129
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,750
And you are picking a fight with ladies.

130
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,166
If I demand money from you now,
would you pay?

131
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,125
Mm hmm.

132
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,500
No.
-No? Then go.

133
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,833
Hey, what are you watching?

134
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,458
Get going! Move!

135
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,125
Super, baby.
-Who is super baby?

136
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,208
How many times should I tell you
not to let go of the clutch all of a sudden?

137
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,125
The traffic is too heavy.
I am scared.

138
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,125
Oh! Do you want a national holiday
because you are driving?

139
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,333
Start the vehicle.

140
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,458
Change the gear.

141
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,834
What’s wrong this time?

142
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,417
I was asked to stop.

143
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,500
Who?

144
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:44,834
Thanks, madam.

145
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,875
Don’t call me, madam.
-Then?

146
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,834
Just Julie.

147
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:49,834
Is that important now?

148
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,000
Why did you get in as if
this were your own car?

149
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,292
Get down!

150
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,417
I waved my hand and Julie stopped the car.
So, I got in.

151
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,084
Stop bluffing.
I was just teaching her how to apply brake.

152
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,417
Really?

153
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,834
Then teach her how to offer lift.
That’s one job done.

154
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,334
You carry on, Julie. Let’s go.
-Okay!

155
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,792
Look to your right.

156
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,167
Huh?
-There’s a car coming.

157
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,792
Hey! What is this box?

158
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,084
What have you brought?

159
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,167
Hey, lemon rice!

160
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,167
I am really hungry.
Is this fresh rice or left over rice?

161
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,834
-Why do you hit me?
-Baby, don’t fight.

162
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:25,834
Give it to me!

163
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,834
What are you both doing?
-Nothing.

164
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,417
She is trying to show you how to drive
with a scuffle going on in the car.

165
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,875
That’s all. Carry on, Julie.
-Hey!

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,792
Why are you acting smart?
How long should I wait for you?

167
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,042
What is your problem now?

168
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,417
What is my problem?

169
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,792
When did you promise to come back
before you left town?

170
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,292
Hey, they deputed me for just a day.

171
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,167
But the CM insisted I stayed there.

172
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,625
Oh!
-That’s why…

173
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,834
Just because the CM praised you,
you think you are superhuman?

174
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,792
And forget me?

175
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,667
-Hey! Don’t try to act funny.
-Hey…

176
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,417
How many days should I wait for you?

177
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,875
Why couldn’t you make a call?

178
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,000
-Baby!
-You have forgotten me.

179
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Why would I?
-Don’t lie!

180
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,792
And why would I lie to you?
-Oh!

181
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,292
So, you two are lovers!

182
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,084
Not lovers, Julie.

183
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,875
Okay, okay, okay.
-Just friends.

184
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,167
Keep your eyes on the road.

185
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,875
Your class is over. Stop the car.
-Hey, careful!

186
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey!
-Okay, okay!

187
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,084
Stop to the side!

188
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,709
Your class is over.
You can go.

189
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,209
There’s still half on hour left, baby.

190
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,667
Enough for today. Leave now.

191
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,167
Will you cover the rest tomorrow?

192
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,500
Tomorrow is your day off.

193
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,834
But I am coming tomorrow, baby.

194
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,667
It’s my day off tomorrow.
Go now!

195
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:30,834
But why?

196
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,500
It’s my match tomorrow.
-Hey!

197
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:34,167
You didn’t tell me!

198
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,209
Congratulations!

199
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,084
Who did you say it was?

200
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,250
It’s me!

201
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,334
Love?
-Hmm.

202
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,334
Love between our school senior
and this driving school?

203
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,834
Exactly.

204
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:55,834
Oho!

205
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,834
I went there to escape
my wedding torture at home

206
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,834
but he torments me
with his love proposal.

207
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,042
Too much of torture!

208
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,667
Enough for both.

209
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,625
Did you tell him about us?

210
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,834
That’s not a problem.

211
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,167
I don’t care for such things.

212
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:14,834
I am very open.

213
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,834
I have no doors!

214
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,084
How is it a problem for him?

215
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,417
It’s a problem for us.

216
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,834
You should have whacked that idiot.

217
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:29,834
Revathi loves Karthik.

218
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,250
But…

219
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:35,542
discovering Mohan’s pure love for her,
she lived happily ever after with?

220
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:39,334
Mohan. Of course,
Karthik was dead.

221
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:40,709
But in our story…

222
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,292
You never know!

223
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:46,250
Hey, hey, hey!
What was he trying to say?

224
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,834
He was talking about the film ‘Mouna Ragam'.

225
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,084
Ignore that.

226
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,417
He said he will speak to my dad.

227
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,500
He knows my dad well.

228
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:57,000
That’s why please come and talk to my dad.

229
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,042
Please.
-Hey, are you nuts?

230
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,000
He tells you something
and you believe it.

231
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,042
Anyway, my SI exam date is declared.

232
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:04,834
I will meet him after the exam.

233
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,625
What was it, sweetheart?
SI exam?

234
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,000
First you said you must find a job.

235
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,042
Then you said wait until you took charge.

236
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,709
Now you talk about becoming an SI.

237
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,094
I can’t wait till you become
the President of India.

238
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,042
Hey, I have no issue talking to your dad.

239
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,042
But don’t you know your dad?

240
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,417
The moment I face him,
he brings up assets, status, caste, creed…

241
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,083
Hey! What is it?

242
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,292
Who are you marrying?
Me, right?

243
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,458
I tell you this.
Come and talk to my family.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,667
Hey, please.

245
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,042
Please.

246
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,000
Hello, sir!

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,625
-Hello, Shiva! When did you come?
-Just now, sir.

248
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:52,042
I heard you had stopped the very CM’s car?

249
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,250
Shiva! It’s in the paper.
Along with your name!

250
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,542
-Not so much, sir.
-Super!

251
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:58,042
I only stopped cars
to clear the ambulance.

252
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,500
But things took a different turn.

253
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,000
The SI asked you to meet him
as soon as you come.

254
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,042
Was expecting.
What does he say?

255
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,042
What, man?
I sent you for CM’s security.

256
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,875
And you stop the CM's car! Huh?

257
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,042
What is this, Shiva?

258
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
What is this?

259
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,375
I sent you for CM’s security.

260
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,208
And you stop HER car?

261
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,042
Every officer who praised you before CM,
is calling me and pulling me up!

262
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,500
‘Can’t you keep your station disciplined?’

263
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,573
Without even knowing the meaning of police,

264
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,865
they find their way into the force
under some quota!

265
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:33,698
We end up giving explanation
to everyone for all that you do!

266
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:35,240
Damn!

267
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:37,740
Hey!

268
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:40,115
One more complaint against you,

269
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:41,948
I will directly suspend you.

270
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,240
Go!

271
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,031
Stop.

272
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:46,865
Is this the time to report to duty?

273
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,740
I will mark your leave. Go.

274
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,823
-Please mark leave for tomorrow also.
-What?

275
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,823
My uncle is in a serious condition.

276
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:57,115
Serious?
-Seriously, bro.

277
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:00,365
That’s why these success celebrations
must go on not for three days…

278
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:02,698
but for ten days!

279
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:04,823
Surely, man.

280
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:08,073
Our CM has praised my son!

281
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:11,865
Do you know how happy I am?
-Of course!

282
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,490
That’s why this three-day celebration!

283
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:17,823
Shiva, your name is in the paper.

284
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,365
-You owe us a party.
-Okay, okay.

285
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,865
-Mom! Brother is here.
-Huh?

286
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,448
Neighbour’s evil eye…
Others’ evil eye,

287
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,865
All eyes are on you!

288
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,115
Let everyone’s evil eye be warded off.

289
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,740
I wish they also put your picture
in the paper.

290
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:36,865
The whole state would have known
how you had stopped the CM and saved a girl.

291
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,240
They publish all kinds of photos
except that.

292
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,573
I will ask them
to put a picture next time, okay?

293
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,865
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

294
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:47,698
Where is dad?

295
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,865
Shiva is super great.

296
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,281
Dad!

297
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,823
Hey, Shiva!

298
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,323
I love you, Shiva. I love you.
-Hey, great!

299
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,448
Dad!

300
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:01,281
I have something important to talk.
Please, come in.

301
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,948
If it’s important, it can wait.

302
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:06,031
Celebration is on going!

303
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,865
Hey, dad! Didn’t I say it’s important?

304
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,698
He is half the reason you are spoiled.
Come inside.

305
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,281
-Okay, let’s go.
-Celebration for three days.

306
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:12,323
-Hey!
-Huh?

307
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,115
-My son is serious.
-Okay.

308
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:15,865
-I am going.
-Go, go.

309
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
-You don’t drink but wait.
-Okay, I will wait. Okay.

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,281
Okay, I will wait.

311
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,281
-Dad…
-Huh?

312
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:39,698
I don’t know if what I am going to tell you
would make you angry but…

313
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:42,865
Hey, if you don’t know it yourself,
let’s talk tomorrow.

314
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,865
Dad, dad, dad!
I will tell you.

315
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,531
Sit down.
Sit.

316
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,865
What is the matter?

317
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,240
Hey! Why do you care? Huh?

318
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:52,906
Why do you interfere
when grownups are talking?

319
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,865
Go into your room!
-Okay, son.

320
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:57,031
Huh! Dad, dad!
I didn’t mean you, dad.

321
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,865
Sit down, dad.
Please. Only for a minute. Sit.

322
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,698
Okay. What is it now?

323
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:09,573
Actually… I… went to Bapiraju school
to study, right?

324
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:11,823
(Sobbing)

325
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:13,865
Sorry, son.

326
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:19,948
I sent you there because their fee was low.

327
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:22,865
The problem is not about the fee.
Dad…

328
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:26,365
If you keep disturbing me halfway,
I lose my flow.

329
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,073
Didn’t you bring me here midway?

330
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,656
Okay, okay, okay.
I will tell you.

331
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,490
The crux of the matter is…

332
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:37,365
-I…
-You?

333
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:40,198
My childhood… friend…

334
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,906
Oh! Revathi’s matter?

335
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:43,365
Revathi?

336
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:45,573
Revathi?

337
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:48,115
Revathi.

338
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:49,365
Who is she?

339
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,073
Dad! Brother has been in love
with a girl since school.

340
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,740
She is a very nice girl.

341
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,698
She is Driving Instructor
in Prem Driving School.

342
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,448
Wait a minute.
-Hey!

343
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:00,865
-Hey! Where are you going?
-Hey, wait!

344
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,323
That’s okay, son.

345
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:06,573
You wanted to tell me
something important.

346
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,573
What is that?

347
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:13,281
Mom, this is the girl.

348
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,865
What made you hesitate so much?

349
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:18,865
The girl looks like Goddess Lakshmi.

350
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,073
Not that song.

351
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:30,823
This song.

352
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:37,240
It’s my song.

353
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:38,865
Why don’t you let me sing?

354
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,865
Hmm!

355
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,698
“Love at first sight,
that’s how it happened”

356
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:14,865
“As soon as I set my eyes
I fell for the dainty girl”

357
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:20,198
“Drops of memories turn into showers”

358
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:24,031
“Won’t I love to get wet
in childhood memories?”

359
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,740
“Love at first sight,
that’s how it happened”

360
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:34,198
“As soon as I set my eyes
I fell for the dainty girl”

361
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:40,240
“Dewy-eyed with pearly teeth
I swooned at that smile”

362
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,573
“Those two plaits with colourful ribbons,

363
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:49,073
“As they scoop me out with a net,
I stand transfixed”

364
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:25,073
“She is the schoolmate
and then the soulmate”

365
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,865
“She is the schoolmate
and then the soulmate”

366
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:37,323
“She is the schoolmate
and then the soulmate”

367
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:40,740
“She has become a crayon
on the book of my dreams”

368
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:46,865
“Like a love bird she stayed in college”

369
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:52,948
“And promised me a hundred years
of togetherness”

370
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,906
“When someone like her becomes my wife”

371
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:59,906
“What other eminence can my favour be?”

372
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,906
“Shall I put you on a
tik-tok, tik-tok flight?”

373
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:44,115
“And show you my love story
on a large screen?”

374
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:51,865
“The fondness of the princess in palace”

375
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:58,240
“Shall I sing it for you like
the bewitched gardener?”

376
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,115
“Shall I put you on a
tik-tok, tik-tok flight?”

377
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:08,865
“And show you my love story
on a large screen?”

378
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:12,865
Super!

379
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:19,865
Keep this in the van.

380
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:24,365
You want to use the same van?

381
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,531
Hey, that’s wrong.
Withdraw your words.

382
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:28,865
This is Goddess Annapurna who feeds us.

383
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,365
You are super, nephew!
You said it all in a single word.

384
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,323
Your dad had come in the same van
to see your mom.

385
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,865
I asked him the same question.

386
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,948
And then he hit the roof
and preached me for an hour.

387
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,865
Where are you all going?

388
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:41,865
Huh?

389
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:44,865
Where are you going?

390
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:45,865
Dad!

391
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:47,531
Didn’t brother tell you last night?

392
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,073
Ramireddy’s daughter…

393
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,281
School?

394
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,865
Love…you even said
the song was nice.

395
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,865
Hey, was it you in the song?

396
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,198
Hey…

397
00:25:57,573 --> 00:25:59,865
I took you to every location
and showed you, dad!

398
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:01,073
Hey!

399
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:04,323
How many times did I warn you
not to tell me anything when I am drunk?

400
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:05,240
Damn…

401
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,281
Where are you going anyway?

402
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,323
-Husband!
-Hmm?

403
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:11,531
Whole of last night we were telling you
we would be going to see the girl for Shiva.

404
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:12,865
Oh…

405
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,198
Sorry, let me get ready and come.

406
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,073
Ah, please do. Make it fast, dad.

407
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:19,531
By the way,
where did you see the girl?

408
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,865
Hey, Dharmaraju! You…
-Oh my!

409
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:23,865
Loker…
-Ah…going. I am going.

410
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:36,948
In the middle of an engagement…

411
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:41,698
-Shiva!
-Stop!

412
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:42,823
What is it, huh?

413
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:45,323
I am being humiliated
and you simply stand and watch!

414
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,490
As if you know nothing.

415
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:49,865
Look!

416
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:52,656
If it’s all me you want,
walk with me now.

417
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:54,073
I will take good care of you.

418
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,531
Or if you want your dad and ready to do
whatever he says, then marry that guy.

419
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,865
Leave me alone.

420
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:05,323
Let’s go.

421
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,240
Hey, do you think you can do anything
because you are a cop?

422
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,031
Why did you go to the temple yesterday and have
an altercation with Mr Reddy about his daughter?

423
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,115
No altercation, sir.

424
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:26,198
We both are in love.

425
00:28:26,448 --> 00:28:28,448
I went with my parents to ask
for her hand.

426
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:32,365
Why did her father come to the station
to file a case?

427
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,865
Look! If I take his complaint
and raise an FIR,

428
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,865
I will have to arrest your entire family.

429
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,115
You know the rules.

430
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:40,865
See.

431
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:43,906
I convinced him you won’t go
near his daughter again and sent him away.

432
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:45,698
How can you tell him that, sir?

433
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:47,281
Sir, that is my personal issue.

434
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:48,698
Why are you getting involved?

435
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:49,865
Did you just say personal?

436
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:52,281
Shall I write the FIR and arrest you
along with your parents?

437
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:53,448
Sir!

438
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,865
Please don’t try to sound
as if you have done me a great favour.

439
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,365
I know very well why you support them.

440
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:00,823
What do you know? Huh?
What is it that you know?

441
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,073
-Don’t slip your tongue….
-Hey, hey…Sir, sir, sir!

442
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,490
Hey, go out now.

443
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,698
Don’t you know
how to talk to higher officials?

444
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:09,573
Sir, please go in, sir.

445
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:10,490
I will see.

446
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:13,365
Shiva, come here.

447
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:16,865
What was that temper, Shiva?

448
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:18,906
You were ready to catch him by the collar.

449
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:22,073
As if you will forget the girl just because
he promised them? Would she leave you? -Sir!

450
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,823
irrespective of who lodges the complaint,
let him take the same action.

451
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,823
How can justice be different
for rich and poor? Huh?

452
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:28,740
Shiva!
-Huh?

453
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,948
He has already gone inside.
Why do you want to draw him out?

454
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:32,448
You…
-Huh!

455
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,323
There.
Missed calls are meant only for you.

456
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,490
Go and talk.

457
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:40,573
Go and talk.

458
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,198
Why are you calling me again and again?
Huh?

459
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:47,865
Why are you yelling?

460
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:49,031
I want to talk to you.

461
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:50,865
I am at the phone booth outside.
Come there.

462
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,823
You spoke enough at the temple.

463
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:55,073
I have a lot of work now.
I can’t come anywhere. Okay?

464
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,865
I have something very important
to discuss with you. please, come.

465
00:29:58,115 --> 00:29:59,865
Hey! Why don’t you understand?

466
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:01,865
I have a lot of work. I
cannot come.

467
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:03,031
Why are you overdoing it?

468
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,073
Are you coming out now
or shall I come in?

469
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:05,906
Tell me.

470
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Fine, I am coming.

471
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:16,573
Sir, I will have tea and come.

472
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,906
Okay, okay.

473
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:19,740
You can have breakfast too.

474
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:20,865
Sir!

475
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:32,698
What?

476
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,031
I have left home.

477
00:30:35,865 --> 00:30:36,948
Come. Let’s get married.

478
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:39,073
Hey!

479
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:41,865
Didn’t you tell me to walk away with you
dressed as I was?

480
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,823
I came away with nothing except
the churidar on me.

481
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,073
Come, let’s get married.
-Hmm.

482
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:46,865
You can talk.
Now you talk.

483
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,740
When you were supposed to talk,
you kept mum.

484
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,031
Fine, I accept there were elders
there yesterday.

485
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,865
What did my parents do?

486
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:55,823
I trusted you and brought them.

487
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:58,031
Your people were insulting them and…

488
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,281
I had no idea, Shiva.

489
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,531
Ah!

490
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:06,115
You knew nothing and yet you were there
with makeup and glowing, right?

491
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,740
I dressed up
because your parents were coming.

492
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:09,823
Who knows?

493
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:11,656
They proposed going to the temple.

494
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,531
That’s why I asked you
to come and talk.

495
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:15,865
I had no idea
they were all coming, Shiva.

496
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,656
What is it now?

497
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:23,365
Hmm?

498
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:26,073
For the issue created here,

499
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,448
they have arranged
my wedding tomorrow in Tirupati.

500
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,281
Tie the knot with me right now.

501
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:34,865
Hey! Don’t talk crazy.

502
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:38,531
Your dad lodged a complaint
against me and my family.

503
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,448
The SI is torturing me using it.

504
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,323
I can’t come anywhere now.

505
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:44,490
There is no time to think, Shiva.

506
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,865
I cannot live with someone else.

507
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,865
I don’t know what you would do.

508
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,531
But take me away.

509
00:31:58,073 --> 00:31:59,656
Otherwise, I will meet my own fate.

510
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:00,531
Hey!

511
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:08,865
Okay.

512
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:13,323
I will figure out something by tonight.

513
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,906
Hmm?

514
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:29,948
Where is sir coming from?

515
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,448
I went to have tea.

516
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:33,073
Hmm. Nukaraju!
-Sir!

517
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:35,740
You wanted leave for some wedding, right?

518
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,240
You can go.
-The wedding is tomorrow, sir.

519
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:38,865
I am granting you two days leave.

520
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,115
You can go.
-Okay, sir.

521
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:41,865
Shiva, start the vehicle.

522
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:46,490
Did you hear?
Start the vehicle.

523
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:52,490
Go, go.

524
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,073
Take me to DSP’s office.

525
00:33:07,865 --> 00:33:09,531
Okay, Rangappa. I will take care.

526
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,865
Where were you till now?

527
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,865
I was in class.
What happened?

528
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:17,073
Nothing. Go in.

529
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,115
Little further down,
take a right at the temple.

530
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,906
I will take care of everything, Mangalam.

531
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,448
Hear me out.
What is it, dear?

532
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,823
Nothing, dad.
-Okay.

533
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:07,490
Hey, Pinky, come here.
-Yes…

534
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,656
uncle carries the bride
in a basket to the dais.

535
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:11,281
Shiva!
-Sir!

536
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:14,490
What are you doing?
Come and start the vehicle.

537
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,698
Revathi, here. Have it.

538
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:18,073
I will come out and eat.

539
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,740
Not necessary.
Eat right here.

540
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,948
What is happening, mom?

541
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:22,698
Ask me if you want something.

542
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,031
Uh, Shiva!

543
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,865
You are here throughout the day.
Go to the station and attend to your duty.

544
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,573
Sir!
-What?

545
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:41,490
You have done nothing today.

546
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:43,323
You were simply roaming with me.

547
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:45,531
Huh? Go. Go to the station.

548
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,198
I don’t know what you’d do.

549
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:54,240
But take me away.

550
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:58,281
Otherwise, I will meet my own fate.

551
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,865
Where are you, Shiva?

552
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,948
What, Shiva?
Did he have a game?

553
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,073
Sir, has Revathi called?

554
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:12,365
No. Why?

555
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:14,573
Sir, she is getting married
tomorrow in Tirupati.

556
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:15,365
Really?

557
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,281
Sir, if I go to her house alone,

558
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,865
…it would be a problem. Will you come along?
-Mani, sir. Bye. Let’s meet tomorrow.

559
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:22,448
We will go check on her and come. Please.
-Why won’t I come?

560
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,906
-Let’s go.
-Sir…

561
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,115
SI put me on night duty.

562
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:28,448
If I go out,
it might be a problem.

563
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,490
Let’s tell him
we were on night rounds.

564
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,573
-Come.
-Sure?

565
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:33,865
Okay, sir. Let me change and come.
-Okay.

566
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,073
How are you less, Shiva?

567
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:38,198
If you get a promotion,
you will become an SI.

568
00:35:38,948 --> 00:35:40,448
They don’t want an SI, sir.

569
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,698
They want a rich boy
from the same community.

570
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:45,240
As if money can make a family!
Crazy people!

571
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:46,906
Times have changed.

572
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:48,906
The couple should be happy and not…

573
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:49,906
Hey!

574
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,031
Sir, sir, Mani sir!

575
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,115
I hope you are not hurt?

576
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,865
I am not.
Check who they are.

577
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,115
Hey, Raju!

578
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:23,865
Come without creating an issue.

579
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,490
Hey! Get lost!

580
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:27,573
Hey! Hey, stop!

581
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,573
Don’t create a problem and come with me.

582
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:30,865
Hey, let go!

583
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:32,490
Let go! Leave!

584
00:36:34,323 --> 00:36:36,448
How dare you heckle a policeman?
Rogue!

585
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,323
-This does not concern you.
-Hey, let go! Go away!

586
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:42,031
Hey!

587
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:46,906
Hey, you better come with me calmly.

588
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:49,573
Are you going to shoot me?

589
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,865
Hey, I am being kind. Listen to me.
-Hey, gun!

590
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,281
Let go! Let go, man!

591
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,865
Leave the gun!
-Leave it.

592
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,656
Hey! I said leave it.
Hey!

593
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:58,865
Who are you, man?
-Leave it!

594
00:36:58,865 --> 00:36:59,865
Can’t you hear? Hey!

595
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:01,865
Mani sir!

596
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:02,865
Hey!

597
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:07,323
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop!

598
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,740
Stop!
-Hey! Stop!

599
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,865
-Stop right there.
-Hey, don’t. Don’t shoot.

600
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,531
Hey, I am from CBI. He is an accused.
-Hey, wait!

601
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,490
Police here!
-Don’t shoot.

602
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,865
Whatever you want to discuss,
come to the station and discuss

603
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,073
Come to the station and talk
-Hey, listen to me, drop the gun.

604
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:18,698
Drop the gun.
-Hey, I asked you to stop.

605
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,656
Hey, hey, hey! I’m CBI. He is the accused.
-Come to the station and talk.

606
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,115
Don’t shoot him.
Hey…Leave him!

607
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,115
Hey, no! Wait!
-Hey…

608
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,198
Hey, what are you doing?

609
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:27,698
Hey, you! What are you doing?

610
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,656
I am asking you.

611
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:36,031
Hey! Speak up!

612
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:37,323
Do you have a match box?

613
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:44,281
Call for you, madam!
-Who is it?

614
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:45,823
Raju’s younger brother Ravi

615
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:50,740
Rajendar is arrested by the CBI, madam.

616
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:53,073
How?

617
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:59,073
Hey, eat a nice side dish.

618
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:01,865
Hello?

619
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,198
Tell me.

620
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,323
What are you saying?

621
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:09,490
Brother! Police! Run!

622
00:38:09,698 --> 00:38:10,573
Who is it?

623
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:17,865
I only asked for a side dish.

624
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,448
I have been looking for 44 hours.

625
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:20,906
For a side dish?

626
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:22,448
Central Bureau of Investigation.

627
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:28,573
Hey!

628
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:31,448
I was drinking in peace!

629
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:33,115
Drop dead, idiot!

630
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,115
Do you have a matchbox?
-Brother, I don’t have one, brother.

631
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,865
How did you come to the party
without a match box, huh?

632
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:48,281
Brother…
-Bloody!

633
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:52,490
Do you have a matchbox?
-Get lost!

634
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,823
Oh, sorry, sorry. It’s ladies.

635
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:57,573
Do you have a matchbox, boss?

636
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,365
Match box…
-What?

637
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:00,865
Bidi…
-No.

638
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:02,240
Bloody….

639
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,031
How do they attend parties
without a matchbox?

640
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,073
Damn!

641
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:15,865
Who is that?
Who put this in the way again?

642
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:20,198
Who is that again?

643
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,448
He has come again!

644
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:32,573
Hey! Drive to the place I tell you.

645
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:36,115
Ah!

646
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,115
Which area?

647
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:43,198
Sir, let’s go to the hospital.

648
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:44,406
-It’s okay, Shiva.
-Hey, listen to me.

649
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,823
I am a CBI officer.
-Hey, stay calm for a while.

650
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,531
Don’t prattle like a madman.

651
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:49,865
Hello, Mani!
-What CBI?

652
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:50,615
Let’s move, sir!

653
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:52,198
Hey, Mani, listen to me.
-We can go to the hospital later.

654
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,698
Hey, hello!
-First inform the SI.

655
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:54,573
Hey! Don’t shout!

656
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:56,198
Brother, can you keep watch?
-Hey, I am a CBI…

657
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:58,281
-I will make a call to the SI. Hey! Shut up!
-Hey, listen to me.

658
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:00,448
Hey, listen to me. I am a CBI officer, man!
-Hey! Don’t shout!

659
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:02,198
Let me make a phone call.

660
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:04,156
If I get stuck here, it will be a problem.
-He is lying, Don’t listen to him.

661
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:05,198
Hey, shut up!

662
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:07,573
He gives some aunt’s number
and passes it off for CBI number.

663
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,448
Hey! shut up!
-Don’t listen to him.

664
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:11,573
This is all because of you. Hey, hello!
-040…23

665
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,448
Hello, excuse me, hello! Hey! Shut up!
-5143…

666
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:15,198
Shut up!
-You shut up!

667
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,823
Hello?

668
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:26,031
Sir, Shiva speaking from the station.

669
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:27,156
Tell me, Shiva.

670
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:32,156
When Writer Mani
and I were on night rounds,

671
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:34,073
some two guys clipped us with a car, sir.

672
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,865
Clipped?
I hope no one was injured?

673
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,198
No, sir. No one.

674
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,906
Mani sir had a minor injury.

675
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:44,281
What did you do with the two?

676
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,448
They are in the lock up, sir.

677
00:40:45,698 --> 00:40:47,198
One says he is from CBI.

678
00:40:47,198 --> 00:40:48,906
The other says he knows the CM.

679
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:50,198
CM directly?

680
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,281
He doesn’t know MPs and MLAs?

681
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:54,073
They are heavily drunk.

682
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,198
Shall I write the FIR, sir?
-No.

683
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:57,656
I will see to it when I come tomorrow.

684
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,198
Take good care of them.
-Okay, sir.

685
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:05,198
Raju was caught by the CBI.
-When was this, madam?

686
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:06,906
Just now… 25 minutes ago.

687
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:09,156
-Where, madam?
-In Sakinetipalli area.

688
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,073
I don’t care what you do.

689
00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:15,698
There should be no problem by morning.

690
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:17,198
Okay, madam.

691
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:23,156
-Revathi!
-Huh?

692
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,656
Didn’t I ask you to stay in the room?
Where are you going?

693
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:28,698
I am going to the washroom.
You want me to do business in the room?

694
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,656
You are getting married tomorrow.

695
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:32,156
You must drink tonight.

696
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,198
Are you crazy?

697
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:34,698
The wedding is tomorrow.

698
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:36,865
And if I sit with you and drink now,
what will Revathi think of me?

699
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:38,198
She thinks I am a bloody drunkard?

700
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:40,531
You are a bad influence on society, man.
Just on temp…

701
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,573
Hi!

702
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:57,198
Sir!
-Tell me, Shiva.

703
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:58,906
SI sir says he will come tomorrow morning.

704
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:00,823
He said they should be
in the lock up till then.

705
00:42:00,823 --> 00:42:01,698
Okay, Shiva!

706
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:04,156
I am leaving. I have some work.
Can you take care?

707
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,906
I will take care. Please, go ahead.
-Hey!

708
00:42:06,198 --> 00:42:07,156
Hey!

709
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:08,198
Don’t go!

710
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:10,198
Hey, listen to me.

711
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:12,156
Hey, I am CBI officer.

712
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:13,865
He is an accused.

713
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,365
I have to present him to the court.

714
00:42:15,406 --> 00:42:17,073
Hey, let me make a call.

715
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,656
It will be a problem
if I get stuck here.

716
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:20,615
Reserve your stories for the SI tomorrow.

717
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,781
You get drunk and blabber.

718
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:24,281
Hey! Have you any sense?

719
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:26,990
You keep saying you will leave?

720
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,823
Are you even a policeman?
-Hey!

721
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:33,781
When you look into someone’s eyes,
don’t you know if he is a criminal?

722
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,865
Do you know
the number of murders he committed?

723
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:39,906
He threw a bomb at Kakinada station
and killed an SI.

724
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,823
Look up the old cases if you want.

725
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:43,240
You will know who Raj is.
-Hey!

726
00:42:44,198 --> 00:42:45,281
it’s not Raj.

727
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:47,865
Rajuuuu!

728
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:13,781
Hey, do you understand
what I am saying?

729
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:18,781
Four years ago, the gas leakage
at Morampudi junction, was not an accident!

730
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,073
He was behind it.

731
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:20,990
Not just that.

732
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,865
Forty innocent lives were lost in the blast.

733
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:24,781
Do you remember?

734
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:26,198
He was behind it!

735
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:37,990
Hey, not his number.

736
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:39,198
Try the one I gave you.

737
00:43:39,656 --> 00:43:40,906
CM will definitely respond.

738
00:43:41,448 --> 00:43:43,615
Then you will know about Raju.

739
00:43:45,615 --> 00:43:47,406
Hey, this is my higher up, Varghese.

740
00:43:47,448 --> 00:43:48,698
He is my Chief.
Take it.

741
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:51,365
Call him and let him know
we both are here.

742
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:52,198
Listen.

743
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:55,198
He should be handed over
to the CBI court in two days.

744
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,823
We shouldn’t be staying here.

745
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:59,365
Hey, he has the government’s backing.

746
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,656
That’s why I am making a request.

747
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:03,198
Take this and call up my boss immediately.

748
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:04,448
Take it.

749
00:44:05,615 --> 00:44:07,615
Please, go. Go.

750
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:21,990
Krishna! Krishna! Get up!

751
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:23,865
Hey! Krishna! Get up, son!

752
00:44:24,448 --> 00:44:25,531
Fast!

753
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:28,198
Wait, wait. You can’t come in.

754
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,615
He is my son, doctor.

755
00:44:29,698 --> 00:44:31,031
He met with an accident.

756
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,531
Husband! He is our only son.
-Renu! Renu!

757
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:40,198
I can’t live without him.
-Don’t worry! Nothing will happen to him.

758
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:42,198
Hello!

759
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:43,448
Hello?

760
00:44:43,573 --> 00:44:45,198
Uh, Mr Varghese?

761
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:46,531
Yes?

762
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,448
Do you know any George?

763
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:50,823
George?

764
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:52,615
Is George with you?

765
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:53,698
Who are you?

766
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:55,198
Er…No tension.

767
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:57,448
I am calling from Sakinetipalli
police station.

768
00:44:57,656 --> 00:44:58,823
George is safe here.

769
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,531
We arrested him in drunk and drive case.

770
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,573
Arrest?

771
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,156
No, no, no!
What is your name?

772
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:06,073
Shiva. Constable Shiva.

773
00:45:06,448 --> 00:45:07,448
Look here, Shiva.

774
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,531
I am Varghese.
CBI investigative Head.

775
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:12,406
It is not safe for George there.

776
00:45:12,698 --> 00:45:15,448
Please give the phone to him.
Is Raju with him?

777
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:17,198
Yes. Raju is also here.

778
00:45:17,198 --> 00:45:18,031
Shiva?

779
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:19,615
Shiva!

780
00:45:19,615 --> 00:45:20,656
Shiva?

781
00:45:21,156 --> 00:45:22,865
I will ask George to call you. Okay?
-Hello…

782
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:24,198
Hello…

783
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:26,240
-Shiva!
-Sir!

784
00:45:26,406 --> 00:45:27,281
Tell me, sir.

785
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:29,031
The two guys hit you with their car?

786
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,573
-Where are they?
-Yes, sir! They are in lock up.

787
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:31,781
One of them is from CBI.

788
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:33,073
I have just confirmed.
-Okay, okay.

789
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:34,198
Sir, they are in lock up.
-Hmm.

790
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:48,823
Hey, SP!

791
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:50,448
You have come here yourself?

792
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:53,198
Two minutes.
-Take your time!

793
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:55,198
Excuse me, sir.
What’s happening here, sir?

794
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,031
Sir, I am a CBI officer, sir.

795
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,406
I have arrested him legally, sir.

796
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:01,198
If you don’t trust me,
verify with my Chief, sir.

797
00:46:01,406 --> 00:46:02,448
Hey! Hey!

798
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,823
Did you speak to him?
-Softly! Softly.

799
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:05,865
Don’t shout.

800
00:46:06,073 --> 00:46:07,240
CBI?
-Okay, sir. Yes, sir..

801
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:08,615
Please!
-Hmm.

802
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,781
Do it, sir. Carry on, sir. Please.

803
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:12,198
Hey, call Varghese!

804
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:14,198
-Rangappa!
-Sir?

805
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,365
Vacate everyone.

806
00:46:15,448 --> 00:46:16,823
No one should stay here.
-Okay, sir.

807
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:17,781
Go!

808
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:20,031
Constables! All of you leave.
-Gopal and Ramesh!

809
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:21,156
Subbarao! You also leave.

810
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:23,198
-What you need to do now…
-Sir, sir! One of them is from CBI.

811
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,573
-I just spoke to his boss.
-Hey!

812
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,240
I know what is to be done.
Go on.

813
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:28,073
Sir….
-Take him away.

814
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:29,656
Come, Shiva.
-It’s not that, sir.

815
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,656
His Chief has also confirmed just now.
-No, Shiva. Let’s go. Come.

816
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:33,198
No, sir. You carry on. I will come.

817
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:34,406
Shiva, come with us, dear.

818
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:35,698
You go ahead, sir. I will come.

819
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:36,865
Please, carry on.
-Listen to me, son.

820
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:38,531
Shiva, this involves bigwigs.

821
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:40,990
Why do you want to invite headache?
Do you really need this?

822
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,781
Let’s go.
Come, Shiva.

823
00:46:42,906 --> 00:46:44,365
Come, let’s go.

824
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:49,198
Have you reached the location?

825
00:46:49,281 --> 00:46:51,198
Yes, sir.
I’m right here.

826
00:46:51,198 --> 00:46:53,198
Both Raju and the CBI officer are here.

827
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,823
What is the CBI officer saying?

828
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:57,198
He wants to talk to his superior.

829
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,406
You know what is to be done, right?
-Yes, sir. I know.

830
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:06,198
Call me once the job is done.
-Okay, sir.

831
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:08,073
Hey, no one answers the phone!

832
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:09,448
Rangappa, come here.
-Sir?

833
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:17,198
Hey!

834
00:47:58,198 --> 00:47:58,906
Hey!

835
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:02,573
Hey!

836
00:48:03,198 --> 00:48:04,281
Down!

837
00:48:04,698 --> 00:48:06,198
Don’t! Down!

838
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:07,906
Hey!

839
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,906
Hey!

840
00:48:21,656 --> 00:48:22,656
Shiva!

841
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:28,865
Why did you shoot me?

842
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:40,073
Hey! Catch him!

843
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:51,198
Hey…

844
00:50:05,823 --> 00:50:06,531
Hey!

845
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:08,448
Hey!

846
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:14,615
Hey!

847
00:50:23,698 --> 00:50:24,531
Hey!

848
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:28,406
Hey, stop it!

849
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:40,823
Hey, Shiva!

850
00:50:41,198 --> 00:50:42,823
Hey, Shiva, wait!
-Hey! Shiva…

851
00:50:44,156 --> 00:50:46,198
Shiva! Don’t interfere into unwanted things.

852
00:50:46,198 --> 00:50:47,365
Listen to me!

853
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,531
You will invite problems.
Listen to me.

854
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:50,615
Hey, Shiva, wait!

855
00:50:50,865 --> 00:50:52,531
Hey! Hey, wait!
-Sir, what you are doing is wrong.

856
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:54,198
Shiva, open the gate!

857
00:50:54,448 --> 00:50:55,448
Shiva…

858
00:50:55,573 --> 00:50:56,448
Hey!

859
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:02,656
Shiva, you are interfering
in the affairs of powerful people.

860
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:04,156
Open the gate, Shiva.

861
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:05,073
Hey!

862
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:06,906
I say this out of concern.

863
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:09,073
Your entire family will face risk, Shiva!
-Hey, Shiva!

864
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:10,990
Hey, listen to me, man!

865
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,073
Hey, catch him!

866
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:15,573
Hey!

867
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:16,781
Shiva!

868
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:23,198
Shiva! Come, pick up the guns.
-Hmm

869
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:24,906
Coming, sir!
-Come. Come, fast!

870
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,531
We must go to the hospital. Come.
-Come.Get up!

871
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:28,031
Come fast.

872
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:30,156
Let’s go.

873
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:32,156
Why did you shoot me instead of him?
Bloody hell!

874
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:33,073
Quick! Move!

875
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:35,781
Hey, Shiva! Take the guns.

876
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:37,906
Come! Come fast, Shiva!

877
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:39,698
Come! Make it fast!

878
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:41,198
Close that gate!

879
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:44,198
Come fast, Shiva!

880
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:45,198
There is no time.

881
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:46,615
Come, Shiva.
Come on!

882
00:51:47,198 --> 00:51:49,240
Come! Come, come!
Come fast.

883
00:52:03,198 --> 00:52:04,031
Hi!

884
00:52:04,781 --> 00:52:05,656
Hi!

885
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,990
I want to talk to you.

886
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:12,281
Catch!

887
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:17,656
Yuck. No.

888
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:19,615
I want to talk to you.
-Oh!

889
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,573
Talk to me?
-Hmm.

890
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:24,198
Now?
-Yes, now.

891
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:26,198
Okay!
-Come.

892
00:52:26,615 --> 00:52:28,656
Come over there.
-Okay, okay!

893
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,198
Come.
-Okay!

894
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:33,365
Revathi… my Revathi!

895
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:36,198
Where are you, my Revathi?

896
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:39,198
Vicco Vajradanti, Revathi…

897
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,365
Hey, hey! It’s time.
Where is the bottle?

898
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:43,615
It’s in the kitchen.
Drink from the kerosene bottle and die.

899
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,156
Revathi… my Revathi…

900
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:48,198
Where are you, my Revathi?

901
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:49,240
Hey!

902
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:55,198
Actually…

903
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:02,615
Can you… do me a small favour?

904
00:53:03,656 --> 00:53:06,198
I’m willing to help you big favour!

905
00:53:07,198 --> 00:53:08,365
What?

906
00:53:10,198 --> 00:53:11,990
No words are coming out.

907
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:13,906
Only air.

908
00:53:13,906 --> 00:53:15,698
You are so cute!

909
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:21,198
-Sir, your cell phone.
-Okay.

910
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:02,615
What happened?

911
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:06,656
Did Raju’s men come?

912
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:08,990
No, sir. Only one guy.

913
00:54:09,448 --> 00:54:10,365
One guy?

914
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,198
A constable from this station, sir.

915
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,198
Constable from the same station?

916
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,906
What the hell were you doing?

917
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:22,156
Do you have his photo?
-Yes, sir.

918
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:28,198
Do as I tell you.
You won’t have any problem.

919
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,656
-If you say no…
-Dad!

920
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:32,240
Hey, Shiva!

921
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,448
What are you doing at this hour?

922
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:46,781
Hey!

923
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:48,198
Where have you brought me?

924
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:49,656
-Let’s go, dad.
-Let’s go, let’s go.

925
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,198
-Tell me!
-Brought you here for first aid.

926
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:55,823
Come. Come, Shiva.
Come, sir.

927
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:56,865
Please, check.

928
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:00,906
Is he a doctor?
-No.

929
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,573
I am a Mortuary van driver.
-Mortuary?

930
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:05,573
Hey! What’s happening, man?
-Hey, hey! Wait!

931
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:08,156
Hey, we need to do the first aid
and stop your bleeding.

932
00:55:08,198 --> 00:55:09,198
Go ahead, sir.

933
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:10,656
Will he do it?

934
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:12,198
I will do it.
Turn the other way.

935
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:21,156
Sir, I hope the bleeding has stopped?

936
00:55:21,156 --> 00:55:23,281
It will stop for a while.
Take him in the meantime.

937
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:25,073
Okay, dad. I will take care.
Let’s go, sir.

938
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:26,198
-Go ahead.
-Hey!

939
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,156
Is he your son?

940
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,615
Your son is taking a big risk
along with this CBI officer.

941
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:33,865
They will kill him.

942
00:55:34,073 --> 00:55:36,865
-Tell him to leave me.
-This vehicle is not very safe.

943
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,281
Shiva, take our vehicle.

944
00:55:39,698 --> 00:55:40,823
Leave this to me.

945
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:43,573
No matter how risky it gets,
hand him over where you should.

946
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,906
Hey, hey, hey!
What’s happening here?

947
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:47,823
This CBI officer is honest.

948
00:55:48,198 --> 00:55:49,698
So is the cop.

949
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:52,198
Even the mortuary van driver is honest.

950
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:54,198
Bad vibrations all around.

951
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:56,156
You can’t even cross the district.

952
00:55:56,615 --> 00:55:58,198
These two will be killed.

953
00:55:58,198 --> 00:56:00,406
You will bring back your son’s body
in your own van.

954
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:01,365
Hey!

955
00:56:01,865 --> 00:56:04,865
One blow from me
and you will drop dead right here, scoundrel!

956
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:07,656
Carrying a dead body is nothing new
for me or my vehicle.

957
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,781
Please, carry on, sir.
-Hey, gentleman!

958
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:12,198
No, dad. Don’t take him seriously. Go on.
-Why are you getting excited out of context?

959
00:56:13,198 --> 00:56:14,240
You scared me to death!

960
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:16,198
-Dad!
-Huh?

961
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,365
Cops will come home looking for me.

962
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:22,156
Take mom and sister and go away.

963
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,656
I will take care of that.

964
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:27,198
You go ahead.

965
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:29,781
Take care.

966
00:56:44,198 --> 00:56:45,281
Where are we going?

967
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:46,698
To meet Shiva.

968
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:48,531
To Shiva?
-Yes!

969
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,615
I must give him a good dressing down.

970
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:52,073
Why? Can’t he dress himself?

971
00:56:52,156 --> 00:56:54,531
No! I must hit him.
He should be shocked.

972
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:55,823
Okay. Let’s get him beaten.

973
00:56:56,406 --> 00:56:57,865
Not get him beaten.
-Hmm?

974
00:56:57,865 --> 00:56:59,531
You must hit him yourself.

975
00:56:59,781 --> 00:57:02,990
You must thrash him
until he begs you to leave him.

976
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:04,156
I can.

977
00:57:04,198 --> 00:57:07,990
I can. But what if you develop sympathy
for him and change your stance?

978
00:57:09,615 --> 00:57:13,198
Once I make a commitment,
I won’t even heed myself.

979
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:14,448
Wow!

980
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,406
But there has been a lot of gap.

981
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:18,906
To fight?
-To fight solo…

982
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:21,406
Thirty is my minimum number to thrash.

983
00:57:21,406 --> 00:57:23,073
This guy is all by himself.

984
00:57:23,198 --> 00:57:25,031
Okay, fine. Crowd will gather
when I start beating him.

985
00:57:25,198 --> 00:57:26,448
I will beat them up too
in the same breath.

986
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:27,573
But you stay away.

987
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,198
I may end up beating you
in all the excitement.

988
00:57:29,198 --> 00:57:30,906
I am so lucky.

989
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,531
Come on, baby.
Let’s go on the bullet!

990
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:35,865
Br… Br….

991
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:38,448
This song sounds familiar.
Did you compose it?

992
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:41,073
I composed it in the bathroom this morning.
For Prasad.

993
00:57:43,656 --> 00:57:44,573
Hey!

994
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:46,115
CBI!

995
00:57:47,323 --> 00:57:49,948
You are central government.
I am state government.

996
00:57:50,406 --> 00:57:52,073
You are legal.
I am illegal.

997
00:57:52,948 --> 00:57:54,073
That’s the only difference.

998
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:56,448
Our jobs are the same.

999
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:59,323
Hey, I don’t work for politicians like you.

1000
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:01,073
Hey!

1001
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:03,448
You work for politicians too.

1002
00:58:04,323 --> 00:58:05,490
Only you don’t see it.

1003
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,406
Here’s another tune.

1004
00:58:07,406 --> 00:58:11,073
-‘You are too beautiful and I am too hasty’
-Hey, Shiva! Stop, stop. Hey, Shiva!

1005
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,073
I think he has understood it.

1006
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,073
-What happened, Shiva?
-That’s why he stopped the vehicle.

1007
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:17,448
Go ahead, my boy.

1008
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,448
Sir, I will be back in a minute.
-Shiva! What happened?

1009
00:58:19,698 --> 00:58:21,073
-Why did you stop the vehicle?
-I will be back in a minute.

1010
00:58:21,115 --> 00:58:22,281
Shiva!
-Remove the handcuffs.

1011
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:24,073
Hey, shut up!
-Shiva!

1012
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:26,073
Revathi!
-Don’t talk!

1013
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:28,573
Why didn’t you come when I was ready to elope?
-Listen to me.

1014
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,073
Ah! I have heard enough.

1015
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,323
But where are you going at this hour?

1016
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:34,781
I should be asking you that.
What are you doing here at this hour?

1017
00:58:34,948 --> 00:58:37,073
Oh, that!
I ran away from home.

1018
00:58:37,073 --> 00:58:38,115
You ran away?

1019
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,281
But where are you going
in a mortuary van?

1020
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,531
Hey, Shiva!

1021
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:43,865
There is no time. Make it fast.
-Sir…

1022
00:58:44,073 --> 00:58:45,781
Hey, hey! We don’t have time either.

1023
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:47,448
He is a CBI officer.
Show some courtesy.

1024
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,073
Sir! We don’t have time either.

1025
00:58:49,115 --> 00:58:50,115
Is this respect enough?

1026
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,073
There is an accused in the van.

1027
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:54,073
Something big happened.
Try to understand. Please.

1028
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:56,156
I have a bigger problem.

1029
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:58,073
It’s my wedding tomorrow with this guy.
-Of course.

1030
00:58:58,073 --> 00:58:59,073
Shall I marry him?

1031
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:01,323
-Rooms also booked.
-Tell me. Shall I?

1032
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,073
Okay, okay.
-Hey,

1033
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:06,031
Come fast!
-Sir, sir!

1034
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:07,448
Okay! You come along.

1035
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,323
What do you mean?
Hey, hey, hey!

1036
00:59:10,448 --> 00:59:11,323
Crap!

1037
00:59:13,323 --> 00:59:14,240
Who is this?

1038
00:59:15,073 --> 00:59:16,448
Sir, my love, sir.

1039
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:18,323
Love?

1040
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:20,531
A small problem at home.
She ran away.

1041
00:59:21,281 --> 00:59:22,156
Hi, sir.

1042
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:25,281
Elbow cut… round cut.

1043
00:59:26,406 --> 00:59:27,531
Hello!
-Son-in-law!

1044
00:59:27,656 --> 00:59:29,073
My daughter has eloped.

1045
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:31,073
Of course, she is eloping.
-What?

1046
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:33,073
Uh… uh… has she eloped?

1047
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,031
Very shocking.
Very embarrassing.

1048
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,073
Just find where the girl is.

1049
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,740
It doesn’t matter how or with whom.

1050
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:40,115
Just find where.

1051
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:41,156
Ah…

1052
00:59:42,073 --> 00:59:43,073
Shiva!

1053
00:59:43,073 --> 00:59:44,906
She is not Parvathi, man.
She is Revathi.

1054
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,698
I will get back to you, huh?

1055
00:59:47,531 --> 00:59:48,531
Look at her!

1056
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:50,156
The girl left home trusting you.

1057
00:59:50,948 --> 00:59:52,698
You brought me trusting this guy.

1058
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,573
At least now,
set me free and go home happy.

1059
00:59:56,906 --> 00:59:58,156
You are spot on, brother.

1060
00:59:58,448 --> 01:00:01,073
A criminal like you
is able to feel my pain.

1061
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:03,073
This cop cannot.

1062
01:00:03,781 --> 01:00:05,865
Revathi, can you be quiet for a while?

1063
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:07,073
Revathi!

1064
01:00:07,531 --> 01:00:09,406
How long have you been in love with him?

1065
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:12,406
Brother…Actually I have been in love
since my school days.

1066
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:13,573
-Ah?
-Hmm.

1067
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:15,073
Right from school days?

1068
01:00:15,906 --> 01:00:17,073
But very sad!

1069
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,740
In a while, my men will kill you all.

1070
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:22,948
Kill us?

1071
01:00:23,073 --> 01:00:24,073
Yeah.

1072
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,031
Don’t you know the issue?

1073
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:30,156
Your lover beat up the SI,
DSP and SP,

1074
01:00:30,156 --> 01:00:32,781
ruined the police station...

1075
01:00:32,906 --> 01:00:35,073
trusting this guy and brought me away.

1076
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:37,073
SP and DSP?

1077
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:40,073
Did you hit so many people for a stranger?

1078
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,448
I have been in love with you
since we were small.

1079
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,115
Why couldn’t you hit my dad
and abduct me?

1080
01:00:44,115 --> 01:00:46,698
Give me the address, sister.
I will do the job for you.

1081
01:00:47,073 --> 01:00:49,073
Revathi, don’t talk without knowing facts.

1082
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,531
Stay quiet.

1083
01:00:50,531 --> 01:00:51,448
Till when?

1084
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,948
Brother says we are going to be killed.

1085
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:57,323
Does it mean I am going to die
before I could marry you?

1086
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,073
Dear! Can you hold it?

1087
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,073
Once this man is handed over,

1088
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,323
I will personally get you both married.

1089
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:04,865
Really?
-Sure, sure.

1090
01:01:04,906 --> 01:01:05,948
You?

1091
01:01:06,156 --> 01:01:07,240
That’s the end!

1092
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,740
All this is because of him.

1093
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,948
A little longer
and my people will kill you.

1094
01:01:13,323 --> 01:01:15,073
They will take me away safely.

1095
01:01:15,115 --> 01:01:16,240
Brother!
-Don’t trust him.

1096
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,073
You called me brother
without even looking at my face.

1097
01:01:20,865 --> 01:01:22,031
Anyway, sister!

1098
01:01:23,073 --> 01:01:24,156
Rest in peace.

1099
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,781
What are you saying, brother?

1100
01:01:25,906 --> 01:01:27,406
Hey, stop it.

1101
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:29,698
He is trying to frighten you.
Don’t pay him attention.

1102
01:01:29,948 --> 01:01:31,865
Tell me if you are scared.
I will stop the vehicle right now.

1103
01:01:31,948 --> 01:01:33,406
-You can go your way.
-No! No!

1104
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:37,073
I would rather die with you
than marry him.

1105
01:01:37,115 --> 01:01:38,448
Bad choice, sister.

1106
01:01:45,073 --> 01:01:46,781
You go that side!
I will go this way!

1107
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:51,073
No one is here, sir!

1108
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,073
Stop! Stop!
Get in! Get in quickly.

1109
01:01:54,115 --> 01:01:55,323
You don’t have to worry.

1110
01:01:55,323 --> 01:01:56,115
Take care, okay?

1111
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,531
The CBI guy has to go to
the Bangalore CBI court with Raju.

1112
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:03,906
He will definitely not use a police jeep.

1113
01:02:04,073 --> 01:02:07,281
He knows we will inform
all the police stations.

1114
01:02:07,573 --> 01:02:09,781
So, check all the vehicles on the route.

1115
01:02:11,156 --> 01:02:13,031
Have you ever seen
the person in the photo?

1116
01:02:13,073 --> 01:02:16,240
Since he is wounded,
they will definitely stop at a hospital.

1117
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:17,948
Check every hospital.

1118
01:02:18,073 --> 01:02:20,531
If you come across any suspicious vehicle,
stop them and inform me.

1119
01:02:20,573 --> 01:02:21,531
Okay, sir.
-Sir!

1120
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:23,781
We checked his house, sir.

1121
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,948
His parents left home two hours ago.

1122
01:02:26,115 --> 01:02:27,323
He is also a cop.

1123
01:02:27,906 --> 01:02:29,115
Doesn’t he know that much?

1124
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:32,073
His friends, relatives…
enquire everyone.

1125
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,948
Sir, he has no kin except his uncle.

1126
01:02:34,073 --> 01:02:35,406
He too is absconding.

1127
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,531
We enquired at the hospital
his dad works for, sir.

1128
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:38,531
But no clue, sir.

1129
01:02:40,073 --> 01:02:42,406
I need to meet SI Rangappa.
Let me in!

1130
01:02:42,573 --> 01:02:43,906
Or call SI Rangappa here.

1131
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:45,073
-Hey! What is the issue?
-Ramireddy here.

1132
01:02:45,073 --> 01:02:46,323
Local Sarpanch, Ramireddy!

1133
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:48,073
Call the SI! Call the SI!

1134
01:02:48,073 --> 01:02:49,740
Mr Ramireddy, what happened?

1135
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,240
Where is Shiva?
-He is not here.

1136
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:53,948
He eloped with my daughter.
I am filing a kidnap case against him.

1137
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:55,406
Raise an FIR against him right now.

1138
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:57,240
Mr Ramireddy,
there is some other issue going on here.

1139
01:02:57,656 --> 01:02:59,115
He didn’t take Revathi with him.

1140
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:01,115
Son-in-law! Son-in-law!

1141
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,406
Hey, you! Can’t you hear?
Come. Tell him.

1142
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:04,740
What should I tell him?

1143
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,948
Tell sir what happened.

1144
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:11,281
Constable Shiva who works in your station,
sir…took my Revathi, ouch!

1145
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:12,115
Hey!

1146
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:13,073
I took her, sir.

1147
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:14,448
I took her and left her.
I confess.

1148
01:03:16,073 --> 01:03:18,073
I was in love with Revathi
since my childhood, sir.

1149
01:03:18,073 --> 01:03:19,490
Those two were also in love, sir.

1150
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,740
But that’s a different topic.

1151
01:03:20,948 --> 01:03:22,156
Mine was pure love, sir.

1152
01:03:22,781 --> 01:03:24,323
Our wedding was planned in Tirupathi, sir.

1153
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:25,698
But last night,

1154
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:27,073
Revathi looked at me…

1155
01:03:27,406 --> 01:03:28,698
and called me sir.
-Hey, son-in-law!

1156
01:03:28,781 --> 01:03:30,281
I thought the same, father-in-law.

1157
01:03:30,448 --> 01:03:33,240
She drew me close
and asked me to take her somewhere, sir.

1158
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,115
I hoped we might get physical
and took her to Palem bridge, sir.

1159
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,781
He appeared there, sir.

1160
01:03:38,073 --> 01:03:40,073
He came; he stopped; he spoke;
and escaped.

1161
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:41,906
He came; he stopped; he spoke;
and escaped.

1162
01:03:41,906 --> 01:03:42,948
He came, he…
-Hey, come to the point.

1163
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,490
Revathi is supposed to be with me
lively and glowing.

1164
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:48,906
But she got into a mortuary van
and left with him like a dead body, sir!

1165
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:50,656
These are not the times
for pure lovers, sir.

1166
01:03:50,698 --> 01:03:51,448
Drat!

1167
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,698
Pure love never dies.
Am I right, father-in-law?

1168
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,240
I am always truly in love with her.
-Hey!

1169
01:03:55,656 --> 01:03:57,531
Was there anyone else
in the mortuary van?

1170
01:03:58,323 --> 01:03:59,656
Words don’t come out.

1171
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:01,115
Only the air is passing.
-Hey!

1172
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:04,448
-Trace the mortuary van.
-On it, sir.

1173
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:06,490
-Enquire in the vicinity of Palem bridge.
-Okay, sir.

1174
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:15,073
What happened?
-Sir, the radiator is overheated.

1175
01:04:15,073 --> 01:04:16,156
We need water.
-Okay!

1176
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:18,073
-I will check in the shop and get it.
-Come back fast.

1177
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,490
No, take your own time.

1178
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,865
Hey! Your mouth…

1179
01:04:21,073 --> 01:04:22,073
You carry on, Shiva!

1180
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:28,073
Tell me. Is there…

1181
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,573
Sir, the mortuary van was seen on
Donakonda road a while ago, sir.

1182
01:04:30,573 --> 01:04:31,448
Proceeding. Over.

1183
01:04:39,948 --> 01:04:42,073
Brother! Let me take some water.
The radiator is overheated.

1184
01:04:42,073 --> 01:04:43,073
Please, take.

1185
01:04:43,115 --> 01:04:45,406
Shiva, long time no see?

1186
01:04:45,573 --> 01:04:47,073
Heard some criminal has escaped?

1187
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:48,656
Have they sent you to catch him?

1188
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,531
Nothing. The radiator is overheated.

1189
01:04:50,656 --> 01:04:51,740
I came for water.

1190
01:04:51,906 --> 01:04:53,240
Why are you using dad’s vehicle?

1191
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,906
Uh, the jeep broke down.
So, I am using dad’s.

1192
01:04:56,281 --> 01:04:58,865
Constable Shiva has escaped
with criminal Raju.

1193
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:00,531
If anyone finds him,
please alert the others.

1194
01:05:01,948 --> 01:05:03,115
Shiva, surrender!
-Sir!

1195
01:05:03,448 --> 01:05:05,073
This is in your best interest.
Surrender immediately. -Let go!

1196
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:06,073
Hey!

1197
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,281
Hey!

1198
01:05:32,073 --> 01:05:33,656
Shiva! Come fast. Come on!

1199
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:36,323
What happened?
-Police sir.

1200
01:05:36,323 --> 01:05:37,698
They are almost here.
-Oh, my God!

1201
01:05:37,865 --> 01:05:38,656
Be quick.

1202
01:05:40,865 --> 01:05:41,781
Start the van, Shiva.

1203
01:05:41,781 --> 01:05:43,448
Make it fast, Shiva.
They are reaching.

1204
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:45,073
-Fast, Shiva.
-Start the van, Shiva!

1205
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,531
Hey, Shiva!
Watch your left.

1206
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:28,240
Block the road. Block it.
They are here.

1207
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:29,740
Block the north side!

1208
01:06:44,406 --> 01:06:45,240
Move it!

1209
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:54,115
Shiva!

1210
01:06:56,406 --> 01:06:57,281
Hey!

1211
01:06:57,323 --> 01:06:59,073
Hey! What are you doing?
-Stop the van!

1212
01:06:59,073 --> 01:07:00,073
-Let go!
-Let go!

1213
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,073
-Hey, Raju! Let go.
-Hey, Raju! Let go!

1214
01:07:03,073 --> 01:07:04,865
Keep driving. Look ahead!
-Stop the van!

1215
01:07:04,906 --> 01:07:06,073
Hey, Shiva! Look ahead!
-Raju!

1216
01:07:06,073 --> 01:07:07,656
Shiva! Look ahead!

1217
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:08,865
Hey, Shiva! Shiva!

1218
01:08:15,156 --> 01:08:16,240
Go the other side!

1219
01:08:20,073 --> 01:08:22,031
Check if there is a way out.
-Yes, sir. Let’s go!

1220
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:23,073
Hey!

1221
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:24,448
You go this side!

1222
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:25,573
Partner!

1223
01:08:26,073 --> 01:08:27,031
Here!

1224
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,323
Hey, partner!

1225
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:32,073
It’s Raju!
It’s been long since I saw you.

1226
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:36,115
It’s me… Raju!

1227
01:08:36,573 --> 01:08:37,698
Sorry, Raju!

1228
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:39,156
Hey!

1229
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:20,073
Hey! Come, come!

1230
01:09:34,906 --> 01:09:36,115
Sir, what are you doing, sir?

1231
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:37,573
Hey, wait.

1232
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:40,073
Sir, what are you doing, sir?
Sir, open the door.

1233
01:09:40,115 --> 01:09:41,531
I can’t do it, Shiva.

1234
01:09:42,573 --> 01:09:43,490
I am hit.

1235
01:09:43,573 --> 01:09:45,115
Open the door.
I will take care.

1236
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
You guys carry on.
-How can we do that without you, sir?

1237
01:09:47,323 --> 01:09:50,073
He should be in the Bangalore court
by tomorrow morning.

1238
01:09:50,073 --> 01:09:50,906
Get going.

1239
01:09:50,906 --> 01:09:52,531
Ah! Please open the door, sir.

1240
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,573
Hey, if you were hit,

1241
01:09:57,073 --> 01:09:58,281
I would leave you and go.

1242
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,490
There is no time to waste.
Get going, Shiva.

1243
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:02,490
-Trust me, sir. Please open the door.
-Move! Hey!

1244
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,073
Do you hear me?

1245
01:10:04,073 --> 01:10:05,573
I will become a baggage for you.

1246
01:10:06,073 --> 01:10:08,073
Hey! They are getting near.
Move.

1247
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,281
It’s an order! Move! Move!
-Sir!

1248
01:10:10,531 --> 01:10:11,781
Go! It’s an order! Go!

1249
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:33,073
Raju!

1250
01:11:34,656 --> 01:11:35,740
My friend!

1251
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,031
Can you hear me?

1252
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,448
See where you have landed yourself?

1253
01:11:43,906 --> 01:11:45,448
You were a terror in the state.

1254
01:11:45,573 --> 01:11:47,073
Today you hide in a narrow lane.

1255
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,073
How many times have I told you?

1256
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,031
Not to roam in public
and not to go out of jurisdiction?

1257
01:11:52,031 --> 01:11:52,781
Did you pay heed?

1258
01:11:52,906 --> 01:11:54,323
Not the CBI got to you.

1259
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:58,740
How many have we killed together?

1260
01:11:59,656 --> 01:12:00,531
See the irony.

1261
01:12:00,906 --> 01:12:02,323
I am forced to kill you.

1262
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:04,073
What can I do?

1263
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:06,073
It’s orders from above.

1264
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Don’t feel!

1265
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,781
What is this, Raju?

1266
01:12:11,906 --> 01:12:13,156
How fearless you were?

1267
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,740
Afraid of me,

1268
01:12:16,323 --> 01:12:19,073
you hide behind
after all a constable.

1269
01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:24,240
I want to see your frightened face.

1270
01:12:24,865 --> 01:12:26,073
Let me see your face.

1271
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:27,906
Come out!

1272
01:12:37,406 --> 01:12:38,323
Raju!

1273
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:41,031
Not Raju…

1274
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,323
Rajuuuu!

1275
01:12:44,115 --> 01:12:45,656
As if I don’t it, partner!

1276
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:47,031
Hey, Raju!

1277
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,948
Hey, hey! No!

1278
01:12:51,073 --> 01:12:52,156
Hey, hey!

1279
01:12:57,656 --> 01:12:59,948
-It’s Raju, man!
-Hey, hey! Raju, stop!

1280
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,531
Raju!

1281
01:13:11,531 --> 01:13:12,406
Hey!

1282
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,698
Hey!

1283
01:14:25,073 --> 01:14:26,740
Hey, hey! Let go!

1284
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:56,573
Revathi!

1285
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,240
Shiva!

1286
01:15:33,698 --> 01:15:34,740
Revathi!

1287
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:35,865
Revathi!

1288
01:15:44,865 --> 01:15:46,031
Revathi!

1289
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:33,750
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!

1290
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:36,958
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!

1291
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:39,916
Namaste.

1292
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:41,166
-Namaste, madam
-Namaste.

1293
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,625
He is upstairs.
You can go.

1294
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:54,666
Hmm!

1295
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,625
Namaste, uncle.

1296
01:16:58,208 --> 01:16:59,625
Hmm. Please, come, dear.

1297
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,458
How are you?
-Hmm.

1298
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,541
Are all your problems cleared?

1299
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:06,541
They will be, uncle.

1300
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:12,500
It took your dad and me a herculean effort
to launch this Party.

1301
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:19,375
At a time when it was unthinkable for a local
party to exist against a national party,

1302
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,541
we established our Party.

1303
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,541
The trust in your dad...

1304
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,541
and the sympathy for his death,

1305
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,791
made you the CM.

1306
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:32,791
But…

1307
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:35,000
because of the mistakes you have made,

1308
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:40,333
the centre wants to use CBI
and close our Party.

1309
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:41,541
Don’t worry.

1310
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:44,791
I will step out of the court tomorrow
after proving my innocence.

1311
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,250
How will you do that, huh?

1312
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:48,416
They have your entire history.

1313
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,375
It’s a report they have collected
for four years.

1314
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,375
That is not sufficient.

1315
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,500
The court needs proofs.

1316
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:57,541
Is it?

1317
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,541
That man… uh, who is that?

1318
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,041
Uh, Raju?
-He won’t turn up.

1319
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,958
He won’t exist.

1320
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,250
After 24 hours,

1321
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,541
no one can even prove a person
called Raju ever existed.

1322
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:11,125
Don’t get me wrong.

1323
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,333
Even if you lose,
it won’t hurt us.

1324
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:18,958
But if a situation arises
when the Party might lose…

1325
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,791
I know.

1326
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:22,750
Party is most important for me too.

1327
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,875
I will meet you after the court tomorrow.

1328
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,541
Actually…

1329
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,708
the elections are round the corner.

1330
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,000
Don’t make us look for another CM candidate.

1331
01:18:38,791 --> 01:18:46,541
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!
-Hail! CM Dakshayani!

1332
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:49,000
What is happening, Nataraj?
-Madam!

1333
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:51,041
I have killed the CBI officer, madam.

1334
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,708
But Raju…

1335
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:56,208
Has escaped with a constable
called Shiva, madam.

1336
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:58,125
Damn! Are you not ashamed?

1337
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:00,541
We are running short of time, Nataraj.

1338
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:01,750
If Raju is caught,

1339
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,541
you, me and everyone will be caught.

1340
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:08,000
Look! You have time till tonight.

1341
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:12,208
Use the entire police department
or do whatever you want.

1342
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,541
Raju must die.

1343
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,916
If the police department is not enough,

1344
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:20,000
use the goons and all the party activists.

1345
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,708
I want… Raju… dead!

1346
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,166
I will take care of it, madam.

1347
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,988
Why are you carrying that gun
with no bullets?

1348
01:19:47,013 --> 01:19:47,482
Hmm?

1349
01:19:47,507 --> 01:19:48,466
Simply.

1350
01:19:49,811 --> 01:19:51,269
Can it be done, Shiva?

1351
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:53,852
Evading all of them…

1352
01:19:54,477 --> 01:19:55,644
can it be done?

1353
01:19:57,102 --> 01:19:58,102
It can be. Come.

1354
01:19:59,144 --> 01:19:59,977
It won’t.

1355
01:20:00,894 --> 01:20:02,936
If you want to live happily together,

1356
01:20:03,727 --> 01:20:05,102
leave me and go.

1357
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:07,061
I will take care of myself.

1358
01:20:08,144 --> 01:20:09,477
I will take care of all that.

1359
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:10,852
What?

1360
01:20:11,727 --> 01:20:12,936
Trying to be a hero?

1361
01:20:13,436 --> 01:20:14,352
Very difficult.

1362
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,436
At least you tell him, sister.

1363
01:20:16,852 --> 01:20:18,144
To leave me and go.

1364
01:20:18,477 --> 01:20:19,686
You will be better off.

1365
01:20:23,477 --> 01:20:24,477
What are you looking at?

1366
01:20:26,477 --> 01:20:27,727
I really mean it.

1367
01:20:28,144 --> 01:20:30,352
You came for him despite knowing
how risky it is.

1368
01:20:31,352 --> 01:20:33,352
I understood how much you love him.

1369
01:20:35,894 --> 01:20:37,477
At least your love must win.

1370
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:39,977
‘At least your love?’
-Hmm.

1371
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:41,894
So, do you have a love story too?

1372
01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:43,352
Where is she?

1373
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:47,144
Tell me, brother.

1374
01:20:47,852 --> 01:20:49,977
That’s one side love.

1375
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:51,894
Doesn’t the girl know?

1376
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:53,477
You should have told her.

1377
01:20:54,352 --> 01:20:56,686
I wanted to. But I couldn’t.

1378
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,477
-But unless you say it…
-Hey, Revathi!

1379
01:20:59,144 --> 01:21:00,477
Stay quiet for a while.

1380
01:21:02,477 --> 01:21:04,561
Brother, who is she?

1381
01:21:06,477 --> 01:21:07,477
CM!

1382
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:09,477
CM?
-Yeah!

1383
01:21:11,144 --> 01:21:12,644
Huh?
-Yes.

1384
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:15,436
The same CM who wanted to kill me.

1385
01:21:15,477 --> 01:21:17,436
Had I told her,
probably this wouldn’t happen.

1386
01:21:17,436 --> 01:21:18,477
You are super, brother.

1387
01:21:18,477 --> 01:21:21,644
Hey, he talks some rubbish
and you believe him.

1388
01:21:22,519 --> 01:21:24,269
Not rubbish. It’s true.

1389
01:21:24,477 --> 01:21:25,477
Yes, Shiva.

1390
01:21:25,644 --> 01:21:29,352
When he talks about her,
I saw true love in his eyes for her.

1391
01:21:29,477 --> 01:21:30,644
You have seen, right? Huh?

1392
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,144
Have you? Super.

1393
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:33,811
Now, shut up and walk.

1394
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:36,477
First think how to get out of here safe.

1395
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:37,894
That’s not possible.

1396
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:41,144
With me,
you can’t even cross the district.

1397
01:21:42,269 --> 01:21:44,102
I thought he came to rescue me.

1398
01:21:45,061 --> 01:21:45,936
Tsk!

1399
01:21:45,977 --> 01:21:48,144
But…anyway,
I will ask my younger brother to come.

1400
01:21:48,644 --> 01:21:49,936
I will take care of myself.

1401
01:21:50,477 --> 01:21:51,477
Take her and go.

1402
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:55,186
I feel his words have a ring of truth, Shiva.

1403
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:58,686
I have no faith that we will safely overcome
all these obstacles.

1404
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:00,936
I have.

1405
01:22:01,477 --> 01:22:02,811
No matter what happens,

1406
01:22:03,644 --> 01:22:06,144
I won’t let go
until he is handed over to the court.

1407
01:22:06,477 --> 01:22:07,894
Hey! Drat!

1408
01:22:08,477 --> 01:22:10,894
Why do you keep repeating the same thing?
Have you no sense?

1409
01:22:11,186 --> 01:22:12,477
Leave me. Let go!

1410
01:22:14,477 --> 01:22:15,436
Shiva!

1411
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:20,519
How many times should I tell you?

1412
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:21,894
Don’t you have any sense?

1413
01:22:26,144 --> 01:22:27,102
Shiva!

1414
01:22:33,186 --> 01:22:34,894
Shiva! Stop it!

1415
01:22:35,352 --> 01:22:36,144
Shiva!

1416
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:39,436
Please…
-Hey!

1417
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:41,519
Why do you hit me
on the wound again and again?

1418
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:42,936
Hey, wait. Wait, wait!

1419
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:44,894
Shiva! Please!

1420
01:22:45,186 --> 01:22:46,269
Stop fighting!

1421
01:22:46,436 --> 01:22:47,936
What are you both fighting for?

1422
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:52,936
Why are you so keen on responsibility
no one seems to care in your department?

1423
01:22:53,727 --> 01:22:55,311
He sounds logical.

1424
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:56,811
Let’s leave him and go.

1425
01:22:58,352 --> 01:22:59,852
You are most important to me, Shiva.

1426
01:23:00,269 --> 01:23:01,519
How can you ask me to leave him?

1427
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,311
Huh? How can you?

1428
01:23:04,477 --> 01:23:07,352
After knowing he killed my brother,
how can I leave him?

1429
01:23:09,365 --> 01:23:10,186
Damn!

1430
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,144
What did my brother do to you?

1431
01:23:51,186 --> 01:24:02,477
“Don’t you call us brothers
for we are far better friends”

1432
01:24:03,061 --> 01:24:05,894
“He is the light
And I am the shade”

1433
01:24:06,102 --> 01:24:08,727
“He is the step
And I am the support”

1434
01:24:09,186 --> 01:24:14,519
“Through times eternal
Our bonding shall stay as strong”

1435
01:24:15,269 --> 01:24:22,811
“Don’t you call us brothers
We will never agree, never ever”

1436
01:25:12,092 --> 01:25:17,437
“If you ask for the light of my life
I shall point towards him”

1437
01:25:18,144 --> 01:25:23,477
“Without him
I am so incomplete”

1438
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:29,477
“Pleading with my mom
I am born as his kid brother”

1439
01:25:30,436 --> 01:25:35,811
“Asking God for his sake
I shall bring the month of spring”

1440
01:25:36,269 --> 01:25:44,727
“If there is a next life,
I shall be his big brother and keep him close”

1441
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:59,477
“Don’t you call us brothers
for we are far better friends”

1442
01:26:00,061 --> 01:26:02,686
“He is the light
And I am the shade”

1443
01:26:03,144 --> 01:26:05,727
“He is the step
And I am the support”

1444
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:11,269
“Through times eternal
Our bonding shall stay as strong”

1445
01:26:12,477 --> 01:26:20,686
“Don’t you call us brothers
We will never agree, never ever”

1446
01:26:32,686 --> 01:26:34,352
Half of it is mine.
-Chuck it, man.

1447
01:26:34,936 --> 01:26:36,102
You know better.

1448
01:26:36,477 --> 01:26:38,352
I want to become a cop.
An SI to be specific.

1449
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:40,477
And I want to serve public.

1450
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:43,977
Everything is falling into place just now.

1451
01:26:44,477 --> 01:26:45,477
Hey, Vishnu.

1452
01:26:46,102 --> 01:26:47,936
This serious acting doesn’t suit you, man.

1453
01:26:48,477 --> 01:26:49,727
Be the jolly guy that you are.

1454
01:26:49,894 --> 01:26:51,269
Hmm? Why this charade?

1455
01:26:51,477 --> 01:26:53,144
-Happy for you, man.
-Thank you.

1456
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:57,811
-Hey!
-Hi!

1457
01:26:58,644 --> 01:27:00,644
Has Sirkanth come?
-Everybody is on the ground. Only we are late.

1458
01:27:00,686 --> 01:27:03,144
Shiva! Get your dad’s medicines
from the town.

1459
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:05,686
Mom, dad work for a government hospital.

1460
01:27:05,686 --> 01:27:07,477
Can’t he get them there?
I have a match, mom.

1461
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:09,269
Hey, you get these medicines only there.

1462
01:27:09,352 --> 01:27:14,144
All the time you are either on the roads,
or at the ground with all of them behind.

1463
01:27:14,477 --> 01:27:16,269
-No other job! Take this!
-Hey…

1464
01:27:16,352 --> 01:27:18,727
Mom! You could have told me yesterday.
I would have gone.

1465
01:27:18,936 --> 01:27:21,477
Hey! Look at my Sachin Tendulkar!
Get going.

1466
01:27:21,811 --> 01:27:22,977
Hey! Go to the ground.

1467
01:27:23,144 --> 01:27:24,519
I will buy medicines and come.
-Okay, man.

1468
01:27:24,519 --> 01:27:26,477
Hey, if we win the toss, choose batting.

1469
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:28,061
-Okay?
-Okay. -Okay.

1470
01:27:33,186 --> 01:27:34,269
Hey, Vishnu…

1471
01:27:34,477 --> 01:27:36,644
Mom asked wants medicines
from the town for dad.

1472
01:27:37,102 --> 01:27:38,477
Go and get them. Okay?
-Hey, hey, hey!

1473
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,977
Hey! Your sister-in-law is waiting for me.

1474
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:42,936
We have to finalise the invitation.
Here.

1475
01:27:43,477 --> 01:27:44,477
Oh!

1476
01:27:44,727 --> 01:27:47,477
So, your wedding is more important
than dad’s health.

1477
01:27:47,519 --> 01:27:49,144
Hey, are you senseless?

1478
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:51,269
Hey, you are not even married!

1479
01:27:51,477 --> 01:27:52,477
And you have changed already?

1480
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:53,477
-Mom!
-Hey!

1481
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:54,644
-He is changing a lot.
-Stop it!

1482
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,061
I don’t know how he is going to be
after the wedding. Watch out. -Shh…

1483
01:27:57,144 --> 01:27:58,977
Don’t fight. Either of you go get them.
-How could you do this?

1484
01:27:59,061 --> 01:28:01,436
There! She told you to get them.
Huh? Buy them quickly, okay?

1485
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:02,477
Hey, hey, hey!

1486
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,477
Your sister-in-law is waiting for me, man.
I have been telling you this.

1487
01:28:04,477 --> 01:28:06,061
Hey…Mr Vishnu!

1488
01:28:06,727 --> 01:28:08,686
You are the boss of the house after dad.

1489
01:28:08,811 --> 01:28:10,436
All responsibilities you take care, man.

1490
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:11,477
Okay? Come on.

1491
01:28:11,727 --> 01:28:13,477
Hey! Let’s go!
-Hey, let’s go.

1492
01:28:13,852 --> 01:28:15,102
You are a silent killer, man!

1493
01:28:15,811 --> 01:28:17,352
You put me in a fix every time.

1494
01:28:17,477 --> 01:28:19,352
Hey, you won’t even win the toss.
-Okay, okay!

1495
01:28:19,436 --> 01:28:20,561
-Even if you do, you won’t be able to play.
-Okay, bye.

1496
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:22,269
You will be duck out.
-Thank you. Thank you, man.

1497
01:28:22,311 --> 01:28:24,144
-Hey! Duck out is confirmed!
-Bye!

1498
01:28:24,436 --> 01:28:25,269
Hey!

1499
01:28:30,436 --> 01:28:31,727
Hello, milk society…

1500
01:28:31,977 --> 01:28:33,311
Hey, milk booth!
It’s me.

1501
01:28:33,477 --> 01:28:34,436
Where are you?

1502
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:35,352
Sorry, dear!

1503
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:36,936
I must get tablets for dad.

1504
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:39,144
I will drop them at home
and come immediately.

1505
01:28:39,352 --> 01:28:40,186
Hey…

1506
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:41,852
Believe me!
I will be there in no time.

1507
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:44,186
Love you. Give me a kiss.
-Hmm?

1508
01:28:44,477 --> 01:28:45,811
Fine. I know you won’t.

1509
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:47,102
Hang up now.

1510
01:29:00,186 --> 01:29:01,144
Baby!

1511
01:29:47,477 --> 01:29:48,352
Hey!

1512
01:29:56,811 --> 01:29:58,311
Hey, come! Come fast!

1513
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:01,477
Get down! Move! Quick.

1514
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:03,977
Hey, kid! Come to me.
Come. Fast!

1515
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:17,477
Hey, don’t be afraid.

1516
01:30:19,477 --> 01:30:20,352
Madam!

1517
01:30:20,644 --> 01:30:21,477
Come.

1518
01:30:23,144 --> 01:30:24,686
Please take this boy.
Quick!

1519
01:30:29,519 --> 01:30:30,477
Hey!

1520
01:30:45,477 --> 01:30:46,477
Hey, Shiva!

1521
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:49,144
There was a bomb blast
at Morampudi junction.

1522
01:30:49,186 --> 01:30:50,477
There are many casualties.

1523
01:30:51,477 --> 01:30:53,477
Hey, hey! Vishnu!

1524
01:30:53,519 --> 01:30:57,477
[indistinct voices]

1525
01:30:58,811 --> 01:31:00,144
Vishnu!
-Go back.

1526
01:31:00,311 --> 01:31:00,977
Vishnu!

1527
01:31:01,102 --> 01:31:02,477
Hey, step back!

1528
01:31:02,644 --> 01:31:03,644
Vishnu!

1529
01:31:04,102 --> 01:31:05,311
Vishnu…
-Wait, wait!

1530
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:06,936
Vishnu!

1531
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:08,311
Madam, move aside!

1532
01:31:08,352 --> 01:31:09,311
Vishnu?

1533
01:31:11,436 --> 01:31:12,811
Hey, move back
-Hey, wait!

1534
01:31:13,061 --> 01:31:13,977
Vishnu?

1535
01:31:14,061 --> 01:31:15,144
Wait!
-Go!

1536
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:18,811
Hello, don’t go! You are allowed to go!

1537
01:31:19,852 --> 01:31:20,561
Vishnu…?

1538
01:31:20,686 --> 01:31:22,477
Sir, sir, please step back.
-Vishnu…?

1539
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,477
Please go back!
Please, sir!

1540
01:31:24,477 --> 01:31:25,352
Come fast! Wait!
Vishnu!

1541
01:31:25,352 --> 01:31:26,477
Ambulance!

1542
01:31:26,936 --> 01:31:30,061
[Indistinct voices]

1543
01:31:30,269 --> 01:31:33,561
Vishnu!
-Ambulance, come faster!

1544
01:31:33,727 --> 01:31:35,477
Vishnu!
-Hurry up, hurry up!

1545
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:36,894
Vishnu!

1546
01:31:38,102 --> 01:31:39,477
Please wait!
Go back.

1547
01:31:39,477 --> 01:31:40,477
Vishnu!

1548
01:31:41,477 --> 01:31:42,936
Vishnu! Vishnu!

1549
01:31:43,186 --> 01:31:44,477
Vishnu, speak, man.

1550
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:46,311
Vishnu!

1551
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:51,144
Ambulance! Please put him in quickly.

1552
01:31:54,061 --> 01:31:55,811
Vishnu… Vishnu…
Vishnu, you will be fine.

1553
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:57,686
Attend to him, nurse. Please.

1554
01:31:58,686 --> 01:32:00,852
You sent me and you escaped, huh?

1555
01:32:01,352 --> 01:32:02,311
Hmm?

1556
01:32:02,977 --> 01:32:03,894
Hey…

1557
01:32:07,644 --> 01:32:08,727
Don’t say that, man.

1558
01:32:08,852 --> 01:32:10,144
Hey, don’t cry, man.

1559
01:32:10,352 --> 01:32:11,477
I was kidding.

1560
01:32:11,686 --> 01:32:13,352
Hey, nothing has happened to you!
-I said for fun.

1561
01:32:15,852 --> 01:32:17,352
If I am gone, it’s all you.

1562
01:32:19,477 --> 01:32:21,894
-Mom, dad, sister…
-Hey…

1563
01:32:22,186 --> 01:32:24,936
You must take care of them all.

1564
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:27,061
Hey, hey! Brother,
don’t speak like that, brother. Please.

1565
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:28,894
Trust me and have courage, brother.

1566
01:32:28,894 --> 01:32:30,936
Nothing has happened to you, brother.
Have courage, brother. Please.

1567
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:31,936
What, man?

1568
01:32:32,352 --> 01:32:33,894
Where did this brother come from?

1569
01:32:34,436 --> 01:32:35,186
Huh?

1570
01:32:35,936 --> 01:32:37,477
Because I am going to die?

1571
01:32:38,477 --> 01:32:39,686
Hey! Hey!

1572
01:32:39,936 --> 01:32:41,477
What makes you talk like this?

1573
01:32:41,477 --> 01:32:42,727
Are you crazy?

1574
01:32:42,852 --> 01:32:44,477
Who is going to die?
No one is going to die.

1575
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:45,727
I am here. Be brave.

1576
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,977
Bro, bro! Please, come fast, bro.

1577
01:32:48,061 --> 01:32:49,144
Go faster!

1578
01:32:49,311 --> 01:32:51,352
Your sister-in-law must be waiting for me.

1579
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:53,144
It’s good that…

1580
01:32:54,186 --> 01:32:55,727
This happened before the wedding.

1581
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,061
What are you saying, man?
Nothing is wrong with you.

1582
01:32:58,144 --> 01:32:59,477
We will go to the hospital in five minutes.

1583
01:32:59,477 --> 01:33:00,519
Everything will be fine.

1584
01:33:00,561 --> 01:33:02,269
I will take you back home.

1585
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:03,811
Okay?
Nothing will happen to you, man.

1586
01:33:06,269 --> 01:33:07,811
Hey, hey, hey!

1587
01:33:08,477 --> 01:33:10,061
Please, don’t cry.
-I had great dreams.

1588
01:33:10,144 --> 01:33:12,936
-Hey…please, don’t cry.
To become a policeman…S.I…

1589
01:33:14,311 --> 01:33:17,102
-Calm down, man.
-And serve the public until I die.

1590
01:33:17,936 --> 01:33:20,436
Hey, Vishnu!
You will certainly help them. Okay?

1591
01:33:20,811 --> 01:33:22,811
Listen to me.
You will certainly help them.

1592
01:33:23,894 --> 01:33:27,102
You will certainly help them.
-Okay, sir! Yes, sir!

1593
01:33:28,727 --> 01:33:29,811
Please wait for a minute!

1594
01:33:29,894 --> 01:33:32,061
Hey, hey, hey, what happened?
Why did you stop?

1595
01:33:32,144 --> 01:33:33,519
Clear the vehicles!

1596
01:33:33,561 --> 01:33:35,477
It’s emergency, brother!
We need to rush.

1597
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:37,519
-Hey! Hey… hey, Vishnu!
-Please, brother!

1598
01:33:37,519 --> 01:33:39,936
Clear the vehicles and give us the way!
-Vishnu! Hey!

1599
01:33:40,186 --> 01:33:41,477
Nurse, he just spoke to me.

1600
01:33:41,811 --> 01:33:44,061
What happened?
-Let me check…

1601
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:46,477
Vishnu! Vishnu!

1602
01:33:46,477 --> 01:33:47,811
Bro, make it fast, bro.

1603
01:33:47,852 --> 01:33:49,686
Bro, please make it fast, bro!
Please! Hey!

1604
01:33:51,852 --> 01:33:52,727
Vishnu…

1605
01:34:16,936 --> 01:34:20,352
My brother died
and so I got his police job.

1606
01:34:23,352 --> 01:34:25,727
All that my brother wanted to do
as an ideal cop,

1607
01:34:27,269 --> 01:34:29,061
I started doing it for him.

1608
01:34:31,477 --> 01:34:32,894
For their own selfish motives,

1609
01:34:32,936 --> 01:34:34,477
they killed so many people
including my brother,

1610
01:34:34,477 --> 01:34:36,311
and made believe it was an accident.

1611
01:34:38,436 --> 01:34:41,102
The moment I discovered he is the reason
for my brother’s death,

1612
01:34:41,144 --> 01:34:42,436
I wanted to kill him.

1613
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:45,144
But no one would know the truth then.

1614
01:34:46,477 --> 01:34:49,686
Every family of each victim
deserves the truth.

1615
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:53,436
Let’s go.

1616
01:34:57,686 --> 01:34:58,477
Get up.

1617
01:35:05,477 --> 01:35:06,936
He is losing a lot of blood, Shiva.

1618
01:35:07,852 --> 01:35:09,477
You said the bullet is still lodged there.

1619
01:35:10,061 --> 01:35:11,852
It will get serious
if he is not treated at once.

1620
01:35:15,727 --> 01:35:16,686
Hmm, come on.

1621
01:35:29,311 --> 01:35:33,311
(Humming a tune)

1622
01:35:36,977 --> 01:35:39,811
‘I got a beautiful chance…’

1623
01:35:42,936 --> 01:35:43,727
Hi!

1624
01:35:43,727 --> 01:35:45,727
Hey, girl?
Do you want a lift?

1625
01:35:46,144 --> 01:35:48,269
No. I want the car.

1626
01:35:48,894 --> 01:35:50,144
Hey, hey!

1627
01:35:50,477 --> 01:35:53,436
I wanted to take her
but she took off with my car. Damn!

1628
01:35:53,644 --> 01:35:55,061
He has come.
You can talk to him.

1629
01:35:56,019 --> 01:35:57,019
Brother-in-law!
-Huh!

1630
01:35:57,394 --> 01:35:58,394
Tell me, Pandu.

1631
01:35:58,394 --> 01:35:59,394
Are you all okay?

1632
01:35:59,769 --> 01:36:01,019
We are all fine.

1633
01:36:01,394 --> 01:36:02,894
Any news about Shiva?

1634
01:36:03,394 --> 01:36:04,394
No, brother-in-law.

1635
01:36:04,394 --> 01:36:06,602
But wherever he is,
he will be safe, brother-in-law.

1636
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:09,394
Be very alert till he comes back,
brother-in-law.

1637
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:10,394
Ah! See you.

1638
01:36:10,394 --> 01:36:11,644
Hmm. Okay.

1639
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:17,102
Here’s your money.

1640
01:36:18,061 --> 01:36:19,186
Namaste.

1641
01:36:23,061 --> 01:36:24,769
Hello! Guntur Sri Balaji Lodge…

1642
01:36:31,727 --> 01:36:33,102
Here. Take left.
-Huh?

1643
01:36:33,102 --> 01:36:34,394
There is a hospital here.
Take left.

1644
01:36:34,394 --> 01:36:36,394
Hey, stop, stop! Cops! Cops!
-Huh?

1645
01:36:36,436 --> 01:36:38,727
Revathi, reverse the car.
Slowly, reverse it.

1646
01:36:40,352 --> 01:36:41,852
Go straight.
Keep straight.

1647
01:36:44,852 --> 01:36:46,269
Hey, Revathi. Police, police!

1648
01:36:46,394 --> 01:36:48,394
Revathi, get into that house.
-This one?

1649
01:36:50,977 --> 01:36:51,769
Revathi!

1650
01:36:52,102 --> 01:36:53,227
Open the gate. Huh?

1651
01:36:53,352 --> 01:36:55,186
Go. Open the gate
and park the car inside.

1652
01:37:12,769 --> 01:37:14,269
Madam, madam, madam!
-Hey, who are you?

1653
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:16,394
A bit of an emergency. Can we make a call, please?
-Why are you barging in? Who are you?

1654
01:37:16,394 --> 01:37:17,852
Tell me who you are!
-Can I make a call?

1655
01:37:17,852 --> 01:37:19,727
Philips! Someone barged into our house.

1656
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:22,394
-Hey, girl! Why are you closing the door?
-Madam! Please. He is losing a lot of blood.

1657
01:37:22,394 --> 01:37:24,102
-Who are you all?
-Emergency. Please try to understand.

1658
01:37:24,227 --> 01:37:25,602
Hey! Who is it?
-Don’t you hear?

1659
01:37:25,811 --> 01:37:26,769
Please, madam.

1660
01:37:26,977 --> 01:37:27,894
Who are you all?

1661
01:37:28,227 --> 01:37:29,227
I am Shiva, sir.

1662
01:37:29,394 --> 01:37:31,186
I am a constable
from Sakinetipalli police station.

1663
01:37:31,269 --> 01:37:32,394
ID number 1302.

1664
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:33,394
Sir, he is an accused.

1665
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:34,769
He is in my custody.

1666
01:37:35,394 --> 01:37:36,644
Please, help, sir.
-What happened?

1667
01:37:36,644 --> 01:37:37,644
He is hit by a bullet, sir.

1668
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:38,811
There is a lot of blood loss.

1669
01:37:38,894 --> 01:37:40,394
Can I make a call to the doctor, please?

1670
01:37:40,436 --> 01:37:42,019
When did this happen?
-Last night.

1671
01:37:42,102 --> 01:37:43,394
We could only give him first aid.

1672
01:37:45,227 --> 01:37:47,019
-Let’s take him into that room. Come.
-Thank you, sir.

1673
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:48,394
Come. Come.

1674
01:37:58,561 --> 01:38:00,394
Do you know what you are doing?

1675
01:38:00,727 --> 01:38:02,061
Relax. You will be fine.

1676
01:38:04,852 --> 01:38:05,894
How did this happen?

1677
01:38:06,061 --> 01:38:08,436
During night duty at the station.
-Oh!

1678
01:38:29,602 --> 01:38:30,894
Sir, is everything okay?

1679
01:38:31,894 --> 01:38:33,061
Nothing to worry.

1680
01:38:33,186 --> 01:38:35,061
Two days of rest will do.

1681
01:38:35,894 --> 01:38:39,394
Sir, I have to hand him over to the CBI court
in Bangalore by tomorrow.

1682
01:38:40,394 --> 01:38:41,602
I have removed the bullet.

1683
01:38:42,186 --> 01:38:44,477
At least for six to eight hours,
I don’t see any problem.

1684
01:38:49,394 --> 01:38:50,227
Hello…

1685
01:38:50,352 --> 01:38:51,852
Sir, Shiva here.

1686
01:38:52,186 --> 01:38:53,102
Shiva!

1687
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:54,602
Where are you calling from?

1688
01:38:54,894 --> 01:38:56,769
They tried to kill George at the station.

1689
01:38:57,102 --> 01:38:59,394
George and I ran away with Raju, sir.

1690
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:02,019
Okay. Give the phone to George.

1691
01:39:02,394 --> 01:39:03,186
Sir…

1692
01:39:03,352 --> 01:39:05,019
George was killed by IG Nataraj.

1693
01:39:08,894 --> 01:39:11,394
He is now trying to kill us both, sir.

1694
01:39:11,602 --> 01:39:13,019
I don’t know what to do.

1695
01:39:13,394 --> 01:39:15,352
Raju also got shot, sir.

1696
01:39:16,102 --> 01:39:17,477
Where are you speaking from right now?

1697
01:39:17,602 --> 01:39:21,394
Sir, I am at an ex-servicemen’s house
in Thungaleru.

1698
01:39:22,102 --> 01:39:23,186
Stay right there.

1699
01:39:24,269 --> 01:39:26,186
I will send my team.

1700
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:30,102
One Ms Ranjitha will come
and pick you up.

1701
01:39:30,727 --> 01:39:31,977
Okay, sir. I will wait.

1702
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:33,852
Madam!

1703
01:39:34,394 --> 01:39:39,436
I think Shiva has some
past connection with Raju.

1704
01:39:39,894 --> 01:39:41,102
That’s why…

1705
01:39:41,727 --> 01:39:43,394
he bashed up everyone at the station…

1706
01:39:44,394 --> 01:39:45,561
and took off with Raju.

1707
01:39:46,352 --> 01:39:48,394
What is this, sir?
You are so casual about it?

1708
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:50,102
What action did you take?

1709
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:51,561
We are looking for him, madam.

1710
01:39:52,394 --> 01:39:54,227
We will certainly catch him.
-Sir…

1711
01:39:54,811 --> 01:39:57,061
I want all details of this case.

1712
01:39:57,394 --> 01:39:58,644
Keep me updated.

1713
01:39:58,977 --> 01:40:01,061
Otherwise, you will be answerable to Delhi.

1714
01:40:03,769 --> 01:40:05,436
Do one thing.
-What?

1715
01:40:05,769 --> 01:40:07,894
Get a requisition from the Commissioner.

1716
01:40:08,269 --> 01:40:09,186
We will give you.

1717
01:40:09,477 --> 01:40:10,644
Huh!
-One second!

1718
01:40:13,894 --> 01:40:14,811
Hello, sir?

1719
01:40:14,811 --> 01:40:16,977
Ranjitha, Shiva has just called me.

1720
01:40:17,394 --> 01:40:20,644
You wanted to meet Officer Nataraj
who is handling this case, right?

1721
01:40:20,769 --> 01:40:21,602
Yes, sir!

1722
01:40:22,394 --> 01:40:24,061
He has killed George.

1723
01:40:27,977 --> 01:40:29,394
I am right now with him, sir.

1724
01:40:29,852 --> 01:40:30,852
Oh, crap!

1725
01:40:31,894 --> 01:40:32,769
Okay.

1726
01:40:33,727 --> 01:40:36,436
Let him not know
that we are aware of this.

1727
01:40:37,019 --> 01:40:38,394
Raju is with Shiva.

1728
01:40:38,602 --> 01:40:42,394
They are safe
in an ex-military officer’s house at Thungaleru.

1729
01:40:42,977 --> 01:40:45,394
-You must go quickly and pick them up.
-Husband…

1730
01:40:45,894 --> 01:40:46,769
Husband!

1731
01:40:47,102 --> 01:40:48,227
Listen to me carefully.

1732
01:40:48,769 --> 01:40:50,394
Nataraj is a dangerous guy.

1733
01:40:50,769 --> 01:40:52,394
We are alone in this case.

1734
01:40:52,394 --> 01:40:54,019
Okay, sir!
Will take care!

1735
01:40:54,186 --> 01:40:55,394
Okay.
-Bye, sir!

1736
01:40:57,811 --> 01:40:58,894
As you suggested,

1737
01:40:59,061 --> 01:41:01,602
I will get the request letter
from our commissioner, sir.

1738
01:41:01,644 --> 01:41:02,602
Hmm.

1739
01:41:03,352 --> 01:41:04,102
Thank you.

1740
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:08,269
Then we must leave immediately.

1741
01:41:08,394 --> 01:41:09,477
Yes, we have to!

1742
01:41:17,644 --> 01:41:18,602
What, dear?

1743
01:41:21,894 --> 01:41:23,727
Here, dear.
These are some clothes. You can change.

1744
01:41:23,769 --> 01:41:25,852
There is a pair for your friend as well.

1745
01:41:25,894 --> 01:41:26,852
Ask him to change.

1746
01:41:26,977 --> 01:41:28,394
Thank you, aunty. Thank you.

1747
01:41:28,394 --> 01:41:29,227
Dear…

1748
01:41:30,394 --> 01:41:31,477
Did you eat something?

1749
01:41:32,394 --> 01:41:34,852
No, aunty. I am famished.

1750
01:41:35,394 --> 01:41:37,186
We have been running since last night.

1751
01:41:37,769 --> 01:41:39,227
Oho! Okay, okay.

1752
01:41:39,352 --> 01:41:40,394
Change your clothes.

1753
01:41:41,019 --> 01:41:42,602
I will get dinner ready. Huh?
-Okay, okay.

1754
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:48,394
Are you okay?

1755
01:41:48,394 --> 01:41:49,436
Do you want anything?
-Okay, sir!

1756
01:41:50,269 --> 01:41:51,644
Do you have a bidi, sir?
-Hm?

1757
01:41:52,269 --> 01:41:54,394
Err…It’s okay.
Forget it, sir.

1758
01:41:56,769 --> 01:41:58,102
Are you a doctor, sir?

1759
01:41:58,394 --> 01:42:00,269
No. Ex-Army officer.

1760
01:42:00,977 --> 01:42:02,769
So you must have liquor, sir?

1761
01:42:03,394 --> 01:42:04,352
Hey!

1762
01:42:04,561 --> 01:42:06,186
Sir, it’s meant for body pains, right?

1763
01:42:09,394 --> 01:42:11,352
You are not a doctor
but how do you know all this?

1764
01:42:12,019 --> 01:42:13,769
We get trained in the Army.

1765
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:15,394
For field emergency.

1766
01:42:17,186 --> 01:42:18,894
I wish the government taught us too, sir.

1767
01:42:19,602 --> 01:42:21,352
We have lots of emergencies as well.

1768
01:42:22,561 --> 01:42:24,269
How many would you have killed, sir?

1769
01:42:24,352 --> 01:42:25,227
Hmm?

1770
01:42:25,769 --> 01:42:26,769
Why?

1771
01:42:27,019 --> 01:42:28,477
Just to know the figure, sir.

1772
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:30,019
What will you do with it?

1773
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:32,644
Sir, you kill at the government’s orders
and so do I.

1774
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:35,394
But you get medals
while I am called accused.

1775
01:42:35,894 --> 01:42:37,394
What sort of comparison is that?

1776
01:42:37,727 --> 01:42:40,269
I kill enemies to protect the country.

1777
01:42:40,561 --> 01:42:43,227
You kill innocents for useless politicians.

1778
01:42:43,269 --> 01:42:44,394
How can they be same?

1779
01:42:44,436 --> 01:42:46,394
Don’t justify your murders.

1780
01:42:46,477 --> 01:42:48,102
Sir, killing is killing, sir.

1781
01:42:48,352 --> 01:42:50,977
My victims have families.
But yours don’t?

1782
01:42:52,186 --> 01:42:52,977
Sir!

1783
01:42:53,061 --> 01:42:55,227
You call it justice.
But everyone has feelings, sir.

1784
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:57,852
The court will decide
what is fair or unfair.

1785
01:42:58,394 --> 01:42:59,394
Why entertain this guy, sir?

1786
01:42:59,477 --> 01:43:01,394
Hey, what was wrong with my question?

1787
01:43:01,769 --> 01:43:02,977
Whatever I ask he is…

1788
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:06,186
Hey, wait.

1789
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:13,061
Who is it?

1790
01:43:13,102 --> 01:43:15,394
We are sent by CBI Head, Mr Varghese.

1791
01:43:15,477 --> 01:43:16,727
I am Ranjitha.

1792
01:43:17,061 --> 01:43:18,727
Is there a Shiva inside?

1793
01:43:22,394 --> 01:43:23,352
It’s them, sir.

1794
01:43:25,811 --> 01:43:27,769
Sir, I am Ranjitha from CBI.

1795
01:43:33,811 --> 01:43:36,394
Shiva, main road is not that safe.

1796
01:43:36,394 --> 01:43:38,436
Five kilometres from here to the left,

1797
01:43:38,769 --> 01:43:40,394
you will find a path in the woods.

1798
01:43:40,394 --> 01:43:42,394
Take that.
You will be safe.

1799
01:44:11,394 --> 01:44:13,061
Hey! The vehicle’s approaching.
It’s heading in.

1800
01:44:13,102 --> 01:44:14,269
Move back!

1801
01:44:19,394 --> 01:44:21,019
Move back, man!
-Move, move.

1802
01:44:23,394 --> 01:44:24,769
Everybody! Stay down! Stay down!

1803
01:44:26,019 --> 01:44:27,852
Don’t move.
Bend down!

1804
01:44:28,269 --> 01:44:29,394
All of you stay here.
-Bend down!

1805
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:30,352
Hey!

1806
01:44:31,186 --> 01:44:32,394
What are you watching?

1807
01:44:32,727 --> 01:44:33,894
Hey, you go that side.

1808
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:37,811
None of you want to become Raju?

1809
01:44:38,394 --> 01:44:39,352
Oho!

1810
01:44:39,436 --> 01:44:41,352
You move only when ‘action’ is said.

1811
01:44:41,561 --> 01:44:42,477
Get going.

1812
01:44:43,019 --> 01:44:44,727
Hey!

1813
01:44:51,394 --> 01:44:53,394
Shiva, these people can’t deal with them.

1814
01:44:53,977 --> 01:44:54,977
Remove my cuffs.

1815
01:44:55,811 --> 01:44:57,394
Hey, keep quiet.
They will take care.

1816
01:45:07,394 --> 01:45:08,394
Hey, listen to me.

1817
01:45:08,561 --> 01:45:09,727
Or they will kill everyone.

1818
01:45:09,727 --> 01:45:10,811
Unlock my handcuffs.

1819
01:45:13,186 --> 01:45:14,769
Shiva, uncuff me. I won’t go anywhere.

1820
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:17,227
Open them.
Or they will kill everyone.

1821
01:45:39,061 --> 01:45:39,894
Hey!

1822
01:45:41,102 --> 01:45:42,186
Hey!

1823
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:52,061
Hey!

1824
01:46:01,394 --> 01:46:02,352
Hey!

1825
01:46:32,394 --> 01:46:33,394
Hey!

1826
01:47:02,894 --> 01:47:05,269
Who wants to be another Raju?

1827
01:47:05,894 --> 01:47:06,769
Come on!

1828
01:47:07,561 --> 01:47:08,394
Come on!

1829
01:47:13,602 --> 01:47:14,894
Raju…

1830
01:47:28,394 --> 01:47:29,394
Hey…

1831
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:31,436
What?

1832
01:48:31,436 --> 01:48:33,394
There is no one here.
They have escaped, sir!

1833
01:48:47,061 --> 01:48:48,394
Shiva, there is a truck.

1834
01:48:48,477 --> 01:48:49,477
Over there.
-Come.

1835
01:48:49,477 --> 01:48:50,852
Come. Let’s go.

1836
01:49:05,394 --> 01:49:09,811
Every man I raised is trying to become Raju.

1837
01:49:11,019 --> 01:49:15,227
Every man I trust,
is trying to kill me.

1838
01:49:16,394 --> 01:49:20,894
Though no way connected,
you are trying to save me.

1839
01:49:21,561 --> 01:49:24,186
I will show what I am…
to the scoundrels.

1840
01:49:27,977 --> 01:49:29,102
What will you do?

1841
01:49:30,352 --> 01:49:31,352
Kill them?

1842
01:49:32,019 --> 01:49:33,352
How many will you kill?

1843
01:49:34,644 --> 01:49:35,894
They will keep coming.

1844
01:49:37,269 --> 01:49:38,227
Let them come!

1845
01:49:38,394 --> 01:49:39,561
They want you dead.

1846
01:49:41,394 --> 01:49:44,394
If you want to show what you are,
confess to the court.

1847
01:49:46,394 --> 01:49:47,394
If I do?

1848
01:49:48,561 --> 01:49:49,977
Will they be convicted?

1849
01:49:51,394 --> 01:49:53,019
They have CM behind them.

1850
01:49:53,394 --> 01:49:55,227
They will get out in the next moment.

1851
01:49:55,394 --> 01:49:56,394
CM?

1852
01:49:57,394 --> 01:50:00,394
CM or PM… how many times
did the court make them stand in the dock?

1853
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:01,436
Huh?

1854
01:50:02,727 --> 01:50:04,852
Come to the court
and try telling the truth for once.

1855
01:50:06,352 --> 01:50:07,394
For justice.

1856
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:11,894
You can rectify all your mistakes.

1857
01:50:19,394 --> 01:50:21,394
Had I come from a nice family too,

1858
01:50:23,394 --> 01:50:24,602
would I have become this?

1859
01:50:25,894 --> 01:50:28,602
I would have known right from wrong.

1860
01:50:29,852 --> 01:50:33,019
I lived my life thinking
whatever I did was right.

1861
01:50:34,102 --> 01:50:35,394
I never….

1862
01:50:38,436 --> 01:50:40,394
Hey, we have reached.
Get the luggage down carefully.

1863
01:50:43,102 --> 01:50:44,269
Okay? Hmm?

1864
01:50:46,019 --> 01:50:46,977
Hey, Raju! Come.

1865
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:52,061
Revathi!
-Huh?

1866
01:50:54,269 --> 01:50:55,186
Namaste…

1867
01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:56,436
How come you are here?

1868
01:50:57,352 --> 01:50:58,227
Mangalam aunty!

1869
01:50:58,394 --> 01:50:59,394
How did you come?

1870
01:50:59,394 --> 01:51:00,602
Mangalam aunty?

1871
01:51:01,394 --> 01:51:02,602
Who are all these people?

1872
01:51:02,644 --> 01:51:05,394
Uh, is the wedding here?
-Yes.

1873
01:51:07,102 --> 01:51:08,394
That’s why I am here.

1874
01:51:09,394 --> 01:51:11,394
But your dad said you are getting married
in Tirupati today?

1875
01:51:11,852 --> 01:51:14,186
Why are you here?
-Uh… that’s…

1876
01:51:14,644 --> 01:51:15,727
Revathi! Hmm!

1877
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:17,769
That’s… uh…
-Tell me.

1878
01:51:17,852 --> 01:51:19,352
That’s…dad lied to you, aunty.
-Damn!

1879
01:51:20,852 --> 01:51:22,394
Hey, Raju! Raju!

1880
01:51:22,477 --> 01:51:23,644
Come. Come here.

1881
01:51:26,102 --> 01:51:27,269
Hey, let’s go. Come.

1882
01:51:34,269 --> 01:51:36,394
There are saris here and lots of jewellery.
There is everything.

1883
01:51:36,394 --> 01:51:37,852
First get ready.
-Aunty, please listen to me.

1884
01:51:37,977 --> 01:51:38,852
Stop!

1885
01:51:39,394 --> 01:51:40,394
First get ready.

1886
01:51:40,561 --> 01:51:42,352
In the meantime,
I should ask your dad.

1887
01:51:42,394 --> 01:51:43,977
‘Why are you angry with me?’
-No, aunty.

1888
01:51:44,269 --> 01:51:46,102
What grave mistake did I make?
-No, no, no! Aunty!

1889
01:51:47,394 --> 01:51:48,727
Oho!

1890
01:51:52,852 --> 01:51:54,227
Hello?
-Brother!

1891
01:51:54,477 --> 01:51:56,186
Why are you angry with me?

1892
01:51:56,394 --> 01:51:57,727
What have I done?

1893
01:51:58,102 --> 01:51:59,644
Why would I be angry with you?

1894
01:51:59,811 --> 01:52:00,811
Nothing of that sort.

1895
01:52:00,852 --> 01:52:02,061
Don’t lie, brother.

1896
01:52:02,394 --> 01:52:03,977
Revathi has told me everything.

1897
01:52:04,269 --> 01:52:05,227
Revathi?

1898
01:52:06,352 --> 01:52:07,602
When?
-Just now.

1899
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:08,602
Where?

1900
01:52:08,727 --> 01:52:09,977
Here. At the wedding venue.

1901
01:52:10,061 --> 01:52:12,269
Why did you lie to me?

1902
01:52:12,602 --> 01:52:14,977
It wasn’t me who lied.
She is lying to you.

1903
01:52:15,394 --> 01:52:16,727
She ran away from her wedding.

1904
01:52:17,061 --> 01:52:18,227
Ran away?

1905
01:52:18,394 --> 01:52:20,394
Don’t let her move.
I am starting right away.

1906
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:22,811
Revathi is found.

1907
01:52:25,894 --> 01:52:26,852
Let’s start!

1908
01:52:30,019 --> 01:52:32,186
Son-in-law! We are getting late.
Come fast!

1909
01:52:32,352 --> 01:52:32,898
Huh?

1910
01:52:32,938 --> 01:52:33,463
Uh, uh.

1911
01:52:33,488 --> 01:52:35,663
Bi-lingual. Take good care.

1912
01:52:35,996 --> 01:52:36,996
I will take a leave!

1913
01:52:37,038 --> 01:52:38,353
Pay the bill!

1914
01:52:38,378 --> 01:52:39,871
Hey, wait. I am coming too.

1915
01:52:48,417 --> 01:52:50,292
Revathi! What have you done?
-Aunt!

1916
01:52:55,042 --> 01:52:56,209
Aunt, please!

1917
01:53:05,084 --> 01:53:06,042
Hey, Raju! Come.

1918
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:12,625
“O my sweet Rukmini,
full of heavenly beauty”

1919
01:53:12,917 --> 01:53:16,417
“Oh, my, how did you
come into this world so daintily?”

1920
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,500
“No care for time and tide
Like a swishing wind”

1921
01:53:21,084 --> 01:53:24,459
“You come to my mind
And make me go mad”

1922
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,625
“Crowd or not, no matter what
you spring at me and embrace”

1923
01:53:33,042 --> 01:53:36,375
“For all the caution the others give
for your infatuation”

1924
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:40,000
“You shoo them away
with a gesture of dismissal”

1925
01:53:40,417 --> 01:53:43,750
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”

1926
01:53:44,459 --> 01:53:47,500
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1927
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:52,417
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”
-Please come. Sit.

1928
01:53:52,875 --> 01:53:56,375
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1929
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:06,625
Mangala, where is Revathi?

1930
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,417
Hey, are you mad? Come.

1931
01:54:15,084 --> 01:54:15,875
Hey…

1932
01:54:16,125 --> 01:54:17,792
She is in the room upstairs. Come.
-Hey, move.

1933
01:54:20,292 --> 01:54:23,875
“Naughty boy that you are
it’s not easy to bear you”

1934
01:54:24,084 --> 01:54:27,084
“With youthful beauty
you try to have a game”

1935
01:54:27,209 --> 01:54:28,417
Son-in-law! Come on!

1936
01:54:28,417 --> 01:54:31,584
“How can I pour out
my heart to you?”

1937
01:54:32,084 --> 01:54:36,084
“You tempt me with your gait
and make me go round you”

1938
01:54:36,667 --> 01:54:40,250
“All the eyes around
are on you and me”

1939
01:54:40,417 --> 01:54:43,917
“And yet you pay no heed”
-Come!

1940
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:47,250
“Let it be; let them see”

1941
01:54:47,875 --> 01:54:50,834
“And I drowned in your intoxication”
-Shiva! Look there.

1942
01:54:52,917 --> 01:54:56,250
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”

1943
01:54:56,834 --> 01:54:59,917
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1944
01:55:00,875 --> 01:55:04,417
“This youthful heart is totally cornered”

1945
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,292
“For the love of you,
it got badly caught”

1946
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,875
Hey, he took her.

1947
01:55:13,917 --> 01:55:14,584
He took our girl.

1948
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:15,417
Not again!

1949
01:55:15,417 --> 01:55:16,625
Not again, not again.

1950
01:55:19,417 --> 01:55:20,834
Be alert.
-Okay, sir.

1951
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:25,917
Where is Raju?

1952
01:55:26,292 --> 01:55:27,417
I am wondering the same.

1953
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,417
Raju!
-He was here till a while ago.

1954
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:33,792
I trusted him and left him.

1955
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:35,292
Where is Raju?

1956
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:37,417
Where could he have gone?

1957
01:55:45,834 --> 01:55:47,209
What is going on, Varghese?

1958
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,773
Sir, I spoke to the military officer.

1959
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:53,875
Constable Shiva will somehow
take Raju to the court.

1960
01:55:53,875 --> 01:55:58,584
Varghese, remember that this is a
very sensitive case involving a CM.

1961
01:55:59,084 --> 01:56:00,667
If he doesn’t show
in the court tomorrow,

1962
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:02,417
it’s a big humiliation
for the department.

1963
01:56:02,417 --> 01:56:03,417
Yes, sir.

1964
01:56:03,584 --> 01:56:05,750
If we can depute
some extra forces …

1965
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:07,417
How many more, Varghese?

1966
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,417
Those who went are already dead.

1967
01:56:09,584 --> 01:56:10,792
Ranjitha is gone.

1968
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:11,875
And so is George.

1969
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,917
I am losing hope.

1970
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:16,417
Wherever they are,
it’s imperative that we find them.

1971
01:56:16,584 --> 01:56:18,500
Know their location
as early as possible.

1972
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:19,667
Okay, sir.

1973
01:56:24,125 --> 01:56:25,084
Hey, Shiva!

1974
01:56:25,584 --> 01:56:27,000
Where are you?

1975
01:56:27,625 --> 01:56:28,500
All because of you!

1976
01:56:29,375 --> 01:56:31,750
If you didn’t turn up in the middle of the journey,
none of this would have happened.

1977
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:32,417
I know.

1978
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,834
If I didn’t come, you would have
no problem in the first place.

1979
01:56:35,584 --> 01:56:37,375
But I would have been married to him.

1980
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:39,125
You should have married him.

1981
01:56:39,292 --> 01:56:40,417
You should have. Please, go.

1982
01:56:41,084 --> 01:56:42,417
That would be one job done.

1983
01:56:43,209 --> 01:56:43,875
Oh!

1984
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:48,417
So, if I married him,
you would have no problem?

1985
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,042
Is that it?

1986
01:56:51,792 --> 01:56:52,834
Stop the vehicle, Shiva.

1987
01:56:53,084 --> 01:56:54,292
Revathi, be quiet.

1988
01:56:54,417 --> 01:56:56,417
If you don’t stop the car, I will jump out.
-Hey, Revathi.

1989
01:56:56,459 --> 01:56:58,417
Don’t act crazy.
Close the door.

1990
01:57:00,417 --> 01:57:02,250
Let go of my hand.
-Revathi, close the door!

1991
01:57:02,417 --> 01:57:04,084
I said let of my hand!
Stop the vehicle!

1992
01:57:06,792 --> 01:57:07,625
Revathi…

1993
01:57:09,084 --> 01:57:09,917
Revathi!

1994
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:13,792
Ah!

1995
01:57:30,417 --> 01:57:31,417
Sorry.

1996
01:57:33,584 --> 01:57:35,250
That was not intentional.

1997
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:39,584
Don’t you know?

1998
01:57:42,417 --> 01:57:43,792
This is my brother’s dream.

1999
01:57:44,792 --> 01:57:47,125
Become a cop.
Serve the public.

2000
01:57:49,084 --> 01:57:51,292
I became a cop
to make his dream come true.

2001
01:57:53,125 --> 01:57:54,084
Look at me now.

2002
01:57:55,209 --> 01:57:58,792
I bashed up the inspector,
any and every guy and took off with Raju.

2003
01:57:59,417 --> 01:58:00,792
Now I don’t know where he is.

2004
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,209
How will I go back?

2005
01:58:05,875 --> 01:58:07,417
Will I still have my job?

2006
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,459
Where are my parents?

2007
01:58:18,834 --> 01:58:21,584
I felt lost and I blurted out.

2008
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:23,250
See, Shiva!

2009
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:27,625
It’s your stubbornness
that I like most in you.

2010
01:58:28,417 --> 01:58:31,250
When you start something,
you won’t give up until it’s done.

2011
01:58:31,792 --> 01:58:34,000
It’s the same trust that made me
fall in love with you.

2012
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,375
Not just this problem…

2013
01:58:36,584 --> 01:58:37,875
Any problem…

2014
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:39,459
I will never leave you.

2015
01:58:40,792 --> 01:58:42,125
Sorry. Forgive me.

2016
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:43,667
Nothing like that.

2017
01:58:44,417 --> 01:58:47,209
The moment you sat next to me,
all my anger had disappeared.

2018
01:58:57,917 --> 01:58:59,417
Shiva…
Hmm?

2019
01:59:00,375 --> 01:59:01,500
I am hungry.

2020
01:59:02,994 --> 01:59:06,327
I noticed a Paratha Dhaba on the way.

2021
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,417
Shall we go?

2022
01:59:22,417 --> 01:59:23,209
Hello?

2023
01:59:23,334 --> 01:59:24,542
Hey, Ravi.

2024
01:59:24,542 --> 01:59:25,625
It’s me.

2025
01:59:25,875 --> 01:59:27,167
Brother, tell me, brother.

2026
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:28,625
How long will it take you?

2027
01:59:28,625 --> 01:59:30,584
It will take around 45 minutes
to one hour, brother.

2028
01:59:30,584 --> 01:59:31,417
Okay, fine.

2029
01:59:31,459 --> 01:59:33,000
There is a dais here.

2030
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,167
Near the giant wheel.

2031
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,625
I am right next to it.
Come over.

2032
01:59:36,209 --> 01:59:37,875
Okay, okay, brother.
I will be right there.

2033
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:46,500
First, keep your anger aside
and think properly.

2034
01:59:46,709 --> 01:59:48,709
No point in thinking while angry.

2035
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,417
He is injured, right?

2036
01:59:53,167 --> 01:59:54,250
He can’t have gone far.

2037
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,625
There will be cops everywhere.

2038
01:59:57,834 --> 01:59:59,167
He will need help.

2039
01:59:59,584 --> 02:00:01,584
I am sure he will call his brother first.

2040
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,250
Hmm… and?

2041
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:05,000
Where do you think he will call him?

2042
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,334
Welcome… hearty welcome.

2043
02:00:06,334 --> 02:00:09,792
We warmly invite you to Sri Sri Sri
Ambika Mother Goddess’s temple fair.

2044
02:00:09,792 --> 02:00:12,167
The temple Committee requests
the residents of the village

2045
02:00:12,667 --> 02:00:14,209
Bro! One more Paratha!

2046
02:00:17,625 --> 02:00:19,334
[indistinct voices]

2047
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:21,417
Do you think we will find Raju here?

2048
02:00:21,625 --> 02:00:22,834
No guarantee he is here.

2049
02:00:23,625 --> 02:00:25,625
But there is no other option.
We got to look for him.

2050
02:00:26,292 --> 02:00:27,625
We will find him somewhere.

2051
02:00:28,094 --> 02:00:31,886
[song playing in speakers]

2052
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:48,219
Hey! Raju!

2053
02:00:56,336 --> 02:00:57,878
-Look that side.
-Okay, okay.

2054
02:01:03,878 --> 02:01:05,086
Shiva! Over here.

2055
02:01:10,253 --> 02:01:11,086
Hey!

2056
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:13,750
Hey, Raju!

2057
02:01:13,791 --> 02:01:14,791
Stop!

2058
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:15,875
Wait!

2059
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:17,791
I trusted you and uncuffed you.

2060
02:01:17,833 --> 02:01:19,458
But you took advantage and fled!

2061
02:01:19,625 --> 02:01:20,958
Bloody wretch!
-Shiva!

2062
02:01:21,208 --> 02:01:22,583
Listen to me.

2063
02:01:22,625 --> 02:01:23,833
-You don’t seem to understand.
-Shiva!

2064
02:01:23,875 --> 02:01:25,791
-You can’t take me evading all the cops.
-Shiva, please.

2065
02:01:25,958 --> 02:01:26,833
Shiva!

2066
02:01:26,833 --> 02:01:29,125
If you take me with you, you will be dead.
Take her and go away.

2067
02:01:29,208 --> 02:01:31,041
Hey, where do you want me to go?
Stop!

2068
02:01:31,333 --> 02:01:33,791
Where do you want me to go?
Back to the police whom I beat up?

2069
02:01:34,041 --> 02:01:37,791
Or to my dad whom I promised justice
for my brother’s death?

2070
02:01:37,875 --> 02:01:39,166
Huh? Tell me.

2071
02:01:39,583 --> 02:01:41,375
I will take you to the court
and hand you over.

2072
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:42,833
Or I will die trying.

2073
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:43,791
Shiva!

2074
02:01:45,125 --> 02:01:47,416
I know Raju and you are here.

2075
02:01:48,583 --> 02:01:49,416
Enough.

2076
02:01:50,166 --> 02:01:51,375
Enough of your running.

2077
02:01:51,791 --> 02:01:53,500
They are here! What next!

2078
02:01:53,791 --> 02:01:57,000
Someone important to you
has come here to see you.

2079
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,791
Hey!

2080
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:02,666
Bring Raju and take your person.

2081
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,416
I am telling you. Listen to me.
-Shiva!

2082
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:09,375
Shiva…Shiva!

2083
02:02:23,333 --> 02:02:24,125
Dad!

2084
02:02:24,458 --> 02:02:25,791
Dad!
-Shiva! Don’t go.

2085
02:02:25,833 --> 02:02:27,791
Ask Shiva to come with Raju.

2086
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:31,958
I will consider this as his ignorance
and spare your son.

2087
02:02:32,208 --> 02:02:34,750
Otherwise… ask him to come!

2088
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:35,833
-Shiva!
-Hey, leave me man.

2089
02:02:35,833 --> 02:02:37,750
Listen to me.
Don’t listen to them.

2090
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:38,791
Ask him to come!

2091
02:02:38,833 --> 02:02:40,041
Don’t come, Shiva.

2092
02:02:40,416 --> 02:02:41,791
Don’t come out!

2093
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:44,333
The truth should come out.

2094
02:02:44,625 --> 02:02:46,041
Shiva! He won’t do anything.

2095
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:48,958
Justice should be done to all those
who died with your brother.

2096
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:50,625
Go away.

2097
02:02:50,791 --> 02:02:52,458
Hey, hey, hey! Shiva!

2098
02:02:52,791 --> 02:02:54,750
Your dad speaks like a mad man.

2099
02:02:54,791 --> 02:02:56,375
I am holding the gun point blank.

2100
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,375
If I pull the trigger…He won’t do anything.
-Shiva! Ignore him!

2101
02:02:58,416 --> 02:03:00,250
If you want your dad bring Raju here.

2102
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:03,791
Come on!
-He won’t do anything.

2103
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:06,125
Don’t come, Shiva!
You promised me!

2104
02:03:06,208 --> 02:03:07,583
You promised on your uniform!

2105
02:03:07,583 --> 02:03:09,791
Hey! We made many such promises.

2106
02:03:10,125 --> 02:03:12,166
Shiva! Do you want your dad?

2107
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:14,625
Or you want to take Raju to the court?
-Dad!

2108
02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:16,875
Please listen to me. He planned to kill us!
-Leave me.

2109
02:03:17,041 --> 02:03:18,125
Decide!

2110
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:19,791
I will count to ten.

2111
02:03:19,875 --> 02:03:21,791
What will you do?
Kill me? Huh? Kill me!

2112
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:22,958
Hey, I will shoot you.

2113
02:03:23,208 --> 02:03:24,791
I will shoot you down!
-Shoot me, then!

2114
02:03:25,333 --> 02:03:29,791
My son, who hasn’t even seen life,
is fearlessly walking towards death…

2115
02:03:29,791 --> 02:03:32,250
why should I, who saw it all,
be afraid of death?

2116
02:03:32,416 --> 02:03:34,041
-Dad! Don’t. Please.
-Don’t believe him.

2117
02:03:34,333 --> 02:03:35,250
Shiva!

2118
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,791
You shouldn’t be defeated because of me.
-Hey, Shiva!

2119
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,791
Your dad is blabbering something.
-Let go of me. Dad…

2120
02:03:39,791 --> 02:03:41,333
If you don’t step out with him…
-Listen to me!

2121
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:49,958
Dad!

2122
02:03:53,583 --> 02:03:54,625
Dad!

2123
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:58,458
Shiva…Shiva!
-Dad, dad…

2124
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:02,125
Hey!

2125
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:03,000
Dad!

2126
02:04:03,041 --> 02:04:04,125
Shiva!

2127
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:09,875
Hey!

2128
02:04:19,791 --> 02:04:21,583
Brother, come! Come fast!

2129
02:04:21,791 --> 02:04:22,666
Shiva!

2130
02:04:22,833 --> 02:04:24,250
Come, come fast!

2131
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:27,791
Hurry up, hurry up!
Get in, get in!

2132
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:29,000
Dad!

2133
02:04:29,125 --> 02:04:31,041
Shiva, Shiva!

2134
02:04:32,208 --> 02:04:33,750
Dad!
-Shiva, get in!

2135
02:04:34,208 --> 02:04:35,625
Hey!
-Dad!

2136
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:40,375
Revathi, leave me!

2137
02:04:40,791 --> 02:04:41,875
Revathi, leave me!

2138
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:43,958
Dad!
-Move, move fast!

2139
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:52,500
“How could you leave me?
Dad, O dad!”

2140
02:04:53,791 --> 02:04:55,750
Dad!
-Shiva, listen to me!

2141
02:04:55,791 --> 02:05:03,000
“Why have you gone away?
Dad, O dad!”

2142
02:05:05,375 --> 02:05:12,750
“Before my eyes and too early
is severed our deep attachment”

2143
02:05:13,125 --> 02:05:20,666
“In this bottomless grief
My world has come to an end”

2144
02:05:20,875 --> 02:05:23,416
“It’s time to part ways
and this moment feels so empty”

2145
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:26,416
“O, How terrible this is!”

2146
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:30,666
There is money in this bag.

2147
02:05:31,791 --> 02:05:33,500
Take it and live somewhere happily.

2148
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,208
If you say, ‘No. I don’t want this money.

2149
02:05:38,416 --> 02:05:41,791
I want morality, justice, and honesty.’

2150
02:05:42,625 --> 02:05:44,250
They will first kill him.

2151
02:05:44,542 --> 02:05:45,959
Then they will kill you.

2152
02:05:48,542 --> 02:05:49,584
What are you staring at?

2153
02:05:50,542 --> 02:05:52,792
Killing his dad was never on my list.

2154
02:05:53,501 --> 02:05:54,542
It wasn’t my fault.

2155
02:05:55,209 --> 02:05:56,501
It was his fault.

2156
02:05:58,126 --> 02:05:59,542
How many times did I tell him?

2157
02:05:59,709 --> 02:06:01,542
‘Don’t come with me. Don’t.’

2158
02:06:01,792 --> 02:06:02,751
Did you listen?

2159
02:06:03,959 --> 02:06:05,167
At least you tell him.

2160
02:06:06,126 --> 02:06:08,334
That he should live with the others.
And to live so.

2161
02:06:10,084 --> 02:06:10,959
Okay?

2162
02:06:12,542 --> 02:06:14,542
Take that money settle down somewhere.

2163
02:06:15,792 --> 02:06:17,126
Invite me to your wedding.

2164
02:06:17,417 --> 02:06:18,542
I will come, eat biryani and go.

2165
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:30,792
They said whoever kills Raju
becomes the next Raju, brother.

2166
02:06:32,542 --> 02:06:36,126
Instead of some outsider,
isn’t it better I kill you?

2167
02:06:36,376 --> 02:06:38,209
After all I am your own brother.

2168
02:06:39,084 --> 02:06:40,751
Why did you stab me here then?

2169
02:06:41,626 --> 02:06:43,251
The liver is on the right.

2170
02:06:43,334 --> 02:06:44,917
You should have stabbed me here.

2171
02:06:45,542 --> 02:06:46,542
Shiva!

2172
02:06:51,501 --> 02:06:52,917
Shiva, no, Shiva. Don’t go.

2173
02:06:54,376 --> 02:06:56,626
Without even knowing where the liver is,

2174
02:06:57,542 --> 02:06:59,209
how can you become Raju?

2175
02:07:00,751 --> 02:07:01,917
Hey!

2176
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:02,917
-Shiva!
-Let go.

2177
02:07:02,917 --> 02:07:04,001
-Shiva!
-Revathi, let go!

2178
02:07:04,167 --> 02:07:05,251
Shiva…

2179
02:07:08,542 --> 02:07:09,376
Hey!

2180
02:07:09,751 --> 02:07:10,709
Shiva!

2181
02:07:12,959 --> 02:07:14,501
Raju! Raju, come.

2182
02:07:14,917 --> 02:07:15,792
Raju!

2183
02:07:20,959 --> 02:07:21,792
Raju!

2184
02:07:22,376 --> 02:07:23,251
Let’s go.

2185
02:07:32,876 --> 02:07:34,542
Revathi! Revathi… Revathi!

2186
02:07:43,251 --> 02:07:44,251
Hey, Shiva!

2187
02:07:46,001 --> 02:07:47,542
Raju! Raju, come.
-Shiva!

2188
02:07:48,542 --> 02:07:49,917
Raju, come.
Revathi, come.

2189
02:07:55,126 --> 02:07:56,542
Come! Let’s board the train.

2190
02:07:57,001 --> 02:07:57,959
Revathi! Get in!

2191
02:08:00,334 --> 02:08:01,417
Get in.

2192
02:08:19,376 --> 02:08:21,542
You kept saying…
Brother will come. Brother will come.

2193
02:08:23,959 --> 02:08:24,959
He has come.

2194
02:08:25,584 --> 02:08:26,542
What happened?

2195
02:08:27,917 --> 02:08:29,542
No one around you is fair to you.

2196
02:08:31,251 --> 02:08:33,001
Not even your own brother.

2197
02:08:37,209 --> 02:08:38,209
What did you say?

2198
02:08:40,417 --> 02:08:43,126
That I can’t even
step out of this village with you?

2199
02:08:44,542 --> 02:08:46,084
See how far we have come.

2200
02:08:50,251 --> 02:08:51,376
Truth wins.

2201
02:08:53,126 --> 02:08:54,001
It takes time.

2202
02:08:54,626 --> 02:08:55,751
But it wins.

2203
02:08:58,084 --> 02:09:00,084
You said my dad’s death won’t be
on your list.

2204
02:09:01,876 --> 02:09:02,917
Fine, it won’t.

2205
02:09:03,751 --> 02:09:05,542
But do you know why my dad died?

2206
02:09:06,417 --> 02:09:07,209
Hmm?

2207
02:09:07,542 --> 02:09:09,001
For truth to come out.

2208
02:09:15,251 --> 02:09:17,084
Stand on the side of justice and see.

2209
02:09:20,501 --> 02:09:21,626
Your very life will change.

2210
02:09:24,709 --> 02:09:25,542
-Hey!
-Shiva!

2211
02:09:25,626 --> 02:09:27,542
Shiva, let go!
Shiva, leave!

2212
02:09:27,542 --> 02:09:28,542
Hey!

2213
02:09:30,751 --> 02:09:32,959
Shiva, leave!
Shiva! Move aside!

2214
02:09:42,917 --> 02:09:44,959
Hey, Shiva! Leave me!
-Revathi, get the gun!

2215
02:09:47,167 --> 02:09:48,126
Hey!

2216
02:09:53,126 --> 02:09:54,542
Revathi, Revathi, Revathi!

2217
02:09:54,542 --> 02:09:56,542
Go to the engine.
This train shouldn’t stop anywhere.

2218
02:09:56,542 --> 02:09:57,542
Do you get it?
-How could I, Shiva?

2219
02:09:57,542 --> 02:10:00,209
Revathi! You have a gun in your hand.
Use the gun if necessary.

2220
02:10:00,334 --> 02:10:02,542
Go to the engine immediately,
-But the train shouldn’t stop at any station.

2221
02:10:02,584 --> 02:10:04,126
Go, Revathi. Go!
-This train doesn’t have any stops.

2222
02:10:04,126 --> 02:10:06,251
Go, pack the bags.
Keep the camera safe!

2223
02:10:24,292 --> 02:10:25,292
Maintaining hundred.

2224
02:10:25,501 --> 02:10:27,334
Over, over.
-Keep your walkie there.

2225
02:10:28,167 --> 02:10:29,292
Right there.

2226
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Make it fast. Faster.
-Okay, okay.

2227
02:10:38,125 --> 02:10:39,750
-Get in!
-Get in!

2228
02:10:39,875 --> 02:10:41,583
Why do you stare? Faster.
-I am doing it, madam.

2229
02:10:44,416 --> 02:10:46,791
-Get in, come!
-Get in!

2230
02:10:47,208 --> 02:10:48,208
Let’s go!

2231
02:11:11,666 --> 02:11:13,291
Come, come!

2232
02:11:25,625 --> 02:11:26,500
Hey!

2233
02:11:31,666 --> 02:11:32,583
Hey!

2234
02:11:33,083 --> 02:11:34,250
Hey!

2235
02:11:34,416 --> 02:11:35,500
Close it, close it.

2236
02:13:06,791 --> 02:13:07,625
Hey!

2237
02:14:25,416 --> 02:14:27,416
Raju! Come.
Raju, get up. Up!

2238
02:14:27,958 --> 02:14:29,250
Raju! Come.
 Let’s get to the engine.

2239
02:14:30,416 --> 02:14:31,416
Come!

2240
02:14:32,875 --> 02:14:33,916
Careful. Come!

2241
02:14:34,416 --> 02:14:35,750
Come, Raju. Get in.

2242
02:14:36,083 --> 02:14:36,958
Raju!

2243
02:14:38,458 --> 02:14:40,250
Raju! Raju!

2244
02:14:41,208 --> 02:14:42,416
Raju! Come.

2245
02:14:45,416 --> 02:14:46,625
Raju! Raju…

2246
02:14:47,041 --> 02:14:48,416
Raju!
Give me your hand.

2247
02:14:48,791 --> 02:14:49,625
Give me your hand.

2248
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:51,750
Raju! Come, come.

2249
02:14:54,416 --> 02:14:55,291
Raju!

2250
02:14:56,458 --> 02:14:57,416
Come!

2251
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:00,750
Raju! What are you doing?

2252
02:15:01,875 --> 02:15:03,416
Raju, what are you up to? Raju?

2253
02:15:03,875 --> 02:15:04,833
Raju… no!

2254
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:08,000
Raju!

2255
02:15:08,416 --> 02:15:09,416
Raju!

2256
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,416
Hey!

2257
02:15:11,958 --> 02:15:12,875
Raju!

2258
02:15:15,125 --> 02:15:16,791
Hey, hey! Stop the train!

2259
02:15:18,291 --> 02:15:19,416
Hey!

2260
02:15:21,875 --> 02:15:22,791
Raju!

2261
02:15:23,083 --> 02:15:24,125
Why, man?

2262
02:15:26,666 --> 02:15:27,500
Damn!

2263
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,500
What, Raju?

2264
02:15:33,416 --> 02:15:34,666
Were you in my place,

2265
02:15:35,833 --> 02:15:37,416
you would do the same, won’t you?

2266
02:15:40,125 --> 02:15:41,666
Honestly, I wouldn’t.

2267
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:46,416
I wouldn’t make you suffer so much.

2268
02:15:48,416 --> 02:15:50,666
The moment I received the instructions,
I would kill you.

2269
02:15:51,958 --> 02:15:53,416
Do you have a matchbox?

2270
02:15:58,416 --> 02:15:59,416
Hey…

2271
02:15:59,958 --> 02:16:02,083
Raju! Raju!

2272
02:16:05,666 --> 02:16:06,791
Raju…

2273
02:16:19,958 --> 02:16:21,750
Hail! CM Dakshayani.

2274
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:24,791
Hail! CM Dakshayani.

2275
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:27,750
Hail! CM Dakshayani.

2276
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:47,208
Your Honour!

2277
02:16:47,833 --> 02:16:51,041
Since the CBI has failed to present
witnesses at the arraignment,

2278
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:54,875
it is evident that CM’s name
was maliciously drawn into the case.

2279
02:16:55,250 --> 02:16:58,708
Hence, I request Your Honour
to strike the case.

2280
02:16:58,875 --> 02:17:01,041
Your Honour!
The witness is here, Your Honour.

2281
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:04,500
With your permission…

2282
02:17:04,833 --> 02:17:05,708
Permitted.

2283
02:17:23,833 --> 02:17:24,833
Shiva, ma’am.

2284
02:17:39,291 --> 02:17:40,166
My Lord!

2285
02:17:41,083 --> 02:17:42,000
I am Shiva.

2286
02:17:42,625 --> 02:17:46,083
A constable from Sakhinetipalli police station.
ID number 1302.

2287
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:52,666
While CBI officer George and I were
bringing the witness, Raju, to the court,

2288
02:17:53,708 --> 02:17:57,541
IG Nataraj and a few police officials
killed both of them.

2289
02:17:57,833 --> 02:18:00,833
So, are you going to give witness
instead of Raju?

2290
02:18:01,041 --> 02:18:02,625
Who said I am going to?

2291
02:18:03,875 --> 02:18:05,083
Raju will do it himself.

2292
02:18:05,541 --> 02:18:07,083
But you just said he was killed.

2293
02:18:07,541 --> 02:18:09,666
Is he going to come back to life
and make a statement?

2294
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:10,708
He will.

2295
02:18:10,875 --> 02:18:12,833
The train shouldn’t stop in between.
Go, Revathi!

2296
02:18:12,833 --> 02:18:15,000
Go to the engine. Go! Go!

2297
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:17,250
Hey, this train is not going to stop anywhere.

2298
02:18:17,416 --> 02:18:19,708
Pack the luggage first.
Keep the camera safe inside.

2299
02:18:19,791 --> 02:18:21,833
Get down, first.
Let’s get off wherever the trains slows down.

2300
02:18:32,833 --> 02:18:33,833
What is this?

2301
02:18:33,833 --> 02:18:36,041
Sorry, ma’am, sorry.
Just a minute. Sorry.

2302
02:18:46,833 --> 02:18:48,250
Shiva! Is this okay?
-Uh, okay.

2303
02:18:48,625 --> 02:18:49,541
Ready.

2304
02:18:50,541 --> 02:18:51,791
Greetings to you all.

2305
02:18:52,791 --> 02:18:53,833
I am Rajasekhar.

2306
02:18:54,333 --> 02:18:55,333
Raju…

2307
02:18:56,666 --> 02:19:01,916
If I am not physically present there
and you are watching this video,

2308
02:19:02,541 --> 02:19:05,583
it can only mean the CM
has already got me killed.

2309
02:19:07,916 --> 02:19:09,875
I want to tell you lots of things.

2310
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:12,833
A few years ago,

2311
02:19:13,708 --> 02:19:16,708
in the gas leak accident
at Morampudi junction,

2312
02:19:17,291 --> 02:19:18,833
nearly forty lives were lost.

2313
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,791
But it was not accident.

2314
02:19:23,416 --> 02:19:29,208
It was a well-planned bomb blast to efface
the body of IAS Officer Radha Krishna.

2315
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,833
Discovering the wrong doings of the CM
and her many illegal activities,

2316
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:37,000
the IAS officer had confronted her.

2317
02:19:51,833 --> 02:19:52,833
Then,

2318
02:19:53,083 --> 02:19:55,833
Mr Natraj and I
placed his body in a car…

2319
02:19:56,041 --> 02:19:57,833
and blew it up at Morampudi junction.

2320
02:19:58,625 --> 02:20:03,916
It was also me who had brought the
low quality chemicals that caused it.

2321
02:20:04,166 --> 02:20:06,333
It was CM who told me to bring it.

2322
02:20:06,833 --> 02:20:08,833
I acted only on her instructions.

2323
02:20:10,041 --> 02:20:13,083
I have done many such things
at the CM’s behest.

2324
02:20:14,250 --> 02:20:15,708
This is my dying declaration.

2325
02:20:16,833 --> 02:20:17,833
Madam!
-Madam!

2326
02:20:20,083 --> 02:20:21,833
The money I took from the party...

2327
02:20:22,208 --> 02:20:29,250
and the voice recordings of my conversations
with them are all kept in a safe place.

2328
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,500
Shiva will hand them over to you.

2329
02:20:36,541 --> 02:20:38,250
Hey, brother! One minute.

2330
02:20:39,833 --> 02:20:40,916
There is something else.

2331
02:20:42,416 --> 02:20:47,083
The first time I saw CM,
I fell in love with her.

2332
02:20:51,541 --> 02:20:52,833
I don’t want to express it!

2333
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,083
Revathi asked me to express my love.

2334
02:20:55,416 --> 02:20:56,833
Revathi, I have said it.

2335
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:01,541
That’s all. That’s it.

2336
02:21:13,833 --> 02:21:16,708
After examining the contents of this case,

2337
02:21:17,208 --> 02:21:23,458
since Raju, marked as the main witness,
is not able to attend the court,

2338
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:31,875
Raju’s dying declaration handed over by Shiva,
is accepted as the principal proof.

2339
02:21:32,833 --> 02:21:41,666
The CBI must collect all proofs
and other material from Shiva and act upon it.

2340
02:21:41,708 --> 02:21:43,833
The court orders CBI to this effect.

2341
02:21:44,791 --> 02:21:52,083
Also, the accused number one
in this case, Dakshayani,

2342
02:21:52,833 --> 02:21:55,333
and the accused number two,
IG Nataraj,

2343
02:21:55,791 --> 02:21:59,833
and the police officers
who cooperated with the accused…

2344
02:22:00,875 --> 02:22:04,916
should immediately be taken into
CBI’s custody for investigation.

2345
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:11,625
The report must be submitted within 21 days
as ordered by this court.

2346
02:22:16,458 --> 02:22:17,708
The court is adjourned.

2347
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:27,500
Thank you, Shiva.

2348
02:22:27,916 --> 02:22:29,208
You did a great job.

2349
02:22:29,833 --> 02:22:30,833
Thank you, sir.

2350
02:22:31,791 --> 02:22:32,833
If you want,

2351
02:22:33,333 --> 02:22:35,833
you can join CBI.
I can appoint you right away.

2352
02:22:38,833 --> 02:22:39,666
No, sir.

2353
02:22:39,875 --> 02:22:41,291
I prefer being a policeman.

2354
02:22:41,833 --> 02:22:42,833
This is my brother’s dream.

2355
02:22:44,708 --> 02:22:45,833
Hmm. Okay.

2356
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:49,083
But you know… that our doors
are always open for you.

2357
02:22:49,833 --> 02:22:50,625
Hmm.

2358
02:22:51,333 --> 02:22:52,250
Thank you, sir.

2359
02:22:52,333 --> 02:22:53,291
All the best.

2360
02:23:12,625 --> 02:23:13,666
Good job, Shiva.

2361
02:23:13,833 --> 02:23:14,916
What you did is right.

2362
02:23:15,250 --> 02:23:18,000
You, me, and everyone else is here
only to serve the public.

2363
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:21,041
If it is going to do them good,
you should confront anyone.

2364
02:23:21,625 --> 02:23:23,708
Be it the CM or the PM.

2365
02:23:52,206 --> 02:23:53,873
Shall we get married now?

2366
02:23:57,167 --> 02:23:59,167
Shiva, why don’t you marry Revathi
at least now?

2367
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:00,834
Audiences are also waiting.

2368
02:24:29,584 --> 02:24:32,917
“Jagada Jagada Jagadam
we are ready for a battle”

2369
02:24:33,125 --> 02:24:36,584
Ragada Ragada Ragadam
We shall shake it all”

2370
02:24:38,375 --> 02:24:42,209
“Let a thousand lives come
We shall swallow death again and again”

2371
02:24:42,417 --> 02:24:46,292
“With this seething, raging poison
Our call is a drum beat”

2372
02:24:48,584 --> 02:24:52,542
“I am the king of the jungle
Sky’s the limit but I always be humble”

2373
02:24:52,584 --> 02:24:54,584
“Lot of people talk about this and that”

2374
02:24:54,584 --> 02:24:57,250
“ But…In the end they fumble”

2375
02:24:57,500 --> 02:25:01,417
“I go voice by the gate
Paps follow me as I am chilling on a break”

2376
02:25:01,459 --> 02:25:05,292
“Talk to me nice cuz this man don’t play man;
if goes left, then it’s a little late”

2377
02:25:06,042 --> 02:25:08,375
“Talk to me nice cuz
I can boost some enterprise”

2378
02:25:08,417 --> 02:25:10,584
“Rooms flare up when I jump on the mic”

2379
02:25:10,667 --> 02:25:12,750
“Walked on the yacht with a chica
on my right”

2380
02:25:12,917 --> 02:25:15,000
“The life I am living is a hella pretty sight”

2381
02:25:15,209 --> 02:25:17,250
“Hey, I am so fly, you know”

2382
02:25:17,417 --> 02:25:19,584
“Life’s going so high,
how’d you know?”

2383
02:25:19,667 --> 02:25:21,834
“You never thought
I could spit fires you know”

2384
02:25:21,834 --> 02:25:24,584
“I am making the whole cry, you know”

2385
02:25:24,584 --> 02:25:26,542
“Hey, I am so fly, you know”

2386
02:25:26,542 --> 02:25:28,792
“Life’s going so high, how’d you know?”

2387
02:25:28,792 --> 02:25:30,792
“You never thought
I could spit fires you know”

2388
02:25:30,834 --> 02:25:33,250
“Now the whole world knows
I am style you know…”
