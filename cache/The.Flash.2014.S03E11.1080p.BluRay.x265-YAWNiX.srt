1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,847
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,765
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,161
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,045
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,484
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,608
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,842
<i>and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,611
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,730
<i>I'm gonna do everything in my power
to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,287
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,608
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,645
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,241
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force,

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,970
<i>I accidentally ran to the future.</i>

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>I saw Savitar murder you.
I wasn't fast enough to save you.</i>

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,770
We can't do this alone, Barry.

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,891
Why don't you come work with us?
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,485
- Welcome to the team.
- Yeah.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,043
If his powers are linked to the energy
that ties together the multiverse...

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,242
He can open a breach
to any Earth he wants.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,367
<i>The thing they never tell you
about fighting villains</i>

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,966
<i>is that nothing ever stays the same.</i>

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,249
<i>The harder you work
to take down the bad guys,</i>

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,164
<i>the more they up their game.</i>

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,410
Gentlemen, welcome to the future of crime.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,284
Not even the military has these yet.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,409
Looks like Christmas came early.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,444
<i>You know what the only problem is?</i>

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,484
You're on Santa's naughty list.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,365
Christmas is canceled.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,761
<i>Fortunately, our team
has a secret weapon of its own.</i>

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,805
<i>A man of science, a man of action,
and that man's name is H.R. Wells.</i>

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,531
Look who has a vortex cannon.
Ho, ho, ho!

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,528
<i>H.R.? H.R.?</i>

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,803
With a blast from my trusty vortex cannon,

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,086
I dispatched the miscreant...

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,924
- H.R.!
- Hey! Yup. Here we are.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,605
- Barry needs help.
- Yeah, Barry needs help!

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,250
- Where is Kid Flash?
- He's on his way!

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,283
Are you on your way?
They need you at Keystone Bridge.

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,562
Surely all your adventures
are not this disorganized?

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,846
There's a method

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,047
to the madness, mate, watch and learn.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,321
<i>The Electric Gang
is headed north.</i>

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,284
You got to cut them off
before they reach the freeway!

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,362
Oh, hey, how you wanna play this?

47
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,567
I have an idea.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,361
Eyes up!

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Here he comes. Just the red one.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,326
Nice work.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,771
They're out cold.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,131
Hey, boys.

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,166
They saved us. They saved us.

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,721
Who are you?

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,291
Um...

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,601
I'm Kid Flash.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,411
- Oh, my gosh, can we get your picture?
- Yes.

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,445
Ooh.-

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,801
Okay. Bye.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,688
- Go, Kid Flash!
- Go, Kid Flash!

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,725
<i>Nice save!</i>

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,645
- Could not have scripted it better myself.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,327
- But Barry did most of the heavy lifting.
- B.A.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,481
<i>Yes, bravo, boys.</i>

65
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,803
Although I did find at least six ways
you could've done it more efficiently.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,047
Just saying.

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,170
I mean, the busload of hot cheerleaders
seemed to like the way that we did things.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,328
<i>That's going in the book.
You know what, I'm running low.</i>

69
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,608
Let me buy you a cup of coffee
over at CC Jitters.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,848
- Bond, are you coming?
- No, thank you.

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,881
- So, exactly how many "hot" cheerleaders?
- I was a good boy.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,441
You know, he has just been
looking forward to this for a long time.

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,641
He's enjoying the moment.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,689
- Well, I'm glad you have his back.
- We have each other's back.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,683
It's actually been really nice
having him out there.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,650
Hey, I meant to ask you,
when you found the Electric Gang,

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,848
did you see them meeting with anyone else?

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,684
- Like who?
- Well, word on the street is,

79
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,810
there's a new arms dealer in town
with access to sophisticated weaponry

80
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,200
like the gun that Plunder used.

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,328
Don't you think that's something
for the police to handle?

82
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,891
I'm still a journalist, Barry.

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,889
I can't hide from the world
because of what you saw.

84
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,641
See you at home.

85
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,451
I can't lose her, Cisco.

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,762
Please tell me you've found a way
to change the future.

87
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,723
We found a way to change the future.

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,041
Did you really?

89
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,329
No, but Caitlin and I
did find a way to map it.

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,682
You're gonna love this. Follow me.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,200
Julian suggested we make
a 3D reconstruction

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,846
of the scene from the future
exactly as we saw it.

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,485
With toys.

94
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,687
The medium's not important.

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,808
Thank you. Eye on the ball, Barry.

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,247
Is this me? Why is he an astronaut?

97
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,131
Eye on the ball, Barry, okay?

98
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,365
Now, this diorama tells us
you need to cover this distance

99
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,685
in less than 0.21 seconds
if you wanna save Iris from Savitar.

100
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,286
What do you guys think?

101
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,488
I think what you're proposing
is impossible.

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,683
- Therefore, you will fail.
- Why?

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,128
Multi-universes may be a new
concept to me, but mathematics is not.

104
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,441
Pay attention, Allen.

105
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,924
This is your speed timeline.

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,081
This is your maximum velocity
when you first acquired your powers.

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,921
This is your current top speed.

108
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,725
And this is where you need to be in May
to cover that distance in 0.21 seconds.

109
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,690
At your current rate
of improvement, impossible.

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,801
Wow. Thank you
for that rousing pep talk, Coach.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,571
Okay, why don't you take a knee,
I think we got it covered here.

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,610
It looks like it.
I actually have to be back at CCPD.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,962
As do you. Cheerio.

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,808
He really does wanna help,
in his own snobbish, thoughtless way.

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,327
Nah, he is right.
I mean, he's kind of a dick about it,

116
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,601
but you can't argue with his math.

117
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,604
Okay, well, then we'll find
another way to make this work.

118
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,326
We need to. Iris isn't gonna die.

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,121
Thank you very much.

120
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,123
- Gotcha.
<i>- Freeze!</i>

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,331
How'd you get in here?

122
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,609
You know what they say,
every time a door closes...

123
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,765
a window opens.

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,523
- Barr...
- Hey.

125
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,125
- Nothing's missing.
- Nope.

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,011
Cash is still in the register.
Safe's not touched.

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,528
I mean, seems like a lot to go through
to get a late night cup of coffee, right?

128
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,926
Yeah, it's definitely a meta.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,044
I'll have Julian
look into his meta database,

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,611
but I think this is someone new.

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
New and dangerous.

132
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,125
Well, it's nothing that the Flash
and Kid Flash can't handle.

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,124
- My two superhero boys.
- He is doing great.

134
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,885
Speaking of my kids, Iris,

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,089
she tell you about this arms-dealer story
she's following?

136
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,169
Yeah, she's mentioned it.

137
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,049
Well, now that you're
her live-in boyfriend,

138
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,528
could you look out for her
and maybe get her to back off a bit

139
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,523
because this isn't something
she should be doing on her own.

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,806
I agree, I'm trying.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,571
She seem okay to you otherwise?

142
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,848
Yeah, why? Do you not think so?

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,403
If you guys got something going on,
I hope you know you can talk to me.

144
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,087
Yeah, I know, Joe. Thank you.
We're both doing great.

145
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,086
Okay.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,207
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,205
So, this is the footage from Jitters,
it should help us ID our new meta.

148
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,761
- Brunette? That really narrows it down.
- I'll clean that up.

149
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,127
Wow, look how clear
the picture is on that screen.

150
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,490
That's 'cause that's not from Jitters,
that's our security footage.

151
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,211
<i>H.R. Wells, I know you're in there.</i>

152
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,886
<i>Come quietly if you don't want trouble.</i>

153
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,565
<i>"H. R.?" How does she know you?</i>

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,849
Talk! Who is this gorgeous intruder?

155
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,684
Her name is Gypsy, and she's what's
known on my Earth as a "collector."

156
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,811
- What is she collecting?
- She's come to collect, you know, me.

157
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,121
Oh!

158
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,641
Where does it hurt?

159
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,450
Oh, everywhere.

160
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,603
You can vibe? Oh, I like it.

161
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,327
Slow down, there.
Let's just talk about this.

162
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,082
Like two adults, over coffee,
or maybe dinner, if you prefer that.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,050
There's a great Thai place up the road,
if you like Thai.

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,851
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,128
- Are you asking her on a date?
- Are you kidding me?

166
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,850
I am negotiating.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,322
Well, you showed me yours,
only fair I show you mine.

168
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,887
Cisco.

169
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,049
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the building.

170
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,762
Speedster. That's fun.
I like to have fun, too.

171
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,281
I see you've got a lot
to learn about your power.

172
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,683
Yeah, like that.
How do you do that? That's cool.

173
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,928
You're harboring a fugitive from justice.

174
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,970
Our world has a strict ban
on inter-dimensional travel.

175
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,565
He knew that when he came here.

176
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,087
- So, you tracked him here?
- <i>Honestly, it wasn't that hard.</i>

177
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,568
Not when he's beaming <i>H.R. Wells'
Adventures in The Multiverse</i> back

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,006
chapter by chapter.

179
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,690
You know what, whatever H.R. did,

180
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,569
you can't just come here
and take him by force.

181
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,926
Not without going through us.

182
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,602
If I really wanted to "go through" you,
you would all be dead.

183
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,251
I've got a lock on you now.

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,925
There is no getting away.

185
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,605
You've got an hour
to get your affairs in order,

186
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,165
and then you are coming back with me.

187
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,926
<i>Adios, Cisco.</i>

188
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,120
What an accent.

189
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,971
"As Francisco threw back
his lustrous locks and laughed,"

190
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,966
"I outlined my plan for neutralizing
the rampaging creature..."

191
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,771
It goes on like this for pages.

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,526
<i>He's been broadcasting this,
without our knowledge or permission,</i>

193
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,286
all the while making himself the hero.

194
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,603
Yeah, every book
needs a central protagonist

195
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,524
that the audience can invest in.

196
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,284
- I would've gone with Barry.
- Barry?

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,766
Cisco, what was that back there?
First, Golden Glider, and now her?

198
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,928
I can't help who I'm attracted to,

199
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,402
even if it is the sexy,
intense, deadly ones.

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,651
So, she takes you back to Earth-19,
and what, you pay a fine?

201
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,521
The punishment for non-authorized
"breach travel" on my Earth...

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,881
It's death.

203
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,009
- Death?
- Yeah, about 24, 25 years ago,

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,640
a neighboring Earth
invaded our planet through a breach,

205
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,770
and almost destroyed the place,
so to prevent it from happening again,

206
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,843
they banned all inter-dimensional travel.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,331
And then they put the collectors in place

208
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,211
to punish those of us
who violated the ban.

209
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,522
I didn't think that she'd track me down.

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,728
So, why would you
risk your life by coming here?

211
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,165
I'm gonna get packing.

212
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,568
It's time for H.R. to face the music.

213
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,801
Mmm-mmm.

214
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,325
Guys, I know H.R. can be annoying,
but he doesn't deserve to die.

215
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,284
Different Earths, different morality.

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,249
But he doesn't go back, I saw him.

217
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,131
In the future, with me and Iris,
and Savitar, he was there.

218
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,045
I mean, that must mean we don't
let her take him back.

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,281
Maybe we do.

220
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,608
Maybe by letting him go back to his Earth,

221
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,367
it changes your future
and prevents Iris' death.

222
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,160
I got to go see her.

223
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,209
Are you just gonna
let this woman take H.R.?

224
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,841
I don't know. No, I just...

225
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,523
I wish I knew if it would
make a difference, you know?

226
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,364
I mean, what if he goes
and nothing changes?

227
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,206
How do we ever know if our actions now
impact the future?

228
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,761
Yeah.

229
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,202
You know, sometimes I wish
we had normal-people problems.

230
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,044
Yeah, that would be nice.

231
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,928
Hey, you didn't tell Joe
about the future, did you?

232
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,206
No, of course not.

233
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,727
The last thing I need
is for him to worry about something

234
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,086
four months away that might not happen.

235
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,446
That won't happen.

236
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,806
That won't happen.

237
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,967
Maybe in the meantime, you could
let this arms-dealer thing go?

238
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,889
Oh, God, did my dad
put you up to this, too?

239
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,804
- No, he didn't have to.
- Barry, look, this...

240
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,567
No, look, I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to keep you from doing your job, okay?

241
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,724
But when we're all focused
on this H.R. thing,

242
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,126
and trying to prevent the future,

243
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,567
do we really need to
go looking for more trouble?

244
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,041
Please?

245
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,601
Okay, I'll drop it.

246
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,729
Really? Just like that?

247
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,606
Um, yes. Sometimes I do listen to you,
you know.

248
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,603
That hasn't been my experience.

249
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,966
Shut up.

250
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,767
All right, I'll see you later.

251
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,126
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you.

252
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,569
Don't you get tired of running?

253
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,921
That's the thing, running just sort of
keeps my mind off of things, I guess.

254
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,565
Must be an amazing feeling.

255
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,966
It is.

256
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,010
You know, cracking a big story
gives me an amazing feeling,

257
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,368
and I think I'm on to one.

258
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,085
Oh, that, uh, arms dealer thing?

259
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,361
How do you know about that?

260
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,330
Because both Dad and Barry
want you to lay off of it.

261
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,450
The phrase "death wish"
got tossed around a lot by them.

262
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,369
Okay, I do not have a death wish.

263
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,604
I just want to see justice done,
like everyone else in this building.

264
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,445
I get that, but it is dangerous, Iris.

265
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,483
Wally, how dangerous could it be?

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,525
I don't die till May.

267
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,765
Barry said that in Flashpoint,

268
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,651
you and I were a brother-sister
crime-fighting team.

269
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,806
I say we make that a reality again.

270
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,651
Shouldn't we ask Barry first?

271
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,646
No, this is just between us, Wally.
We can do this together.

272
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,570
Do you know what I'm really
gonna miss about this Earth?

273
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,483
- I don't know...
- Soap operas.

274
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,208
I mean, a long winding story
served up daily in hour-long chapters?

275
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,089
You never answered Caitlin's question.

276
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,328
Oh, about why I put mustard on my fries?

277
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,161
- Why you risked your life to come here.
- That.

278
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,960
I looked in a mirror.

279
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,767
I don't follow.

280
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,331
Look, on my Earth,
I had fame, I had power, I had respect.

281
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,444
I was "H.R. Wells..."

282
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,809
But when I looked in the mirror,
I knew the truth.

283
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,366
And the truth was...

284
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,401
I didn't matter.

285
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,121
I was a fraud.

286
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,325
That is why I came to this Earth.

287
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,404
So I could rewrite my story,
both literally and figuratively.

288
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,689
There's got to be
something you can do, H.R.?

289
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,841
There's not.

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,843
You can't hire a lawyer, appeal the case?

291
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,764
There's nothing I can do, B.A.!

292
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,486
I don't mean to snap at you.

293
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,120
I just... I don't have any options here.
All right?

294
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,563
Unless, of course,
I appeal for trial by combat.

295
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,562
<i>Guys, Gypsy's here.</i>

296
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,531
Always so punctual.

297
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm impressed.

298
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,486
I thought you'd try and flee again.
Time to go.

299
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,841
All right, Gypsy.

300
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,244
- Take me home.
- Wait.

301
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,326
You're not taking him anywhere.

302
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,925
- What?
- Why not?

303
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,008
Because I challenge you
to trial by combat.

304
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,851
- What are you doing?
- I'm challenging her to trial by combat.

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,606
No, no, he isn't, okay?
Lam. I'm gonna fight you.

306
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,091
Well, that one spoke first.

307
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,730
What? That's like a real rule?

308
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,804
By the laws of Earth-19,
I hereby challenge you

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,002
for possession of H.R. Wells.

310
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,642
If you want,
we can solve this another way.

311
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,080
There's a great spot for drinks.

312
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,163
You realize trial by combat
is to the death?

313
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,804
Yeah, for the loser.

314
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,683
Listen, you want him,
you have to come and claim him.

315
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,921
Hmm.

316
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,483
It's Arwen. It's fun.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,844
I take it you also want
the customary 24 hours to prepare?

318
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,044
- Do I want the customary...
- Yes, you do.

319
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,205
I would love to take advantage of the
customary 24 hours, if you don't mind.

320
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,887
Very well. One day.

321
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,281
One day.

322
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,806
See you then.

323
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,489
She's gonna kill me, isn't she?

324
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,685
She's good.

325
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,526
She's great.
Gypsy is a legend on my Earth.

326
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,523
So why exactly did you agree to fight her?

327
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,001
- I don't know.
- You did what any of us would've done.

328
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,401
I might not have done it,
just being honest.

329
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,766
Okay. All right. Lay it out for me.

330
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,684
What are my chances here,
scale of one to ten?

331
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,842
- She's gonna kill you.
- It's a pretty solid "one," mate.

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,048
You have the same powers
Gypsy does, right?

333
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,691
I mean, she's not doing anything
you can't do.

334
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,922
Much better, I mean,
she's doing it just much better.

335
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,201
<i>You can do this, okay?</i>

336
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,362
You just need a little practice
and a little confidence,

337
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,681
and we're all gonna
help you with that, right?

338
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,966
- Yes.
- Uh, sure.

339
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,360
- Yes.
- Yeah.

340
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,521
Hey.

341
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,686
I believe in you, all right?
You can beat her.

342
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,364
Listen, I have some ideas for
a training regimen I can set up in here.

343
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,761
Caitlin, why don't you get
the medical bay prepared in the meantime.

344
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,968
What? Why does she need to
set up the medical bay?

345
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,043
For when you beat her.

346
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,441
When you beat her, she's gonna
need medical attention.

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,046
'Cause you will beat her. I have every
faith that you're gonna beat her.

348
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,850
We need to work
on your interpersonal skills.

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,206
I was really trying.

350
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,929
Has anyone ever beat her?

351
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,206
Yeah.

352
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,806
No. Oh.

353
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,888
Okay. Well, I've officially reached
a nice, comfortable level

354
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,570
of just straight-up panic.

355
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,245
You don't even like me.

356
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,482
Why would you risk your life for me?

357
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,722
Well, you heard Barry,
it's what we do around here.

358
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,081
Come on. Why?

359
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,086
You're not like the other Wells-es.

360
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,480
Yeah, so you keep reminding me.

361
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,251
No, I mean, those two,
they were geniuses, we depended on them.

362
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,084
But with you, the roles are reversed.

363
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,691
You depend on us.

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,970
Harrison Wells was always there for me,
so, I guess, in some weird way,

365
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,442
I just wanna be there for Harrison Wells.

366
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,691
- Anyway...
- Yeah.

367
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,802
What are we doing here?
I thought you didn't want Dad to know

368
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,087
we're going after this arms dealer?

369
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,643
Oh, yeah, no, I don't, but actually,
I need you to swipe his file on the case,

370
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,286
photograph the pages,
and then put them back. Thanks.

371
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,131
What? Iris, have you lost your mind?
Dad will kill us.

372
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,329
No, no, Wally, he won't.

373
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,050
He won't even know
that Kid Flash was there.

374
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,884
First, you have to tell me why.

375
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,284
Okay, look, I know everyone is working
really hard to prevent Savitar from...

376
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,367
Yeah.

377
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,648
But, honestly, these could be
my last few months on Earth.

378
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,121
Can you not talk like that?

379
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,891
I'm just being realistic, Wally,
I get to do that.

380
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,168
Look, I want my life to mean something,

381
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,444
more than just a daughter,
or as a sister, or as a girlfriend,

382
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,806
but as a reporter.

383
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,491
This story can do that, it can say that,
I, Iris West, mattered.

384
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,167
You know, my life was a lot easier
before I had a sister.

385
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,685
But it's a lot better now, isn't it?

386
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,841
Come on.

387
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,801
Okay.

388
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,329
I can get you
the no-knock warrant, but, Joe,

389
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,767
this guy is armed to the teeth
with God only knows what.

390
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,843
You're gonna have to
move in there fast and hard.

391
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,961
- "Fast and hard," okay, I kind of walked...
- Hey, sorry.

392
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,167
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi.

393
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,841
Hi, Iris.

394
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,365
Hi, good to see you, Cecile.

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,449
Um, Dad, can I borrow you for a second
for a little father-daughter talk?

396
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,684
I need to go catch up with Captain Singh,
so I will be back in a little while, yeah?

397
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,888
- It was good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

398
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,009
So, what's up? How can I help you?

399
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,730
Can I talk to you for a second over here?

400
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,206
<i>Um...</i>

401
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,926
Yeah, so, um...

402
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,087
I wanted to speak to you
about me and Barry.

403
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,201
You and Barry?

404
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,725
- Yes.
- Okay.

405
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,645
So, there comes a time
in every couple's relationship

406
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,203
when you realize that there is
too much love for two people.

407
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,640
And, uh, when that happens,

408
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,883
you know in your heart
that the only solution

409
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,001
is to make your family a little bigger.

410
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,247
Okay, I'm gonna need a second...

411
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,370
Oh, Dad. Hey, hey, listen to me
very closely, this is so important to me.

412
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,761
Oh, God.

413
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,601
Um...

414
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,081
Uh...

415
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,847
- Is Barry a dog or a cat person?
- What?

416
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,445
Yeah, what kind of animal does he like,

417
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,761
because I was thinking about
getting him a pet,

418
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,410
and I don't really remember him
having a preference.

419
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,528
Oh, man, you had me
going there for a second.

420
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,926
What did you think I was talking about?

421
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,447
Nothing, nothing. You can get him
any kind of animal you want

422
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,369
as long as it has four legs.

423
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,487
Good, great advice. Four legs, copy that.

424
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,247
Thanks for the chat. Okay, bye.

425
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,601
Bye.

426
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,921
Damn.

427
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,760
Oh. Yeah, facing the wrong way again.

428
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,126
- How many is that?
- Three.

429
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,281
- Nine.
- You'll get there.

430
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,171
Yes, hopefully in the next 21 hours
and 46 minutes.

431
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,243
All right, look, whenever I'm out there,
I'm in a tough fight,

432
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,324
I think maybe I don't have it,
I just take a deep breath,

433
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,286
trust my instincts.

434
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,286
Trust my instincts, that's good.
That helps.

435
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,603
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

436
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,730
Guys, up here.

437
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,441
- Let's go talk.
- All right.

438
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,248
We can't let Francisco fight Gypsy,
because if he does, he is a dead man.

439
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,528
- You don't know that.
- Oh, I know that, you know that,

440
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,489
- he knows that, she knows that...
- Okay. I get it.

441
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,802
- We know that, everybody knows that.
- What are we supposed to do?

442
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,371
We're supposed to stop her
before she fights him.

443
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,403
That would be great
if we knew where she was.

444
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,005
- Yes?
- I know where she is.

445
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,367
- How?
- I tagged her with a tracer

446
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,521
the last time she was here.

447
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,682
A magician friend told me,
you kind of distract them and tag...

448
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,609
- H.R...
- I needed to know where she was,

449
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,723
so I could stay one step ahead of her.
She is...

450
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,689
- At the waterfront.
- At the waterfront.

451
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,968
What do you say, for Francisco?

452
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,207
All right.

453
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,321
This world may be a primitive,
uncultured backwater,

454
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,643
but they do make
an excellent cup of coffee.

455
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,723
That they do.
You know what you got to try?

456
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,044
You got to try the Brazilian roast.
It's new, it is so good.

457
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,931
- Maybe I'll take a few bags back with me.
- Yeah, I think that's wise.

458
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,366
Will you be going back in a bag?

459
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,969
Look, that kid, Francisco,
he's just trying to protect me.

460
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,289
Then he's as foolish as he is cute.

461
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,764
Okay, Gypsy, let's go home.

462
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,565
B.A.!

463
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,849
Nice try.
You think I didn't see that coming?

464
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,684
- Stop. Stop!
- Stop what?

465
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,604
- Stop...
- Stop trying to enforce the law?

466
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,131
You are a criminal.

467
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,890
<i>Now, it's great
that you made friends here,</i>

468
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,963
but that doesn't change
the fact that you lied.

469
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,407
<i>You broke our most sacred laws,</i>

470
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,410
and now it is time
for you to face justice.

471
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,724
Wait! You still need to face Cisco.

472
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,089
No, I think this little stunt
forfeits his claim and his time.

473
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,765
You just said
you believe in the law, right?

474
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,804
We made a mistake, but Cisco
will hold up his end of the deal.

475
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,961
He will.

476
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,725
You have really
pulled a number on these people

477
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,046
if they would die for you.

478
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,809
Tell Cisco there is no backing out now.

479
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,042
I'll keep this one
as insurance until then.

480
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,565
B.A...

481
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,201
That's not good.

482
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,446
- She took H.R.?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

483
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,127
Can she do that?

484
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,362
I mean, I thought this whole
trial-by-combat thing had rules.

485
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,444
Which, apparently, we broke
when we tried to get the drop on her.

486
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,126
Well, that wasn't very clever, was it?

487
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,044
A deal's a deal, it should be honored.

488
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,123
You know what? You're right, Julian.

489
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,046
A deal is a deal, and our deal was that
I would train so that I could fight Gypsy,

490
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,090
but I guess you two wanted to go
behind my back and try to sub in?

491
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,288
We didn't go... We just thought maybe
you could use some help.

492
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,441
Yeah? What happened to,

493
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,369
- "Cisco, you can beat her"?
- You can.

494
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,130
- "I believe in you."
- I do.

495
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,645
"Trust your instincts."

496
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,966
Well, right now,
my instincts are telling me

497
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,610
I should be writing
my last will and testament,

498
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,762
- so, please excuse me.
- Cisco, come...

499
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,486
- Should I go talk to him?
- No. I... I got it.

500
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,001
Looks like I'm not the only one who
has to work on their interpersonal skills.

501
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,360
<i>Oh, hey, I'd be careful if I were you.</i>

502
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,324
Last thing we want
is for me to touch a button

503
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,481
and blow your head off, right?

504
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,762
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing, right?

505
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,921
You know I don't think that.

506
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,880
Yeah, well, you have a very,
very strange way of showing it.

507
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,365
You're right, man, I'm sorry.
I don't know, I just

508
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,001
guess this whole not-getting-faster thing,
it just has me rattled.

509
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,963
<i>I was always able to do it before,
you know?</i>

510
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,481
I mean, against Reverse-Flash,
and then against Zoom,

511
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,047
but Savitar's on a whole other level.

512
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,120
And knowing what he'll do to Iris
if I fail...

513
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,082
I'm afraid just thinking
what's gonna happen to H.R.

514
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,241
if I don't beat Gypsy.

515
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,811
<i>But you, you're the hero.</i>

516
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,568
I mean, how do you handle
all this pressure all the time?

517
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,486
Byjust leaning on all of you guys,
you know?

518
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,689
I mean, you're always in my corner,
helping me face my fears.

519
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,645
<i>And it is okay to be afraid, trust me.</i>

520
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,524
And when you are,
I'll be there, in your corner.

521
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,844
Yes, lovely little speech, Allen,

522
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,369
but what Mr. Ramon needs to defeat
his inter-dimensional adversary

523
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,723
is a practical stratagem.
Lucky for you, I found one.

524
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,925
This is Gypsy's signature move,
I call it her "breach and blast."

525
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,969
Oh, yeah. That move.

526
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,202
You see, just before she comes
in and out of a breach,

527
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,850
her feet come off the ground.

528
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,729
So, for that split-second
she's off the ground,

529
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,451
- she'll be off-balance.
- Yes, and vulnerable.

530
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,649
It might behoove you
to use this during the battle.

531
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,246
This is great, Julian.

532
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,320
Hmm. Just glad I could be helpful.

533
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,321
This is more than helpful.
I got to work on this. Thank you.

534
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,721
Cheers.

535
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,121
Thanks.

536
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,567
- You sure this is the place?
- Positive.

537
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,449
<i>All right, you ready
to bust an arms dealer,</i>

538
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,601
get me a front-page headline?

539
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,366
Wally, wait. CCPD's been looking
for this guy for months.

540
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,522
He might have
some sort of secret tunnel network

541
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,125
that helps him slip out and get away.

542
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,486
I should do a quick recon.

543
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,086
Yeah, thorough.
We don't wanna miss anything, okay?

544
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,526
Be back in a you-know-what.

545
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,550
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

546
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,683
Hope you like what you see,

547
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,966
'cause this sneak preview's
gonna cost you your life.

548
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,686
Yeah, I don't think so.

549
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,844
Are you crazy?
This will rip a hole right through you.

550
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,288
Everyone's got to go sometime, right?

551
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,611
And I am pretty sure
today just isn't my day.

552
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,608
What the hell, sis?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

553
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,923
God, okay. Look, we got to get you
out of here before CCPD sees you.

554
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,849
Don't worry, Dad's, like,
my biggest fan now.

555
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,122
He's totally cool with me
doing stuff like this.

556
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,805
Hell, no, I ain't cool with this!

557
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,204
You two almost compromised
a major CCPD sting operation

558
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,442
that took the DA's office
months to assemble!

559
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,291
- You still got the guy, right?
- That is not the point, Iris.

560
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,603
The point is, you had you and your brother
out there in danger, and for what?

561
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,848
A story? And where the hell were you?

562
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,764
Dad, this is more
than just a story for me.

563
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,445
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.

564
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,201
Okay.

565
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,601
What?

566
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,369
Iris, what is going on with you?

567
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,687
Joe, I'm sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?

568
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,887
We'll be right back.

569
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,125
Joe already suspects something's up.

570
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,009
You going out there like that,
it just hangs a bell on it.

571
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,050
This story is going to
change lives, Barry.

572
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,449
Why do you think that you're the only one
allowed to risk your life to do good?

573
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,086
I don't.

574
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,249
It's okay to be afraid of the future.

575
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,805
But I won't let you die.

576
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,763
I am not afraid to die, Barry, I'm not!

577
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,361
Then, what?

578
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,206
I'm afraid...

579
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,163
What if I end up just like my mom?

580
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,331
Just gone, without making a mark,
without leaving anything behind.

581
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,769
Iris, your mom, she left something behind.

582
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,521
She left a brave, wonderful son

583
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,165
and the woman that I love.

584
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,167
All right?

585
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,121
I don't know what the future holds,
none of us do.

586
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,528
I know that we will face it together.

587
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,644
Gypsy just vibed me her location.

588
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,240
Let's do this.

589
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,167
I don't think
the literary critics on our Earth

590
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,244
would know a real
sci-fi, romance bestseller

591
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,926
- unless it bit them in the...
- Time's up, Wells.

592
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,365
Looks like your so-called friend
is a coward after all.

593
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,681
He's not a coward.

594
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,128
He's one of the finest men
I've ever known.

595
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,960
<i>Oh, you're right about that!</i>

596
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,361
I'm fine as hell.

597
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,444
There he is.

598
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,840
Didn't think you'd show.

599
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,442
Oh, I wouldn't miss an evening with you,
even if it is for a showdown.

600
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,086
I will kill you, Cisco.

601
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,691
We'll see who dies tonight.

602
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,570
To the victor goes H.R. Wells.

603
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,210
May the best vibe win.

604
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,769
Part of me was hoping
you wouldn't show tonight.

605
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,201
How do you wanna do this?

606
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,727
Westworld style, back-to-back 10 paces,
turn and shoot?

607
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,331
No.

608
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,520
- This does not bode well.
- Cisco can hold his own.

609
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,721
Barely.

610
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,008
Barry, we can't let this happen.
What if he can't defeat her?

611
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,050
I can't interfere again. If I do,
then we forfeit, H.R.'s a dead man.

612
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,884
At this rate,
Cisco's gonna be the dead man.

613
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,690
Ooh!

614
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,443
Ooh, girl, you done did it now!

615
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,526
You're stronger than I thought.

616
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,650
I'm just getting warmed up.

617
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,126
Yeah, maybe not do that.

618
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,964
Time to turn things up to 11.

619
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,041
<i>Spinal Tap.</i> That's, like,
one of my favorite movies.

620
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,407
- Where did they go?
- They could be anywhere by now.

621
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,965
In any universe.

622
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,361
This is Earth-2.

623
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,570
You're cute, but you talk too much.

624
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,286
Oh, you wanna play dirty, huh?

625
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,601
Let's play dirty.

626
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,283
That hurts.

627
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,930
That, too.

628
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,811
Is it me, or is this city getting weirder?

629
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,326
Well, this is hot.

630
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,324
I think you're flirting with me
to distract me 'cause you're afraid.

631
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,643
My collection record is flawless.

632
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,849
In these trials, I am undefeated.

633
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,325
Oh, please,
everybody's got a weakness.

634
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,521
Even you.

635
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,728
Says the man afraid of showing everyone
how powerful he can be.

636
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,601
You and I resonate
on a similar frequency, I can feel it,

637
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,730
yet you allow your fear and insecurity
to hold you back.

638
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,247
That's why you're gonna lose.

639
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,521
Does this look like holding back to you?

640
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,051
I could do this all night.

641
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,201
How did you...

642
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,567
You might wanna work
on your balance next time, girl.

643
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,246
Admit it, I won.

644
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,045
- He won?
- Yes! Yeah, he did.

645
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,890
- He won! Yes!
- Yeah.

646
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,689
She must've been having an off day.

647
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,370
- What?
- Wow.

648
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,081
By the laws of Earth-19,
prisoner is yours for the taking,

649
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,326
as is my life.

650
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,290
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't roll like that around here.

651
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,241
Come on.

652
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:56,409
In all the multiverse,
I have never met anyone like you, Cisco.

653
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,408
Please, call me Vibe.

654
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,525
Or you can call me Cisco,
that's also allowed.

655
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,611
Just a regular guy,
just a regular single guy.

656
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,284
It says you're totally fine.

657
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,290
So, what happens now?

658
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,761
Go back to your Earth,

659
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,922
tell all your superiors that
you were bested in battle,

660
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,009
all the charges against H.R. are dropped?

661
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,091
No, I tell them I killed him.

662
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,961
Wait, what?

663
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,282
If I return empty-handed,
they'll know I failed,

664
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,489
and I never fail, until today.

665
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,167
Okay, but if you tell them
that you killed me, then I...

666
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,483
You'll never go back to Earth-19, ever.

667
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,841
Do we have a deal?

668
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,490
Yeah, I guess we have a deal.

669
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,130
I don't really have anything
to go home for.

670
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,362
You'll always have a home here, H.R.

671
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,405
Listen, I know there's
no coffee on your Earth,

672
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,766
'cause of the whole blight thing
or whatever,

673
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,482
but this is an absurd amount of coffee
to be bringing back to your Earth.

674
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,004
- That can't be legal.
- I mean, I won't tell if you won't.

675
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,331
You know, for someone so fixated
on enforcing the law,

676
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,562
you sure seem oddly at ease
about breaking it.

677
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,047
I guess some laws are worth breaking

678
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,526
for the right person.

679
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,325
Hmm.

680
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,246
So, it's goodbye, then?

681
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,801
For now.

682
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,807
Wow.

683
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,845
What an exit.

684
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,929
Okay, you know, for the fastest man alive,
you are the slowest reader.

685
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,129
Hey, this is your big article,
I'm not gonna rush through it.

686
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,762
I'm just kidding,
I read it five times already.

687
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,966
You sure sold the hell out of Kid Flash
as Central City's next super-savior.

688
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,242
I'm sure Wally's loving that.

689
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,602
Well, I did promise him the front page.

690
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,526
What do you think?

691
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,405
Do you think it will make any difference?

692
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,404
Kid Flash already changed one thing
that we saw in the future.

693
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,011
No, I meant the article.

694
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,045
- What?
- The article?

695
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,884
I think you should be really proud.

696
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,641
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

697
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,680
It's the beginning of
an amazing journalistic legacy.

698
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,007
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

699
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,606
How amazing? Like, Pulitzer amazing?

700
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,761
Time will tell.

701
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,926
Hey, I'm sorry.

702
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,528
- You know what I realized?
- Hmm?

703
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,730
Savitar, he said that I trapped him
wherever he is.

704
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,086
You know what that means?

705
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,411
It means I beat him,

706
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,289
and I'm gonna do it again, I promise.

707
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,361
So, don't worry,
the Flash is gonna save you.

708
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,681
My hero.

709
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,445
The thing they never tell you is that
nothing ever stays the same.

710
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,086
So, the harder you work
to take down the bad guys,

711
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,765
the more they up their game.

712
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,166
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

713
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,721
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
- No, no.

714
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,527
- Just had to grab some stuff.
- Yeah.

715
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,090
I thought you were finished
working with that.

716
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,528
Oh, no, it's just... This is just for me.

717
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,245
No, the book, it...

718
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,085
You know, my own personal
sense of accomplishment.

719
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,443
Well, you've accomplished plenty.

720
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,442
What have I accomplished, Francisco?

721
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,126
Well, for one, you got me
to risk my life to save yours,

722
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,051
and, trust me, my friend,
that is a huge accomplishment.

723
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,124
Yeah, about that,

724
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,889
I just wanna say that I appreciate
what you did for me.

725
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,289
Yeah, it's what we do
for our friends, right?

726
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,802
Besides, it was a way for me
to balance the scales.

727
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,923
Balance the scales, right.
What does that mean?

728
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,647
I just mean, I can't tell you the amount
of times that I've been in your shoes,

729
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,609
and a man with your face
has made me feel better.

730
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,728
Yeah, about that, I would

731
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,528
love if you could share some
of my doppelgangers' knowledge.

732
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,001
I would love to know what
the smarter versions of me think.

733
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,046
Okay. Um...

734
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,690
The first Wells told me
my time would come to be a hero.

735
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,530
That it was my job to show up,
to be ready for when it did.

736
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,361
You know why I love working here?

737
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,681
Why?

738
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,089
We're all making investments
in each other.

739
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,531
I made an investment in you.

740
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,490
And one day,
that investment's gonna pay off

741
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,049
when you use that crazy way of thinking
you have to help me out.

742
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,685
I guess if he were here,
he would say, "Show up."

743
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,967
Yeah.

744
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,045
- <i>Be ready.</i>
- Yeah.

745
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,966
'Cause one day
you might need to save my ass.

746
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,007
Keep it up, at this rate,
you're gonna reach Mach 3 soon.

747
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,648
I know, it's crazy how fast I've gotten
in such a short time, right?

748
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,525
Yeah, and I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

749
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,481
- Why's that?
- Because I've done the math over and over,

750
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,961
and I finally realized that I've been
looking at things the wrong way.

751
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,248
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar,

752
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,801
you are.

753
00:41:56,825 --> 00:42:04,825
