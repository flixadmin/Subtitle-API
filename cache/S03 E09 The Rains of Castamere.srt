1
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,629
Catelyn: Are you
sure about this?

2
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,675
It's dangerous.

3
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,096
If we take tywin's castle from him,

4
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,433
the lords of Westeros
will realize he's not invincible.

5
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,936
Take his home, take
his gold, take his power.

6
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,272
Why are you telling me?

7
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,819
You begged me not to send theon

8
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,698
to negotiate with his father,
and I ignored your advice.

9
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,994
Now winterfell is burnt to the ground,

10
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:45,082
the north is overrun with ironborn,
and bran and rickon are gone.

11
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,711
So, casterly rock...

12
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,926
I'm asking your advice.

13
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,935
We have enough men?

14
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,357
If walder frey cooperates.

15
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,235
If walder frey cooperates.

16
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,704
If reinforcements arrive from king's
landing before we take the castle,

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,834
we'll be caught between
tywin's army and the sea.

18
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,551
We'll lose the war and
die the way father died.

19
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,344
Or worse.

20
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,561
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

21
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,011
Walder: My honored guests,

22
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,266
be welcome within my walls and at my table.

23
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,104
I extend to you my hospitality

24
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,025
and protection in the light of the seven.

25
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,527
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

26
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:46,536
I have come to make my apologies, my
lord, and to beg your forgiveness.

27
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't beg my forgiveness, your grace.

28
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,377
It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.

29
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,392
One of them was supposed to be queen.

30
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,019
Now none of them are.

31
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,149
This is an/vyn, my daughter.

32
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,821
My daughter walda, my daughter denna,

33
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,448
my daughter waldra.

34
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:33,083
My eldest granddaughters ginia and neila.

35
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,172
Serra and sarra, granddaughters, twins.

36
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,966
You could have had either.

37
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,219
Could have had both, for all I care.

38
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,596
My granddaughter marianne.

39
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,683
My granddaughter Freya.

40
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,477
My granddaughter...

41
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,855
Wertha.

42
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,859
Waldra.

43
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,320
Waldina.

44
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,571
I'm merry.

45
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,323
Fine.

46
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,035
And here's my youngest daughter shirei,

47
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,913
though she hasn't bled yet.

48
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,583
Clearly you don't have
the Patience for all that.

49
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,794
My ladies.

50
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,172
All men should
keep their word, kings most of all.

51
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,844
I was pledged to
marry one of you and I broke that vow.

52
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,013
The fault is not with you.

53
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,348
Any man would be lucky
to have any one of you.

54
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:36,396
I did what I did not to slight
you, but because I loved another.

55
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,315
I know these words cannot set right

56
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,275
the wrong I have done
to you and your house.

57
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,777
I beg your forgiveness

58
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:48,158
and pledge to do all I can to make
amends so the freys of the crossing

59
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,702
and the starks of winterfell
may once again be friends.

60
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,004
Walder: Very good.

61
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,424
There she is.

62
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,054
Come closer. Let me have a look at you.

63
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,604
Still can't see you.

64
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,190
Old eyes.

65
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,457
Love.

66
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,127
That's what the starks
of winterfell call it, eh?

67
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,467
Very honorable. I call it a pretty face.

68
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,593
Mmm.

69
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,679
Very pretty.

70
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,849
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.

71
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,436
Very shapely as well.

72
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,274
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.

73
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,068
If you wanted to hide her,

74
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,445
you shouldn't have
brought her here in the first place.

75
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,331
I can always see
what's going on beneath a dress.

76
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,750
Been at this a long time.

77
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,171
I bet when you take that dress off,

78
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,924
everything stays right where it is.

79
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,426
Doesn't drop an inch.

80
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,180
Your king says he betrayed me for love.

81
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,352
I say he betrayed
me for firm tits and a tight fit.

82
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,148
And I can respect that.

83
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,236
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

84
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,656
to get into that without a second thought.

85
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,830
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

86
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:03,126
We'll set up tents outside
with food and ale for the rest of your men.

87
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,128
Thank you, my lord.

88
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,966
Well, let's get ready.

89
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,343
The wine will flow red

90
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,805
and the music will play loud

91
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,143
and we'll put this mess behind us.

92
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,570
Where?

93
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,155
There.

94
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,624
There. It's a back gate.

95
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,126
My men use it
when they visit yunkai's bed slaves.

96
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,878
Your men, but not you?

97
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,630
Daario: I have no interest in slaves.

98
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,840
A man cannot make love to property.

99
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,430
This is where we enter
the city. Very few guards. They know me.

100
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,807
They let me inside...

101
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,101
We're not gonna
sneak an army through a back gate.

102
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,352
Daario: I kill the guards.

103
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,937
I take your two best men

104
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,107
and lead them through the
back streets, which I know well,

105
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,192
and open the front gates.

106
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,528
Then comes the army.

107
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,114
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

108
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,866
Or perhaps you'll lead grey
worm and me to the slaughter,

109
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,494
cutting the head off our army.

110
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,538
The masters of yunkai will pay you your fee

111
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,456
and you won't have to split it three ways

112
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,708
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

113
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,461
You have a very suspicious mind.

114
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,131
In my experience,
only dishonest people think this way.

115
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,552
You command the unsullied.

116
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,197
What do you think?

117
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,515
You are a leader now.

118
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,935
Do you trust him?

119
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,858
I trust him.

120
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,068
You leave tonight.

121
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,947
Very good. We'll prepare.

122
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,579
Ser jorah.

123
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,291
You can use an extra sword.

124
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,378
You're the queensguard,
ser barristan. Your place is by the queen.

125
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,131
If we are truly her onal servants,

126
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,383
we'll do whatever needs to be done,

127
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,304
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

128
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,059
Samwell: We're west of castle black,

129
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,270
but the nightfort's closest to us.

130
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,523
It was the first castle on the wall.

131
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,985
The watch abandoned it
during the reign of king jaehaerys I.

132
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,530
Too big. Impossible to maintain.

133
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,158
Other than castle black itself,

134
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,702
the nightfort's the perfect castle for us.

135
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:48,666
It's got a secret Sally port,
the black gate, as old as the wall itself.

136
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,337
No one's used it in centuries, most likely.

137
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,050
It leads through
the wall right down into the nightfort,

138
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:02,180
if one knows how to find it,
which, it just so happens, I do.

139
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,270
How do you know all that?

140
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,149
I read about it in a very old book.

141
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:23,368
You know all that
from staring at marks on paper?

142
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,954
Yes.

143
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,998
You're like a wizard.

144
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,182
Our father used to tell us

145
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,186
that no wildling ever looked
upon the wall and lived.

146
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,730
Here we are.

147
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,650
Alive.

148
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,627
Remember what happens to children who run.

149
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,380
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

150
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,851
The roads have gone right to hell.

151
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,294
Cracked three spokes this morning.

152
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,687
Need a hand?

153
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,938
Need about eight hands.

154
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,106
Oh!

155
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,819
Got to get this salt pork to the
twins in time for the wedding.

156
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,613
Many thanks.

157
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,328
Don't! Don't kill him.

158
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,621
Dead rats don't squeak.

159
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,498
You're so dangerous, aren't you?

160
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,417
Saying scary things to little girls.

161
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,629
Killing little boys and old
people. A real hard man you are.

162
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,173
More than anyone you know.

163
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,424
You're wrong.

164
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
I know a killer.

165
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,511
- A real killer.
- That so?

166
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,265
You'd be like a kitten to him.
He'd kill you with his little finger.

167
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,435
That him?

168
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,688
- No.
- Good.

169
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,149
Don't kill him.

170
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,401
Please.

171
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,445
Please don't.

172
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,619
You're very kind.
Someday it'll get you killed.

173
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,097
Where are we?

174
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,932
The gift, I think.

175
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,142
Brandon the builder gave all this land

176
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,977
south of the wall to the night's watch

177
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,605
for their sustenance and support.

178
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,982
Maester luwin taught me that.

179
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

180
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,532
It's good land, and there's no war up here.

181
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,491
Why leave?

182
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,160
Wildlings.

183
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,079
Sorry.

184
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,500
But they come over
the wall and raid, steal, carry off women.

185
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,669
Old nan said they
turn your skull into a cup

186
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,838
and make you drink your own blood from it.

187
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,217
That's what old nan said.

188
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:27,927
There's a storm coming.

189
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,221
I don't see any.

190
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,953
It's as good a place to shelter as any.

191
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,191
We can drink some blood while we wait.

192
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,610
I don't need much.

193
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,958
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

194
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,794
What's one old man doing with eight horses?

195
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,838
He breeds them for the watch.

196
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,756
How's he keep folks from stealing them?

197
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,967
The watch protects him.

198
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,636
Orell: Not today, they don't.

199
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,473
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

200
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,057
Tormund: And proper steel.

201
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,350
Orell: Let's carve him up.

202
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,935
We just take the horses and go.

203
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,563
The old man's no threat.

204
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,149
I keep telling you.

205
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,278
He's an old man. A spear through
the heart's a better way to die

206
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,072
than coughing up your
last with no one but your horses to hear.

207
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,244
The watch might send
a few men looking for a horse thief.

208
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,164
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

209
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,960
I hope so.
Killing crows in their castle is tough.

210
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,672
Killing them out
here in the open, that's what we do.

211
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,927
Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.

212
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,845
Yg ritte I

213
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,891
tormund: Clear the barn!

214
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,529
No one's going to believe
you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.

215
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,768
Best part of the animal.

216
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,275
Don't worry. They're still there.

217
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,361
I know they're still there.

218
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,032
You check every five minutes
like you're afraid they're gonna move.

219
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,701
I'm not afraid.

220
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,994
Of course you are.

221
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:45,583
You're almost there
and you're afraid you won't make it.

222
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,211
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

223
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,465
No point in trying to
hide behind that face.

224
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,426
I know fear when I see it.

225
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,303
Seen it a lot.

226
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,222
I knew fear when I saw it in you.

227
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,685
You're afraid of fire.

228
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,396
When beric's sword went up in flames,

229
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,023
you looked like a scared little girl.

230
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,904
And I know why, too.

231
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,241
I heard what your brother did to you.

232
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,372
Pressed your face to the fire like
you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

233
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,252
That give you some ideas?

234
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,299
Might do.

235
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,346
Go ahead, then. You might get away.

236
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,057
Might even make it there on your own.

237
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,227
They're just over the river.

238
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,355
The closest you've been to family

239
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,774
since ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

240
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,571
Someday I'll put a sword through

241
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,740
your eye and out the back of your skull.

242
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,143
How are we going to get past the wall?

243
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,479
My uncle said it's 700 feet high.

244
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,819
How did you get past it?

245
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,868
Got in a boat and rowed
past the bay of seals.

246
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,246
It would take us two months
to get to the bay of seals.

247
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,081
Some climb straight up the ice.

248
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,791
Even hodor's not strong enough to

249
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,543
climb the wall with me on his back.

250
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,669
Hodor: Hodor.

251
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,340
Nineteen castles guard the wall.

252
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,526
Only three are still manned.

253
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,630
Hodor!

254
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,905
One of those abandoned
fortresses will give us a way through.

255
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,848
My uncle said the gates
were sealed with ice

256
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,850
and stone when the castles were deserted.

257
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,478
Well, we'll have to open them up again.

258
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,773
Old man: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,274
Meera: There's a rider out there.

260
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,569
Just one?

261
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,404
- Meera: There's more.
- Hodor!

262
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,700
It's just thunder, sweet giant.

263
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,160
Hodor

264
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,537
old man: I yield.

265
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,164
- I yield.
- Wildlings.

266
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,796
Where's shaggydog and summer?

267
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,963
Hunfing.

268
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,925
Hodor!

269
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,135
- Shh. Quiet, hodor.
- Hodor!

270
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,262
Make him shut up. If they hear us...

271
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,782
Hush, hodor. No... no more hodoring.

272
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,224
Hodor!

273
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,975
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

274
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,019
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

275
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,938
Brandon: Hodor, be quiet.

276
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,566
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

277
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,026
Hodor! Hodor!

278
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,528
Hodor, be quiet!

279
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,635
What did you do?

280
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,054
Nothing.

281
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,181
I don't know.

282
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,771
What's that?

283
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,440
That's a horse dying.

284
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,953
Man 1: Bring them over here.

285
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,081
Man 2: That was
the last of them. The rest are dead.

286
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,709
Orell: I heard shouting up there.

287
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,085
Thunder.

288
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,088
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

289
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,966
Maybe it's ghosts.

290
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,062
That won't help you, grandpa.

291
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,943
Where you riding?

292
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,070
Doesn't matter now, does it?

293
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,573
No, it doesn't matter now.

294
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,661
Cut his throat,
or he'll tell the crows we're here.

295
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,377
You understand.

296
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,296
Let me stand at least.

297
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,758
Let me go with a bit of dignity.

298
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,473
Make the crow kill him.

299
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,438
You're one of us now. Prove it.

300
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,694
Jojen: The wolves are out there.

301
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,991
I can't do it by choice.

302
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,160
I don't know how.

303
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,120
It happens in my dreams.

304
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,040
You're a warg, bran. It's in your blood.

305
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,876
I can't.

306
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,045
You just did, with him.

307
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,905
A onf is nothing compared to that.

308
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,139
She looks sharp.

309
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,818
Do it.

310
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,320
Do it.

311
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,448
I told you. He's still one of them.

312
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,160
Go on, boy.

313
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,707
Go on!

314
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,593
He's a crow. He'll always be a crow.

315
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,471
And here's his crow wife guarding him.

316
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,599
He'll stab us in the
back first chance he gets.

317
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,104
Kill him.

318
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,121
He's one of them.

319
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,291
Do you hear me? Ahh!

320
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,383
You're not gonna die for one of them.

321
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,178
Do it.

322
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,431
They'll find us if you don't.

323
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,962
You were right the whole time.

324
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,387
Daario: When you hear
a songbird's whistle, you come.

325
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,683
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

326
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,232
Daario naharis.

327
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,137
Daario: That one was quick.

328
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,475
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

329
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,520
The yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

330
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,942
Jorah: That's what you call a few guards?

331
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,511
Come on! What do you got, huh?

332
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,545
Lord edmure,

333
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,091
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

334
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,436
You're a delight to me, my lady.

335
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,232
You may now cloak the bride
and bring her under your protection.

336
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:33,183
In the sight of the seven,
I hereby seal these two souls,

337
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,646
binding them as one for eternity.

338
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,399
Look upon each other and say the words.

339
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,237
- Father, Smith...
- Father, Smith...

340
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,697
- Warrior, mother...
- Warrior, mother...

341
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,826
- Maiden, crone, stranger.
- Maiden, crone, stranger.

342
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,120
- I am hers...
- I am his...

343
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,205
- And she is mine...
- And he is mine...

344
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,750
Both: From this day
until the end of my days.

345
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,340
Meera: Is that safe?

346
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,883
Osha: They're long gone.

347
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,265
Brandon: You were right.

348
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,435
I can get inside
summer's mind whenever I want.

349
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,228
Of course you can.

350
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,314
North of the wall there are wildlings

351
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,275
who can control all sorts of animals.

352
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,361
But you did a lot more than that.

353
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,782
You got inside hodor's mind.

354
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,139
They can't do that north of the wall?

355
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,708
No one can do that. Anywhere.

356
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,092
When I was looking through summer's eyes,

357
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,760
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

358
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,095
He was with the wildlings.

359
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,473
They tried to kill him, but he got away.

360
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,558
Osha: He'll be heading back
to castle black, then.

361
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,226
That's where we should go.

362
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,729
For all we know,
castle black's already under attack.

363
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,373
If this many wildlings got through...

364
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,482
I already told you.

365
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm not going north of the wall.

366
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,361
Everything jojen told me is true.

367
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,657
You saw what I did to hodor.

368
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,743
I have to find the three-eyed raven.

369
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,328
Listen to me, little lord.

370
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,621
Don't worry.

371
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,582
I'm not asking you to come with me.

372
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,336
It won't be safe for rickon.

373
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,506
Me? I'm coming with you.

374
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,511
You and osha and shaggydog
head for the last hearth.

375
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,847
The umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

376
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,936
I'm coming with you.
I'm your brother. I have to protect you.

377
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,983
Right now I have to protect you.

378
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,654
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the wall.

379
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,782
If something happens to us,
you're the heir to winterfell.

380
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,037
Would you know how to find the last hearth?

381
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,541
You southerners
build your big castles and you never move.

382
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,959
You're easy to find.

383
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,836
We're not southerners.

384
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,839
And I don't want to leave you.

385
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:10,924
Osha: Shh!

386
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,968
Come here, little soldier.

387
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,347
You and me,
we're gonna have some adventures.

388
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,016
You don't have to do any of this.

389
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,272
Your family took me in
and was good to me without cause.

390
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,151
We'll be fine, you and me.

391
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,281
The umbers are great warriors. Even I
heard about them growing up.

392
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,367
They'll teach you how to swing a sword.

393
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,662
I know how to swing a sword.

394
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,589
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

395
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,257
I learned to walk in darkness.

396
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,500
Say your good-byes, little man.

397
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,688
Keep this one safe.

398
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,525
He means the world to me.

399
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,507
We've been waiting a long time.

400
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,303
Haven't we?

401
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,389
Well, I don't know, you tell me.

402
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,308
How long does it take to sack a city?

403
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,818
It was just as you said.

404
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,155
They did not believe until it was too late.

405
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:02,577
Their slave soldiers
threw down their Spears and surrendered.

406
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,250
And daario naharis?

407
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,482
The city is yours, my queen.

408
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,173
They're good, aren't they?

409
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,937
They ought to be because they cost enough.

410
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,268
Look at the crowd there.

411
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,941
He complained about this marriage

412
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,235
the entire ride from riverrun,

413
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,570
and now look at him.

414
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,864
Blackfish: The gods love to reward a fool.

415
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,574
- Uncle.
- What?

416
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:28,413
He's my nephew. I love him.
And he's a damned fool.

417
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,920
Don't you drink, lord Bolton?

418
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,423
Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.

419
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,508
Blackfish: That's the point.

420
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,594
Didn't you marry one of these frey girls?

421
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,431
Aye. Lord walder
let me choose any of his granddaughters

422
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,518
and promised me
the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.

423
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,270
So I have a fat young bride.

424
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,191
I hope she makes you very happy.

425
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,026
Well, she's made me very rich.

426
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,114
Pardon, my lord,
my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.

427
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,120
My mother's alone
with roose Bolton. I should rescue her.

428
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,707
Your mother is less in need of rescue
than any woman I've ever met.

429
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,044
Be kind. She's finally
starting to like you.

430
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,547
And I like her.

431
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,967
But if she had her way,
I would be back in volantis

432
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,304
playing my harp
and you would be sitting over there,

433
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,349
eating blackberries out
of Roslin frey's hand.

434
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,476
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

435
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,148
Striking your king is an act of treason.

436
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,986
No, don't

437
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,823
don't insult them.

438
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,536
Your grace.

439
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,547
The septon has prayed his prayers,

440
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,549
some words were said,

441
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:07,470
and lord edmure
has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.

442
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:11,850
But they are not yet man and wife.

443
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,768
A sword needs a sheath.

444
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,151
And a wedding needs a bedding.

445
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,030
What does my sire say?

446
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,033
All: To bed! To bed! To bed!

447
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,918
If you think the time is right,
lord walder, by all means,

448
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,045
let us bed them.

449
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,763
All: To bed! To bed! To bed!

450
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,187
Man: Go on.

451
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,749
Ho-ho!

452
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,751
Careful now, ladies.

453
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,836
Once you set that monster free,

454
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,963
there's no caging him again.

455
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,801
All: To bed! To bed! To bed!

456
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,431
Poor girl.

457
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,225
Every bride suffers the same.

458
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,770
I'm sure you endured yours with grace.

459
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,855
Oh, ned forbade it.

460
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,442
He said it wouldn't be right if he
broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.

461
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,204
That is a very strange custom.

462
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,999
I suppose it does seem strange
from a foreigner's perspective.

463
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,542
It seems normal to you?

464
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,962
It's a tradition.

465
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,675
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

466
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,593
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

467
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:14,722
No, but there
are other ways of providing proof.

468
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,726
Boy or girl?

469
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,147
I don't know.

470
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,067
But if it's a boy,
I know what we should name him.

471
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,819
Oh, do you?

472
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,781
It seems to me the father
should have some say in his son's naming.

473
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,074
Eddard.

474
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:41,416
Don't you want to
teach little ned stark how to ride horses?

475
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,459
I do.

476
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,726
Man: Go on, line 'em up!

477
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,328
Hound: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,124
Where are you going?

479
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,168
Got salt pork for the feast.

480
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,586
The feast is over.

481
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,006
Hound: Doesn't sound like it's over.

482
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,926
If I tell you it's over, it's over.

483
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,305
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

484
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,015
Hound: Got pig's feet, too.

485
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,020
Are you soft in the head?
Turn this cart around.

486
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,368
Your grace.

487
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:52,672
I feel I've been remiss in my duties.

488
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,134
I've given you meat and wine and music,

489
00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:01,681
but I haven't shown you
the hospitality you deserve.

490
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,687
My king has married
and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

491
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,776
Robb!

492
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,793
Ohh!

493
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,755
Ahh!

494
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,285
Man 1:
You ready to head home to winterfell, eh?

495
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,040
Man 2: Feast over yet, is it?

496
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,124
Aye, it's over.

497
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,828
Aim!

498
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,192
It's too late.

499
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,571
The king in the north arises.

500
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,218
Lord walder!

501
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,846
Lord walder, enough!

502
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,265
Let it end!

503
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:37,188
Please. He is my son.

504
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,607
My first son.

505
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,193
Let him go,
and I swear that we will forget this.

506
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,153
I swear it by the old gods and new.

507
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,530
We will take no vengeance.

508
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:50,159
You already swore me
one oath right here in my castle.

509
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,913
You swore by all the gods
your son would marry my daughter!

510
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,458
Catelyn: Take me
for a hostage, but let robb go.

511
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,295
Robb, get up. Get up and walk out.

512
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,506
Please!

513
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,468
Please!

514
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,431
And why would I let him do that?

515
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,769
On my honor as a Tully,

516
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,189
on my honor as a stark,

517
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:26,404
let him go, or I will
cut your wife's throat.

518
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,164
I'll find another.

519
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,128
Mother.

520
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,297
The lannisters send their regards.
