00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,003
<i>This season on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,601
I went back in time
and created an alternate timeline,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,086
<i>a whole new existence.</i>

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,482
<i>I created Flashpoint
and changed everything.</i>

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,490
- Who are you?
- Savitar, the god of speed.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,205
You said that I trapped you
in the future. Where?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,085
The only place that could hold me,
the Speed Force.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,442
- Iris West, will you marry me?
- Yes.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,087
Dr. Brand invents the technology
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,850
- Good luck with that.
<i>- We don't want to fight you.</i>

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,445
We're your friends, your family.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,483
- Caitlin, I love you.
- I never loved any of you.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,966
<i>Caitlin's working with Savitar.</i>

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,322
<i>- Caitlin is dead.</i>
<i>- Not to me.</i>

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,649
<i>- I know who you are.</i>
- I am the Future Flash.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,047
<i>When I have control of all of time,</i>

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,130
it will be you
who is abandoned and forgotten.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,689
And I only need for Iris to die, so that
you are driven so far into the dark

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,847
that I can be born.

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,087
<i>I'm gonna stop you.</i>

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,089
- It didn't work.
- You lose, Barry.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,401
No!

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,727
Iris.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,561
Oh, no...

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,727
Iris? Iris.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,721
B.A.

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,561
What?

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,801
B.A.

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,561
H.R.?

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,121
Dad...

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,081
Dad.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,641
Baby?

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,961
Yeah.

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,441
I don't understand.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,601
It was H.R.

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,205
Until the next one.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,321
H.R.?

38
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,807
Hi.

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,881
Hi.

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,611
Let's get you out of here.

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,966
- Where is everybody else?
- Couldn't tell.

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,970
Barry or Savitar would know I was coming.

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,049
- Let's get you out of here.
- Okay.

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,721
Get her.

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,208
- We can't outrun them.
- No, we can't.

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,161
What are you doing?

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,844
I'm the reason Savitar found you.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,241
- I need to remedy that.
- Not like this.

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,561
Give me that.

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,688
Don't! I'm the one he wants, okay?

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,848
Please, don't hurt him.

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,927
H.R.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,001
Tracy...

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,688
- No, no, no...
- It's okay.

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,611
Why are you doing this?

56
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,850
I couldn't be a coward.

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,680
I'm not a coward.

58
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,451
- But we just found each other.
- I know.

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,409
Our story will be brilliant.
You will be brilliant.

60
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,487
You will be glorious, Tracy Brand.

61
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,566
You will be.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

62
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,961
I love you.

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,489
- B.A.? B.A.
- I'm right here.

64
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,925
Will you tell Cisco...

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,561
Please tell him...

66
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,727
Will you tell him that, for me?

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,410
- Yeah.
- Good.

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,401
Now,

69
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
go stop Savitar.

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,083
H.R. H.R.

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,008
Savitar took the Speed Force bazooka.

72
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,971
Bye-bye, Vibe.

73
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,170
Keep him alive.

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,131
What? Why?

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,690
Because I need him
to build something for us.

76
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,366
<i>Iris West Allen.</i>

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,210
It changed back.

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,162
- Does that mean what I think it means?
- Yeah, Joe.

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,366
The future is ours again.

80
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,841
Savitar?

81
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,167
- Something's wrong.
- What is it?

82
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,243
She's not dead.

83
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,411
- How is that possible?
- H.R.

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,726
He took her place.

85
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,721
H.R.?

86
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,522
- I thought you said H.R. lives.
- Not anymore.

87
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,369
If Iris doesn't die...

88
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,569
That means the future is changing.

89
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,441
So is yours.

90
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,366
What?

91
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,371
H.R. is dead. I can't believe that.

92
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,563
- Is Tracy all right?
<i>- Not good.</i>

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,451
She just wants to be alone.

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,280
There'll be time to mourn.

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,245
Right now, we need to figure out
our next move.

96
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,769
So, for the millionth time,
I am lost on all this time travel stuff.

97
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,042
What happens now with Savitar?

98
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,244
Iris didn't die.
So that changes things, right?

99
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,646
I mean, since Iris didn't die,

100
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,809
future me never goes down
that same dark path.

101
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,162
I never create Time Remnants
to fight Savitar.

102
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,767
And if future you never creates
these Time Remnants,

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,641
then Savitar himself is never born.

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,129
Precisely.
Once the time paradox catches up with him,

105
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,250
then he'll be erased from existence.

106
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,442
- But I saw him, he didn't disappear.
- Not yet.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,920
But he will, Joe.

108
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,407
Any guesses how long that's going to take?

109
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,130
Maybe a few hours.

110
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,288
You can do a lot of damage in a few hours.

111
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,967
Well, guys, we can't just sit around
and wait for Savitar to disappear.

112
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,086
But Savitar won't become Savitar
if he's erased.

113
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,209
Not unless he pulls off whatever
he's got in mind

114
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,362
before the paradox hits him.

115
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,090
He stole the bazooka for a reason.

116
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,685
- Yeah, why?
- I don't know.

117
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,604
But, remember,
he's been planning this for centuries.

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,926
He wants to be a god.

119
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,528
He must need the bazooka and Caitlin
to achieve his goals.

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,688
- Anybody got any good news?
- Actually, <i>voila'.</i>

121
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,442
- What is that?
- This, Detective, is a cure for Caitlin.

122
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,324
You're kidding. You figured it out?

123
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,047
Not by myself.
With the help of Caitlin's mother.

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,003
This is experimental gene therapy.
This will rewrite Caitlin's meta-DNA.

125
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,885
This will bring back Caitlin.

126
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,528
I searched the forest.
Savitar and Caitlin were gone.

127
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,167
- So was Cisco.
- Savitar has them both.

128
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,209
<i>You better have a plan B.</i>

129
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,486
Because I don't think your plan A
worked out too well.

130
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,041
Fix this.

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,371
Fix what? The Speed Force bazooka?

132
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,246
I didn't name it.
If I didn't name it, I didn't make it.

133
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,325
And if I didn't make it,

134
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,045
I don't know how it works.

135
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,210
You know enough about it
to alter what it does.

136
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,845
I see. You want me to alter it. Well,
what do you want me to alter it into?

137
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,769
Like a hair dryer? Or a waffle maker?

138
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,171
I know, maybe something that's going to
fix that thin-crust pizza you call a face.

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,731
An intra-dimensional quantum splicer.

140
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,567
A splicer?

141
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,410
I do have a plan B.

142
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,409
I open a time portal,
exposing the Speed Force.

143
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
You shoot me with that,

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,050
and I become fragmented
throughout all of time.

145
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,562
The past, present, future.

146
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,801
After that, the paradox can't reach me.

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,763
You want to splice yourself
throughout time.

148
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,290
Exist in every single
moment that ever was.

149
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,888
All of us aware and connected
through one consciousness.

150
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,881
I'll be everywhere.

151
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,601
Every hour, every minute.

152
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,126
And then I will rule from the Big Bang
until the end of the world.

153
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,489
You wanted us to build this thing.

154
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,087
Well, why do you think
I let you idiots live?

155
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,410
Tracy Brand trapped me in the Speed Force
in the future.

156
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,649
All I had to do was get her
to build this a little earlier

157
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,407
and have my best friend
make all the adjustments.

158
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,606
- I'm not your friend.
- Get to work, Francisco.

159
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,288
How about I sit on my ass and let you
obliterate permanently from existence.

160
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,691
How does that sound?

161
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,120
That's your plan?
Do it or you'll Reverse-Flash me?

162
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,125
Not you.

163
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,486
Her.

164
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,805
You know what I'm remembering?

165
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,166
Julian just got back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

166
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,646
He has the cure.

167
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,684
He can turn her back.
You can have her back.

168
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,325
You're so close.

169
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,450
But not if she's dead.

170
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,282
So put that mechanical genius
to good work.

171
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,126
Make me what I need,

172
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,648
and I will let you both go.

173
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,401
<i>I hated Thawne.</i>

174
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,561
And Zoom.

175
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,371
They took so much from me.

176
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,162
And I've hated Savitar for threatening
to take you away from me, too.

177
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,241
But he didn't.

178
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,201
I know.

179
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,491
There is strength in anger.

180
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,046
I've used it before.

181
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,531
And so we sit here with our anger,

182
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,162
trying to think of a way to hurt Savitar
or maybe kill him.

183
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,041
And I just don't think that hate's gonna
get it done this time.

184
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,721
What do you mean?

185
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,004
Something that Snart said to me.

186
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,526
That the Flash should stay a hero.
All the way.

187
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,365
And sometimes that's not about who can
punch the hardest or run the fastest.

188
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,725
So, what are you going to do?

189
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,686
The last thing he'd expect.

190
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,964
I wasn't sure you'd come.

191
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,730
Must be an odd sensation.

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,970
Getting new memories.

193
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,568
<i>You having an uncertain future.</i>

194
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,162
What do you want? I'm busy.

195
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,961
<i>Doing what?</i>

196
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,324
Getting erased from existence?

197
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,851
We will see which one of us gets erased.

198
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,088
Are you still planning on becoming a god?

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,289
Cisco and Caitlin are still alive,

200
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,089
- if that's what you're worried about.
- <i>I know.</i>

201
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,125
You need them, right?

202
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,010
To pull off your grand ascension.

203
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,162
Look, Barry,
if I wanted to talk to myself,

204
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,167
I could've done that back at my lair.

205
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,011
What do you want?

206
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,808
- I want to help you.
- Really?

207
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,648
You don't have much time before
the paradox reaches you.

208
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,441
Come back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

209
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,287
Let Cisco and Caitlin go.
And let us figure out a way to save you.

210
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,444
You really think I'd trust you?

211
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,161
You showed up.

212
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,281
So you remember me coming here.
Did I have any tricks up my sleeve?

213
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,450
Was I planning on blindsiding you?

214
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,648
I don't know, Barry.
Maybe I get off on watching you grovel.

215
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,804
No, I don't think that's it.
I think you're hearing me.

216
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,405
I'm still in there.

217
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,804
Deep down,
buried beneath the scars and the pain,

218
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,123
that part of you that must feel so lonely.

219
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,690
<i>But it also knows what it's like
to have a family.</i>

220
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,805
To have friends.

221
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,324
<i>You can have all that back.</i>

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,323
We can stop hurting each other.

223
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,730
I remember when I was six

224
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,362
and I begged Mom and Dad to let me
go to the Science Expo in Midway.

225
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,007
And we got a flat tire on that dirt road.
No spare.

226
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,086
<i>So we were towed to that garage
in a tiny one-street town.</i>

227
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,841
Of course, we were stuck there all day.

228
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,731
Then we got ice cream and French fries
with gravy at that little diner.

229
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,891
<i>And then that night we watched
the local fireworks show,</i> and...

230
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,287
It actually turned out to be a great day.

231
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,045
It's my favorite memory of Mom and Dad.

232
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,123
What was the name of that town?

233
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,886
Masonville.

234
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,121
I'm still in there.

235
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,886
Come home.

236
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,726
You make a move toward Iris...

237
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,567
He won't. Killing Iris won't save him now.

238
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,081
<i>Not anymore.</i>

239
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,403
- Where's Cisco? Where's Caitlin?
- They're safe.

240
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,761
I was asking him.

241
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,330
Show me that you can help me.

242
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,925
Then I will tell you
where your friends are.

243
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,289
You tell us now or you go up in smoke.

244
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,646
This is bloody insanity.

245
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,284
- What is he doing here? He's a...
- Stop! Guys!

246
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,128
It's okay. Everyone just...

247
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,171
Iris, stay away from him.

248
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,846
Look at me.

249
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,281
It's okay. Look at me.

250
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,005
We're going to help you, okay?

251
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,361
Thank you.

252
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,807
<i>Right.</i>

253
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,011
Well, since our guest here has both
of our resident scientists hostage,

254
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,486
what temporal problem
can we help you with?

255
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,209
Tracy built the Speed Force trap.
Maybe she has an idea.

256
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,367
- Tracy's our best bet.
- Am I?

257
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,204
So, you're Savitar?

258
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,325
I hear you're about to have
a really bad day.

259
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,524
- Good.
<i>- Tracy...</i>

260
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,371
He stole my future.

261
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,045
Why does he deserve one?

262
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,205
I shouldn't have come here.

263
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,205
No. We'll get her to help us.

264
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,682
I think I know someone who might
be able to get through to her.

265
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,041
I'm not H.R.

266
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,609
My name is Harrison Wells.

267
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,449
I'm from a different Earth.

268
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,202
In the multi-verse... How to explain this?

269
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,202
You're his doppelganger?

270
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,241
Yeah.

271
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,802
<i>Something like that.</i>

272
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,405
Look, these people,

273
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,285
they are good people.

274
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,081
And they need your help.

275
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,086
By helping the bad guy that
I spent weeks trying to stop?

276
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,401
No.

277
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,921
I won't do it.

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,084
The only reason I agreed
was because of H.R.

279
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,766
H.R. needs your help.

280
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,401
H.R. is dead.

281
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,084
That's why you need to stay,

282
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,249
because of what Savitar took from you,
because of what Savitar took

283
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,610
from H.R., everything.

284
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,484
H.R. paid the price that he did
because he loved these people.

285
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,931
Because he loved you.

286
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,649
And when the moment came,

287
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,931
H.R. didn't run.

288
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,329
It's strange being back here.

289
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,289
You remember S.T.A.R. Labs?

290
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,491
I remember everything.

291
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,965
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

292
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,131
to use against DeVoe.

293
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,801
Who?

294
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,810
You haven't gotten there yet.

295
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,326
So, how's this gonna work?
Where will I live?

296
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,803
- What do you mean?
- Are Wally and I gonna be bunkmates?

297
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,801
Am I supposed to just rejoin Team Flash,
fight some rogues?

298
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,891
What kind of life
were you thinking I'd lead?

299
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,842
I hadn't gotten that far yet.

300
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,686
How do we explain me at the wedding?

301
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,484
And do I sit bride-side or groom-side?

302
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,844
Look, I mean,
we don't have all the answers.

303
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,605
You know, we're gonna figure it out.

304
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,521
Together.

305
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,681
No.

306
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,521
Not together.

307
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,841
Love and hate,

308
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,686
they're so close,
it's easy to mistake one for the other.

309
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,966
You're gonna spend the rest
of your life with him.

310
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,204
<i>But I remember giving you the ring.</i>

311
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,531
Singing to you.

312
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,210
Asking you to marry me.

313
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,921
I can't do this.

314
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,404
Yes, you can, okay?

315
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,211
I will be here for you.

316
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,723
I tried to kill you.

317
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,881
I killed H.R.

318
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,402
And you're going
to have to live with that.

319
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,124
But we won't give up on you, okay?
That is not what we do.

320
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,571
There's a way through this. For all of us.

321
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,243
Where are Cisco and Caitlin?

322
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,081
I'll bring them home.

323
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,761
What is it?

324
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,124
There's energy radiating
from the breach room.

325
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,125
That's not breach energy.

326
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,285
That's the Philosopher's Stone.
It's releasing all its energy.

327
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,962
- Savitar.
- It looks like it's gonna blow.

328
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,284
Wally, get everybody out.

329
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,961
Is it finished?

330
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,163
Yeah, it's finished.

331
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,165
Fantastic.

332
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,162
You know,
Savitar's gonna turn on you one day.

333
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,841
No, he won't.

334
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,924
A bad guy like Savitar
always turns on his partners.

335
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,482
- Not this time.
- Wake up!

336
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,845
You're only saying that
because he needs something from you.

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,526
Once he's done with that,
it's over for you.

338
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,526
- How'd it go?
- As I expected.

339
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,843
I was a fool to think otherwise.

340
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,409
<i>Where did he go? What did you do?</i>

341
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,365
I got rid of a problem.

342
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,241
A few of them.

343
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,364
Now I can fix mine.

344
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,207
- Are we ready?
<i>- Yes.</i>

345
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,241
Do it.

346
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,361
<i>Caitlin.</i>

347
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,522
Listen to me. He'll do it.

348
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,681
He'll kill you.

349
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,531
I'll take my chances.

350
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,361
Gypsy?

351
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,087
Wait! No!

352
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,728
- You don't care that they got away?
- No, it doesn't matter.

353
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,561
It's time.

354
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,211
Ow.

355
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,890
I had that. I was getting through to her.

356
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,281
You were almost killed.

357
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,050
Maybe that's how it looks
to the untrained eye.

358
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,725
These eyes are highly trained.

359
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,083
And I know you were in danger
because I vibed it across the multi-verse.

360
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,609
I can't believe this is the thanks I get
for saving you.

361
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,770
This isn't thanks.
This is the opposite of thanks.

362
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,401
Wait a minute.

363
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,491
How did you vibe that I was in trouble?

364
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,405
Because we are connected.

365
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,241
Jackass.

366
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,441
<i>Guys?</i>

367
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,921
Oh, my God.

368
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,449
I thought something happened to you guys.
Two-Face told me you guys were dead.

369
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,647
We're okay.

370
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,251
- Gypsy.
- Gypsy.

371
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,646
- Guys.
- Gypsy.

372
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,807
Harry.

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,002
- Here to help.
- Good.

374
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,611
I know what he's up to.

375
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,090
We have to hurry.

376
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,366
I must become immortal
before the paradox reaches me.

377
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,683
Today I become a god.

378
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,287
This is why I brought you here.

379
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,809
The Speed Force doesn't like it
when speedsters mess with time.

380
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,451
Get ready.

381
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,481
See you later, Hunter.

382
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,964
The one thing
Black Flash can't fight, cold!

383
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,207
Finally, to be a god.

384
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,165
What? No!

385
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,680
I've been waiting a long time to do that.

386
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,888
- Garrick. How did you...
- He didn't.

387
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,441
I did.

388
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,683
By changing the polarity
of the climbing arc,

389
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,367
I changed her Speed Force splicer
into a Speed Force skeleton key.

390
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,531
Didn't think I was actually gonna let you
become a god, now, did you?

391
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,921
Let's end this.

392
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,201
Go!

393
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:02,225
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

394
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,649
Go ahead, Cisco. Go bad.

395
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,922
No. I never will.

396
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,610
But I will give you a choice.

397
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,530
You want to be Caitlin again?

398
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,081
Here's your chance.

399
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,321
Look out!

400
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,921
You'll pay for what you did.

401
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,601
And you can die the same way twice.

402
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,291
I knew you didn't have it in you, Caitlin.

403
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,688
I only have a few minutes left.

404
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,406
I can feel it.

405
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,962
But before I go, I'm gonna kill Joe.

406
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,641
And Wally and Iris.

407
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,842
If I'm going to die,
then everything you love

408
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,328
is going to die, too.

409
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,921
How's it feel to get so close
to your ascension,

410
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,765
and end up on the ground?

411
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,081
Now I see...

412
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,329
- It's written.
- Nothing's written.

413
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,247
Do it!

414
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,048
You kill me, you become me.

415
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,443
Either way, I live!

416
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,566
I'll never let the pain and darkness
determine who I am.

417
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,651
I'll never be you.

418
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,961
All these months,
you were trying to save me from him.

419
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,970
Look at that, I saved you.

420
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,366
When I think of H.R.,

421
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,491
<i>I'm reminded</i>

422
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,163
<i>of a story that John Lennon once told.</i>

423
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,643
When Lennon was five years old,
his teacher asked him

424
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,802
to write down what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

425
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,290
Lennon wrote "happy."

426
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,324
<i>His teachers said
that he didn't understand the assignment,</i>

427
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,126
and Lennon said
that they didn't understand life.

428
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,164
H.R. understood life.

429
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,964
<i>He wasn't a genius
and he didn't have super-speed,</i>

430
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,647
but when we needed him the most,
he was our hero.

431
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,841
He was my hero.

432
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Mine, too.

433
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,206
Good on you, mate.

434
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,649
Thanks for believing in me, H.R.

435
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,371
I've been looking
for the right time to tell you.

436
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,401
Tell me what?

437
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,328
Right before H.R. died,
he asked me to give you a message.

438
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,731
Tell Cisco, this took strength
and he gave it to me.

439
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,361
I know that you've had a connection
with every Wells that we've met, but...

440
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,889
I don't know.
There's something about this Wells.

441
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,561
Yeah.

442
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,401
Something.

443
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,206
I'll be right back.

444
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,926
Well, well, well.

445
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,240
I guess you're not shopping
at Villains "R" Us anymore.

446
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,561
I'm sorry about H.R.

447
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,410
I'm sure he would have
appreciated you coming.

448
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,089
- Why did you come?
- I don't know.

449
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,400
- Maybe you wanted to come home?
- I don't have a home.

450
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,251
Yes, you do, Caitlin.

451
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,240
You do, with your friends. With me.

452
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,445
I'm sorry, Julian.

453
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,726
I'm not Caitlin anymore.

454
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,926
You're not Killer Frost.

455
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,885
No, I'm not. I'm something else.

456
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,971
And I need to figure out what that is.
On my own.

457
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,601
- Hey.
- Cisco.

458
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,601
Let me go.

459
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,609
- Stop it.
- It's not funny.

460
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,767
- I know.
- Why are we laughing?

461
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,203
We should not be laughing.
Today of all days.

462
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,003
I think H.R. would've approved.

463
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,481
Probably.

464
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,007
Are you okay? I mean,

465
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,161
with what you did?

466
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,843
I'm sure one day it'll hit me.

467
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,682
In the future, which I have again.

468
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,290
We have. Every day of it.

469
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,524
♪ <i>Every hour, every minute</i> ♪

470
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,846
I think we have the song picked out
for the dance at our reception.

471
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,325
Yeah, that reminds me.

472
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,848
I can officially mail these.

473
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,206
What are these?

474
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,005
Save-the-date cards for our wedding.

475
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,525
On one of my braver days,
I filled them out.

476
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,805
I never mailed them, not knowing if
I would live to see the ceremony, but...

477
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,364
But now I guess it's safe to...

478
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,201
Delivered.

479
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,524
I wasted a lot of money on stamps.
Thank you very much.

480
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,728
Are you ready to be Iris West-Allen?

481
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,562
I've always been Iris West-Allen.

482
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,566
I've always been yours.

483
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,571
What is that?

484
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,563
There's never been an earthquake
in Central City.

485
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,083
That wasn't an earthquake.

486
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,561
You found something?

487
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,364
Everything is barbecued.

488
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,728
I'm gonna try to establish
an uplink to the satellite.

489
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,761
That's not good.

490
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,491
Hey, Wally, can you reverse
the polarity on the neutron flow?

491
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,642
<i>On it.</i>

492
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,930
Central City University just reported
an earthquake of 6.6 on the Richter scale.

493
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,409
- That's not an earthquake.
- Then what was it?

494
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,489
Earthquakes come from down below. This...

495
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,807
This is something else.

496
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,601
It's getting bad out there.

497
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,966
Emergency services
will soon be overwhelmed.

498
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,408
Guys, 7.2, that last one.

499
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,642
<i>- Cisco.</i>
- Yeah. We're on. Guys.

500
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,446
What is that thing?

501
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,126
That's definitely not a breach.

502
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,520
Holy plutonium.

503
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,527
What even emits that many kilojoules?

504
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,446
The Speed Force.

505
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,847
- But Savitar is dead.
- That's the problem.

506
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,641
It's the Speed Force prison.

507
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,331
It needs an occupant.

508
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,802
When you freed me, we emptied it.
Without a prisoner...

509
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,166
It goes unstable.

510
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,444
And now it's bleeding energy
onto our Earth.

511
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,324
Okay, so how do we stop this?

512
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,330
By giving it what it needs.

513
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,047
Which is what?

514
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,328
<i>The Speed Force is unbalanced.</i>

515
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,841
I have to stabilize it.

516
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,523
- What? How?
- By running into it.

517
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,848
No, you can't.
Barry, you'll be trapped in there forever.

518
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,968
If I don't go, the whole city,

519
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,003
maybe even the entire planet
could be destroyed.

520
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,403
Cisco, there's got to be
another way, right?

521
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,848
Barry, Central City needs the Flash.

522
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,240
And they'll have one.

523
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,721
They'll have one.

524
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,401
All right?

525
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,407
- All right?
- Yeah.

526
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,201
Mate...

527
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,851
Do you mind sticking around?

528
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,371
Anything for you.

529
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,089
Barry, Wally and Jay
said they were in hell.

530
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,280
Barry, it's your mother.

531
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,281
That's the Speed Force.

532
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,130
Barry isn't going to hell.

533
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,609
But like all runners must eventually,
he's reached his finish line.

534
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,441
His race is over.

535
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,250
You can't take him with you.

536
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,403
She's not taking me anywhere.

537
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,406
I have to go.

538
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,250
Why? Why are you being punished?

539
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,408
This... All of this,

540
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,610
it started with my mistake.
With Flashpoint.

541
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,643
This is my penance.

542
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,771
This is my redemption.

543
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,486
My beautiful boy,

544
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,445
it's time to rest.

545
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,120
- Don't mess it up with her.
- I'll do my best.

546
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,641
They're all gonna look to you now.

547
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,605
I'm not a hero like you.

548
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,771
You've always been my hero.

549
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,644
All this time we're trying to save Iris,
you're telling me

550
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,690
that we should've been trying
to save you, too?

551
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,645
You did save me, Joe.

552
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,651
You took an 11-year-old boy
with a broken heart

553
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,525
and you gave him a home and so much love.

554
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,522
No son ever felt more love from a father.

555
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,207
No father ever felt more proud of a son.

556
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,361
Barry?

557
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,806
<i>It's time.</i>

558
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,207
Barry.

559
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,850
This is unfair.

560
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,481
I know.

561
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,842
We were supposed to have our happy ending.

562
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,008
I'm ready to be Iris West-Allen.

563
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,804
And you always will be.

564
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,889
But you need to keep living your life.

565
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,010
Keep growing.

566
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,646
Keep loving.

567
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,883
Keep running. For me.

568
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,723
Promise me you'll run, Iris.

569
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,486
I promise.

570
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,245
I gotta go.

571
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:52,269
