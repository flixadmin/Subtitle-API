1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,842
Kdk— 12, come in.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,178
-Kdk—12. —kdk-12.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,765
Hey, Bobby, need you to look in
on Mrs. Peyketewa.

4
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,893
- She all right?
- Her daughter called from California.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,230
She hasn't heard from her in a while,
kind of worried.

6
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,161
Miss peyketewa, hello.

7
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,125
Miss peyketewa.

8
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,802
Miss peyketewa.

9
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,864
Kdk-12 here.
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

10
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,991
- Come again?
- Miss peyketewa, she's dead.

11
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,328
- I need some backup out here.
- Okay. On their way.

12
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,753
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now!

13
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,557
Hold it right there.

14
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,058
Let me see your hands.

15
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,814
All right, down.

16
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,315
On your knees.

17
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,401
You understand me?

18
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,945
Do you speak English?

19
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,033
I said, down. On your knees.

20
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,785
Down!

21
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,373
Damn it, get down.

22
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,791
On your knees.

23
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,251
Do it.

24
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,756
On your knees or I'll fire!

25
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,551
- Yeah?
- I found the papers.

26
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,013
Right where you left them,
in the crib.

27
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,098
Yeah, well...

28
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,644
You know best, right?

29
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,604
Anything else?

30
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,397
Do you have any thought...

31
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,195
About how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr.?

32
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,072
Well, he's still my son.

33
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,282
- I mean, he will remain...
- Of course.

34
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,661
My point being...

35
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,121
The divorce.

36
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,709
Well, I...

37
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,838
I think he gets it, don't you?

38
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,966
I mean, I...

39
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,552
I think he saw it coming.

40
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,846
He sees your unhappiness and...

41
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,848
My unhappiness?

42
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,142
My completely out-of-the-clear...

43
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,438
Que-sky unhappiness?

44
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,274
Really?

45
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,569
Look, as you said, for the best.

46
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,947
Okay.

47
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,576
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

48
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,789
In the child support worksheet,
you list medical, dental...

49
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:19,170
Child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

50
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,839
That's right, all of it.

51
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,426
Walt.

52
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,972
- No.
- Skyler, you wanted me out...

53
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,975
I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

54
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,227
Not with that money.

55
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,480
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

56
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,359
How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

57
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,324
I have to go.

58
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,576
Yep, I was right.

59
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,245
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

60
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,290
I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others.

61
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,125
No, no, this one's fine.

62
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,967
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so...

63
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,636
Yeah, I like it.

64
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,638
I like everything about it.

65
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,807
I'll take it as-is.

66
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,356
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

67
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,157
- You have to clean the fryer.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,454
We try to clean them every night...

69
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,500
But make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

70
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,837
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

71
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,507
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...

72
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:49,719
Clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

73
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,721
Main valve on, main switch on.

74
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,308
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

75
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,488
You're for real?

76
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,074
- This is all you?
- All me.

77
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,410
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

78
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
My man Jesse can cook.

79
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,540
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

80
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,042
- Just the right shade of blue.
- Good shade.

81
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,212
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger...

82
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,382
- It would be a jolly rancher.
- Be my guest.

83
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,554
You sure?

84
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,932
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

85
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,561
No. I can watch, yo.

86
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,023
- I can cook and I can watch.
- Go for it.

87
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,358
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

88
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,736
Go easy.

89
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,405
Okay.

90
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,215
Riverdance.

91
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,427
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

92
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,558
Bow before me.

93
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,437
I am lord of the dance.

94
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,939
Shit.

95
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,608
I gotta try that again.

96
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,693
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

97
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,446
That is awesome, Jesse.

98
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:36,826
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...

99
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

100
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,456
Like Anthrax.

101
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,254
You ready to talk some business?

102
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,426
You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

103
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,097
I know...

104
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,182
What you're thinking.

105
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,644
Trust me,
it's not gonna be like it was.

106
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,438
All right, never gonna be like it was.

107
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,982
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

108
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,360
All right? We sell it smart.

109
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,822
We don't get greedy, like before.

110
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,491
I don't know, man.

111
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
Combo and all.

112
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,336
Still...

113
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,005
Man's gotta make his living.

114
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:36,052
If it's like Jesse says
and we're not greedy...

115
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,846
I mean...

116
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,889
I guess I can see it.

117
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,226
Had a good thing going
before we started pushing our luck.

118
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,813
- If it can go back to being like that...
- Hey, it will be.

119
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,399
Step one, we build inventory.

120
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,025
Badger, go see clovis.

121
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,697
Get the rv in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

122
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,576
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights. Not us.

123
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,869
Cautious.

124
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,162
- Right on.
- You got it.

125
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,875
You know that buzzer thing?
Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

126
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,044
Just have him put in
one of those too.

127
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,547
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

128
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,757
I'll get you a list.

129
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,426
Right on.

130
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,386
Yeah?

131
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,889
- Yeah.
- All right.

132
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,269
- We good?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,064
- All right.
- Let's do this thing.

134
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,248
Brandon mayhew.

135
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,459
I know you.

136
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,588
Small world, Albuquerque.

137
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,610
Wanna talk about it?

138
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,030
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

139
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,826
You know, ironically...

140
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,205
I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

141
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,456
Sure.

142
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,167
Well, just as much of me at least.

143
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

144
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,840
What, I don't get a vote in this
either?

145
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,011
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

146
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,640
I do feel guilty.

147
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,440
I am the man that I am, son...

148
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,944
And there's plenty
that I would change about that, but...

149
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,201
Here we are,
and this is just what it is.

150
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,500
You know what? Call me crazy...

151
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,380
But I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

152
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,416
Morning.

153
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,085
They're back.

154
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,757
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

155
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,384
Why?

156
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,719
They're doing nothing wrong.

157
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,811
Okay, let's put this on table 33,
okay?

158
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,022
Hello there.

159
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,192
Mr. White, I presume?

160
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,402
Oh, yes. Hi.

161
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,324
Sorry. I'll be right down.

162
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,836
- Hi. Gale boetticher.
- Hi.

163
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,549
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

164
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,717
Yes, I am.

165
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,386
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

166
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,181
I have my résumé here for you.

167
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,228
I received my bachelor's degree
from unm.

168
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,064
My master's
from the university of Colorado.

169
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,692
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in...

170
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,569
It's all right there.

171
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,031
"X-ray crystallography."

172
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,241
Really?

173
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,079
I could talk about that for hours.

174
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,580
I would love to.

175
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,376
But first, I'm curious about this.

176
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,382
That's a little pet project of mine.

177
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,470
See, in my opinion,
it's all about the quinic acid level.

178
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,599
You wantjust north of 4800 milligrams
per liter...

179
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,311
But if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

180
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,730
Bitterness, yuck.

181
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,275
Sol pull a mild vacuum.

182
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:52,738
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 c and...

183
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,912
Judge for yourself.

184
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,802
Oh, my god.

185
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,147
My god, that is the best coffee
I've ever tasted.

186
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,650
Sumatran beans...

187
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,112
And I also have to give credit
to the grind...

188
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,990
- But thank you, Mr. White.
- Walt.

189
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,242
Please, call me Walt.

190
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,746
Why the hell are we making meth?

191
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,858
Hey.

192
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,568
Tell me...

193
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,279
With the phenylacetic acid
solution...

194
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:02,076
You said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes...

195
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,913
And then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

196
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,960
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl...

197
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,755
You get an oilier aqueous layer,
and hence...

198
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,590
Better benzene extraction.

199
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,427
Exactly.

200
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,971
But actually, I prefer ether.

201
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,931
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

202
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,734
Gale, I'm wondering how you...

203
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,777
Ended up here.

204
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:43,284
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

205
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:48,456
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike each other as criminals.

206
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:54,628
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime...

207
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,797
."Isuppose.

208
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,799
I'm definitely a libertarian.

209
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,844
Consenting adults want
what they want...

210
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,514
And if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

211
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,476
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

212
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,438
No added toxins or adulterants.

213
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,443
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to...

214
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,489
Pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
nsf research Grant.

215
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,366
I was on my way,
jumping through hoops...

216
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,452
Kissing the proper behinds...

217
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,999
Attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

218
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,667
You know that world.

219
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,713
That is not what I signed on for.

220
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,844
I love the lab.

221
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,473
Because it's all still magic.

222
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,682
You know?

223
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,520
Chemistry?

224
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,189
I mean...

225
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,525
Once you lose that...

226
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,529
It is magic.

227
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,864
It still is.

228
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,745
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

229
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,874
"When I heard
the learn'd astronomer."

230
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,377
I don't know it.

231
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,878
Anyway...

232
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,381
Well, can you recite it?

233
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,928
Pathetically enough, I could.

234
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,222
All right, well...

235
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,850
No, no, come on. Come on.

236
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,101
Yeah?

237
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,984
When I heard the learn 'd astronomer

238
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:45,865
when the proofs, the figures
were ranged in columns before me

239
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,742
when I was shown the charts
and the diagrams

240
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,579
to add, divide, and measure them

241
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,956
when I, sitting,
heard the astronomer

242
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:59,044
where he lectured with much
applause in the lecture-room

243
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:04,925
how soon, unaccountable
I became tired and sick

244
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,386
till rising and gliding out

245
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,597
I wander'd off by myself

246
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,601
in the mystical moist night-air

247
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,519
and from time to time

248
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:20,274
look'd up in perfect silence
at the stars

249
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,618
I am a nerd.

250
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,332
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

251
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,794
Come on, Pinkman.

252
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,005
You little rat bastard.

253
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,467
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

254
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:54,491
http://hiqve.com/

255
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,880
- Hey, baby.
- Are you ever coming home?

256
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,382
Marie, I'm working.

257
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,342
Did you find it? The rv?

258
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,219
No. Working on it, so...

259
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,516
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

260
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,560
It's not simple. There's a thing
called the constitution.

261
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,897
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

262
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,404
This kid, I swear to god,
I wish I just could...

263
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,699
This is that Pinkman character?

264
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,033
That's the one.

265
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,411
Positive the little bastard's
got an rv.

266
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,830
I just don't know where he keeps it.

267
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,583
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something...

268
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,587
I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

269
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,550
Well, not to bring up
ancient history...

270
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:14,638
But I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

271
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,890
Possibly.

272
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,434
It's worth a shot.

273
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,394
Yeah?

274
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,397
Who?

275
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,069
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

276
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,446
Hey, how you doing?

277
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,364
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

278
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,450
Listen, I hate to bother you.

279
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,578
- I just had a quick question.
- Shoot.

280
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:41,915
I only ask this because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentially.

281
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,418
I'm working a case and...

282
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,883
You know that I would never put you
on the spot or make you uncomfortable.

283
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,719
Hank, you could just cut
to the chase.

284
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,599
Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down...

285
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,809
Through your student,
Jesse Pinkman.

286
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,897
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time...

287
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,316
He may have dealt you
a little weed.

288
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,776
- Hank...
- Just a little.

289
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,570
And I so do not care about that.

290
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,947
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

291
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,783
Like you said, out to the chase.

292
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:21,330
Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid ever had an rv?

293
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,585
You know, a recreational vehicle...

294
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:31,256
You know, like a winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

295
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,135
Why?

296
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,264
Long story, but I'm personally of the
opinion he's moved on from weed...

297
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:45,312
And graduated to selling
crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.

298
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,944
Walt?

299
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,677
What, Mr. White?

300
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,028
How's my favorite genius?

301
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,905
Is this a secure line?

302
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,825
Is this a secur...?
Yes, what's with the...?

303
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,326
Hey, hello to you too.

304
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,037
Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

305
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,914
- I'm listening.
- My brother-in-law...

306
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,041
He knows about the rv.

307
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,251
What rv?

308
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,669
Our rv...

309
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,090
The one which contains a meth lab,
which is covered with my fingerprints.

310
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,886
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

311
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,847
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

312
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:06,059
He has linked it to Jesse. It's a matter
of time before he tracks it down.

313
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,896
So get rid of it!
What are you doing sitting there?

314
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,608
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

315
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,694
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

316
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,198
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

317
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,701
Jesus. Plan a, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

318
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,038
And do what exactly?

319
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,748
I mean, what...?

320
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:32,127
The thing is the size of a...

321
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,629
It's rv-size.

322
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,423
I mean, where do I go
to make an rv disappear?

323
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,050
I'm not David Copperfield.

324
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,928
What do I look like,
the rv disposal people?

325
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,430
- Did you not plan for this contingency?
- No.

326
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,933
Well, next time, plan for it,
would you?

327
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,810
The starship enterprise
had a self-destruct button.

328
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,104
Okay. Shut up.

329
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,274
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

330
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:59,780
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

331
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,991
You did that,
you would be rolling in it.

332
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,452
Socket wrench.

333
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,454
The big one.

334
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,584
What? You scared of the arabs?

335
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,842
You out of your minds?
Why is this in the open?

336
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,178
- Who the hell are you?
- He's Heisenberg.

337
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,681
- Is this drivable?
- Yeah. I was changing the oil.

338
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,142
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean,
take it out to the desert.

339
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,644
Come on, help me.

340
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,980
Hold up. What's this about?

341
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,483
The DEA,
the drug enforcement administration.

342
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,819
You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

343
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:43,198
They know all about this rv
and they're trying to find it right now.

344
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,826
I want this off my property now.

345
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,370
No, no, we have got
to destroy the evidence.

346
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,165
- We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
- Not here. Get it out of here.

347
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,626
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

348
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,046
If I go down, we all go down.
Do you understand?

349
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,049
All right, just...

350
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,053
I know a way. I know a guy that'll
wipe this off the planet, no questions.

351
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,513
Call him.

352
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,229
Hey, what about Jesse?

353
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,522
What about him?

354
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,202
Hey, it's me.
Wanna hear something weird?

355
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,372
Now, listen to me.
You get that address.

356
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,877
Now, badger, I don't care how.
You find out where he's taking it.

357
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,507
Oh, yeah.

358
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,612
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

359
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,296
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths
are for paying customers only.

360
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,759
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.

361
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,140
What can I do for you?

362
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,520
You know.

363
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,650
Sunset.

364
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:05,757
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.

365
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,968
Beyond recovery, right?

366
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,304
- Beyond recovery means...
- I got it. Beyond recovery.

367
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,932
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Hey, don't worry.

368
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,144
When we're through with it,
it's gonna be about yay big.

369
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,981
Then we flatbed it over to long beach,
ship it across the pacific.

370
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,484
Chinese turn it into patio furniture...

371
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,987
So mind at ease.

372
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,657
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm obviously gonna need a ride.

373
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,785
- Could you call a cab?
- You got it. Pleasure doing business.

374
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,330
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

375
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,996
- The hell you think you're doing?
- Me?

376
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,333
This is minejust as much as yours.
You don't get to just...

377
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,543
- Oh, god.
- What?

378
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,842
What?

379
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,011
He's here.

380
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,930
Who's here?

381
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,394
Oh, no.

382
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,067
Oh, god.

383
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,401
Oh, god.

384
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,071
You led him right to us.

385
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,812
Shit.

386
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,528
Shit.

387
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,197
Mr. Pinkman,
you wanna add resisting arrest?

388
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,367
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

389
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,121
Last chance to do it the easy way.

390
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,829
Got a warrant?

391
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,417
Who are you, huh? Who are you
and what do you know about this rv?

392
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,711
Well, I'm the owner of this lot...

393
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,256
Which means you're trespassing
on private property.

394
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,259
As far as the rv goes,
seems to me it's locked...

395
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:23,306
Which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

396
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:28,103
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counselor.

397
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,107
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

398
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,734
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

399
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,570
See these round rubber things?

400
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,072
Those are wheels.

401
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,740
This is a vehicle.

402
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,577
This is a domicile, a residence...

403
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,708
Protected by the fourth amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

404
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,919
- Why don't you just go out...?
- Did you see this drive?

405
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,421
How do you know it runs?

406
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,465
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

407
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,594
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

408
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,433
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

409
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,978
Oh, yeah?

410
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,647
Look at these.

411
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:20,071
What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

412
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,659
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

413
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,747
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

414
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,415
Call the Albuquerque police...

415
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:35,837
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

416
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,088
What?

417
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,259
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

418
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,344
Say it. Say it.

419
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,973
DEA operation, there's 20 guys
rushing in here like the wrath of god.

420
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,810
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

421
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,270
That's right.

422
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,148
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

423
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,944
There's somebody in there.

424
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,491
"Private domicile
and I won't be harassed."

425
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:09,329
I'll give you three seconds
to get your ass out here. One, two...

426
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:13,500
This is my own private domicile
and I will not be harassed.

427
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,472
Fine. You want your warrant?

428
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:34,229
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it
on a little satin pillow. How's that?

429
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,858
I waited this long.
I'll wait a little longer.

430
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,922
Hey, Vicky.

431
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,675
Yeah, schrader.
Get me merkert, will you?

432
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,396
You know, I say...

433
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,523
I say we just ram him.

434
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,191
All right?

435
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,027
I mean, we... we...

436
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,574
We start her up
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

437
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,368
We make our escape. Right?

438
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,252
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

439
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,590
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

440
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,093
So, what do we do, man, huh?

441
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,888
What do we...? What?

442
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:56,019
Please tell me you got something.

443
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,610
Yeah, I got something.

444
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,165
It's me.

445
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,959
We need your help.

446
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,361
Is this Mr. Henry r. Schrader?

447
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:47,946
Yeah. Who's this?

448
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,532
Sir, this is officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque police.

449
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,451
Is your wife Marie schrader?

450
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,495
Yes, why?

451
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,873
I'm sorry to inform you your wife's
been in an automobile accident.

452
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,668
She's being airlifted
to los ranchos medical center...

453
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,212
And should be arriving there
shortly.

454
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:11,636
- How is she? What's her condition?
- I don't have the current information.

455
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,806
But I think you might wanna get there
as soon as possible.

456
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,810
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

457
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,036
- Marie?
- I'm just checking in.

458
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,956
I'd love to have some idea of whether
I should cook dinner or not.

459
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,418
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

460
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,170
Why?

461
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,674
Hank?

462
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,052
What's up?

463
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,406
I told you before.

464
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,743
You will not kill Walter white.

465
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,080
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

466
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,750
We've waited long enough.

467
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,461
We won't wait any longer.

468
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,756
You'll have to.

469
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,633
The decision...

470
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,927
Is not yours to make.

471
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,935
Explain to me, why this man white?

472
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,441
He betrayed your cousin tuco, yes.

473
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,487
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

474
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,740
Was there not another man...

475
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,284
Who pulled the trigger?

476
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,912
A DEA agent.

477
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,123
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

478
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,461
North of the border is my territory.

479
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,380
My say.
