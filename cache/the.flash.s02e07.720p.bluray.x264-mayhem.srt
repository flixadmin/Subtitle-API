1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,007
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,969
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,059
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,226
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,685
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,026
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,363
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,528
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,829
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,035
Zoom wants me dead.

11
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,950
The meta-humans
that he's sending from Earth-2,

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,743
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,002
I have to go.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,455
I need you to tell me
that it's okay.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,340
Barry!

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,675
Is this the face of your
hero, Central City?

17
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,684
Seriously. You got your ass kicked.

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,265
I can't feel my legs.

19
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,530
- All right, I got you.
- Okay.

20
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,861
All right, I got you.

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,201
I can't do it right now all right?

22
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,957
- Oh, yes you can, Barry.
- No, no, no.

23
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,335
We were making so much progress.

24
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,586
Yep, six whole steps.

25
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,042
Someone get me a Bozo button.

26
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,466
Hey, give yourself some credit.
You just broke your back.

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,548
Yeah. A normal person would've been
paralyzed the rest of his life.

28
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,381
Hmm. How long until I'm fully healed?

29
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,266
The initial MRI I took a week ago
showed a complete dislocation

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,600
at the T-twelve to L-one interspace
of the thoracolumbar junction.

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,603
But this is the MRI I took this morning.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,938
It's remarkable,
but you're almost completely healed.

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,153
I'm still having trouble breathing.

34
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,439
That's totally normal
with a spinal injury.

35
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,404
It should clear up soon.

36
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,620
We're gonna get you back
in that suit, Barr.

37
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,037
Real quick. Trust me.

38
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,123
What are we gonna do about Zoom?

39
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,794
No sign of him since Cisco nailed him
with that tranq dart.

40
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,421
And I haven't vibed since then.

41
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,419
Maybe Zoom's not coming back.

42
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,750
I highly doubt that.

43
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,966
Which is why
I'm gonna go do something about it.

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,922
What do you mean go do something about it?

45
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,262
I need access to your breach room
and your speed cannon.

46
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,767
Why is that?

47
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,224
Because, Barry, it's time to go home.

48
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,857
So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,118
and now you want to go home.
Sounds very familiar.

50
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,574
Again, that wasn't me.

51
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,911
I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

52
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,996
before anyone else gets killed.

53
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,418
How do you plan on doing that?

54
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,669
I'll think of something.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,713
Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

56
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,214
No, no. You can't go through the breach.

57
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,547
Yeah, he can.
Jay taught us how to send people.

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,881
That's not what I mean.

59
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,217
Look, if you can figure out
how to stop Zoom on your Earth,

60
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,722
you can figure out how to do it here.

61
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,014
We need you to stay here
until we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

62
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,393
What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home.

63
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,526
I'm gonna do that,
with or without your assistance.

64
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,192
What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go, bye.

65
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,577
Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,488
I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

67
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,575
Yeah. I mean, the last bright idea he had
nearly got Barry killed.

68
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,493
I know. But Jay's gone.

69
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,704
And Dr. Wells knows Zoom
better than anyone.

70
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,295
So, until Barry is back on his feet again,

71
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,302
we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

72
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,179
Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here,
then we're better off without him.

73
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,589
Let him go.

74
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,554
I can't do that. Not yet.

75
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,389
Oh, snap, meta-human attack.

76
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,936
Nope. Nope. My bad.
That is just an alert for me.

77
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,650
For what?

78
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,783
Oh, it's just a reminder.

79
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,819
Oh, with who?

80
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,577
With the lovely Kendra Saunders,
the barista at Jitters.

81
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,327
Oh, she makes a mean latte.

82
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,626
I think we're gonna go out
for dinner and a movie.

83
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,623
And then, I don't know,
maybe some breakfast.

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,753
Wait, breakfast? Why breakfast? I don't...

85
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,383
Yeah.

86
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,047
'Cause you go home and...

87
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,965
Mmm, Cisco. He's messing with you.

88
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,266
Oh.

89
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,942
Patty-

90
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,321
Patty, hey-

91
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,452
Hey. I hear you're still sick.

92
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,872
Yeah, yeah. It's a nasty bug.

93
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,454
Well, I make a mean chicken noodle soup
from scratch.

94
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,289
I could bring some by later,
if you'd like.

95
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,038
No, that's sweet.

96
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,172
I'd feel terrible
if you caught any of this.

97
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,254
Besides, I love the canned stuff.

98
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,135
Okay, well, try to stay off your feet.

99
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,096
Oh, yeah. Believe me, I am.

100
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,430
Are you sure you're okay?

101
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,473
You sound like something's up.

102
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,686
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm just not myself right now.

103
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,566
Okay.

104
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,520
I hope to see you soon and...
feel better.

105
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,904
Thanks.

106
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,282
- Bye.
- Bye.

107
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,294
You should stay away
from the cheese curds.

108
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,879
They're addicting.

109
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,503
I'm going to take a wild stab
and guess that you are here

110
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,839
without the consent
of the rest of your fabulous team.

111
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,055
It's been difficult having you here.

112
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,639
For all of us.

113
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,892
You don't have to worry about that anymore,
because I'm leaving.

114
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,637
We can help you save your daughter.

115
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,521
I know that's why you want to go home.

116
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,529
Look, I made a big mistake coming here.

117
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,280
My plan

118
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,902
was to get The Flash's help
and use that help to stop Zoom.

119
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,412
And my plan failed.
I don't have another plan.

120
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,702
Except to go back home

121
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,624
and face Zoom myself.

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,874
So, let's say you go back to your Earth
and you fight Zoom.

123
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,629
He will kill you.

124
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,877
And then how does that help your daughter?

125
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,757
Look, the best way to save Jesse

126
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,797
is for you to stay here.

127
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,848
And work with us. As a team.

128
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,392
No.

129
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,102
Now, please leave me alone

130
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,684
while I discover which one
of these breaches is gonna get me home.

131
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,435
You know, you're lucky Cisco
and Professor Stein never figured out

132
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,228
how to close all the breaches.

133
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,611
Then, you'd be stuck here.

134
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,740
Wait.

135
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,328
We close the breaches.

136
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,657
All of them except one.

137
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,913
So Zoom only has one way
to get to this world.

138
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,256
- The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Exactly.

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,592
And then we set a trap.

140
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,216
It's got fencing,
fighting, torture, revenge,

141
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,265
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

142
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,145
true love,

143
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,855
miracles.

144
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,192
And, it's ranked as one of the best
date movies of all time.

145
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,354
Well, let's see if that's true.

146
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,539
Cisco?

147
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,701
Are you okay?

148
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,335
I gotta go.

149
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,004
What? Why?

150
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:40,548
I am so sorry that this
is happening right now.

151
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,679
Iam SO, SO sorry. Uh...

152
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,265
I have to go.

153
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,979
I'll call you, okay?
I'll call you. I swear.

154
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,778
Okay, Brian, let that sit overnight.

155
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,864
And then we'll assay in the morning.

156
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,832
Dr. Shore?

157
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,341
Are you okay?

158
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,006
What are you doing?

159
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,721
You can't take that out of here.

160
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,823
What happened to me?

161
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,663
What are you?

162
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,672
Foolish human.

163
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,129
I am Grodd.

164
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,477
Patty!

165
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,020
What'd you find?

166
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,607
Found these weird looking hairs
all over the street.

167
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,110
I'm gonna run them against the database,
and see what I can find.

168
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,940
Uh, here. Our victim.

169
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,527
His name's Dr. Jeffrey Shore.

170
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,283
He's a biochemistry engineer here
at Vaughan Pharmaceuticals.

171
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,615
This is the second dead
lab tech in two weeks.

172
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,870
That ain't a coincidence.

173
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,493
Yeah, and like the other tech,

174
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,033
he had just stolen a serum
from their storage cooler.

175
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,417
Really? What kind of serum?

176
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,704
It's called Cortexin.
It's used to treat encephalopathy.

177
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,372
Uh, blood disease in the brain.

178
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,175
The serum's missing,
but his colleagues found him here,

179
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,505
a couple of minutes later, dead.

180
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,885
He didn't get far.

181
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,178
He died from blunt force trauma

182
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,721
- to the head.
- Ugh.

183
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,181
And apparently, a lot of it.

184
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,592
Yeah, check this out.

185
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,686
- Is that his blood?
- Point of impact.

186
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,563
Okay.

187
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,066
Can you run through
what you told me to her,

188
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,569
and see if you can get anything else
and if the cases are linked?

189
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,944
Sure thing.

190
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,113
Hi.

191
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,941
Some of the evidence.
I'll be right with you.

192
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,241
Uh, Detective?

193
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,699
How's Barry feeling?

194
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,700
Oh, I'm heading to see him right now.

195
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,912
He asked me to bring him
some of my homemade chicken noodle soup.

196
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,584
He hates that canned stuff.

197
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,754
Don't we all.

198
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,639
Faster, Barry!

199
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,392
There you go.

200
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,359
Push yourself!

201
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,786
Barry!

202
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,205
Are you okay?

203
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,332
Oh, yeah, you know?
I'm not great right now.

204
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,253
What happened?

205
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,084
I just... Nothing. I'm good, all right?
Just forget it.

206
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,716
Barry, talk to us. We can help you.

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,174
No, you can't help me.
Not this time. I'm sorry.

208
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,052
You wouldn't understand.

209
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,071
What up, Barr?

210
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,116
Zoom destroyed me.

211
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,579
He showed everyone in Central City
what he could do,

212
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,456
and that I'm powerless to stop him.

213
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,826
They gave me a key to this city, Joe.

214
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,209
I'm supposed to be their hero.

215
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,962
I'm supposed to be the guy
that can protect them

216
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,418
from something as evil as that.

217
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,466
And I failed
in front of all of them.

218
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,480
When they think of The Flash,
all they see now

219
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,645
is someone not strong enough
to protect them.

220
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,699
- Hey.
- I'm good.

221
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,793
Oh, hey, I know I keep asking,

222
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,084
but have you read any reports

223
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,046
or anything recently
about a Birdman attacking anywhere?

224
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,927
There's no such thing as a Birdman, Cisco.

225
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,680
Okay, like that's a stretch, in this city?

226
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,967
Look, I know what I vibed. lt was a man,

227
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,394
with these big, wide wings.

228
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,771
It was crazy.

229
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,149
What if it was an angel?

230
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,112
It was an angel.

231
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,657
Caitlin.

232
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,953
Okay, come on. Like that's a crazy idea.

233
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,702
What is wrong with you?

234
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,956
I just don't know
what to do about Barry.

235
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,297
I mean, all the test results say
he's fine, but it's like

236
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,881
there's something holding him back.

237
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,551
I keep trying to talk to him,
but I can't get through.

238
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
Then maybe we should
get the person who can.

239
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,183
We can talk about that
when I see you at home.

240
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,437
- I gotta take this, okay?
- Okay.

241
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,730
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

242
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,023
Patty, what's up?

243
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,025
Turns out our dead scientist
cases are linked.

244
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,402
Okay. Hit me.

245
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,734
Well, the other scientist
stole a large quantity

246
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,148
of a racetam drug,

247
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,154
typically used to treat
patients with Vertigo.

248
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,412
Okay. So, we got two stolen drugs,
one for blood disorders of the brain

249
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,789
and the other one for vertigo.
What's the connection?

250
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,121
Well, they are both nootropic drugs,
used to enhance intelligence.

251
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,503
Hey, did you get results
from the hairs you found?

252
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,709
Yes. um.

253
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,629
Apparently, they were all over
the other crime scene, too.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,174
The weird thing is,
they're not human hairs...

255
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,554
Uh, they're hairs from a...

256
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,847
From a gorilla.

257
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,766
How did you know?

258
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,017
Patty, I gotta go.

259
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,028
Did Caitlin come through here?

260
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,697
No.

261
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,739
She just hit me in the face and ran away.

262
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,118
Yo!

263
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,078
Grodd!

264
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,622
- What?
- Grodd's back!

265
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,746
Caitlin.
That must be why she was acting like that.

266
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,159
She was being mind-controlled!

267
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,231
I'm continually amazed by the similarities
between our two worlds.

268
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,441
You got talking gorillas on your Earth,
too?

269
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,693
Oh, yeah.

270
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,072
Remind me to never go there.

271
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,699
Ramon, why would this
Grodd abduct Dr. Snow?

272
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,366
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.
She was always so nice to him.

273
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,250
He mind-controlled two lab technicians

274
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,123
to steal chemicals
that enhance intelligence.

275
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,669
He wants her for something.

276
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,752
Well, it looks like he left his
bachelor pad in the sewers.

277
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,292
Grodd's a big-ass gorilla.

278
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,969
He can't just waltz through downtown

279
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,345
without anybody noticing.

280
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,638
Right, and if there's been sightings,

281
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,841
then we might be able to
approximate his location.

282
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,308
I can call C.C.P.D.

283
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,433
They can access the tip hotline,
send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.

284
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,812
Good.

285
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,689
We got to get her back.

286
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,067
We will.

287
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,529
Barry?

288
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,195
- Barry?
- Yeah?

289
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,368
You can't blame yourself for this.
There's nothing you could've done.

290
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,780
I still don't have my speed.

291
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,706
How are we supposed
to save her from Grodd?

292
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,204
You may not have your legs just yet,

293
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,204
but you still got that brain. Use it.

294
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,038
Help us figure that out.

295
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,058
Where are you?

296
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,425
Caitlin.

297
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,094
Grodd?

298
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,008
You remember me?

299
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,399
Caitlin always kind.

300
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,864
Why did you bring me here?

301
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,453
Need help.

302
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,538
I don't understand.

303
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,670
How did I become Grodd?

304
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,467
Oh.

305
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,506
That's a long story, Grodd. Um...

306
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,473
The dark matter
from the particle accelerator explosion,

307
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,517
that's how this happened.

308
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,815
Repeat.

309
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,943
Repeat?

310
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,535
Need to repeat Grodd!

311
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,748
You want me to make more like you?

312
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,709
I don't know how to do that.

313
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,630
Learn.

314
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,234
Keep that chin down, slugger.

315
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,696
Dad.

316
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,207
That was a hell of an idea you had,
bringing Henry here.

317
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,421
Well, he may not have his mother,
but he's got two amazing fathers.

318
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,089
Seemed like he needed both.

319
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,559
- My girl.
- Mmm.

320
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,765
So, how did Grodd become sentient?

321
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,309
A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

322
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,444
with the military to research and awaken

323
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,652
latent mind reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

324
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,568
And I'm guessing Grodd
was one of the test subjects.

325
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,452
Right. But then,
Dr. Wells shut down the program.

326
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,409
And we all thought it was to save Grodd

327
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,870
from all the crazy
mind control experiments.

328
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,662
But it was really so that Dr. Wells
could use the accelerator explosion

329
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,705
to create a 1,500 pound
mind-controlling gorilla

330
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,624
that he could manipulate.

331
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,418
Hmm.

332
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,552
What kind of algorithm is that?

333
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,465
It's an algorithm meant
to extrapolate Grodd's location

334
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,383
from places we know he's already been.

335
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,480
Hello.

336
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,982
And there we have it.

337
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,234
No spinal cord edema,
I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging,

338
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,273
bone fused beautifully.

339
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,656
You're all good, Barry.

340
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,276
I'd give you some physical therapy,

341
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,953
but you don't need it.

342
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,289
I'm really glad you're here, Dad.

343
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,582
Me too.

344
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,171
I tried to call, but you can't get a cell
in Granite Peak National Park. So...

345
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,999
Granite Peak?
What, you went camping by yourself?

346
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,382
Yeah, yeah. I got a tent.

347
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,130
I went fishing every day.

348
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,548
I have had my fill
of largemouth bass for a while.

349
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,518
Sometimes, you just have to slow down,

350
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,019
to get back to where you want to be.

351
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,397
Yeah.

352
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,777
- Dad...
- Hey, guys!

353
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,612
Ithink we found them.

354
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,322
Yeah?

355
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,743
Grodd has to be in one of these
three bell towers.

356
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,653
The only reason
we couldn't find them on any cameras

357
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,034
underneath the city before is

358
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,581
'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad

359
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,658
to a penthouse, like a baller.

360
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,078
Okay. So, we know where he is,
we still don't know how to get her.

361
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,461
We got a plan for you.

362
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,754
What's the plan?

363
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,047
We use me.

364
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,420
That's Harry! That's the other Wells!

365
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,719
Barry.

366
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,597
Let him go. Let him go.

367
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,429
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

368
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,060
I found another suit in the Time Vault.

369
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,352
I thought he was dead.

370
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,772
He's dead. This is...
this is Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

371
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,314
Earth-2?

372
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,607
- I'll explain later.
- If we can

373
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,565
get Harry to convince Grodd

374
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,149
that he's his father,

375
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,151
maybe we can convince
him to let Caitlin go.

376
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,575
I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

377
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,323
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

378
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,253
Looks like we're oh-for-two
in the bell towers, huh?

379
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,919
I like to think of it more as now,
we know exactly where they are.

380
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,929
Okay, let's do this again.
Give me your best Wells.

381
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,307
I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon.
I told you...

382
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,055
Look, I Just made these
anti-mind control ear buds.

383
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,721
They could fail, and if they do,
you're toast.

384
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,480
So, you're gonna need to nail it,
if you wanna live.

385
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:49,938
Ramon...

386
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,773
- Cisco.
- Cisco.

387
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:58,159
"In many ways, you've shown me
what it's like to have a son."

388
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,490
What?

389
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,072
Okay, let's... Let's just try it again.

390
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,993
This time, up the creep factor,
like, a lot more.

391
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,501
And,

392
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,083
make it a little more sincere.

393
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,708
Like you really love me,
but you're gonna have to kill me anyway.

394
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,136
"Cisco,"

395
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,093
"in many ways,"

396
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,884
"you've shown me what it's like
to have a son."

397
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,062
Yep. That's the one.

398
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,560
Here you go.

399
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,562
Yo. Yeah.
We're moving on to the third location.

400
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,901
Copy that.

401
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,403
Now, we wait.

402
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,738
So, this is what it's like.

403
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,658
Every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

404
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,206
Uh... pretty much.

405
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,288
Only Cisco and Caitlin
are normally the ones in here,

406
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,668
and I'm the one out there.

407
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,246
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't be.

408
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,335
Iris showed me what happened with Zoom.

409
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,466
That was hard to watch.

410
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,757
I can only imagine
what that must've been like for you.

411
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,518
He showed everyone in Central City that
their hero wasn't good enough to stop him.

412
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,101
Well, that's certainly
what it looked like.

413
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,398
Was he right?

414
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,155
Your body's healed, Barry.

415
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,112
And yet, here you are,

416
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,365
feeling the shame of losing.

417
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:26,955
I can't stop him.

418
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,666
I know it, he knows it.

419
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,999
And now,
everyone in this city knows it, too.

420
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,169
They don't believe in me anymore, Dad.

421
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,923
At my trial for your mother's death,
a lot of our family and friends

422
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,257
were in the courtroom.

423
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:45,387
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

424
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,766
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.

425
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,099
Every day, I could see it on their faces,
the moment

426
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,855
when I lost them,

427
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,400
until everybody had
stopped believing in me.

428
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,820
Well, that was my reality, you know?

429
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,274
I was gonna serve a life sentence
for a crime I didn't commit.

430
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,613
But worse than that, every time I looked
at someone in the eye,

431
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,278
from that moment forward,
they were gonna believe

432
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,614
that I had killed the woman I loved

433
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,367
in front of our son.

434
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,593
So, yeah. I do know
what's it's like being destroyed.

435
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,343
How did you get past that?

436
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,304
I embraced it.

437
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,015
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward.

438
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,479
But I knew that if I could survive that,

439
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,902
and learn to believe in myself again,
then I could survive anything.

440
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,114
You know what lit that belief in me,
Barry?

441
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,950
You.

442
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,328
Eleven-year-old you running around,
believing in me, gave me that hope.

443
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,713
And now, I'm giving it back to you, Son.

444
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,633
No more monsters can take that from us.

445
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:19,026
So, one of the main differences
between ape and human brains

446
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,563
is the white matter and connectivity
in the brain cells.

447
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,983
The chemicals that
you were treated with as an infant

448
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,576
were meant to overcome those differences
and cause an explosive growth of both,

449
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,284
similar to what humans experience
in their first few years of life.

450
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,291
Maybe, these chemicals can be used
to duplicate that growth,

451
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,832
then we won't need
a particle accelerator explosion.

452
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,340
Hey, buddy.

453
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,843
Easy, buddy.

454
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,933
It's me.

455
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,769
I'm back.

456
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,692
Father? You died.

457
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,607
No.

458
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,572
No, buddy. I didn't die.

459
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,317
I just went away for a while.

460
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,070
All right, that's great, Wells.
Keep talking.

461
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,831
But now that I'm back,

462
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,954
we don't need Caitlin anymore,
do we, buddy?

463
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,798
So, you can let her go.

464
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,049
Come on, buddy.

465
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,178
Let me get her out of here.

466
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,598
Please.

467
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,561
Father never ask.

468
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,316
Father take.

469
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:43,940
Run.

470
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,115
Who are you?

471
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,361
Cisco, you gotta get in there, man.

472
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,831
Oh, Cisco, thank God.

473
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,333
Okay, you guys gotta get out of there!

474
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,332
Harry's trapped. We can't leave
him here. What do we do?

475
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,253
The drugs,
the drugs that Grodd stole.

476
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,541
Wells... an overdose of those

477
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,800
drugs will shock his brain.

478
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,095
Okay, just hit him with as much as you can.

479
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,929
You are not him. You are not father!

480
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,934
I am Father.

481
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,228
And you hit Father.

482
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,479
Grodd.

483
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,486
Look at me.

484
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,156
Look at me!

485
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,958
I would never leave you here alone, Grodd.

486
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,959
I made you a promise.

487
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,343
I have bigger plans for you.

488
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,009
Remember?

489
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,390
One day.

490
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,843
This city will be yours.

491
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,812
I promised you.

492
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,854
I intend to honor that promise.

493
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,694
Go!

494
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,953
Come on.

495
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,673
Thank you.

496
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,344
Thank you for rescuing me.

497
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,260
Well...

498
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,719
We're a team, right?

499
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,055
I'm impressed.

500
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,807
Ithink we all are.

501
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,188
Yeah. We need to do something about Grodd.

502
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,519
Like what?

503
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,149
Like, get rid of him for good.

504
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,480
You want to kill him?

505
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,983
Considering how many people he's killed?
Yeah.

506
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,317
This isn't Grodd's fault.

507
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,649
He's only like this because
Wells made him this way.

508
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,410
Yes, but Cait,
he kidnapped you and you could have died.

509
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,036
You didn't see what I saw.

510
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,409
Grodd's getting smarter.

511
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,495
He's lonely and sad.

512
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,580
He wants more apes like him.

513
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,207
What are you saying? He wants kids?

514
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,004
'Cause I'm pretty sure one telepathic

515
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,878
Grape Ape is more than
enough for this city.

516
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,422
I know somewhere we could send him.

517
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,215
What are you talking about?

518
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,380
When the singularity exploded

519
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,849
I discovered the breach in S.T.A.R. Labs,

520
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,221
I ran a similar test,

521
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,389
and discovered the same thing.
51 additional breaches.

522
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,024
The difference being,
the breaches in Central City

523
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,186
are scattered all throughout the city,
whereas their counterparts in my world,

524
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,858
most definitely are not.

525
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,192
And you know where they lead?

526
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,116
Well, I was in the process
of figuring all that out.

527
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,326
When Dr. Snow
so gallantly convinced me to stay.

528
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,574
But if I am correct,

529
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,163
this breach is gonna get Grodd

530
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,074
as close to home
as he's ever likely to get.

531
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,955
Okay.

532
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,289
Even if you're right,
how do we bait Grodd to go through it?

533
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,628
My son will do it.

534
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,381
Won't you, Flash?

535
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,851
Grodd!

536
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,980
Caitlin.

537
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,575
Flash.

538
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,703
You want Caitlin, Grodd,
you're gonna have to catch me first.

539
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,225
So, Barry's gonna lure Grodd
in front of the breach.

540
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,355
Yep.
And once he gets him to the right spot,

541
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,982
Cisco's gonna blast him into Earth-2

542
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,400
with his thingamajig.

543
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,731
Speed cannon.

544
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,982
Exactly.

545
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,360
Well, things have gotten a lot
more complicated

546
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,694
since I got out of prison.

547
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,242
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you have no idea.

548
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,488
Cisco?
Almost there, are you ready?

549
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,910
I'm in position.

550
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,950
Now, once you turn on the speed cannon,

551
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,787
the quark matter will stabilize,
stretching the breach about so big. So...

552
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,130
Anywhere within this circle will suffice.

553
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,886
Right on time.

554
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,890
Okay, come on.

555
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,188
I don't have eyes on Grodd,
does anyone see him?

556
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,900
That is a big gorilla.

557
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,532
Where is Caitlin?

558
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,082
- Oh, my God.
- Get up, Barry.

559
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,246
Where is Caitlin, Flash?

560
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,670
Right here.

561
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,839
No. No, no, no.

562
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,720
You need to let him go, Grodd.

563
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:06,217
Flash is my enemy. Now, you too.

564
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,555
No.

565
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,304
He was trying to save me from you.

566
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,149
We didn't understand what you wanted.
But now, we do.

567
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,694
I can give you what you want.
I can give you a home.

568
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,070
You just have to trust me.

569
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,787
All right, here he comes.

570
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,500
Get ready to flip the switch.

571
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,675
Now, Barry!

572
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,106
- Full power!
- It is!

573
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,536
Barry.

574
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,076
You can't let Grodd get free.

575
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,537
Conquer your fears, son.
Believe in yourself.

576
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,604
Come on.

577
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,523
Come on, come on.

578
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,006
Welcome back, Flash.

579
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,385
Thanks, bro.

580
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,437
I can't believe something good finally
came from that suit.

581
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,353
The first and the last time.

582
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,405
That thing still gives me the creeps.
We should destroy it.

583
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,816
Let's do that,
but see if you can figure out

584
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,530
how to get it back on this ring first.

585
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,986
Might be nice to have something like that

586
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,787
instead of carrying around
a bag all the time.

587
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,118
I can help you with that.

588
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,375
What?

589
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,164
I know a thing or two
about microtechnology.

590
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,622
Yeah. You know a thing or two
about a lot of things.

591
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,383
Well, as long as what he knows
keeps my son and these good people safe.

592
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,089
The more you know, the better.

593
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,712
Pleasure to meet you, Harrison.

594
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,092
Again.

595
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,594
Dr. Allen.

596
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,096
Good to see you.

597
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,640
Cisco.

598
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,849
- Let's go.
- Take care.

599
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,767
So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth
that we've sent Grodd,

600
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,442
what is it, exactly?

601
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:10,239
It's a refuge where gorillas subjected
to lab experiments, like Grodd,

602
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,204
can roam freely.

603
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,747
I know it's for the best,
but I still feel like I betrayed him.

604
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,754
No, don't say that. You didn't betray him.

605
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,206
You gave him a better life.

606
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,923
I still don't understand, though. I...

607
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,765
Why do the breaches on our Earth
lead to different places on yours?

608
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,599
I don't know yet,

609
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,765
Ramon.

610
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,520
But I do know we have to close them all.

611
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,272
And I don't know how to do that.

612
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,730
You don't have to do it alone anymore.
Any of it.

613
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,445
Together, we defeated Grodd.

614
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,984
And if we stay that way,

615
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,446
we will figure out how to close
the breaches, get Zoom,

616
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,110
and get you your daughter back.

617
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:57,952
Thank you.

618
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,584
Oh, this one is definitely a keeper.

619
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,881
Oh, yeah.

620
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,839
He could've done just the standard
baking-soda-and-vinegar volcano,

621
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,173
but no.

622
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,839
Barry wanted to do
a molecular structure

623
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,053
of chocolate and nougat.

624
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,433
It's my favorite candy bar.

625
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,848
Who does that in the sixth grade?

626
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,887
Why, a true science nerd.

627
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,395
Like father, like son, I suppose.

628
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,276
All right, Dad. We should get going.

629
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,271
Yeah. Uh, Joe? Can I?

630
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,605
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

631
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,529
Iris.

632
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,406
Thank you so much
for reaching out to me.

633
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,328
I am so glad you did.

634
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,996
- Me, too.
- Mmm.

635
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,787
Joe,

636
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,581
there are no words, man.

637
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,210
Thanks.

638
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,259
All right. Um, I'm gonna swing by my lab
before I come home.

639
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,171
Which reminds me,
Patty, she's a smart girl.

640
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,971
She's not buying your whole sick story.

641
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,264
All right.

642
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,389
Patty? Would this be a new girlfriend?

643
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,141
Uh, yeah.

644
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,688
Something like that, yeah.

645
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,856
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

646
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,187
Come on.

647
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,145
- Bye.
- See you.

648
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,695
You okay?

649
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,286
It's embarrassing. I... I love Barry

650
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,370
like he's my own son, but
when I'm reminded that he isn't,

651
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,044
I start to wonder
what it would've been like if, you know...

652
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,253
Dad, you would've been just as amazing
with your own son,

653
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,841
just like you were with me and Barry.

654
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,273
I hear you've been spending

655
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,983
a lot of time up here.

656
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,815
Well, you know what they say.

657
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,151
When the CSI's away...

658
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,903
It's good to see you on your feet again.

659
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,456
It must have been
all that canned soup you had.

660
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,334
Or maybe the homemade stuff
Joe brought you.

661
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,586
Yeah.
I wasn't actually sick, Patty.

662
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,588
Yeah, I figured that out.

663
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,885
Why did you lie to me?

664
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,595
My dad was in town.
I needed to spend some time with him.

665
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,687
You couldn't just tell me that?

666
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,273
You gotta understand, Patty.
My dad was convicted of murder.

667
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,313
When someone's image
has been tarnished like that,

668
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,448
it's hard for some people to see past it.

669
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,073
And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

670
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,580
No, I know.
I should've given you more credit.

671
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,241
No, you should've given yourself
more credit.

672
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,044
This isn't about your father, Barry.
This is about you.

673
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,925
I need to know that I can trust you,
if we're gonna do this.

674
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,511
Okay.

675
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,135
I'm serious.

676
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,679
I can tell.

677
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,894
You cannot always be a smart ass.

678
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,368
- Hi.
- Hi.

679
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,166
I didn't know if you liked
flowers or chocolate. So...

680
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,710
I got you both.

681
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,716
Well, I'm allergic to chocolate

682
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,378
and I think that flowers
are a waste of money.

683
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,009
Um...

684
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,972
I have lollipops in my car?

685
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,267
Cisco, I'm joking.

686
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,598
Oh, God.

687
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,979
This is great. Thank you.

688
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,895
Listen, I wanted to come over here

689
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,900
and say I'm sorry

690
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,528
for bailing the other night.

691
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,985
I'm a liaison with the C.C.P.D.,

692
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,696
and there was an emergency
and I had to be there.

693
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,444
- The C.C.P.D.?
- Yeah.

694
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,579
Wow, that's really cool.

695
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,452
And very brave.

696
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,124
Thank you.

697
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:14,296
And this is very, very sweet, Cisco.

698
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,418
Um...

699
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,878
What is this?

700
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,671
- Oh, see, that right there?
- Mmm-hmm.

701
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,844
That's a digital movie projector.

702
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,513
I loaded all of Princess Bride on there.

703
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,633
Mmm-hmm. That's right.

704
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,178
So, all we need is a wall or, you know,

705
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,769
someplace where we can

706
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,059
pick up our date where we left off.

707
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,852
Well, if we're going to pick up

708
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,278
right where we left it...

709
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:57,960
Whoa.

710
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,917
Whoa. What? What's wrong?

711
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,885
Nothing.

712
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,350
You're just a really amazing kisser.

713
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,518
Okay.

714
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,268
Let's go watch Princess Bride.

715
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,358
- Let's.
- There's a great wall up on the roof.
