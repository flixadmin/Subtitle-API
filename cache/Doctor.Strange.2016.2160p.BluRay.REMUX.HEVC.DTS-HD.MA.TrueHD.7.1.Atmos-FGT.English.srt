(SOFTLY) Yes.

You helped him to walk again.

Yes.

00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,352
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

378
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,313
Well, I didn't correct it.

379
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,773
He couldn't walk.

380
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,274
I convinced him that he could.

381
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,359
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

382
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,403
When you reattach a severed nerve...

383
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,947
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

384
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,032
It's the cells.

385
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,700
The cells are only programmed...

386
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,827
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

387
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,912
Right.

388
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,498
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

389
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,834
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

390
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,005
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

391

is your treatment?

395
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,849
Quite.

396
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,644
So, you've figured out a way...

397
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,021

No, Mr. Strange.

400

(CHUCKLES)

410
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,597
And what about this one?

411

- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

412
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,353

417
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,492
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

418
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,078
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,749
to see more, to know more.

422
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,919
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

423
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,921
in ways you can't imagine...

424
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,590
you reject the possibility.

425
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,176
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

426
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,927
about chakras or energy...

427
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,679

you see through me, do you?

It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.
