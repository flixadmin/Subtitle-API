1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,834
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,449
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:09,469
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:11,854
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:16,025
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:21,498
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,303
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,789
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,840
I could save you,
or I could kill you.

10
00:00:30,842 --> 00:00:32,842
Slade has the Mirakuru
in his system now.

11
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:35,428
The ones who survived,
they became someone else.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,912
Whoa!

13
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:40,850
This Mirakuru,
it's messing with your head.

14
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,235
I know you
and your new friends

15
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:43,820
have the Mirakuru.
In exchange,

16
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:44,904
I'll promise you
and your friends

17
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,006
safe passage
off this island.

18
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,858
Slade's gone, and he took
the Mirakuru with him.

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,244
You know who he is under
that hood, don't you?

20
00:00:51,246 --> 00:00:56,282
Once he has lost everyone
and everything he values...

21
00:00:56,284 --> 00:01:00,536
I will drive an arrow
through his eye.

22
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:19,055
Welcome to
St. Walker's, alderman.

23
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:22,108
Or should
I call you Mayor?

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,943
Thank you
for letting me come by so late.

25
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,396
Well, I can imagine how
busy your schedule is.

26
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,114
It's really great
of you taking the time

27
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:29,232
to come and visit
your aunt.

28
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,701
Her health
has taken a bad turn.

29
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:33,736
Of course.

30
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,772
She's family.

31
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:41,911
Maya, look who came to see you.

32
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:44,997
It's your nephew, Sebastian.

33
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't go.

34
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:48,684
Please.

35
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:50,720
We'll be fine.

36
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:52,605
Thank you.

37
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,009
Still worshipping
the old Gods, I see.

38
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:59,929
They're the last thing
I have from your father's.

39
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,848
They protect me.

40
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,484
You were supposed
to protect you.

41
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:07,353
A friend of mine, Laurel Lance,
came by to visit you

42
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:10,790
a couple days ago.
Do you remember her?

43
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,258
She's muy Linda.

44
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,927
Yes, she is.

45
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,396
What did you both
talk about?

46
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,932
Nada.
Nothing.

47
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:23,119
You know I don't like it
when you lie to me.

48
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:25,938
I told her
the truth.

49
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,925
That you--
you kill him.

50
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:30,659
Your father.

51
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:34,714
Mi esposo!

52
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:38,384
I don't know
what came over me.

53
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:41,154
I am so, so sorry.

54
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:44,340
I hurt you, mijo.

55
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:46,142
Esta bien.

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,311
No te preoccupes.

57
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:52,181
But you are
my child, my son.

58
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:56,185
And I hurt you.

59
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,788
I forgive you, mama.

60
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:08,364
I forgive you
for everything.

61
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:19,926
La luz de dios me rodea,
amor de dios me envuelve,

62
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:22,378
El poder de dios
me protege,

63
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,648
la presencia de dios
vela por mí.

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,986
Los dioses
están muertos.

Oh! Ah!

68
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,733
Oh, please!

69
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,035
I don't know anything.

70
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,087
The man in the skull mask.
Where is he?

71
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,755
I don't know what
you're talking about.

72
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,941
He's been experimenting
on people in the Glades.

73
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,626
He's leaving a trail
of corpses

74
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:54,989
with blood running
from their eyes.

75
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,010
No, no, no, no, no.

76
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,596
I deal in stolen
merchandise, that is it.

77
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:02,581
Ah, ooh, please!

78
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,666
Ask him
what color his shoes are.

79
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:06,268
What?

80
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,970
You want this guy
to take a polygraph

81
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,172
via Bluetooth, cool,
but I need to hear him

82
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:12,942
establish a base line.
I need to hear him tell the truth

83
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,443
just once.

84
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,947
What color
are your shoes?

85
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,648
What?

86
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,066
They're blue!

87
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,986
He's not lying.

88
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:25,521
Please...

89
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:31,293
He's out there.

90
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:33,695
Somewhere.

91
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:35,047
Come home.

92
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:37,699
We can't do
any more tonight.

93
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,538
Slade?

94
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,641
Slade!

95
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,810
Thought maybe
he'd come back here.

96
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,762
He has the Mirakuru
serum in his bloodstream.

97
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:53,933
He's not thinking clearly.
So what do we do now?

98
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,268
I don't know, Sara.

99
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:00,823
The sensor grid
is still active.

100
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,191
So at least we're going
to know if Ivo

101
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,326
and his men come back
to the island.

102
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,278
So we just sit here and wait?

103
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,497
Well, do you have
any other ideas?

104
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:12,034
'Cause right now,
I'm open to suggestions.

105
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:14,703
We find Slade, and...

106
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,456
Maybe we consider Ivo's offer.

107
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,958
What?

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,577
Look, if we get the serum
back from Slade,

109
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,295
then we can go home.

110
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,931
And I can try to talk to Ivo.
I can get him to listen to me.

111
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,018
Like he listened before he shot
Shado in the head?

112
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,753
He's just tired,
and he's frustrated.

113
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,940
You don't understand
what finding

114
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,276
the Mirakuru serum
has meant to him.

115
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,144
You're right, Sara,
I don't understand.

116
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:41,030
And I don't get
how you can even consider

117
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:42,982
trusting him after what he did.

118
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,950
He's not evil.

119
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:48,037
He kept me safe
on that ship for over a year.

120
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,740
And I mean, not just safe,
he taught me things.

121
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,775
And I learned a lot.

122
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,161
I learned a lot, too.

123
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:59,381
This island taught me
that you can't trust anyone.

124
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,481
Ms. Lance?

125
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,483
I have a call for you
on line two.

126
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,101
Thank you,
Katherine.

127
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:23,489
Laurel Lance.

128
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,741
This is nurse Downey
from St. Walker's.

129
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:29,361
You asked me to call if there was
any changes Inaya Resik's condition.

130
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:32,915
I'm sad to report
she passed away.

131
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,283
What?

132
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,503
Her heart gave out
on her, poor soul.

133
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,955
You think Sebastian Blood,
the saint of Starling City,

134
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,373
killed his own mother?

135
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,824
He was the last person
to see her alive.

136
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:44,593
That isn't a coincidence.

137
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,328
He's a devoted nephew
visiting a sick relative.

138
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,963
You're right,
that's very, very suspicious.

139
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:49,715
He didn't go there
to visit her.

140
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,050
He went there to
kill her;

141
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,718
to cover up the fact
that as a child,

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,553
he killed
his father.

143
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,055
Maya Resik told me
what happened.

144
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,506
From inside
a padded room, right?

145
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:59,525
Which he had her
forcibly committed.

146
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:02,394
She tells me the truth and then
two days later has a heart attack.

147
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,363
You don't find that strange?
Well, for one thing,

148
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,115
there's no record that Maya Resik
was even Blood's mother,

149
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:07,900
and according
to the hospital,

150
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,618
she was in the late
stages of heart disease.

151
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,704
I need you to call
in a favor with Judge Carlin.

152
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:14,206
Get a search warrant
for Sebastian's campaign headquarters,

153
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,742
his phone records; I--I
have to start somewhere.

154
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,994
Laurel, this isn't
some casual request.

155
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:21,964
I'm the ADA
who took Vertigo on live TV.

156
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,749
I take a shot
at Sebastian Blood and miss,

157
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:26,034
my career is done.

158
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:28,036
Adam!

159
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,204
Please.

160
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:30,706
I'm sorry, Laurel.

161
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,342
You're on your own.

162
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:39,515
Hello, Roy.

163
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,435
Lurking in an ally.

164
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:44,987
That's not
at all creepy.

165
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:46,488
When I ran the club,

166
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,273
I learned
all the secret entrances.

167
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:50,192
I never got a chance
to thank you

168
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,194
for saving my mother's life.

169
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:54,113
Thea told me.

170
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:57,166
She said that
you were very brave.

171
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,501
I did what anyone
would have done.

172
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,003
Not anyone.

173
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,622
It takes a lot to run
towards danger,

174
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,507
not away
from it.

175
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,926
That sounded like praise.

176
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:10,629
I thought where I was concerned,
you didn't approve.

177
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,466
Thea said that you also got
hit by some falling debris.

178
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:16,852
How are you feeling?

179
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:19,138
Actually, it mostly missed me.

180
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,974
I'm fine. Look,
I got to get back to work.

181
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:30,282
Has Roy mentioned
anything about the man

182
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,734
in the skull mask
who injected him?

183
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,368
Roy is not
the kind of guy

184
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,571
who is comfortable
discussing his feelings.

185
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:38,540
Not like you and me.

186
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,409
Don't yell at me, but I really think
we need a new plan

187
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,127
on how to find
this creepy mask guy.

188
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,246
Scaring the crap out of low-lifes
isn't yielding results.

189
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,415
Felicity, I am open
to any and all suggestions.

190
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,217
Oliver, maybe we're
over thinking this.

191
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:50,719
What if the mask simply got wind
that you were after him

192
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,004
and decided
to skip town?

193
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,672
He didn't go
to all the trouble

194
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,758
of recreating the serum
and testing it on people

195
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,292
just to walk away.

196
00:08:57,294 --> 00:09:00,262
He is still out there, and
we need to locate him.

197
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:07,569
Lance,
for the Arrow.

198
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:10,072
Yes, Detective?
Can we meet?

199
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:11,573
What is it?

200
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:14,276
Someone wants
to talk to you.

201
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:22,084
Hello, Laurel.

202
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,319
You're late.

203
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:27,055
I had to circle around to make sure
there wasn't a SWAT team

204
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,457
waiting for me again.

205
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:29,925
That's fair.

206
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,760
Trust me, I wouldn't
have asked my father

207
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:34,379
to put me in touch with you
if I had any other choice.

208
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,532
What do you need?
Sebastian Blood.

209
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,550
He's about to be
the new mayor of Starling City.

210
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:39,852
I know who he is.

211
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:42,688
No, you don't.
No one does.

212
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,606
A few weeks ago,
I was approached

213
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:47,392
by your groupie, Roy Harper,
and his girlfriend.

214
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:51,947
They asked me to investigate
the death of Max Stanton.

215
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:55,901
You think Blood was involved in
Stanton's death?

216
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:59,571
Blood, or a man that works
for him named Cyrus Gold.

217
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,792
Gold killed
four cops,

218
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:07,529
including my father's
partner, Lucas Hilton.

219
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,391
Blood and Gold knew each
other from the orphanage

220
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,917
that Blood was raised at.

221
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:15,554
He would do anything to keep
the truth about his past hidden.

222
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,507
Including murdering
his own mother.

223
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,559
Why would he do that?

224
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:23,312
To cover up the fact that he
killed his father.

225
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,849
I tried going to the DA.

226
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,567
No one will believe me.

227
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,154
I swear to you,
Sebastian Blood is dangerous.

228
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:35,507
And you're the only person
in this city who can stop him.

229
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,252
Laurel was right.

230
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,887
I hacked Blood's
cell phone records.

231
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,605
The alderman and Gold have
stayed buddies

232
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,006
since Zandia
orphanage.

233
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,675
So what? They
kept in touch.

234
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,093
Doesn't exactly mean
that Sebastian Blood

235
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,728
is the man
in the skull mask.

236
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,264
His last name is Blood.
That can't be a good sign.

237
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,766
Felicity, he's dedicated
his life, risked his life

238
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,401
to help the people
of the Glades.

239
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:01,320
And in his spare time,
he's a murderer

240
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,172
trying to create an army
of human weapons?

241
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:05,274
You're a personal bodyguard
who fights crime at night

242
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,159
with his billionaire boss.
Not a lot of people

243
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,812
show their real face in public.

244
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:12,531
Oliver, what
are you thinking?

245
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:16,201
Laurel gave me
a case number to start with.

246
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:19,338
We need to know if Sebastian
really killed his father,

247
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,123
then we figure out
if there's a chance

248
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,459
he has the Mirakuru formula.
I'm on it.

249
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:25,094
And what if this
is just another trap,

250
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,845
set by Laurel?
She could be setting you up,

251
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,748
and this time, you wouldn't
have Sara to save you.

252
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:37,723
Asking a cute girl to meet you
down by the tracks, Harper?

253
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,725
Good thing Thea and I are tight.

254
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,259
I have to show you
something.

255
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,694
Easy there, tiger.

256
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,401
You're not even bleeding!
When did you start juicing?

257
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:50,903
I'm not.

258
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,271
Then how do you explain
what I just saw?

259
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,243
You remember that night around
Christmas when I went missing?

260
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:00,162
Yeah, Thea
and I were pissed.

261
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:03,165
I never told you guys
what really happened.

262
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,717
You were right
about your friend Max.

263
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,753
He didn't OD,
he was murdered.

264
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,721
He was injected with something,

265
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,224
and I was injected with the same thing,
but it didn't kill me.

266
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,426
It made me--
it made me stronger.

267
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:16,345
Thea must be
freaking.

268
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,129
No, she doesn't know,
I don't want her to.

269
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,265
Why not?
No, I can't, not yet.

270
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:22,935
Not until I know more about
what happened to me.

271
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,403
I don't want to scare her.

272
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,438
And you're not worried
about scaring me?

273
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,740
Come on, I was going crazy
not telling someone.

274
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,642
So what are you
going to do?

275
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:35,020
Well, the Arrow once told me
all I was good for was taking a beating.

276
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:38,824
Maybe it's time I started
handing out a few of my own.

277
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,172
I don't follow.

278
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:44,415
Now I don't need his help
to protect this city.

279
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:47,501
Let's find us a bad guy.

280
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:49,387
I have good news

281
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,006
and bad news.
I suggest the good news first;

282
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:54,208
it tends to soften
the blow of the bad news.

283
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,477
Okay, dealer's choice.

284
00:12:56,479 --> 00:13:00,214
Good news is we found the case file
on Sebastian's dad's murder.

285
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:02,099
Anything in it
to suggest he killed him?

286
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,684
Oliver, meet bad news.

287
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,686
That file was
sealed years ago.

288
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:07,989
And since the file
is over 27 years old,

289
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,757
there is no digital copy
for me to hack.

290
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,360
The only hard copy
is stored the old-fashioned way

291
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,445
in the city archives.
So I go in

292
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,414
and take it--
the old fashioned way.

293
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,250
Except security in the file room
is so old school,

294
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:21,619
you need a key card to get in,
which, even if you had,

295
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,971
you wouldn't know where
to start looking for the file.

296
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:29,043
An assistant DA would.

297
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:47,461
You said
you needed my help.

298
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,930
Now I need yours.
What do you need?

299
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:52,650
You.

300
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,545
You know what I really miss
about being home?

301
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:08,449
My bed.

302
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:13,888
I don't know if I even remember
what a bed feels like anymore.

303
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,891
And you probably
never will.

304
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:19,093
And neither
will I.

305
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:21,429
Sara...

306
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,597
You don't have to do that.

307
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,267
We're going to find
a way off the island.

308
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,686
Ok?

309
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:33,640
You just--you just
have to trust me.

310
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,611
Last time
I trusted you

311
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:40,231
was right before
the "Gambit" went down.

312
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,750
I haven't gotten
a chance to say this...

313
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,319
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:48,122
I know this is my fault.

315
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:49,957
And none of this
would have happened

316
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,227
if I hadn't invited you
on the boat with me.

317
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:56,213
That's not
exactly true.

318
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:57,965
I mean...

319
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:00,201
I was the one
who said yes.

320
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:03,003
And it was only
half because of your charm.

321
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,605
And the other half?

322
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:06,557
Do you remember
when you spilled that beer on me

323
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,175
at Tommy's party?

324
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:09,894
No.

325
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:12,846
But I never left
one of Tommy's parties

326
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,482
with my memory intact.

327
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:17,034
Well, I wasn't even
supposed to go.

328
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,519
But I snuck
out of the house

329
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,037
because I knew
you were going to be there.

330
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,573
And I had this--

331
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:25,626
I had this embarrassing
crush on you.

332
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,962
And Laurel,
she knew it.

333
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:32,466
And that's why the party got
broken up by the cops.

334
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,585
She tipped off our dad.

335
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,420
Then I was grounded
for a month,

336
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:38,472
and the next thing
I knew...

337
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:42,226
You and Laurel
were together.

338
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:45,045
You think she did
all that on purpose?

339
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:50,217
Not everybody's
what they seem.

340
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:54,555
We should
get some sleep.

341
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,885
You ready for this?

342
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,188
Whatever it takes.

343
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,924
We're going in.

344
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:33,227
At least the security cameras
are from this century.

345
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,781
And now
they're toast.

346
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,200
You have exactly seven minutes
until the system reboots.

347
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:44,321
Hey, check it out.

348
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:49,660
This could
take a while.

349
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:52,379
You have six minutes.

350
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,589
I'm rebooting the monitors.

351
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:03,624
There's a trojan
plugging our system.

352
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:06,510
It's probably some punk.

353
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,688
Uh-oh.

354
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,908
Oliver...

355
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,643
What's wrong?

356
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:24,862
It looks we've got the one
rent-a-cop with a brain here.

357
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:28,115
If there's a camera nearby,
I recommend hiding.

358
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:30,417
Look there.

359
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:33,921
You got to send
some officers here.

360
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,172
Starling's finest
will be there any minute.

361
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:36,957
You need to get
out of there now.

362
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,093
We're not leaving
without the file.

363
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,661
Laurel...

364
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:44,381
I can't find it!

365
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,833
Up there, third floor.

366
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:54,675
Hurry, Oliver.

367
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:05,119
Wait! Case number SC43878!

368
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:06,570
This is it!

369
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:08,572
Vigilante,
we know you're here!

370
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,908
Close everything off, now!

371
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:14,745
They're blocking
our only way out!

372
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:16,046
It's not our only way.

373
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,465
Get to the east wall
and wait for me.

374
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,503
Drop your weapon!

375
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,421
We tried going through
all the security footage

376
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,223
at the city archives
to see if anyone swiped the file

377
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:07,641
over the last few days.
Did you see anyone?

378
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,843
Just this.

379
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,563
It's all been erased.

380
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,315
So what happened
when you reversed the footprint

381
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,200
to see who hacked in
before you?

382
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:19,436
I struck out again.
It must have been an inside job.

383
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,188
Meaning?
As a city alderman,

384
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,739
Blood would have
had access to the files.

385
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,390
Oliver, anyone on city payroll
could have done this.

386
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:25,909
He's running for mayor.

387
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,444
One hint that
he killed his father,

388
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:28,995
and his political future
is dead in the water.

389
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:31,048
Wait, I thought you two were
supposed to be friends.

390
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,083
Don't you think you ought to give him
the benefit of the doubt?

391
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,335
Please keep digging
into Blood's past

392
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:37,070
and see if there's
anything that could help us.

393
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,256
Where you going?

394
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,875
To give a friend
the benefit of the doubt.

395
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:47,214
What, are you still
giving me the cold shoulder?

396
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:48,432
Are you still
not telling me

397
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,717
what the hell
is going on with you?

398
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,185
Am I interrupting?

399
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:54,337
He and I would
actually have to be talking

400
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,022
for you to be
interrupting.

401
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,224
Can I try?

402
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,060
Be my guest.

403
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:01,895
Tell her.

404
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,530
No.

405
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:05,365
Now what do you
got for me?

406
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,701
This guy in the Glades,
the Starling Slasher.

407
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,237
Word on the street is,
he's got a thing for prostitutes.

408
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,240
And by thing, I mean he has
a thing for slicing them up.

409
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:14,991
Mostly hunts in Crescent Circle.

410
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:16,543
Sounds like
a great guy.

411
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,328
Hmm, yeah. Problem is,
he's some big shot lawyer,

412
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,280
so no one has
the sack to ID him.

413
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:22,582
Wait, this sounds exactly like someone
the Arrow would go after.

414
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,750
But we don't need
the Arrow anymore.

415
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:24,835
We're going to have
to bait him.

416
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:26,319
What pro is going to let us

417
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:28,088
dangle her in front
of a psycho?

418
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,173
No. No, no way--
Thea.

419
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,391
No!

420
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,727
Um, Sin has a date.

421
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,762
She has hoping
to borrow an outfit.

422
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:37,681
You know, something slutty.

423
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:40,133
I have the perfect
first date outfit.

424
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,269
Guarantees a second one.

425
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,436
Great.

426
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:44,738
This guy won't know
what hit him.

427
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,774
Or girl.
Whatever you're into.

428
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:49,776
I could do your make-up
or your hair.

429
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:51,411
You are not touching
the hair, Queen.

430
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:54,314
Ok.

431
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:05,625
You looking for me?

432
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:07,460
Sebastian.
Good to see you.

433
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,179
You too, man.

434
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:10,881
Listen, I'm so sorry, but I'm
right in the middle

435
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:12,599
of a polling snafu.

436
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,684
I'll be quick. I just
had a question about Laurel.

437
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,136
Of course.
Is everything ok?

438
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:17,721
Not sure. I ran
into her the other day,

439
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:20,190
and something just seemed off.
I know the two of you

440
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:21,608
have been spending
a lot of time together,

441
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,060
I just wanted to know
if you knew anything.

442
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:25,645
Well, we've traded
phone calls,

443
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:27,614
but she's in trial,
I've been campaigning.

444
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:29,282
We haven't really
been able to connect.

445
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,951
Nothing happened
between the two of you?

446
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:35,288
Not an argument
or a fight or something?

447
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,407
If I didn't know
any better,

448
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,209
I'd say you were coming to me like
a jealous ex-boyfriend.

449
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:42,829
No. Just--no, I'm just
looking out for a friend.

450
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:44,831
And I hope you do the same.

451
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,999
Of course.

452
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:48,552
Listen, I will
take care of Laurel.

453
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,870
Thank you
for letting me know.

454
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:11,156
You're new.

455
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:13,392
Got to start
somewhere, right?

456
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:14,893
Get in.

457
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:26,922
Romantic.

458
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,907
You're pretty.

459
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,877
You're disgusting.

460
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:35,381
I see you'd like
to play rough.

461
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:46,692
Wait!

462
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:48,927
I've got money!
Keep it.

463
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:02,324
Roy, Roy, stop it,
you're killing him!

464
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:06,712
Oh! Sin?

465
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:08,330
Sin, I'm sorry.

466
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,749
We have to call
an ambulance.

467
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:20,926
Point blank range.

468
00:23:20,928 --> 00:23:24,396
Single shot to the heart
from a low angle.

469
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:28,467
Obviously the handiwork
of someone quite scared,

470
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:32,104
and very small.

471
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,023
How come the police
didn't arrest you?

472
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,358
I knew how to cover my tracks.

473
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,528
A skill you've obviously lost since
you've gotten bigger.

474
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,997
You know how close you came

475
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,800
to allowing the Vigilante
to destroy everything?

476
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,535
Someone spoke out of turn.

477
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,420
I've taken care of the problem.

478
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,492
Your mother was
not our problem.

479
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:56,111
Laurel Lance is.

480
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:57,829
You were the one who told me
to get close to her.

481
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:00,165
You said that it was part of the plan
to hurt the Vigilante.

482
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,867
It is.

483
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:04,836
But you being
sloppy isn't.

484
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:08,023
Fix this, Mr. Blood.

485
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:11,894
You don't want me
to fix it for you.

486
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:18,267
Brother Daily.

487
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,486
I need you to take care
of something for me.

488
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:36,835
Whoever you are,
I'm calling the police!

489
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:39,338
No need to.
Remember me?

490
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,040
Officer Daily, right?

491
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,059
What's this all about?

492
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:46,095
What are you doing
in my apartment.

493
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,147
I have a warrant.

494
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,431
A warrant for what?

495
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,383
We found these
in your bedroom, Ms. Lance.

496
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:53,218
These aren't prescribed to you.
That's a felony.

497
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,388
What?! This is ridiculous!

498
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,108
You're under arrest for possession of
a controlled substance.

499
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,776
You have the right
to remain silent.

500
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,494
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

501
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:03,896
in a court of law.

502
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,920
I know what
this looks like.

503
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,793
But you have
to listen to me.

504
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,426
I know what's happening.

505
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:31,896
Sebastian Blood...
He's setting me up,

506
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,498
because he knows
I'm onto him.

507
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,683
He's--he's trying
to frame me!

508
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:37,935
So he planted drugs
in your apartment?

509
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,105
But--no, no!
Forget about the drugs.

510
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,324
The point is, is that he

511
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,776
is the one
behind this witch hunt.

512
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:50,281
Sebastian called your boss.
He's worried about you.

513
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,200
No, no!

514
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:54,836
He wasn't worried
about me.

515
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:57,255
He's trying
to discredit me!

516
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,323
Don't you see
what he's doing?

517
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,542
What I see is that you
have tested positive for opiates.

518
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:03,010
I see that you have been
lying to me,

519
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:05,663
and I see that you have been
stealing from me!

520
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,267
I can explain that.

521
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,719
Every person that stands
where you're standing now

522
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,604
says the same thing.

523
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,890
Dad...
The DUI,

524
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,609
the paranoia about Blood,
you're looking like hell.

525
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:23,981
You got a problem, Laurel.

526
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,583
No.

527
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,818
It's addiction.
No!

528
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,071
It runs in the family.

529
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,909
You can't pin it
on Sebastian Blood.

530
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,545
Daddy, please,
you have to believe me!

531
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:41,249
Please!

532
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,967
Please.

533
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,104
I don't, baby.

534
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,908
No!

535
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,577
No!

536
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,851
How is she?

537
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,070
I don't know.

538
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:05,356
I don't know
anything anymore.

539
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:10,657
I'll--I'll get her home.

540
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:15,763
Thanks.

541
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:26,506
Anthony?

542
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,023
Are you there?

543
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,890
I'm here, Sara.

544
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:32,910
I was hoping that
you would reach out to me.

545
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,528
Are you alone?

546
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,697
Yes.

547
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:43,069
Are you all right?

548
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:44,871
You're not hurt,
are you?

549
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:48,375
Do you even care?
You were going to shoot me.

550
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:49,710
No.

551
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:51,211
No, Sara.

552
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,680
I swear, you were
never in danger, I swear.

553
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:57,417
So it's ok because you were just
planning on murdering Shado?

554
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:02,255
Her name was Shado.

555
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:03,807
Yes.

556
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,643
And you killed her,
Anthony.

557
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,863
And I'm going to have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

558
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:13,116
I never set out to hurt anyone.

559
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,570
I started this quest
to save people;

560
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,539
to save the human race.

561
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,608
I know.

562
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,495
Sara.

563
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,781
I know you think
that this ship rescued you

564
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:31,584
when you were stranded at sea.

565
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:35,588
The truth is...

566
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:42,228
You rescued me.

567
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,631
But now the darkness,
it's threatening me again.

568
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:50,236
I need you, Sara.

569
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:52,405
Please.

570
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,807
Save me.

571
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,876
How's he doing?

572
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:15,211
The damage done to his head
and lower abdomen is severe.

573
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:16,313
He ruptured his spleen

574
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,338
and he has massive
swelling in his brain.

575
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,351
Thankfully, he got medical
attention quickly,

576
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:23,553
so he's got a shot.

577
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,772
You did a good thing
here, Roy.

578
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:33,646
What happened to you out there?

579
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,847
I don't know.

580
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:36,849
We nearly killed this guy.

581
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:38,451
Roy?

582
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:39,652
Are you ok?

583
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:41,154
What are you
doing here?

584
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,688
Sin called me.
Why did you do that?

585
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,042
Because she was
worried about you.

586
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:48,711
Who is that guy?

587
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:50,713
He was my date.

588
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:52,865
We put him there.

589
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:55,668
You--you did this?

590
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,470
Just drop it.
Please.

591
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:59,305
Roy, something
is happening to you.

592
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:01,057
I'm not judging you.

593
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,176
I'm not angry with you.

594
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,345
I'm on your side.

595
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,313
I just want to help you.

596
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:10,233
You can't.

597
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:14,053
I--I got to go.

598
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:16,356
Roy!

599
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,565
You haven't
said much.

600
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,717
Are you working
on your lecture?

601
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,719
No lecture.

602
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,689
I suppose you think I was wrong
about Sebastian, too, though.

603
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:52,091
I think...

604
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:54,861
that you have everyone fooled,

605
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:58,931
because you want people to think
that none of this gets to you.

606
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,867
And that you don't need
anyone's help.

607
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:02,768
I don't!

608
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,071
Except, I know you!

609
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:10,793
This isn't you.

610
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,949
What happened
to no lectures?

611
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:23,956
I just--I need
a glass of water.

612
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:26,776
Do you mind?

613
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,778
Please.

614
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,449
Leave him. He's not important.

615
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,517
Hello, Laurel.

616
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,258
Laurel.

617
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,658
It's me.

618
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:09,992
Someone
came after Laurel.

619
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,160
Do you know
where they took her?

620
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,379
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

621
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:44,893
If that mask
is supposed to scare me...

622
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,579
All that it's doing

623
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:50,366
is confirming what I've already
known for a while now.

624
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,788
You're one sick
son of a bitch, Sebastian.

625
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,239
30,000 years ago,

626
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,575
masks invested
their wearer with authority,

627
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,210
like a God.

628
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,578
You're insane.

629
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,547
I'm not the one
making drug-addled,

630
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,300
unsubstantiated accusations
against Starling's favorite son.

631
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,186
If I can find out
the truth,

632
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,054
then others can, too.

633
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,723
You found out
nothing.

634
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:16,725
You know nothing.

635
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,929
Get away from her!

636
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:25,618
Or I will put...You...Down.

637
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,019
And to think,

638
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,937
a few short months ago,

639
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,990
you were trying
to arrest him.

640
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,876
You wanted me here.
I'm here.

641
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,546
Let...Her...Go.

642
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:42,585
No, I think
she should witness this.

643
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,957
Aaah!

644
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:40,442
Take off his mask.

645
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:43,979
I need to see.

646
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:34,382
Sweetheart.

647
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:37,152
Are you all right?

648
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:38,320
Yeah.

649
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:42,191
Looks like Daily
was behind this whole thing.

650
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:45,494
Son of a bitch volunteered for the raid
that got Hilton killed.

651
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,362
And we found
the accelerant that he used

652
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:50,416
to torch the Langford Institute
in his apartment.

653
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,735
I thought it was Sebastian.

654
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:57,372
I was so sure.

655
00:35:57,374 --> 00:35:59,458
Yeah.

656
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,244
Well, that's the thing about
the booze and the pills.

657
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:05,380
You know, same thing
that dulls your pain...

658
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:08,067
clouds the judgment.

659
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:17,559
Can we have a minute?

660
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,098
Yeah.

661
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:30,656
Are you here to say,
I told you so?

662
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,541
We're dropping
the possession charges

663
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:34,960
and you won't be charged
in Daily's shooting.

664
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:36,728
It was clearly self defense.

665
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,949
You don't seem
that thrilled for me.

666
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,252
Are you going
to look me in the eye

667
00:36:43,254 --> 00:36:45,954
and tell me you don't have
a substance abuse problem?

668
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:52,978
The DA's office has
a generous severance package.

669
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,629
Wait!

670
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,682
Wait, let me explain
to DA Spencer.

671
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,350
I can--I can tell
her everything!

672
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:00,269
This isn't coming
from Spencer, Laurel.

673
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:01,770
This is me.

674
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:04,472
I'm the one that hired you.

675
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,825
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,827
But you're done.

677
00:37:17,954 --> 00:37:21,406
Did Laurel
really shoot him?

678
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,592
She saved my life.

679
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:26,011
That's a good thing,
Oliver.

680
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:29,047
You ok?

681
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,140
She really had me believing
that Sebastian Blood

682
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:33,303
was a criminal mastermind,

683
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:37,139
and the only reason
that I nearly believed her

684
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,975
was because it was Laurel.

685
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:44,346
I do have a blind spot
where she's concerned.

686
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:48,217
Not anymore.

687
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:51,203
Certainly know how
to talk yourself out of a victory.

688
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:52,988
It's a gift.

689
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,756
Take the win, man.

690
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:56,658
Daily's dead, you destroyed
the serum.

691
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,628
It's over.

692
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:06,134
No, it isn't.

693
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,676
Hey.

694
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:17,312
Slow night?

695
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,317
Something I said?

696
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,036
Don't take it
personally.

697
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:27,522
He won't even make
eye contact with me.

698
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,942
Something happen?

699
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:34,363
He put someone
in the hospital.

700
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:37,833
He's a little stingy
with the details,

701
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:40,902
but.... You should have
seen this guy.

702
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,788
I don't understand
how any human

703
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,257
could have done that
to another.

704
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:48,743
Each day, he becomes
more and more like somebody

705
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,713
I don't even know.

706
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:54,049
He won't even
listen to me.

707
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:56,251
I know someone
he'll listen to.

708
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:00,305
Sara,
are you still there?

709
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:02,257
When you first
found me,

710
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:05,360
I felt like
you were my savior.

711
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:07,145
And letting me
into your work,

712
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:09,114
I felt like I was a part
of something bigger.

713
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,066
You are, Sara.

714
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:13,101
It was only because
I didn't want to see

715
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,870
what you were
really doing.

716
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:17,406
I mean, what you did
to those people on the boat,

717
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:21,793
and how you tortured
them for science...

718
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:25,580
How I was glad
that I wasn't one of them.

719
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,752
But now...

720
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:35,957
I'd rather be dead
than keep being a part of this.

721
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:40,395
You ungrateful bitch.

722
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:43,315
You think you know
what torture is?

723
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:45,767
You have no idea.

724
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:48,970
But I will show you.
I am going to hunt you down.

725
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,939
Both of you,
and I will show--

726
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,429
Let's go find Slade.

727
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,467
It's done.

728
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:20,668
They think
it was all Daily.

729
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,689
He sacrificed himself
for our cause.

730
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,640
A good start.

731
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:28,009
But the magnitude
of your negligence

732
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:31,897
requires a greater sacrifice.

733
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:43,992
Your incompetence has now
cost four lives, alderman.

734
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:48,130
Fail me again...

735
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:51,199
and yours will be
the fifth.

736
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:04,813
If that was supposed to
go through my other leg,

737
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,681
you missed.

738
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,818
You seem to be
healing pretty well.

739
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,359
You're stronger,
you heal faster,

740
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:19,778
but you're not in control.

741
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,730
The serum that you were
exposed to, it changes your body

742
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:25,283
but it also warps your mind.

743
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:27,235
How do you know
so much about it?

744
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,736
I've seen it before.

745
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:30,288
It twists men.

746
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:34,242
Turns them into
someone they don't recognize.

747
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:38,046
Someone dangerous.

748
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,882
Maybe you should put
another arrow through me.

749
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:43,018
This time through my heart.

750
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,771
There's another
way, Roy.

751
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,556
I can teach you...

752
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:50,976
to control
your new ability.

753
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:54,112
And to control
yourself.

754
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:56,415
Let me help you.

755
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:02,087
When do we start?

756
