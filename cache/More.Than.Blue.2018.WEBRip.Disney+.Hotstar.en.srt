1
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:29,628
"No love for the losers"

2
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,988
"When love is over"

3
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:47,118
"Morning bound train"

4
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:52,148
"Thoughts are having
a tug-of-war"

5
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:56,148
"A lonely path"

6
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:59,148
"making the babe weep"

7
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:03,428
"How the stunned kitty
make up to it"

8
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,308
"Scenaries that flashing by"

9
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:11,508
"how unwillingly to let it go"

10
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:16,468
"babe would become a passenger"

11
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:19,948
So Tung

12
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,028
Do you like it?

13
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,868
The lyrics are done an hour ago

14
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:23,948
Hot and fresh

15
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:26,028
Jonny made the tune pretty catchy

16
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:27,908
The market can use
a song with a fuss

17
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:29,628
Well, that's true

18
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:32,188
But we invested a lot
to work it in the web series

19
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,148
If the song doesn't go viral

20
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,428
It's GG for our company

21
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,588
She is a natural born diva

22
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:39,868
the fans will buy
whatever she performs

23
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:40,948
Is that so?

24
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,628
-What are you worrying about?
-"How deep is babe's love"

25
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,668
Just wait for
the money to pour in

26
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:48,518
"scared the pants off"

27
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:50,388
Hold on a second

28
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:52,388
This is what I am worried about

29
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,518
Amanda

30
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:55,148
The lyrics

31
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,588
I can't really relate to it

32
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:58,468
Babe

33
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:00,428
scared the pants off

34
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,068
How should I sing it?

35
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:05,388
A-Lin, if we don't
do the recording now

36
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,518
it would be too late
for the mixing

37
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:08,388
Just give it a try

38
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:09,908
Ok

39
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,958
I am not doing it
You can sing the song on your own

40
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,348
Hey, babe

41
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:14,428
Uh no, A-Lin

42
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:15,548
I am a natural born diva

43
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:17,868
A-Lin

44
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,628
Can you do me this favor?

45
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,548
I would like to help

46
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:26,588
But I just can't sing it
with my emotions

47
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,028
I know

48
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,228
These phrases are
very popular on the internet

49
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:31,628
But they are totally unrelated

50
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,028
to the tone of the song

51
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,388
How am I supposed to convey that?

52
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:37,188
Excuse me

53
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,308
What?

54
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:39,988
There is a song in my phone

55
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,828
It has not been published yet
I wonder if you can use it

56
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,188
No need

57
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:44,628
Play it, Hsiao-Yu,
I want to hear it

58
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,748
Sure

59
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:53,628
"I don't envy the sun"

60
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:59,508
"it can't illuminate your past"

61
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,068
"there are certain darkness"

62
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:04,708
"in both of us"

63
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:06,108
What is the title of the song?

64
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,268
The lyrics are well-written too

65
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:11,988
The song is called
A Kind of Sorrow

66
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,668
Maybe we can hire him
to write the lyrics

67
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:15,988
so the song would
still have a chance

68
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,748
Who wrote the lyrics?

69
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:19,388
I have no idea

70
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,508
A friend of mine,
A-Pang gave it to me

71
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,588
Take me to him now

72
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,748
"If there is no need to speak up"

73
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:28,548
"then there is no need to"

74
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:31,188
"hide"

75
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,148
A-Pang

76
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,068
Hsiao-Yu What brings you here?

77
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,148
Hi, I am Amanda

78
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,468
A-Lin's manager

79
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:45,628
A-Lin

80
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,868
The A-Lin?

81
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:47,988
Hi, how are you?

82
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:49,148
I am A-Lin

83
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,548
Here, come in please

84
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:51,828
Coffee on the house

85
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:53,158
Close the door for me, Hsiao-Yu

86
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:55,598
A-Pang

87
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,948
Do you know the lyric writer?

88
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,388
There is a song from our company

89
00:03:58,478 --> 00:03:59,548
We would like to
hire him to write the lyrics

90
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:00,628
I do

91
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,708
She is called Cream

92
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:04,598
The Cream that
did Face-to-face Breakup?

93
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,228
Yuan-Yuan. Yuan-Yuan Sung

94
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:08,548
Do you have
her contact information?

95
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,548
Line, WeChat, or facebook?

96
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,348
No one can reach her now

97
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,508
Or anyone she knew?

98
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:16,598
Like the one that sang this Demo

99
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,788
He could probably reach her

100
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:19,268
The singer is Che-Kai Chang

101
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:20,948
Che-Kai Chang

102
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:23,598
Does he know Yuan-Yuan Sung?

103
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:24,668
Yes, he does

104
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:26,348
They fell in love
with each other before

105
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:27,908
Great

106
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:29,508
Can you give me his phone number?

107
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,598
Please

108
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,388
This is really important

109
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:33,788
I need to find him no matter what

110
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,988
He passed away

111
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,308
He's dead

112
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,428
I remember it now

113
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,598
Che-Kai is K

114
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:47,868
We worked in
the same record company

115
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,268
When I first joined the company

116
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:52,478
I met him once

117
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,748
then later he left the company

118
00:04:58,038 --> 00:04:59,108
So it was him

119
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,788
It's really much too sudden

120
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:13,508
"More than Blue"

121
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:15,108
The story of Che-Kai Chang

122
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,748
began when he was 16 years old

123
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:22,108
His family left him that year

124
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:25,428
He began living on his own

125
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,908
in the old house that was piled

126
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,588
with his father's heirlooms

127
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,428
that he was
too frustrated to organize

128
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:42,268
He kept everything
to himself back then

129
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:46,428
as if he was destined to be alone

130
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,548
as if living itself
is a painful thing

131
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:09,468
Until the day he met her

132
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:27,388
Eh

133
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:28,508
My treat

134
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,308
What are you doing?

135
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:34,988
You're smoking?

136
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,868
-Hey
-What class are you from?

137
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:45,188
How dare you smoke in school?

138
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:47,308
No, ma'am it wasn't me

139
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:48,428
Get up

140
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,708
-There's always student like you
-Ma'am

141
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:52,068
-breaking the rules
-Don't grab my hair, ma'am

142
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,148
-with no discipline
-it hurts

143
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:54,228
No shame and manners

144
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:57,068
When Che-Kai Chang
first met Yuan-Yuan Sung

145
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:58,268
it's love at first sight

146
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,508
I asked him how can it
be love at first sight

147
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,828
since he didn't
even introduce himself

148
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,028
He said

149
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,428
If love can be explained

150
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:10,068
no one in the world
would suffer from it

151
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:14,388
Eh

152
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,908
Let's go home together

153
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:18,508
Hey

154
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:19,588
I got a minor demerit
because of you

155
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,148
Don't be a square

156
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,588
It's just a minor demerit

157
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,828
I'll repay you with
comics and instant noodle

158
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:24,988
Let's go

159
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,228
-Instant noodle
-that's right

160
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,548
-Three cups please
-you sure can eat

161
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:29,148
extra meet, egg, and vegetables

162
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:32,748
Since that day

163
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,788
Yuan-Yuan Sung
has entered my life

164
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,468
and changed it too

165
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,588
Her free spirit

166
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,188
Her cheerful personality

167
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,428
Che-Kai Chang

168
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,068
opens up my heart

169
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,228
Which college?

170
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,868
-The same one
-What?

171
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:54,748
We got into the same college

172
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:58,868
Stop it!

173
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:01,108
We decided to
celebrate our birthdays

174
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:02,628
Happy Birthday

175
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,228
Let's go

176
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:19,518
Wait

177
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,428
We have a lot in common

178
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:29,308
Enjoy reading comic books

179
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,028
Enjoy eating instant noodles

180
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,108
The one who loses will pay

181
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:35,308
Why are we competing over this?

182
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:38,348
Oh Che-Kai Chang,
you are so generous

183
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:40,348
taking me to Kyoto
for graduation photos

184
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,108
It costs you a lot right?

185
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,228
There are cherry blossoms

186
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,878
-You're so dramatic
-How nice of you

187
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,468
Ok, look over here

188
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,548
300 dollars for the Kyoto shot

189
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:52,828
I thought it's 150, master

190
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:53,948
There's two of you

191
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:55,028
Look over here

192
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,828
-I just looked the other way
-It's all right

193
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,348
I will count to three

194
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:00,428
one two

195
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:01,948
that's 600 dollars

196
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,188
That's a rip off

197
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:04,588
Here comes the best one

198
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:05,668
She likes challenges

199
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,428
And I

200
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,108
like to do
the challenges with her

201
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,758
Hurry

202
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,268
We both enjoy
eating popcicles in winter

203
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,548
We like the rain

204
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:19,188
like the seasons that we share

205
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:23,188
We became inseparable
with each other

206
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,188
You live alone?

207
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:43,548
Since I was 16
I started living alone

208
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:49,188
Here

209
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,148
Here, clothes for you

210
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,028
Oh, right

211
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:05,988
I can't change with
you being here

212
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:07,548
Go away

213
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,948
You're drenched, go dry it off

214
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,308
No peeking

215
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,948
-I won't peek
-Turn around

216
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:19,948
-Eh
-Fine

217
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,068
Childish

218
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:22,988
No peeking

219
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,758
I am watching you

220
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,388
I am not peeking

221
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:32,908
That's more comfortable

222
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,108
Eh

223
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,588
I should move in with you

224
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,228
This is a big house

225
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:04,868
I

226
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,028
I am used to living alone

227
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:12,948
I am alone

228
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:27,628
Get up. Look at the hours.
Stop sleeping

229
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,308
-Stop sleeping!
-Since that day,

230
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:31,428
Cream moved in here

231
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:32,988
Wake up!

232
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,548
She opened up a window for me

233
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:38,308
a window that
trapped me in loneliness

234
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,388
She dispels my sadness

235
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,188
and let me realize

236
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:46,388
after all

237
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,028
I deserve to
have someone here for me

238
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,068
after all

239
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,988
when people get
used to loneliness

240
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,788
that is much sadder
than sadness itself

241
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:03,308
Che-Kai Chang

242
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,348
I don't like the sound of it

243
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:06,548
Let me give you a new name

244
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:09,108
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,788
You should be called K

246
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:13,268
-K
-Right

247
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,148
That's a nickname,
not a proper name

248
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,948
I will just call you K anyway

249
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,308
so it will be your name

250
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:20,828
Why K then?

251
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,908
Well because I am Cream
As in cream from ice cream

252
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,268
Then why are you Cream?

253
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:25,748
because I like to eat ice cream

254
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:26,828
You like to eat ice cream

255
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:28,508
then you should be called
ice cream Why just Cream?

256
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:29,628
Cream is buttermilk

257
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,108
It means milk

258
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:32,188
milk

259
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:35,508
Where are you looking at?

260
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:37,508
Your boobs

261
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:38,948
Cream from Ice Cream

262
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,228
There's no milk in cream

263
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,068
-You're talking nonsense
-Fine, Cream

264
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,468
Cream

265
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:45,548
K

266
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,068
Eh

267
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:57,788
They said that people
with Roman feet

268
00:13:57,908 --> 00:13:59,308
their moms would live longer

269
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,628
What's Roman feet?

270
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:04,708
Like yours

271
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,188
Thumb of the foot is longer

272
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:11,828
That's not right

273
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:15,868
My parents died
in a car accident together

274
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,588
She didn't live longer

275
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,068
But my mom is still alive

276
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,308
She left you when you're a kid

277
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,908
She is not in your life anymore

278
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:30,108
That doesn't count

279
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,588
Or maybe I don't have Roman feet

280
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:37,228
Check it out for me

281
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,348
Don't block the movie

282
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:39,428
Come on, check it out for me

283
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:40,668
Do you think it's Roman feet

284
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:41,828
You're really annoying

285
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:44,788
-It stinks
-that hurts

286
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,108
I am warning you

287
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,028
If you dare to die before me

288
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,908
you are so dead you hear me

289
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,668
Stop interrupting the movie

290
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,188
It's really sad

291
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,948
Are you watching it or not?

292
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:06,668
I cherish the moment
I spent with her

293
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:09,508
but just like a prisoner
sitting in a cell

294
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:12,468
when one fell in love

295
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:13,788
it is hard to get out

296
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,948
I fall in love with Cream

297
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,308
I love everything about her

298
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,868
I want to live with her forever

299
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,628
But I can't

300
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:29,828
I wouldn't dare to
tell her my feelings either

301
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:32,468
because

302
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,788
something inside me is about
to act up the cancer cells

303
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,708
"Ambition"

304
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,788
K

305
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:06,988
Che-Kai

306
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:08,748
Che-Kai Chang

307
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:10,068
You stayed up all night
in the office again

308
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,068
You want the money
more than your life

309
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:13,388
Keep it down

310
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:16,628
You are sweating
all over in your sleep

311
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,748
Did I?

312
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:18,828
Yes

313
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:20,828
Your clothes are all soaked

314
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,988
I am probably too tired

315
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,108
One of the employee Lisa

316
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,588
is getting married

317
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:26,668
I have to work
so hard to cover her

318
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:28,828
I beg your pardon

319
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:31,228
You suddenly took a leave
for a week last time

320
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:32,628
I nearly passed out
trying to cover you

321
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,788
Lady

322
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:36,748
I really did pass out

323
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,508
Right

324
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:41,428
Seriously, Cream can't

325
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:42,668
know about this

326
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,148
I know

327
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,228
You have already reminded me

328
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:46,428
the thrid time

329
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,598
You swear?

330
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:49,788
I swear

331
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:50,988
Ok?

332
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,188
-Thanks.
-Hello.

333
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:54,228
-Go home already
-I am not finished

334
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:56,908
-Health comes first
-No problem, I am really healthy

335
00:16:56,988 --> 00:17:00,318
Hello

336
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:02,708
Hi, I am Lisa

337
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,838
Hi

338
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:05,318
Hi, I am Amanda

339
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,388
I start working today

340
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,468
Looking forward
to working with you

341
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,948
Hi I am Che-Kai Chang,
just call me K

342
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,078
Hi, K

343
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:13,028
I am a manager
I am managing Feng-Yi now

344
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,228
Hi, I am Feng-Yi

345
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,548
What do you think?Do you like it?

346
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,228
Very well. You coached him well

347
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,318
Thank you, K

348
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,388
Looking forward
to working with you

349
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:21,628
Ok, we should get going

350
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,078
Sure, keep up the good work

351
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,078
-Sorry to bother you
-Thank you for your time

352
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,148
That's too fake

353
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:28,348
Didn't your father
school you as a kid?

354
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,028
Hey

355
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:35,228
Say hi to Bonnie

356
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:37,908
-Hi
-K

357
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,148
Bonnie's new style

358
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:40,598
How is it? Looks great right?

359
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,788
Hi, K

360
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,348
Bonnie is the Galaxy idol

361
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,748
Supernova pretty kitty

362
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:47,428
I think it's pretty good

363
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:48,548
Not bad

364
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,468
Sorry, Chi
Can you turn off the music first?

365
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:53,348
Let me introduce you

366
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:54,788
This is my talent manager

367
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:56,748
-A-Pang
-Hi, K

368
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,028
Hi

369
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,948
Chi
Let's talk in the conference room

370
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,838
-Good
-This way

371
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:09,788
"You don't have to speak"

372
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,988
"Just meow with me together"

373
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:13,468
"Meow Meow Meow Meow"

374
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,548
"Bonnie hug"

375
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,788
"You are the one I rely on"

376
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,228
"Kitty bomb Bomb Bomb"

377
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:20,318
Time out

378
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,108
Bonnie

379
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,788
It's all right

380
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,188
You did good at the beginning

381
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:26,318
Very subtle

382
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,788
Don't try to yell
at the high pitch part

383
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:28,868
Your throat might get hurt

384
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:29,988
Try it later

385
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,948
Use your strength from the belly
Hold your bottom

386
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,948
-Ok
-She can do it

387
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,318
Ok, go on

388
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:38,668
"Meow Meow Meow Meow"

389
00:18:38,748 --> 00:18:40,628
"Bonnie Hug"

390
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,108
"You are the one I rely on"

391
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,348
"Kitty bomb Bomb Bomb"

392
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,508
Hold on

393
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:48,838
Bonnie wants to change
You are the one I rely on

394
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,188
into You are my eternity

395
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:51,268
Is that all right?

396
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:52,348
Sure

397
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:54,318
Bonnie can do whatever you like

398
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:55,548
What are you doing?

399
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:58,228
Come on, Bonnie likes it
to be more romantic

400
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,868
What's so romantic
about eternity?

401
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,598
It has pink bubbles

402
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,228
What pink bubbles?

403
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,948
Eternity is not
the theme of this song

404
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:06,028
Why are you acting like this?

405
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:07,148
Yeah, why are you
acting like this?

406
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,318
It's none of your business anyway

407
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:09,988
This song is given
to Bonnie by Chi

408
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:12,078
Bonnie can do
whatever she likes to it

409
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:13,598
Chi, look at her

410
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:15,668
Lady she wants to change
one line of the lyrics

411
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:17,148
You are making
too big a deal out of it

412
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,748
You have no right
to tell her what to do

413
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:20,348
Who said I have
no right to speak up?

414
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,468
No, I mean her

415
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:23,318
I wrote the lyrics
Why don't I have the right?

416
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:24,388
Eh

417
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:25,868
Bonnie and Chi
said that you can't

418
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:27,548
then you can't

419
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:28,948
Who the hell are you?

420
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,668
You really want to change it?

421
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:31,748
Yes

422
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:32,838
Bonnie wants to change it

423
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,028
I will change it for you

424
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:37,988
Sorry about that

425
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,348
-Let me ask you again
-I told you I want to change it

426
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,838
You has-been lyric writer

427
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,388
What did you say?
Calling me a has-been?

428
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,148
Hey

429
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:46,228
Stop it

430
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,028
Chi said stop it

431
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,348
You can hit me if you want

432
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:50,468
Stop it

433
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,668
You really hit me

434
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:13,838
Is there anyone home?

435
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:19,838
Don't cry

436
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:20,948
It's fine

437
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:22,908
It's fine

438
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:24,348
Here

439
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:25,948
What's with the veil?

440
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,108
Are you getting married?

441
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:32,108
Wow, your face

442
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:34,548
Why are you injured?

443
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,078
Some kitty girl Bonnie

444
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,748
She wanted to
change my lyrics to eternity

445
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:42,748
Eternity sounds so low

446
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:44,548
Then?

447
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:47,028
Then I beat her

448
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,468
You're too impulsive

449
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,108
I have straighten it out for you

450
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,668
Chi still appreciates your talent

451
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,508
but you scratched
his favorite kitty girl's face

452
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:01,788
You should apologize to her

453
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:03,708
I don't want to

454
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:05,388
My face is screwed too

455
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:06,628
Look at my faceand my hands

456
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,838
I got hurt as well

457
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,388
You hear me?

458
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:15,948
I will go apologize

459
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:21,148
How is the lyrics working?

460
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:22,268
I am not in the mood

461
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,268
Throwing a fit now?

462
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:26,948
Come on

463
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:28,108
I am here, I can work it with you

464
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,308
I don't like eternity

465
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,428
Then throw it away

466
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:37,348
Change it

467
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,188
Next life

468
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,268
I can accept next life

469
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,148
Next life

470
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,548
Next life

471
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:47,868
It feels like an appointment

472
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:49,708
but eternity is not

473
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,988
if one of the two people is gone

474
00:21:52,068 --> 00:21:53,068
it won't be eternity

475
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,388
Then tell me

476
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:58,988
If there is a next life

477
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:01,868
what would you want to be

478
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:04,388
A human being

479
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:05,588
Who wouldn't want
to be a human being?

480
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:06,868
You can be a pig

481
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:08,788
Fine, seriously

482
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,228
If I have a next life,
I want to be

483
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:15,148
a ring

484
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:16,748
Ring?

485
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:18,268
or maybe

486
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:19,508
Hold on a second

487
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:26,628
Ok, go

488
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:29,468
Hi, I am K

489
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:32,108
If I have a next life

490
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,388
I want to be

491
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:34,748
a ring

492
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,148
a pair of glasses

493
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:39,308
a bed

494
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:40,428
and

495
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,188
a notebook

496
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:43,988
Why would you want
to be these things?

497
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,068
So I can accompany you

498
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:47,948
You're so gross

499
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:49,068
Gross, how?

500
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:50,828
The lyrics can be a bit cheeky

501
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:52,468
Right?

502
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,468
Isn't it supposed to be eternity?

503
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:06,708
Why didn't you change it?

504
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:13,468
I changed it to the next life

505
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:15,508
is it ok?

506
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:18,908
Actually

507
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:20,668
it doesn't sound that bad

508
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:24,068
Glasses, key, comforter and ring

509
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:25,588
can be expressed as companionship

510
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:26,988
Bonnie likes it

511
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:28,548
The word eternity

512
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,308
if one person is gone

513
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:31,508
it would not sustain

514
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:32,948
But the next life

515
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:34,628
it sounds like

516
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:35,708
an appointment

517
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,108
if one person is gone first

518
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:38,628
they could still have
a chance to meet

519
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,468
Bonnie thinks it's so romantic

520
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:43,868
That is exactly
what I want to express

521
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:44,988
You totally get it

522
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,068
Really?

523
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:47,188
Then Bonnie has the potential

524
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,068
to become a great lyric writer?

525
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:50,148
I think you are very talented

526
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,308
It should be a piece of cake

527
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,228
Wonderful. Bonnie happy

528
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,428
Meow meow

529
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:57,188
About the incident last time

530
00:23:57,988 --> 00:23:58,988
I am really sorry

531
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,068
It's fine

532
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,788
Bonnie doesn't mind
Bonnie forgives you

533
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:05,068
Bonnie knows that
writing is very difficult

534
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:07,708
But Yuan-Yuan
you are doing really well

535
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:09,068
You can call me Cream

536
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,188
Ok, Cream

537
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:11,988
You can call Bonnie Hui-Chun Chen

538
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:13,108
Who?

539
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:14,988
Hui-Chun Chen

540
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:17,708
Oh your real name?

541
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,028
Bonnie is Hui-Chun Chen

542
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,068
Hui-Chun Chen is Bonnie

543
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:24,628
In order to make Bonnie
a famous lyric writer

544
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,708
Starting today

545
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:28,588
Bonnie Hui-Chun Chen will be
friends with Cream

546
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:29,668
Good

547
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:32,428
Bonnie's friend
is me Chi's friend

548
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:33,908
Chi and Bonnie's friend

549
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,148
is me A-Pang's friend

550
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,708
Chi and Bonnie and
A-Pang's friend

551
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:39,588
is our friend

552
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:51,308
"Cat's tears are like pearls"

553
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:55,428
Ok, this love song

554
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:56,788
will be the first hit

555
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:57,988
What do you guys think?

556
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:10,508
What's wrong?

557
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:11,828
What about Kitty Bomb?

558
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,588
I think Kitty Bomb
is a good first hit

559
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:16,068
Starting with a fast song
will be more impressive

560
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,908
and Kitty is great for
singing and dancing

561
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:21,988
The song is pretty cute

562
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,388
Cream wrote the lyrics?

563
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:26,308
-Hmm
-Yeah

564
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:27,588
Haven't seen her work for a while

565
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,548
But I still think the lyrics
are a bit off tone

566
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:34,308
But Bonnie likes it very much

567
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:36,508
Bonnie wants to
stay ahead in the trend

568
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:37,588
Meow

569
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:40,028
You are way
too ahead in the trend

570
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,148
I think the song is great

571
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,228
You definitely need
a Music Video for it

572
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,468
-It has strong visuals
-Music Video?

573
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:46,588
If the MV is well-produced

574
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:47,988
I think the young people
would love it

575
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:50,148
Fine

576
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:52,308
Then this song
will be the title track

577
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:55,308
What about the second one?

578
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,748
Anyone has any ideas?

579
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:58,268
-I do
-Huh

580
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,748
Bonnie is my babe

581
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,028
We need MV for
every song at all costs

582
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:05,628
Bonnie is so touched

583
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,868
Bonnie is going to cry

584
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:08,948
Huh

585
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,028
You're crying

586
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:11,908
This can be a promotion material

587
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,108
What?

588
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:20,028
It's the title track

589
00:26:21,228 --> 00:26:22,268
Yes!

590
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:27,308
Does it mean that because of you
my song get to be the title track

591
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,308
I told you many times

592
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,668
It is your own skills that did it

593
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:32,748
Whether Face-to-face Breakup
or this song, ok?

594
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:33,868
I have nothing to do with it

595
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:35,668
I think so too

596
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:37,428
-How dare you hit me
-You hit me first

597
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,748
So? So what if I hit you?

598
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:43,308
This is embarassing

599
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,548
Did Bonnie

600
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:48,908
come at a bad time?

601
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:50,108
Not at all

602
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:51,268
Oh

603
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:55,388
-Uh, what do you want?
-To celebrate

604
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:56,468
Cream's song

605
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,868
has just been picked
as the title track

606
00:26:57,948 --> 00:26:58,948
Let's go to the karaoke

607
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:00,068
Bonnie's treat

608
00:27:01,468 --> 00:27:02,548
Sure

609
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,188
Che-Kai

610
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:07,788
I suggest you quit your job

611
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:09,148
and rest yourself at home

612
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,028
So my disease

613
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:15,308
is starting to break out

614
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:16,868
Your symptoms

615
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:18,268
are the same as your dad's

616
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:21,388
A bone marrow transplant
is your best hope

617
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,908
Take his blood pressure again

618
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:25,108
Ok

619
00:27:36,508 --> 00:27:37,708
Tell me

620
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,948
Do you have anything

621
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:41,868
you want to say to me?

622
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:43,988
What's going on?

623
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,628
Looking for inspirations
for songs again?

624
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,788
Don't avoid my question

625
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:47,948
Come on

626
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:49,108
I mean

627
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,308
What am I supposed to say?

628
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,268
Just tell me things that

629
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:55,508
you would like to say

630
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:56,988
but you can only say it

631
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:58,948
when there is no one around you

632
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,028
Why am I so good looking?

633
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:05,468
Not that

634
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:07,828
It's like the things

635
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,148
you would confess
to a priest in a church

636
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,468
those kind of things

637
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:14,428
Well, then I am not
going to tell you

638
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:15,548
you are not a priest

639
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:16,628
Don't avoid my question

640
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,828
I want to hear it

641
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:22,868
Well, there is one

642
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:26,828
I like you

643
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,228
I knew that already

644
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,308
Then why are you asking me?

645
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:38,228
I have another question then

646
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:39,788
You certainly have a lot to ask

647
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:40,948
So what?

648
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:42,788
What is your wish?

649
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:47,188
To live long and happy

650
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:52,468
Not this kind of wish

651
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:54,588
I mean

652
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:55,708
that

653
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,788
Is there anything
you really want to do

654
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:58,948
but you haven't done it yet

655
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,748
Yes

656
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:07,228
I wish you

657
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:10,308
can find a nice guy
and get married

658
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:15,668
I thought you said you like me

659
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:18,228
You can marry me

660
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:21,628
I am not a nice guy

661
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,828
What is the definition
of a nice guy?

662
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:29,188
Got a job

663
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,268
Some money

664
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:32,068
Who is kind and loves his family

665
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:34,188
and

666
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,228
with good health

667
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:42,908
What's that supposed to mean?

668
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,148
Nothing really

669
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:47,548
Have your meal,
I thought you're hungry

670
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:48,748
Eh

671
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:49,948
This is really delicious

672
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:51,788
You don't want it,
I'll have it all

673
00:29:58,628 --> 00:29:59,628
Cream

674
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,348
Do you like K?

675
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:06,428
Why would you say
that all of sudden?

676
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,468
Because Bonnie can tell

677
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:10,068
there is something
going on with you and K

678
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:11,228
Have you told him that before?

679
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:13,908
We are not like that

680
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:15,828
I don't get it

681
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:18,588
We live together

682
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:20,188
but we are not together

683
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,508
So roomates but not a couple

684
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,108
How is that possible?

685
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,868
Well, some people still do that

686
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:27,468
That's what we are doing

687
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:28,668
I am used to it

688
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:30,228
How long have you been like this?

689
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,588
Ever since high school

690
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:34,748
over a decade I think

691
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:36,068
10 years?

692
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,068
So what are you doing
in those 10 years?

693
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,228
What can we do at home?

694
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,988
Doing laundries,
cooking, having dinners

695
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:43,468
No sex?

696
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,348
We...

697
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:50,388
How many times?

698
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,348
5 times

699
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:55,788
Only 5 times in 10 years?

700
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:57,148
No

701
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:58,668
0.5

702
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:00,548
What does that mean?

703
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:04,028
It means only kisses and hugs

704
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:05,108
but not that

705
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:06,188
What?

706
00:31:06,268 --> 00:31:07,748
We are not in a relationship

707
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:09,908
So

708
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,388
You don't like him?

709
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,268
It's not that I don't like him

710
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,068
but we are not in a relationship

711
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,028
I don't want it
to be too complicated

712
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:21,788
Cream, you want
to keep living like this?

713
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:24,068
Don't you want
to tell him how you feels?

714
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:26,428
Actually

715
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,828
He told me to marry someone nice

716
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:31,828
Is he sick?

717
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,708
I am telling you

718
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:36,068
Men are so bitchy

719
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,228
You should
go find someone and be with him

720
00:31:38,308 --> 00:31:39,508
If he finds out about it

721
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:41,228
he will try to win you back

722
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:42,388
Trust me

723
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,268
Behind you

724
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,508
Go forward

725
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,388
Gordon is about to puke

726
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:02,988
Who is that guy?

727
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,348
The vampire?

728
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:05,868
That's one of
my high school classmates

729
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:06,988
He is a dentist

730
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:10,308
Lisa, I'll go grab a drink

731
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:11,428
Sure

732
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:19,628
Are you done with that?

733
00:32:22,188 --> 00:32:23,188
You don't have a glass?

734
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:25,188
Hmm. Can I borrow it?

735
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:36,308
Thanks

736
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:45,188
This doesn't count
as a kiss right?

737
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:47,268
Does it?

738
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:49,228
Huh

739
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,988
Nevermind Just a kiss

740
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:53,068
Thanks

741
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:58,868
Gordon hit it

742
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:09,788
"Yu-Hsien Yang"

743
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,188
You have great dental health

744
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:13,348
Nothing serious

745
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:21,428
Doctor Yang

746
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:24,148
We have seen
each other 2 days in a row

747
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,068
We kissed in the first time

748
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,148
and the second time

749
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:28,748
I showed you inside
my mouth for cavity

750
00:33:28,828 --> 00:33:30,668
What are we doing
for the thrid time?

751
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,308
I want to know you more

752
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:42,028
Do you want to do that?

753
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:50,508
Eh

754
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,108
I found a nice guy

755
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,758
Huh? What did you say?

756
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,828
can find a nice guy
and get married

757
00:33:58,908 --> 00:34:00,428
He is a dentist

758
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,238
Lisa's high school classmate

759
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,428
That's great

760
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:48,628
I've been waiting for
the transplant for 7 years

761
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,548
How much time do I have now?

762
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:52,668
You need to come back regularly

763
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,468
If the status is stable

764
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:56,308
you can still live
on with your life

765
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:58,068
Uncle Te

766
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:00,028
Stop trying to comfort me

767
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:03,718
My disease

768
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:05,388
is in accelerated
phase now right?

769
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,108
How long do I have left?

770
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,028
Probably

771
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:15,718
no more than a year

772
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,718
Chi I want you to
investigate someone for me

773
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:32,428
Investigate

774
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,238
That is my specialty

775
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:35,758
But K

776
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:37,908
I want you to do me a favor too

777
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,468
This is a token of my gratitude

778
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:49,268
Bonnie's promotion
is counting on you

779
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,428
Dental implant
for Mr. Chen at 16:30 34, 35

780
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:54,588
Turn on the CT for me

781
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,908
and get the other
equipments ready

782
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:56,988
-Ok
-Thanks

783
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:02,268
This is for you

784
00:36:02,948 --> 00:36:03,988
Thank you

785
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:07,068
I wrote it

786
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,348
You are a lyric writer

787
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:10,468
Hmm

788
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:11,628
That's impressive

789
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:15,308
What are you doing after work?

790
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:16,758
Nothing

791
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,108
Buy me a drink

792
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,028
I got you a CD

793
00:36:25,788 --> 00:36:27,268
Come on

794
00:36:27,348 --> 00:36:28,508
You have nothing to do, right?

795
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:29,788
Can we have a drink?

796
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:32,828
Can I ask you something?

797
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:34,908
Guys don't like
to tell the truth, right?

798
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,108
Like when you
clearly love someone

799
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,068
but would just
say you like her a bit

800
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,348
How hard is it to tell the truth?

801
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:49,868
You have no
romance before, right?

802
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,028
I am engaged

803
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:03,388
Can I borrow it?

804
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,428
Only two things would
happen in a romance

805
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,868
one would be like this

806
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,868
falling deep in love

807
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:35,988
the other one

808
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:39,388
is dredging up the sunken love

809
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,908
You said you want to know me more

810
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:50,028
Hmm

811
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,238
Why me?

812
00:37:54,268 --> 00:37:56,198
If love can be explained

813
00:37:56,268 --> 00:37:58,348
no one in the world
would suffer from it

814
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,148
One more shot

815
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:06,388
Yu-Hsien Yang

816
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:07,588
His family does
business for a living

817
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,198
He graduated top in
the class of a dental school

818
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:10,988
Now runs a clinic with his friend

819
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:12,108
No criminal records

820
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:13,468
No vices

821
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:15,628
No special diseases
with perfect health

822
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:17,828
He has a fiancee called Cindy

823
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,788
Simply put, a winner in life

824
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:21,148
So the one next to him

825
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,268
that is his fiancee

826
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:23,348
Hmm

827
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,988
She is
a professional photographer

828
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:27,068
often works with celebrities

829
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:30,468
Then the promotion
photos of Bonnie

830
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:31,758
we should get her to do it

831
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,028
Yes, I will arrange
that right away

832
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:40,788
It's so cold

833
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:47,428
You went drinking?

834
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:49,068
Hmm

835
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:55,388
With him?

836
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:56,508
Hmm

837
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:00,348
What do you like about him?

838
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:05,588
I have no idea

839
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,468
No idea

840
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,268
No idea

841
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,668
Stop talking, go to sleep

842
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,628
Right, Left

843
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,468
-K
-The hands should be like this?

844
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,028
Cindy is quite a gal

845
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:42,868
An honest man like Yu-Hsien Yang

846
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,668
would have no idea
that his fiancee

847
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,068
is such
a popular figure out there

848
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,308
Give us some more time

849
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:50,948
I can prove it with videos

850
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:53,828
No need

851
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,198
This is enough

852
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,668
-Ok
-K

853
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:58,388
Why is loving someone

854
00:39:58,468 --> 00:39:59,468
so freaking hard?

855
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:04,508
Chi What do you mean?

856
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:09,068
Hey hey hey

857
00:40:09,148 --> 00:40:10,268
Watch your hands,
you want trouble?

858
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:11,348
Chi

859
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:12,628
He is teaching Bonnie
how to dance

860
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:13,788
What are you doing?

861
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,868
Just give your instructions
No need to grope her ass

862
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:17,508
I can dance too,
maybe I should do it

863
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:18,588
How can you teach Bonnie?

864
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:19,718
You are not professional

865
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:20,868
Stay out of this

866
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:21,988
What do you mean professional?

867
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,148
I am good at cutting people up

868
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:24,758
-He is great
-Should I cut him up now?

869
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:26,788
He sucks,
I can hire someone better

870
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:28,908
Bonnie don't care, I want Michael

871
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:30,988
-But...
-I don't care!

872
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:32,828
Chi, K passed out

873
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:41,988
Where's Che-Kai Chang?

874
00:40:49,468 --> 00:40:50,718
Why did you pass out suddenly?

875
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:54,548
I don't know

876
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:56,028
The doctor told me that

877
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:57,758
I have Congenital anemia

878
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:00,468
Congenital anemia

879
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:01,548
Hmm

880
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:08,148
The reason he passed out is

881
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:09,238
that he was too exhausted

882
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:11,908
and lacking a bit of calcium

883
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,428
Usually, this kind of anemia

884
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:15,308
would not affect your daily life

885
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:17,268
Miss you don't have to worry

886
00:41:18,788 --> 00:41:19,908
I'm fine

887
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:21,548
Really, it's fine

888
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:22,628
Lacking calcium

889
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,238
That's weird,
I eat the same with you everyday

890
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:26,468
Why am I not lacking calcium?

891
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:28,628
Because you eat more than I do

892
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:31,068
Eh You are the gobbling monster

893
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,948
Anyway, stop working
overtime from now on

894
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,388
And take your calcium everyday

895
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:38,508
It'll be fine

896
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:39,628
Fine

897
00:41:43,388 --> 00:41:44,508
Help me store this to the archive

898
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:45,988
Ok Doc

899
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,068
Your mail

900
00:41:47,148 --> 00:41:48,148
Oh

901
00:42:20,388 --> 00:42:21,628
What's up?

902
00:42:33,628 --> 00:42:34,868
Take a look at this

903
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:51,908
Shit

904
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:55,868
Premarital investigation?

905
00:42:56,388 --> 00:42:57,788
I didn't do the investigation

906
00:42:58,268 --> 00:42:59,758
someone sent it to me

907
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:02,988
We have been together for 6 years

908
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:04,068
I funded you
to become a photographer

909
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,758
I want to give you a home

910
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,068
And this is how you repay me?

911
00:43:10,308 --> 00:43:11,548
Yu-Hsien

912
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,388
You are the one
that wants to get married

913
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,508
We have been through
this a long time ago

914
00:43:18,308 --> 00:43:20,148
Love is never my first priority

915
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:21,268
Even if it's not
your first priority

916
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,388
doesn't mean
you can take it for granted

917
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:23,788
I don't want
to explain everything to you

918
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:27,508
As long as
I have a clear conscience

919
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:28,588
in the relationships
that I want to cherish

920
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:30,388
You're saying that
to avoid any consequences

921
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:33,428
I need creative works

922
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:35,548
So being with me
is for your creation

923
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:40,748
That is a very mean thing to say

924
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,548
So the things you did isn't mean?

925
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:48,028
Does anyone that can fund you

926
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:49,108
is your love interest?

927
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:52,988
What is that supposed to mean?

928
00:43:53,748 --> 00:43:55,068
Then what are your actions mean?

929
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,428
I won't deny what I did

930
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:11,308
If you just want my apology

931
00:44:12,588 --> 00:44:13,908
I can tell you I am sorry

932
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:44,708
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

933
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:45,828
You have no right
to investigate me

934
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:47,068
I can find
the surveillance camera

935
00:44:47,148 --> 00:44:48,468
even without an address

936
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:51,068
Hey What are you doing?

937
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:52,828
That's enough

938
00:44:52,908 --> 00:44:53,988
Let go of me

939
00:44:55,308 --> 00:44:56,348
And

940
00:44:57,188 --> 00:44:58,868
My life doesn't concern you

941
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:02,068
Hey Give me that

942
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:05,388
Sorry

943
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:07,588
I am just hoping

944
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:09,028
You can break up
with Yu-Hsien Yang

945
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:11,988
-Hey!
-Are you nuts?

946
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,268
I don't know what is your purpose

947
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:17,708
But if you dare
come bothering me again

948
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,348
I will get back to you
with all I got

949
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:35,228
Che-Kai Chang

950
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:37,468
K

951
00:45:39,188 --> 00:45:41,108
I don't know
what you are thinking

952
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:42,788
investigating that crazy woman

953
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,268
And ask her to call off
her engagement

954
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:45,348
What do you want?

955
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:46,908
Are you insane?

956
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:48,388
I am insane

957
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:50,388
I just want Cream
to find a nice guy

958
00:45:51,508 --> 00:45:52,668
How old is she?

959
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:53,828
Can't she find it on her own?

960
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:56,828
Look at me

961
00:45:56,908 --> 00:45:58,308
Do you think she can?

962
00:45:59,908 --> 00:46:01,628
She can't, really can't

963
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:03,228
And I am really
running out of time

964
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:04,908
What do you mean out of time?

965
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:06,548
I am running out of time

966
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,988
If Bonnie's record
hits the market

967
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:11,508
and sells less than
10 thousand copies

968
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:13,748
Chi is going to fire me

969
00:46:13,828 --> 00:46:14,948
A-Pang

970
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:17,108
I would have nothing
to worry about then

971
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:18,188
A-Pang

972
00:46:19,308 --> 00:46:20,708
You are just going
to lose the job

973
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,108
or are you going to die

974
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,868
Look at me K

975
00:46:26,948 --> 00:46:29,428
If I didn't show up in time

976
00:46:29,508 --> 00:46:30,948
you were really going to die

977
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:34,348
A-Pang

978
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:36,868
Thank you so much

979
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:39,548
What a bro

980
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:41,468
My man Come on

981
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,348
Fine Tell you what

982
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:51,388
I will go to Cindy
with you tomorrow

983
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:52,508
to negotiate with her

984
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:53,588
What'd you say?

985
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:10,828
Remember to close the door

986
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:20,228
Do you want a drink?

987
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:22,548
No

988
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:28,188
Hey, don't touch the flower

989
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:29,868
I have been shooting it
for a week

990
00:47:30,468 --> 00:47:31,508
Oh

991
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,348
Eh

992
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:39,948
What are you guys doing here?

993
00:47:51,228 --> 00:47:52,588
This is to compensate you

994
00:47:54,068 --> 00:47:56,428
I hope you can leave
Yu-Hsien Yang

995
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:58,668
and call off
the engagement with him

996
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,588
Did you see my studio?

997
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:14,108
He funded me to do
the photography

998
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:16,548
I can get where I am now

999
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,228
I have to give him
half the credits

1000
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:19,708
If he didn't make a move first

1001
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:21,508
I won't leave him

1002
00:48:22,548 --> 00:48:23,788
You understand?

1003
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,148
I still want to ask you

1004
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,348
I have less than a year to live

1005
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:38,748
I am dying

1006
00:48:47,068 --> 00:48:48,188
"Diagnosis:
chronic myelogenous leukemia"

1007
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:52,268
First year in high school,
my dad died of cancer

1008
00:48:53,828 --> 00:48:55,428
Unfortunately

1009
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:58,268
When my mom knew
I got leukemia too

1010
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:01,348
She couldn't take it anymore

1011
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:03,588
She gave me some money

1012
00:49:03,668 --> 00:49:05,028
The savings

1013
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,308
and left me

1014
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,748
should support you to adulthood

1015
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:10,948
Take good care of yourself

1016
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,188
Don't leave me

1017
00:49:13,188 --> 00:49:14,388
Mom

1018
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:27,188
In my loneliest moment

1019
00:49:28,428 --> 00:49:30,268
Cream appeared in my life

1020
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,028
and she became my family

1021
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:34,508
and the one I love the dearest

1022
00:49:34,588 --> 00:49:35,628
One Two

1023
00:49:38,668 --> 00:49:39,708
Here

1024
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:41,308
Birthday gift

1025
00:49:41,388 --> 00:49:43,108
You like rainy days, right?

1026
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:47,428
A black cloud for you

1027
00:49:47,508 --> 00:49:49,948
Thanks, happy birthday to you too

1028
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,748
But today is not my birthday

1029
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:54,028
How many birthdays do you want?

1030
00:49:54,108 --> 00:49:55,548
From now on this day
will be your birthday

1031
00:49:57,388 --> 00:50:00,548
but my leukemia has entered
the accelerated phase

1032
00:50:00,628 --> 00:50:01,708
I can't tell Cream

1033
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:03,188
what happened to me

1034
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:05,948
She might not do what my mom did

1035
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:07,948
just leave me because of
pain and fear

1036
00:50:08,908 --> 00:50:09,908
but I don't know

1037
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:11,068
what she would do

1038
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,708
and a blow like this

1039
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:16,588
I don't want her to take it

1040
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,708
I am really sorry

1041
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:23,108
my love one falls for your fiance

1042
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:24,628
I am begging you

1043
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:27,748
K

1044
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:36,908
Sorry

1045
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:38,388
I am probably pushing it too hard

1046
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:40,148
This is my business card

1047
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:43,028
If you change your mind

1048
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:44,268
Please contact me right away

1049
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,388
I can agree to your deal

1050
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:58,988
only under one condition

1051
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:02,668
I promise you

1052
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:10,228
I am going to present
an exhibition

1053
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:11,588
the theme is about
Death and Deadline

1054
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:14,148
Since you said
you are going to die

1055
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:15,908
then you should be my model

1056
00:51:15,988 --> 00:51:17,348
let me take your photos

1057
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:19,668
as my work for the exhibition

1058
00:51:21,508 --> 00:51:23,108
I will go break up with him

1059
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:24,708
You're being ridiculous

1060
00:51:24,788 --> 00:51:26,428
Anyway, this is my deal

1061
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:27,748
take it or leave it

1062
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:31,788
Let's go K

1063
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:47,228
Night snack time

1064
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,708
Why aren't you eating?

1065
00:51:54,788 --> 00:51:55,828
The food is getting cold

1066
00:51:58,068 --> 00:51:59,268
Well

1067
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:00,988
It just occurred to me

1068
00:52:01,068 --> 00:52:02,868
She never brought me
night snack before

1069
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:06,668
Don't think too much about it

1070
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,788
Just eat

1071
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,668
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

1072
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:12,588
Text me and let me know
I will bring it to you again

1073
00:52:23,068 --> 00:52:24,748
"You don't have to speak"

1074
00:52:24,828 --> 00:52:26,668
"Just meow with me together"

1075
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:27,948
"Meow meow meow meow"

1076
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:29,948
"Bonnie hug"

1077
00:52:30,028 --> 00:52:31,228
"Next life again"

1078
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:32,428
Bonnie did great

1079
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:34,988
"Bonnie Bonnie Meow meow hug hug"

1080
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,188
Shoot the smoke

1081
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:38,108
-Where is the smoke?
-"You are here with me"

1082
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,068
"Never let me go!"

1083
00:52:40,148 --> 00:52:41,308
"Dance"

1084
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:43,188
"Bonnie hug"

1085
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,948
"Spring blossom loves
the summer firework"

1086
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,348
-You're here
-Hmm

1087
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:47,908
Let me introduce you

1088
00:52:47,988 --> 00:52:49,428
This is the dentist
I told you about

1089
00:52:49,508 --> 00:52:51,028
-Yu-Hsien Yang
-Hi

1090
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:52,428
Hi, I'm Che-Kai Chang

1091
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:53,508
Welcome

1092
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,108
I know, I heard lot about
you from Yuan-Yuan

1093
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,388
Ok, cut

1094
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:57,628
Director, is it ok?

1095
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,668
-Great, give me five
-Give me five

1096
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:00,948
Chi

1097
00:53:01,028 --> 00:53:02,028
How did Bonnie do?

1098
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:04,148
-Pretty good?
-Very good

1099
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,188
Hey Cream

1100
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:09,348
What do you think
about Bonnie's dance?

1101
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:10,428
-Very good
-Very good

1102
00:53:10,508 --> 00:53:12,028
Oh well, that's for sure

1103
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:14,748
Bonnie is an international star

1104
00:53:16,348 --> 00:53:17,428
And you are?

1105
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:18,628
-Oh
-Mei

1106
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,308
He is the dentist
I told you about

1107
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:21,988
Hi

1108
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:23,868
So you are Yu-Hsien Yang

1109
00:53:23,948 --> 00:53:24,988
Yes

1110
00:53:26,948 --> 00:53:28,148
Not bad

1111
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:29,468
Meow

1112
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:31,108
-Don't frighten him
-Here, reshoot it

1113
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:33,308
Are you ok?
You don't look too good

1114
00:53:33,428 --> 00:53:35,348
-I'm fine
-Have a drink after work?

1115
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:37,188
Fine by me

1116
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:38,268
Let's go together

1117
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:41,308
I need to get back to the office

1118
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:42,508
What a bummer

1119
00:53:42,588 --> 00:53:43,668
Don't you need to
look after the scene?

1120
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:45,388
The scene

1121
00:53:45,468 --> 00:53:46,468
Mei can handle it

1122
00:53:47,108 --> 00:53:48,828
Sure, I got it here

1123
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:50,028
Just go do your thing

1124
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,628
-Where is Bonnie?
-I am here

1125
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,028
-I should go now
-Bye

1126
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:56,708
-Go for it
-Ok, everyone standby

1127
00:53:56,788 --> 00:53:57,908
Are you coming?

1128
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:59,068
I really have to work

1129
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,308
-Nice to meet you
-Music go

1130
00:54:00,388 --> 00:54:01,548
Me too

1131
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:03,508
-Bye
-Bye

1132
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:06,308
Chi, I'm leaving

1133
00:54:06,948 --> 00:54:08,268
Ready to roll

1134
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:10,828
Okay, action!

1135
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:13,668
Ok, start the snow now

1136
00:54:15,668 --> 00:54:16,748
"Meow meow meow meow"

1137
00:54:16,828 --> 00:54:18,748
"Bonnie hug"

1138
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:20,148
"Next life again"

1139
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:21,988
"Kitty bomb Bomb Bomb"

1140
00:54:22,068 --> 00:54:25,428
"Bonnie Bonnie Meow meow hug hug"

1141
00:54:25,508 --> 00:54:26,868
"You are here with me"

1142
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:29,028
"Never let me go!"

1143
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,108
When did you first meet
Yuan-Yuan Sung?

1144
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:43,508
High school freshman year

1145
00:54:43,588 --> 00:54:45,868
What was she like in high school?

1146
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:47,148
Cute

1147
00:54:47,228 --> 00:54:48,308
Outgoing

1148
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:49,708
Pretty eyes

1149
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:51,388
You have the chance
to cherish her now

1150
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:52,828
and be with her

1151
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:53,948
Why don't you want to?

1152
00:54:56,348 --> 00:54:57,668
Why don't you tell her the truth?

1153
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:00,708
What kind of truth?

1154
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,108
Do you know the pain?

1155
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:05,148
We lost our family
when we were 16

1156
00:55:05,228 --> 00:55:07,028
I am her only family now

1157
00:55:08,108 --> 00:55:09,308
What do you want me to say?

1158
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:10,948
And what then if I said it

1159
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:13,148
To let her suffer once more

1160
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:15,388
Even if I told her

1161
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:17,348
you think she can live with that?

1162
00:55:19,228 --> 00:55:21,188
We can all learn to live with it

1163
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:23,428
You think too less of yourself

1164
00:55:23,508 --> 00:55:25,868
Yuan-Yuan Sung can be
tougher than you think

1165
00:55:27,748 --> 00:55:29,308
Perhaps

1166
00:55:29,388 --> 00:55:31,588
I am surprised you
have male chauvinism

1167
00:55:31,668 --> 00:55:33,228
You are just finding
her a cash cow

1168
00:55:33,868 --> 00:55:34,868
Right

1169
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:35,948
I am finding her a cash cow

1170
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:37,388
So what?

1171
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:38,948
I suck, I am selfish

1172
00:55:40,828 --> 00:55:42,108
I am her only family now

1173
00:55:43,228 --> 00:55:44,588
I wish her to be well

1174
00:55:44,668 --> 00:55:45,748
Ok?

1175
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:52,188
I can leave Yang like you asked

1176
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:54,708
but you need to promise me
one more thing

1177
00:55:55,748 --> 00:55:56,868
What is that?

1178
00:55:56,948 --> 00:55:58,948
I get all your belongings
after you died

1179
00:56:00,348 --> 00:56:01,428
No way

1180
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:05,148
All my belongings go to Cream

1181
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:08,828
You see the paradox here?

1182
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,428
You want her to forget you

1183
00:56:10,508 --> 00:56:12,108
Then you should leave her nothing

1184
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:40,428
Sorry

1185
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,108
Let's break up

1186
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,588
All these days we been together

1187
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,308
I know you don't
love me that much

1188
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,988
Maybe it's like what you said

1189
00:56:57,188 --> 00:56:58,948
Love is not that important to you

1190
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:03,388
But I just can't let it go

1191
00:57:05,828 --> 00:57:07,188
But you do now

1192
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:10,908
I think it's time
for me to wake up

1193
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,068
It's about those photos I guess

1194
00:57:16,148 --> 00:57:18,148
We are not together
for love anymore

1195
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:20,308
It's just a habit now

1196
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:22,788
So you're saying

1197
00:57:24,468 --> 00:57:26,108
The 6 years we had
is not about love

1198
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,308
Anyway, since you
want to break up

1199
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,068
I am here to break up
with you too

1200
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:35,468
I met a girl recently

1201
00:57:36,868 --> 00:57:38,548
but that has nothing
to do with us

1202
00:57:41,108 --> 00:57:42,268
Hope you will be happy

1203
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:01,428
I broke up with her

1204
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:10,868
Then I have something

1205
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:12,148
I want to tell you

1206
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:18,748
When I was a freshman
in high school

1207
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,348
I was in the middle of a class

1208
00:58:20,988 --> 00:58:22,228
the teacher rushed in suddenly

1209
00:58:22,308 --> 00:58:24,308
and spoke to me with a weird look

1210
00:58:24,788 --> 00:58:26,188
You should go to the hospital now

1211
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,188
I asked him why

1212
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:29,908
He said it's because

1213
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:31,748
your parents and your sister

1214
00:58:32,948 --> 00:58:34,388
had a car crash in a tunnel

1215
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:35,588
and were all dead

1216
00:58:38,988 --> 00:58:40,028
Afterwards

1217
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:42,948
I started living with K

1218
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:48,108
K

1219
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,188
K is Che-Kai Chang

1220
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:52,668
I thought his name is too tacky

1221
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:53,948
so I called him K

1222
00:58:55,588 --> 00:58:56,988
He is really a weird guy

1223
00:58:58,508 --> 00:58:59,988
When we're at home

1224
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:01,628
he's like a mother

1225
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:04,748
when he's at work,
he's like a father

1226
00:59:06,788 --> 00:59:09,668
when he comforts me
he's like a brother

1227
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,348
sometimes

1228
00:59:12,428 --> 00:59:13,508
he's like a lover

1229
00:59:16,748 --> 00:59:18,068
but when
the important moment comes

1230
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:20,828
he acts like a fool

1231
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:29,508
Why are you so honest to me?

1232
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,068
Because you didn't lie to me

1233
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:33,428
so I don't want to lie to you

1234
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:36,188
and I am

1235
00:59:36,868 --> 00:59:38,108
afraid you would mind

1236
00:59:41,268 --> 00:59:42,388
You mean K

1237
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:44,668
Hmm

1238
00:59:45,588 --> 00:59:46,868
Not at all

1239
00:59:53,308 --> 00:59:54,548
Good then

1240
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:39,028
A gift for Christmas

1241
01:00:41,148 --> 01:00:42,388
Thanks

1242
01:01:03,908 --> 01:01:05,308
Why do people get married?

1243
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:07,828
Married?

1244
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:08,908
Hmm

1245
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:12,468
So when you're old

1246
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:14,228
or you need someone
to take care of you

1247
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:15,348
he can accompany you

1248
01:01:15,428 --> 01:01:16,668
no reason asked

1249
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:18,508
-Then I don't want to get married
-What?

1250
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:20,108
You have been with me since 16

1251
01:01:20,188 --> 01:01:21,668
You're going to leave me
when I get old?

1252
01:01:22,868 --> 01:01:23,908
You idiot

1253
01:01:23,988 --> 01:01:25,268
That's different

1254
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,588
Marriage is marriage

1255
01:01:26,668 --> 01:01:28,068
It needs a ceremony

1256
01:01:28,148 --> 01:01:29,188
to become a marriage

1257
01:01:29,828 --> 01:01:30,868
Is it?

1258
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:31,988
Yes

1259
01:01:34,468 --> 01:01:35,748
Nevermind
I don't want to think about it

1260
01:01:36,308 --> 01:01:37,508
I am so hungry

1261
01:01:37,588 --> 01:01:38,588
Is there anything to eat?

1262
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:42,308
I don't want to eat this

1263
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:43,508
This is really good

1264
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:45,508
-It really is
-No

1265
01:01:45,588 --> 01:01:46,668
I'll go make some noodles

1266
01:01:48,268 --> 01:01:49,468
Not for you

1267
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:58,108
"I don't envy the sun"

1268
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:04,148
"it can't illuminate your past"

1269
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,548
"there are certain darkness"

1270
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:12,228
"in both of us"

1271
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:14,668
Be merrier

1272
01:02:14,748 --> 01:02:15,868
You are making it too sad

1273
01:02:15,948 --> 01:02:17,348
It's a sad song already

1274
01:02:17,428 --> 01:02:21,068
"I am too jealous of the time"

1275
01:02:21,148 --> 01:02:22,948
That's too cheerful

1276
01:02:23,028 --> 01:02:27,788
"it can leave in poise"

1277
01:02:27,868 --> 01:02:29,868
"If there is no need to speak up"

1278
01:02:29,948 --> 01:02:30,948
Do it right

1279
01:02:31,028 --> 01:02:35,668
"then there is no need to hide"

1280
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,348
I think you are singing it

1281
01:02:41,868 --> 01:02:42,988
a bit careless

1282
01:02:43,068 --> 01:02:44,708
I am singing it very seriously

1283
01:02:45,868 --> 01:02:47,668
What if Bonnie sings
it like you do

1284
01:02:47,748 --> 01:02:49,228
and the new song fails

1285
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:50,428
Wait

1286
01:02:50,828 --> 01:02:52,028
Dear lyric writer

1287
01:02:52,988 --> 01:02:55,508
You should know that I did this
only because you asked me to

1288
01:02:56,508 --> 01:02:57,788
I know, thanks

1289
01:03:01,868 --> 01:03:02,948
Thank you

1290
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:04,308
Taking care of Yuan-Yuan so much

1291
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,628
That should be my line

1292
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,868
Thank you for being there
with her for so long

1293
01:03:08,948 --> 01:03:10,108
You took good care of her

1294
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,588
Then you probably know
that we live together

1295
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:14,868
But make no mistake

1296
01:03:14,948 --> 01:03:16,428
we really are just friends

1297
01:03:16,508 --> 01:03:18,148
Yuan-Yuan told me about it

1298
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:19,668
You two are great friends

1299
01:03:20,388 --> 01:03:22,428
sort of like a family in a sense

1300
01:03:23,348 --> 01:03:25,228
So she asks you to help pick
the wedding dress

1301
01:03:25,308 --> 01:03:26,588
sounds pretty reasonable to me

1302
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:28,828
About the wedding dress, I...

1303
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:30,188
This is what Yuan-Yuan wants

1304
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,708
I want to do as she asks

1305
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:35,348
And this would also be the last

1306
01:03:35,428 --> 01:03:37,108
important thing
you did for Yuan-Yuan

1307
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:39,908
You get what
I am talking about right?

1308
01:03:52,348 --> 01:03:53,628
What do you think?

1309
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,948
Is it pretty?

1310
01:03:55,028 --> 01:03:56,348
It's beyond pretty

1311
01:03:57,428 --> 01:03:59,028
Do the groom like
to try on the suit?

1312
01:04:00,468 --> 01:04:01,788
I am not the groom

1313
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:03,308
It's ok, give it a try

1314
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:04,388
I want to see it

1315
01:04:04,948 --> 01:04:05,988
Go

1316
01:04:07,228 --> 01:04:08,228
Hurry up

1317
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:09,588
-Why would I try it on?
-I want to see it

1318
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:19,028
Very handsome

1319
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:21,188
Come on

1320
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:24,908
It's looks great

1321
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:29,108
How is it?

1322
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:31,108
Let me take a photo for you

1323
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:33,068
Sure

1324
01:04:33,148 --> 01:04:34,228
Ok, look over here

1325
01:04:34,748 --> 01:04:37,108
One two three, cheese

1326
01:04:41,868 --> 01:04:42,948
Wait me here

1327
01:04:43,028 --> 01:04:44,108
I will go put on another dress

1328
01:04:44,988 --> 01:04:46,028
Thanks

1329
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:38,228
I have picked the wedding dress

1330
01:07:38,308 --> 01:07:39,868
I'll send you the photo

1331
01:07:39,948 --> 01:07:41,308
Hey listen

1332
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:43,108
I think my phone is
running out of battery

1333
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:44,228
Later I will

1334
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:53,468
Borrow me

1335
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:04,908
Hello, my phone
ran out of battery

1336
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,148
Hmm

1337
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:07,628
Right

1338
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,508
Ok, I will charge it later

1339
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:11,348
Hmm. Get back to work

1340
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:12,508
I will call you later

1341
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,668
Bye

1342
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:19,958
Where have you been yesterday?

1343
01:08:20,588 --> 01:08:21,998
You left me there by myself

1344
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,468
I felt so awkward

1345
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:25,388
Where did you go?

1346
01:08:28,508 --> 01:08:29,868
Nowhere

1347
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:31,108
What do you mean nowhere?

1348
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,708
Hello?

1349
01:08:33,788 --> 01:08:35,308
Hello, Che-Kai Chang,
are you out?

1350
01:08:36,868 --> 01:08:38,078
What are you doing?

1351
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,468
Why did you answer my phone?

1352
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:41,708
No, I thought it was

1353
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:42,998
Who do you think you are?

1354
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:46,078
This is ridiculous

1355
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,388
The dinner is ready

1356
01:08:53,468 --> 01:08:54,708
Where are you going?

1357
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:56,998
I am going out

1358
01:08:57,078 --> 01:08:59,228
You're dating
that girl on the phone?

1359
01:08:59,308 --> 01:09:00,788
It's none of your business

1360
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:02,588
So do you want
to have the dinner or not?

1361
01:09:02,668 --> 01:09:03,668
No

1362
01:09:06,348 --> 01:09:08,428
You will never have
it once I get married

1363
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:20,708
What are you worrying about?

1364
01:09:20,788 --> 01:09:21,958
She only heard my voice

1365
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:23,468
She can't possibly know who I am

1366
01:09:24,468 --> 01:09:26,268
She knows you are
Yu-Hsien Yang's ex girlfriend

1367
01:09:26,348 --> 01:09:28,038
I don't want to take that risk

1368
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:30,748
They why do you
ask me to call you

1369
01:09:30,828 --> 01:09:32,348
and pretend dating with you

1370
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:33,588
Pretty scheming of you

1371
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,148
I have to let her give up on me

1372
01:09:39,998 --> 01:09:41,188
Floriography

1373
01:09:41,868 --> 01:09:43,748
Everlasting love

1374
01:09:43,828 --> 01:09:45,078
Solitarily powerful

1375
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:51,788
In the next three years

1376
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:53,038
you can help me give her cactus

1377
01:09:58,388 --> 01:09:59,588
This is the last step

1378
01:09:59,668 --> 01:10:00,668
that you are hoping for

1379
01:10:03,348 --> 01:10:04,468
One for each year

1380
01:10:05,628 --> 01:10:06,788
after three years

1381
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:08,958
she won't notice I am gone

1382
01:10:11,038 --> 01:10:12,188
Doing this

1383
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,788
you sure it will
make her happier?

1384
01:10:19,188 --> 01:10:20,228
She will be happy

1385
01:10:21,268 --> 01:10:22,428
if not right now

1386
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:24,428
but in the end she will be

1387
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:30,428
You are dying

1388
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,708
can't you live
it more straightforward

1389
01:10:32,788 --> 01:10:35,188
Cry when you want to
Laugh when you want to

1390
01:10:35,268 --> 01:10:37,828
Get angry when you want to
And eat when you're hungry

1391
01:10:37,908 --> 01:10:39,188
And if you are getting scared

1392
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,428
just call for help

1393
01:10:44,078 --> 01:10:45,788
Something needs
to be said before it's too late

1394
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:46,998
You know?

1395
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:51,388
Or do you want to be
gone without a trace?

1396
01:11:09,148 --> 01:11:10,308
"Sorry"

1397
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,908
"Have you ate?"

1398
01:11:35,038 --> 01:11:36,038
Thanks

1399
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:06,308
"I don't want to
talk to you today"

1400
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:09,958
"Sorry for all what I've done"

1401
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:15,958
"I am sorry too"

1402
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:26,908
"For what?"

1403
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:31,228
"For all what I've done"

1404
01:12:33,628 --> 01:12:37,628
"I love you"

1405
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:53,468
"Hope you will be happy"

1406
01:13:00,188 --> 01:13:01,348
Thanks

1407
01:13:27,788 --> 01:13:29,308
Tell me

1408
01:13:29,388 --> 01:13:30,788
Why do people get married?

1409
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:32,588
So when you are old

1410
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:34,348
or when you need
to be taken care of

1411
01:13:34,428 --> 01:13:36,468
he can accompany you
no reason asked

1412
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:39,348
I thought you said you like me

1413
01:13:39,868 --> 01:13:41,108
You can marry me

1414
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:45,348
I am not a nice guy

1415
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:48,868
Doing this

1416
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,388
will she really be happier?

1417
01:13:53,788 --> 01:13:54,908
She will be happy

1418
01:13:55,908 --> 01:13:57,228
if not right now

1419
01:13:57,998 --> 01:13:59,268
but in the end she will be

1420
01:14:02,548 --> 01:14:04,548
We lost our family since we're 16

1421
01:14:05,388 --> 01:14:06,548
I am her only family

1422
01:14:07,828 --> 01:14:08,868
I hope she will be well

1423
01:14:25,148 --> 01:14:27,038
Or do you want things
to be like this

1424
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:28,708
Leaving no trace

1425
01:14:28,788 --> 01:14:30,388
and just gone from the world

1426
01:14:33,148 --> 01:14:34,308
You think I want to die

1427
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:37,998
You think I want to die like this

1428
01:14:38,868 --> 01:14:40,348
Who wouldn't want
a wonderful life?

1429
01:14:41,348 --> 01:14:42,628
You think it is possible for me

1430
01:14:43,508 --> 01:14:44,828
You think I still have time

1431
01:14:46,108 --> 01:14:47,468
I wish she will be marrying me

1432
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:48,628
Not him

1433
01:14:50,428 --> 01:14:51,788
I wish we can grow old together

1434
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,508
taking care of each other

1435
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:57,188
but it's just an illusion

1436
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:00,078
a sad dream

1437
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:04,868
I don't want to dream anymore

1438
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:15,708
I didn't know K had such a story

1439
01:15:16,748 --> 01:15:17,998
Too bad he's gone

1440
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,788
This is for you, A-Lin

1441
01:15:22,868 --> 01:15:23,958
Thanks

1442
01:15:24,038 --> 01:15:26,788
The last album they collaborated

1443
01:15:26,868 --> 01:15:28,268
Keep this as
a remembrance of them

1444
01:15:31,148 --> 01:15:32,228
Oh right

1445
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:33,428
Let's do the recording tomorrow

1446
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:36,228
-Seriously?
-Yes

1447
01:15:36,308 --> 01:15:37,908
Then I will book the studio

1448
01:15:37,998 --> 01:15:38,998
But

1449
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:40,428
I want to record

1450
01:15:40,508 --> 01:15:42,188
A Kind of Sorrow

1451
01:15:48,588 --> 01:15:50,038
I am home, Yuan-Yuan

1452
01:15:54,788 --> 01:15:55,958
Yuan-Yuan

1453
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:10,748
Yu-Hsien

1454
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:13,748
I am sorry

1455
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:16,228
I am really sorry

1456
01:16:18,628 --> 01:16:19,998
The love between mortals

1457
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:23,148
can't be reached by hands

1458
01:16:24,468 --> 01:16:26,468
be explained by words

1459
01:16:28,508 --> 01:16:30,348
be seen by eyes

1460
01:16:33,268 --> 01:16:34,268
My love

1461
01:16:35,148 --> 01:16:36,628
started from meeting him

1462
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:39,748
and has been in my life

1463
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:42,268
and will never part

1464
01:16:45,588 --> 01:16:47,308
I thought I don't have
to suffer the loss again

1465
01:16:47,388 --> 01:16:48,868
I thought I don't have
to suffer the loss again

1466
01:16:49,998 --> 01:16:51,078
but it didn't occur to me

1467
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,428
from that day on

1468
01:16:53,268 --> 01:16:54,868
K will be leaving me

1469
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:05,508
calling me
a has-been lyric writer

1470
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:07,548
you are the out-of-tune singer

1471
01:17:08,468 --> 01:17:09,958
Meow Meow Meow

1472
01:17:10,038 --> 01:17:11,078
Pig

1473
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:20,908
Kitty's target audience
must all be guys

1474
01:17:20,998 --> 01:17:22,078
Men

1475
01:17:22,148 --> 01:17:24,628
What do men like?

1476
01:17:28,668 --> 01:17:31,308
What is more important for them?

1477
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:53,388
Excuse me

1478
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,468
May I help you?

1479
01:17:54,548 --> 01:17:56,508
What does this mediccation treat?

1480
01:17:58,228 --> 01:17:59,788
Where did this come from?

1481
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:01,908
From my home

1482
01:18:05,868 --> 01:18:07,428
Glivec treats cancer

1483
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:09,148
or leukemia patients

1484
01:18:10,078 --> 01:18:11,668
And that is
a strong dose of painkiller

1485
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,428
Using these two meds together

1486
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:15,748
means he is
in pretty bad condition

1487
01:18:15,828 --> 01:18:16,828
Bye

1488
01:18:16,908 --> 01:18:18,078
-Bye Yuan-Yuan
-Take care of the house

1489
01:18:18,148 --> 01:18:19,308
We are leaving sis

1490
01:18:20,188 --> 01:18:22,108
-Take care of the house
-Bye Yuan-Yuan

1491
01:18:37,868 --> 01:18:38,868
No

1492
01:18:41,078 --> 01:18:42,428
Don't leave me

1493
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:44,428
No

1494
01:18:45,788 --> 01:18:47,188
You can't be here

1495
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:48,268
You can't leave me

1496
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:49,348
Don't!

1497
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:50,428
Don't you leave me

1498
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:53,668
Stop

1499
01:19:04,188 --> 01:19:05,748
Is anyone home?

1500
01:19:08,078 --> 01:19:09,628
I feel sorry for K
to have endured the pain

1501
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,748
What's wrong?

1502
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,268
dealing it all quietly

1503
01:19:13,908 --> 01:19:16,388
-I thank him so much
-If next life exists...

1504
01:19:16,998 --> 01:19:20,078
Thinking about me
even when he's sick

1505
01:19:21,788 --> 01:19:25,348
maybe I can't grow old
with K in this life

1506
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,388
But I look forward
to the next life

1507
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:30,868
that we can meet again then

1508
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,548
That day

1509
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:37,348
The thing I was worried
about has happened

1510
01:19:37,428 --> 01:19:38,998
You really can't tell her

1511
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:40,468
really can't tell her

1512
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:43,668
really can't tell her

1513
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,748
But you need someone
to look after you

1514
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:48,998
I am fine

1515
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:51,308
I can take care of myself

1516
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:55,828
How long you think
you can keep it from her?

1517
01:20:00,148 --> 01:20:01,308
I don't know for how long

1518
01:20:01,868 --> 01:20:03,078
But if she finds out

1519
01:20:03,148 --> 01:20:04,148
everything is over

1520
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:07,468
Before think about other people

1521
01:20:08,628 --> 01:20:10,468
you should think about
yourself first

1522
01:20:10,548 --> 01:20:11,668
I am not important

1523
01:20:11,748 --> 01:20:13,148
But she's different
She is all alone

1524
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:16,868
She needs someone
to be there for her

1525
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:22,308
You are all alone too

1526
01:20:24,748 --> 01:20:25,868
aren't you?

1527
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:42,308
Take good care of yourself.

1528
01:20:42,388 --> 01:20:44,308
The first time I met K

1529
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:46,308
is a month after my family died

1530
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:49,388
Death has taken my family

1531
01:20:50,468 --> 01:20:53,868
But K was abandoned by his family

1532
01:20:56,308 --> 01:20:57,628
That day

1533
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:00,078
he looked pretty sad

1534
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:02,708
and needed a hug more than I do

1535
01:21:05,308 --> 01:21:06,388
From that day on

1536
01:21:07,078 --> 01:21:08,348
I decided to call him K

1537
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:10,868
As for me, I am Cream

1538
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:15,188
After all, two lonely people

1539
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,108
should have a name
feeling less lonely

1540
01:21:19,348 --> 01:21:21,388
You said that K is about to die

1541
01:21:22,108 --> 01:21:23,268
You think

1542
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,668
I should tell him I already knew

1543
01:21:28,348 --> 01:21:30,998
If he didn't want you to know

1544
01:21:32,108 --> 01:21:34,228
he probably has his reasons

1545
01:21:35,268 --> 01:21:37,748
Would expose him now

1546
01:21:37,828 --> 01:21:39,428
make any difference?

1547
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:41,148
I only want K to be happy

1548
01:21:42,108 --> 01:21:43,748
No matter what happened

1549
01:21:43,828 --> 01:21:46,348
I will do anything
to fulfill his wish

1550
01:21:48,748 --> 01:21:50,188
Do you have any wishes?

1551
01:21:51,228 --> 01:21:52,228
I hope you

1552
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:53,828
find a nice guy and get married

1553
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,078
What is the definition
of a nice guy?

1554
01:21:58,468 --> 01:21:59,668
Got a job

1555
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:00,748
some money

1556
01:22:01,548 --> 01:22:04,508
I wanted so bad that
his wish is to be with me

1557
01:22:04,588 --> 01:22:06,868
and with good health

1558
01:22:08,588 --> 01:22:10,668
but for K who is
about to leave me

1559
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:12,548
even though I don't want to

1560
01:22:13,188 --> 01:22:15,148
I will do everything for him

1561
01:22:19,828 --> 01:22:21,628
Who is that guy?

1562
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:22,998
The vampire?

1563
01:22:23,078 --> 01:22:24,428
He is my high school classmate

1564
01:22:24,508 --> 01:22:25,788
He is a dentist

1565
01:22:25,868 --> 01:22:26,958
This doesn't count
as a kiss, right?

1566
01:22:28,078 --> 01:22:29,148
Does it?

1567
01:22:29,228 --> 01:22:30,228
I want to know you more

1568
01:22:31,038 --> 01:22:32,788
I am engaged

1569
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:35,998
Therefore,

1570
01:22:37,228 --> 01:22:39,108
sorry, Yu-Hsien

1571
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:41,868
I used you

1572
01:22:42,998 --> 01:22:44,468
If I am with you

1573
01:22:45,548 --> 01:22:47,508
I think K would be relieved

1574
01:22:49,828 --> 01:22:50,908
Sorry

1575
01:22:52,308 --> 01:22:53,748
I used your kindness for me

1576
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:56,628
Your consideration for me

1577
01:22:58,078 --> 01:23:00,308
I know even
if I am thinking of someone else

1578
01:23:01,588 --> 01:23:02,868
you will still take me in

1579
01:23:05,268 --> 01:23:06,868
Waiting quietly for the time

1580
01:23:08,038 --> 01:23:09,038
to move me

1581
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,348
Why do people get married?

1582
01:23:27,868 --> 01:23:30,668
Because when you are old
or need to be taken care of

1583
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:33,508
he can accompany you
with no reason asked

1584
01:23:35,228 --> 01:23:36,588
Then I won't get married

1585
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:39,078
Marriage needs a ceremony

1586
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:40,148
to be called a marriage

1587
01:23:42,868 --> 01:23:44,508
When can we get married?

1588
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:46,548
If you really love me

1589
01:23:46,628 --> 01:23:48,268
we can do it anytime

1590
01:23:51,348 --> 01:23:52,908
Please forgive me

1591
01:23:54,468 --> 01:23:56,148
My love one is about to die

1592
01:23:57,468 --> 01:23:59,108
I really can't think it
all through

1593
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:13,998
Hi, I am K

1594
01:24:15,388 --> 01:24:17,388
If I have a next life,
I want to be

1595
01:24:18,038 --> 01:24:19,188
a ring

1596
01:24:20,038 --> 01:24:21,228
glasses...

1597
01:24:21,308 --> 01:24:22,708
I shouldn't detest eternity

1598
01:24:22,788 --> 01:24:24,308
bed, and...

1599
01:24:24,828 --> 01:24:26,868
I want to stay beside K forever

1600
01:24:29,628 --> 01:24:31,828
One two Three, cheese

1601
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:37,628
Wait me here

1602
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:38,748
I will go put on another dress

1603
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:40,628
Thanks

1604
01:25:01,108 --> 01:25:02,148
-I will call you back
-Ok

1605
01:25:02,228 --> 01:25:03,998
-Sorry
-It's all right

1606
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:06,508
I am suffering from
the great pain

1607
01:25:08,078 --> 01:25:09,468
I know K is too

1608
01:25:11,828 --> 01:25:13,388
I made a promise to myself

1609
01:25:14,388 --> 01:25:15,868
If he turned around

1610
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,998
I would confess everything to him

1611
01:25:19,038 --> 01:25:20,308
If he turned around

1612
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:23,468
I would give him a big hug

1613
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:51,188
"I love you"

1614
01:25:58,308 --> 01:26:00,388
I wanted to say
I love him out loud

1615
01:26:00,468 --> 01:26:01,958
"Hope you will be happy"

1616
01:26:02,038 --> 01:26:05,908
but I knew I would burst
into tears once I said it

1617
01:26:07,188 --> 01:26:08,588
I couldn't hold on anymore

1618
01:26:11,828 --> 01:26:12,908
Thanks

1619
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,388
Can you do
the wedding rehearsal with me?

1620
01:26:23,188 --> 01:26:24,268
Yuan-Yuan Sung

1621
01:26:25,748 --> 01:26:27,788
for richer or for poorer

1622
01:26:29,308 --> 01:26:31,468
in sickness and in health

1623
01:26:32,628 --> 01:26:33,788
Will you take

1624
01:26:33,868 --> 01:26:35,788
the man in front of you

1625
01:26:35,868 --> 01:26:36,998
to be your husband?

1626
01:26:42,308 --> 01:26:43,468
I do

1627
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:53,108
K and I became really
husband and wife

1628
01:26:54,588 --> 01:26:56,908
the happiest moment
in my dream is fulfilled

1629
01:26:58,388 --> 01:27:00,868
I thought we can

1630
01:27:00,948 --> 01:27:02,868
go on together forever

1631
01:27:04,668 --> 01:27:05,748
But

1632
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:08,708
in the real world

1633
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:11,828
K gives my hand to another man

1634
01:27:28,388 --> 01:27:29,868
The feelings I have for K

1635
01:27:30,868 --> 01:27:32,468
from 16 years old until now

1636
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:39,428
has gone so deep

1637
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,668
it can never be dredged up again

1638
01:27:51,028 --> 01:27:52,068
Yu-Hisen

1639
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:55,148
Thank you for everything you did

1640
01:27:56,828 --> 01:27:58,108
Thank you for loving me

1641
01:28:00,828 --> 01:28:02,028
I have found K

1642
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:05,068
I want to go see him

1643
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:31,388
Hi

1644
01:28:40,228 --> 01:28:41,308
Here you are

1645
01:28:41,388 --> 01:28:42,548
I have been looking
all over for you

1646
01:28:52,108 --> 01:28:53,388
Silly

1647
01:28:53,468 --> 01:28:54,788
You know you're having a fever

1648
01:28:56,828 --> 01:28:57,868
It's fine

1649
01:28:59,988 --> 01:29:01,188
It will be fine soon

1650
01:29:09,508 --> 01:29:10,708
I am warning you

1651
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,548
No more instant noodles
from now on

1652
01:29:14,628 --> 01:29:16,508
no more walking in the rain
no more popsicles

1653
01:29:16,588 --> 01:29:18,388
no more extra shifts,
you hear me?

1654
01:29:21,748 --> 01:29:22,748
K

1655
01:29:26,068 --> 01:29:27,308
I will look after you

1656
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:33,388
We are going to
play baseball together

1657
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:37,508
You need to sing
the terrible demo for me

1658
01:29:40,788 --> 01:29:42,628
Don't leave me alone
in my birthday

1659
01:29:44,668 --> 01:29:46,748
We had a deal when we were 16

1660
01:29:47,988 --> 01:29:49,668
We would spend
the birthdays together

1661
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:55,028
I am right here

1662
01:29:55,108 --> 01:29:58,268
It will be fine

1663
01:30:03,308 --> 01:30:04,428
It's ok

1664
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:09,828
I am here with you

1665
01:30:20,788 --> 01:30:22,028
Feeling better now?

1666
01:30:25,228 --> 01:30:26,268
We're home

1667
01:30:30,948 --> 01:30:32,028
It'll be fine here

1668
01:30:32,868 --> 01:30:34,868
Sorry Cream

1669
01:30:38,148 --> 01:30:39,508
I arranged your romance

1670
01:30:41,188 --> 01:30:42,588
without your approval

1671
01:30:43,388 --> 01:30:44,508
Do you like it?

1672
01:30:50,108 --> 01:30:51,508
Let's take another picture

1673
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:54,428
You asked me once before

1674
01:30:54,508 --> 01:30:55,868
Let's take the photo

1675
01:30:55,948 --> 01:30:57,428
about my wish

1676
01:31:00,348 --> 01:31:01,508
My biggest wish

1677
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:02,588
Here

1678
01:31:02,668 --> 01:31:04,028
is to be with you

1679
01:31:05,228 --> 01:31:06,428
together forever

1680
01:31:08,108 --> 01:31:09,228
K

1681
01:31:09,908 --> 01:31:11,028
and Cream

1682
01:31:14,348 --> 01:31:15,348
We are a family

1683
01:31:19,388 --> 01:31:20,668
We always have been

1684
01:31:20,748 --> 01:31:21,988
Take the photo now

1685
01:32:14,748 --> 01:32:15,748
Long time no see

1686
01:32:18,108 --> 01:32:19,228
Hi

1687
01:32:24,788 --> 01:32:26,028
Why are you here so early?

1688
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,508
I thought you might
get busy later

1689
01:32:31,868 --> 01:32:33,228
Let me show you around

1690
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:35,388
Sure

1691
01:32:37,668 --> 01:32:39,268
Hi, I am K

1692
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:42,748
If I have a next life,
I want to be

1693
01:32:43,428 --> 01:32:44,508
a ring

1694
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:46,908
a pair of glasses

1695
01:32:47,788 --> 01:32:49,388
a bed

1696
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:51,108
I still can't understand now

1697
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:53,628
An idiot like Che-Kai Chang

1698
01:32:54,508 --> 01:32:56,548
really existed in the world

1699
01:32:56,628 --> 01:32:59,908
-You're so disgusted!
-If the lyric...

1700
01:32:59,988 --> 01:33:01,868
If love can be explained

1701
01:33:03,628 --> 01:33:05,828
no one in the world
will suffer from it

1702
01:33:37,068 --> 01:33:38,428
I underestimated love

1703
01:33:41,308 --> 01:33:43,148
I told Che-Kai Chang before

1704
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:46,028
Yuan-Yuan Sung

1705
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,228
She could be tougher
than you think

1706
01:33:50,868 --> 01:33:52,948
She will do fine even
if you're gone

1707
01:33:55,988 --> 01:33:57,348
But I was wrong

1708
01:34:01,148 --> 01:34:02,828
The love in their point of views

1709
01:34:05,068 --> 01:34:07,308
is based on
each other's happiness

1710
01:34:09,148 --> 01:34:14,348
"Then there is no need to hide"

1711
01:34:18,228 --> 01:34:21,308
"a kind of sorrow"

1712
01:34:21,868 --> 01:34:26,908
"is your name staying in my past"

1713
01:34:27,588 --> 01:34:32,708
"breathing with me,
shaping my smile"

1714
01:34:34,188 --> 01:34:37,828
"Can't seem to forget"

1715
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:42,468
K

1716
01:34:42,548 --> 01:34:43,868
Do you know?

1717
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:46,228
After my family left

1718
01:34:47,868 --> 01:34:50,068
I thought happiness
left with them

1719
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:53,828
until I met you

1720
01:34:54,548 --> 01:34:56,588
I realized that two lonely souls

1721
01:34:57,268 --> 01:34:58,628
as long as they can stay
with each other

1722
01:34:59,308 --> 01:35:01,028
can have the right to be happy

1723
01:35:04,108 --> 01:35:07,308
We are destined
to meet each other

1724
01:35:07,388 --> 01:35:09,108
No one can replace that

1725
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:13,988
Do you know?

1726
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:16,148
-What I want...
-What are you doing?

1727
01:35:16,228 --> 01:35:18,708
is not someone that brings me
hot coffee in the cold winter

1728
01:35:20,228 --> 01:35:22,468
but someone who eats popsicles
with me in the rain

1729
01:35:22,548 --> 01:35:23,868
so much so that our teeth hurt

1730
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:26,788
What I want

1731
01:35:26,868 --> 01:35:28,308
is not a guardian

1732
01:35:29,028 --> 01:35:31,028
but someone who would do
the adventures with me

1733
01:35:31,988 --> 01:35:33,068
I don't want anyone else

1734
01:35:34,348 --> 01:35:35,348
I don't want anyone else

1735
01:35:37,908 --> 01:35:38,948
I want you

1736
01:35:40,428 --> 01:35:41,468
K

1737
01:35:42,908 --> 01:35:44,388
Thank you for everything you did

1738
01:35:45,668 --> 01:35:47,588
As long as I get to stay with you

1739
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:53,388
it would be
the happiest thing for me

1740
01:35:53,468 --> 01:35:56,908
"and stay in my past"

1741
01:35:56,988 --> 01:35:57,988
Sorry

1742
01:35:58,068 --> 01:36:00,988
"Can't seem to be forgotten"

1743
01:36:01,068 --> 01:36:02,108
I love you

1744
01:36:04,788 --> 01:36:06,908
"a kind of sorrow"

1745
01:36:06,988 --> 01:36:08,188
"Che-Kai, Yuan-Yuan's grave"

1746
01:36:08,268 --> 01:36:11,868
"Is your determination
to let love become"

1747
01:36:11,948 --> 01:36:15,948
"the light that shines on me"

1748
01:36:16,028 --> 01:36:18,308
"giving me warmth"

1749
01:36:18,948 --> 01:36:21,268
"but not permitting me"

1750
01:36:21,348 --> 01:36:22,348
I keep wondering

1751
01:36:22,868 --> 01:36:24,148
why call me K?

1752
01:36:25,668 --> 01:36:26,708
Because I am Cream

1753
01:36:27,268 --> 01:36:28,388
That's it?

1754
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:32,828
Because

1755
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:35,348
we have no family
since we were kids

1756
01:36:35,428 --> 01:36:36,748
and we live together

1757
01:36:37,228 --> 01:36:38,268
K

1758
01:36:38,348 --> 01:36:39,348
and Cream

1759
01:36:39,428 --> 01:36:41,068
all have the same consonant K

1760
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:43,988
Don't you think it sounds

1761
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:45,788
like a real family?

1762
01:36:45,868 --> 01:36:49,228
"a kind of sorrow"

1763
01:36:49,308 --> 01:36:51,348
"Don't want to be apart"

1764
01:36:51,428 --> 01:36:56,668
"and miss you so back to back
we look around"

1765
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,748
"You are everything"

1766
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:03,268
"you are an eternal figure
in a photo"

1767
01:37:04,468 --> 01:37:07,708
"to be remembered"

1768
01:37:12,668 --> 01:37:14,428
"2002-2015"

1769
01:37:14,508 --> 01:37:18,108
"What we shared together"

1770
01:37:18,188 --> 01:37:20,508
"defines Eternity"
