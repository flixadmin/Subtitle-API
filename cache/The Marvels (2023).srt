Now that we've got that
out of the way, team,

786
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,346
I've been trying to tell you,

787
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,432
I think I know how she's
making the weird jump points.

788

It started glowing really weirdly

791
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,233
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also,

792
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,319
it once traveled me
through space and time,

What you're describing
is a Quantum Band.

there were two of these.

I just did not expect
the other one to be in space.

They're a pair? How do
you have a Quantum Band?

798
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:24,707
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

799
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,084
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.

And then her and Kamala

804

805
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,262

807

It's inscribed on the bangle.

808
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:43,768
If the Kree legends are true,

809
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,603
the Quantum Bands
were used to create

810

in unison to connect the galaxy.

Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,195
MONICA: Here is what we do know.

894
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,322
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

895
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,698
is a system of wormholes

896
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,824
through the space-time continuum

897
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:28,117
aka, jump points,

898
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:30,912
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

899
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,373
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

900
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:34,748
without rupturing the continuum.

901
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,960
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

902
00:46:38,044 --> 00:46:40,254
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

903
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:41,714
and then... earthquake.

904
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:46,218
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

905
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,305
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

906
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,765
Question is, what does she want?

907
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,144
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

908
00:46:54,227 --> 00:46:56,395
so maybe the attack was a warning?

909
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:58,647
So, she could be after
another former colony?

910
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,316
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

911
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,026
CAROL: At one point, the Kree colonized

912
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,612
25% of the galaxy, so...

913
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,698
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

914
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:09,325
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

915
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,451
Why a jump point?

916
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:12,286
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

917
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,621
they're means of transportation.

918
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,456
Every jump point has two sides,

919
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,917
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

920
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,753
-it had to go somewhere, or...
