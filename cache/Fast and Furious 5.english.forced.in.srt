1
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:26,925
Easy, friends.

2
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:28,259
She's with me.

3
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,437
Time for bed little one.

4
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,063
Can I bring him?

5
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,107
Of course.

6
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:28,486
Good night.

7
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,173
Excuse me, sorry.

8
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,051
Does he know?

9
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,403
I'm taking the GT40.

10
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:52,495
This car suits me better.

11
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:09,971
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.

12
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,806
We'll get the car there.

13
00:12:58,436 --> 00:12:59,520
Go after the girl!

14
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,230
Hurry up!

15
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:22,903
The American fugitives killed three
DEA agents during a train robbery...

16
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,906
...Police warn they are armed
and extremely dangerous.

17
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,410
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...

18
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,176
I apologize for
the interruption.

19
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:41,263
Senior Reyes,
may I speak with you?

20
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,849
We've found them.

21
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:13,238
Go that way!

22
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,698
The other two
went over the wall!

23
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:05,074
I told you the skinny
chick had balls.

24
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,702
Looks like she started
the party without us.

25
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:13,833
What's this guy saying?

26
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,460
Ugly is still ugly in
Spanish or in English.

27
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,261
Nobody move!

28
00:48:54,923 --> 00:48:56,008
Explain.

29
00:48:56,091 --> 00:48:57,760
They invaded
the Leblon house.

30
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,470
Who invaded?

31
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:01,930
The men from the train.

32
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:12,483
How much did they take?

33
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,443
They didn't
take anything.

34
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,155
They burned it!

35
00:49:18,447 --> 00:49:20,032
They burned my money?

36
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:23,243
Yes. And said
there's more coming.

37
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:32,336
Okay...

38
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:42,971
Then this...

39
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,308
...is what
we're going to do.

40
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,483
Clean the houses.

41
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:58,987
I want that money
under lock and key...

42
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,532
...within an hour.

43
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:03,826
Understand?

44
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,663
Understood.

45
00:52:25,384 --> 00:52:26,885
Looks like this is going to be a
shorter trip than I thought...

46
00:54:04,816 --> 00:54:05,817
Everything okay?

47
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:06,943
Everything is okay.

48
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:09,696
Who is this Hobbs?
This Federal Agent running around town?

49
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:10,947
Some American cowboy.

50
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:12,699
He's handled.

51
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,409
He killed sixteen
of our men.

52
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,328
Handle him better.

53
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:21,792
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.

54
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:25,545
They won't be a problem.

55
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:56,451
It's all here?
Yes.

56
00:54:57,953 --> 00:54:59,705
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?

57
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,164
Nothing yet.

58
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:04,042
But I have all our
officers searching.

59
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:06,002
Not good enough.

60
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:08,296
Put a price
on their heads.

61
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:09,881
High enough...

62
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:12,592
...to get every pair of eyes in
the city searching for them.

63
00:59:48,576 --> 00:59:50,078
Two to one says
you blow the wrong pipe.

64
00:59:53,707 --> 00:59:55,041
I ain't negative.

65
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,919
I'm just positive
you're going to mess it up.

66
01:00:06,094 --> 01:00:09,764
Next time if there's no
elevator, I'm not coming.

67
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,309
You need to learn
to relax, loco.

68
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:37,000
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

69
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:43,048
Why do you always set
the timer so short?

70
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:07,739
I hope you know
where you're going.

71
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,508
...a police station.

72
01:01:40,105 --> 01:01:41,940
You used too much
explosive! Again.

73
01:01:43,024 --> 01:01:44,692
Too much, too little...

74
01:01:45,276 --> 01:01:46,277
it's all the same.

75
01:01:46,945 --> 01:01:51,783
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?

76
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:54,494
And what you're doing
there on the wall...

77
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,372
You got that from
the same book, huh?

78
01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:54,090
Dominic Toretto's
ride in my garage.

79
01:04:55,174 --> 01:04:59,345
Now that...
will be a nice trophy.

80
01:23:02,552 --> 01:23:03,637
I know she's here!

81
01:23:06,139 --> 01:23:07,307
Find her!

82
01:23:07,474 --> 01:23:09,017
Go! Go! Go!

83
01:23:57,983 --> 01:23:59,067
Yo, you burned it!

84
01:24:02,195 --> 01:24:04,531
Yeah, but your mom is the
worst cook in the world.

85
01:24:04,656 --> 01:24:07,492
Yo, don't you be talking
about my momma.

86
01:39:29,246 --> 01:39:30,289
See?

87
01:39:31,457 --> 01:39:34,126
I called in every cop
on our payroll.

88
01:39:35,628 --> 01:39:37,421
We're covered.

89
01:39:39,131 --> 01:39:40,549
We've got every entrance
covered with weapons teams.

90
01:39:40,633 --> 01:39:43,386
God Himself couldn't get at
your money if He wanted to.

91
01:39:43,886 --> 01:39:48,224
God isn't my worry.

92
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:01,755
What's happening?

93
01:41:01,839 --> 01:41:03,299
They're taking the vault!

94
01:41:03,382 --> 01:41:05,050
What?
The vault!

95
01:41:14,602 --> 01:41:17,855
Follow me! Quickly!

96
01:41:22,193 --> 01:41:23,694
Let me through!

97
01:41:33,746 --> 01:41:34,747
Don't move!

98
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:37,333
Stay down.

99
01:47:55,627 --> 01:47:56,795
Zizi, stay on them.

100
01:48:23,322 --> 01:48:25,240
They can't outrun us
on the bridge.

101
01:48:35,292 --> 01:48:36,501
They have no way out.

102
01:49:24,383 --> 01:49:25,425
Hey, what is he doing?

103
01:49:29,388 --> 01:49:30,514
We've got him!

104
01:49:47,364 --> 01:49:48,615
Close down the bridge!

105
01:50:22,858 --> 01:50:24,234
Do something, asshole!

106
01:50:36,329 --> 01:50:37,456
Kill him, dammit!

107
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:50,302
Kill him now!

108
01:56:22,967 --> 01:56:26,429
”For Rosa and Nico.
See you soon, -Uncle Dom”

109
01:56:33,311 --> 01:56:36,773
MONACO

110
01:56:39,484 --> 01:56:40,568
You sure about this?

111
01:56:42,362 --> 01:56:43,822
You know I am.

112
01:56:45,782 --> 01:56:47,242
You don't need to do this.

113
01:56:48,243 --> 01:56:50,578
Just leave me alone.

114
01:56:50,662 --> 01:56:52,705
Bro, I'm not trying to
be negative, but casinos

115
01:56:52,914 --> 01:56:55,625
are the kinds of places designed to
take money from guys like you and me.

116
01:56:55,792 --> 01:56:59,462
When I win here I'm buying you a
lifetime supply of antidepressants.

117
01:56:59,754 --> 01:57:02,757
You don't put
ten million on red!

118
01:57:02,841 --> 01:57:03,800
Enough already.

119
01:57:03,883 --> 01:57:05,260
You put it on black.

120
01:57:07,846 --> 01:57:08,972
No more bets.

121
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:29,977
