00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,370
My name is Oliver  Queen.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,170
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,970
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,440
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,040
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,210
To them, I am Oliver  Queen.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,640
To the rest
of Starling city,

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,980
I am someone else.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,820
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,920
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,490
There's a lot of good people,
they lose someone,

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,120
They lose themselves,
which is why they come in here

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,350
To work off that rage.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,520
Roy, are you ok?
You look
a little tired.

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,960
I just haven't been
sleeping much lately.

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,900
If I had accepted
my life, I would be
a cocktail waitress

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,300
In vegas
like my mother,

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,630
And I never would
have believed some
crazy guy in a hood

19
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,040
When he told me I
could be more than
just some it girl.

You're not moving
very quickly this morning.

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,230

23

You're just lashing out.

How do normal people
spend their morning?

Mrs. Fernandes!

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,610
I already told you,
I haven't seen

Your...Cat.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,080
I haven't
seen him, either.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,810
Or is the cat a girl?

37
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,380
Was I being misogynist
just now?

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,320
Or is it misogynistic?
I never know.

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Ray...What are you--

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,350
Nice place you've got here.
Lots of space.

41
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,550
So it occurred
to me this morning,

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,420
What's the one thing
that  Queen consolidated has

43
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,790
That we don't use
to its maximum potential?

44
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,960
Have you heard of a process
called cogeneration?

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,430
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.

46
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,330
Well, cogeneration is--
the repurposing

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,000
Of waste heat given
off by electricity
production.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,740
Exactly. It's a principle
of thermodynamic efficiency,

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,470
Which occurred to me
could be applied
to a building

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,610
Which generates
over 240,000 watts
of electricity.

51
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,980
Like  Queen consolidated.
Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,820
I did some
preliminary calculations

53
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,220
On the drive over.

54
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,550
You want to sell qc's excess
energy back to the city?

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,320
If by "sell"
you mean "give away
for free," then yes.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,630
Energy is something
that should be given

57
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,230
Freely to the masses.

to see you.

For a visit.
Look, look, look.

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,490
Didn't you
get my text?

68
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,790
Mom, to send a text,

this really sweet loft.

160
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,900
Listen to me.
He's alive,

161
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,240
And if you take
his money, he has
a hold on you.

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,210
I think you're being
a little melodramatic.

163
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,550
I'm his daughter, ok?
He's not going
to put me in danger.

164
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,880
He's responsible
for the death of
503 innocent people,

165
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,550
Including your brother.

166
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,160
Now that is a card
that you do not get to play.

167
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,460
You are my brother,

168
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,530
But that does not mean
you have the right to tell me

169
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,400
What I can do with my life.

170
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,130
I am my own person.

171
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,870
The movers are coming
tomorrow, so you can
stop by with popcorn

172
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,140
Or not stop by at all.

173
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,130
Oh, please.

Judgment has been rendered
against this city.

Its sentence carried out.

184

An earthquake. A siege.

185
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,320
This is what comes next--

186
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
A new life you will
live on your knees,

187
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,700
And it will take
nothing more than
a push of a button.

188
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,660
We are in control now.

And this is just
the beginning.

190
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,270
Let there be light.

191
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,290
Ooh, a nightclub.

192
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,260
[chuckles] you know,
I'm really not dressed
for a nightclub.

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Really?
You think?

194
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,530
My friend owns the
place. He just needs

195
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,370
A little help turning
the power back on, so...

196
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,070
Why don't you...
Come, come.

197
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,680
Stay put.
Stay here?

198
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,540
Right here.
Ok.

Hey. Any luck
tracking this--

Hello.

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,350
Hi. Uh,

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,490
Please tell me
this is your friend.

203
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,790
No. Mom,

204
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,620
This is Oliver..
Queen.

205
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,230
Very nice to meet you.

206
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,790
Yes, it's so nice
to meet you, too.

207
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,230
How many billionaires
do you know?

208

Nice to meet you,
too. Oh! Hello!

Who is this
little nugget?

213
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,610
This is my daughter Sara.

Ooh!
Mom.

Mom. Ahem, mom!

What?

217
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,320
We have to go
downstairs.

218
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,820
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to stop you.

I'm so sorry.

So sorry.

It's great
to meet you, finally.

222
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,360
Yes, yes, definitely.

223
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,290
Why is Sara here?

224
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,930
Lyla's on on assignment
in santa prisca

225
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,460
And the nanny
called in sick.

226
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,230
But--we can't
bring her down there.

227
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,740
Why not, Oliver,
who's she going to tell?

228
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,340
I'm not comfortable
with her down there.

229
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,380
God help me.

230

My mother loves
babies. Just...

Really?

232
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,020
Whoever this
brother eye group is
somehow got access

233

To the city's
protected network

234
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,320
And uploaded
a system-wide virus.

235
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,520
No, it deleted itself
as soon as it
completed its task.

236
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,190
They said the power outage
was just the beginning.

237
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,300
Then let's find
them before
there's a next time.

are you all right?
Did you get here ok?

I'm fine.
I was close.

241
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,710
But why do I get
the emergency
services alert?

242
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,370
Why don't they call
the district attorney?

243
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,380
'cause he's visiting
his niece in coast city.

You are the acting
district attorney.

in buying a fake id.

you pulled
the plug on me.

Well, think of how many
accounts you could

if I hadn't stopped you.

They can. The subroot
was configured.

you set off a packets feedback

trace back to.

up the bread crumbs.

to the virus
they're using.

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,050
No, no, no, no, no, no!

319
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,350
What's wrong?

320
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,850
The virus...
I can't stop it!

321
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,050
How do you know?
Because it's mine.

322
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,390
I wrote it five years ago.

323
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,970
Ok, ok, before
you say anything,

324
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,240
Just know that
I never imagined
the virus being used

325
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,410
For something
like this.
I mean, sure,

326
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,570
I could have
imagined it.

327
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,940
I actually have
a very vivid
imagination.

328
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,340
Like cronuts!
I had a vision
of them before--

329
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,480
Hey.

330
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,280
Relax.

331
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,880
Take a deep breath.

332
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,050
Good.

333
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,950
Now start at the beginning.

334
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,160
I was in this,

335
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,790
I guess you could
call it a group,

336
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,930
In college.
We were "hacktivists."

337
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,700
For lack
of a better word.

338
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,560
Civil disobedience

339
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,000
Via the world wide web.

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,900
I created this.

341
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,070
This...

342
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,510
Super virus.

343
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,710
That could give us
root access

344
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,810
To any infected server.

345
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,020
We could expose
government fraud

346
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,180
And start
virtual sit-ins

347
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,120
And digitally
deface criminals.

348
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,460
I guess you could say
it was my first attempt
at being a hero.

349
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,230
Felicity. [sighs]

350
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,500
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

351
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,900
Do we even know
a fraction

352
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,430
Of what happened
to you the five years
that you were away?

353
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,070
Who else had access
to the program?

354
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,540
Myron forest.
He was my...

355
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,610
I had a boyfriend
in college,

356
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,140
And myron
was his roommate.

357
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,550
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?

358
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,910
What about the boyfriend?

359
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
Oh, he couldn't
have done this.

360
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,450
He's...Not
in the picture,

361
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,820
But myron always had
somewhat of an edge.

362
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,490
Can you get me an address?

363
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,290
Sure.

364
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,260
Just one small problem--

365
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,170
Not small,
necessarily, but short.

366
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,040
Just take
the alleyway entrance.

367
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,970
Ok.

368
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,990
Are you ok?

369
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,430
[chuckles]

370
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,790
I've been better.

371
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,600
I talked it over with myron,

372
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,100
And I'm going to tell them
I wrote the super virus.

373
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,730
You can't do that.

374
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,300
I can't let you
rot in prison, coop.

375
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,710
You can't tell them
you wrote that virus...

376
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,470
'cause I already
told them I did.

377
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,150
I always said
I'd protect you
from the grues.

378
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,520
This isn't--
it's better this way.

379
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,220
I wiped out
those loans.

380
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,050
There's no reason
both of us should
be in prison.

381
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,260
I love you.

382
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,330
Love you, too.

383
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,570
Hey. Got a minute?

384
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,310
Congratulations,
you called in a riot squad,

385
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,150
You nearly started one!
And! You did it behind my back.

386
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,790
And the situation
at Starling national
was escalating.

387
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,050
You escalated it, Laurel!

388
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,160
Please tell me you can
at least see that now.

389
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,760
Ok.

390
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,030
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,060
Laurel, baby...

392
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,130
What's gotten into you?

393
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,470
You're angry,
you're distant,
you're reckless.

394
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,640
Tell me you're not
boozing again.

395
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,110
Then what the hell's going on?
Because this isn't you.

396
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,280
Look, I haven't said anything
because I was hoping that
you would say something,

397
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,150
Because you, sweeTheart,
you are in ten different
kinds of pain,

398
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,920
And you won't talk about it.

399
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,750
I can't talk
about it with you.

400
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,390
Ok.

401
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,090
But listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.

402
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,630
But talk about it
with somebody.

403
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,160
'cause secrets hurt, baby.

404
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,130
Sometimes more than the truth.

405
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,210
Ahh.

406
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,880
Back-up generator
keeps that locked.

407
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,950
Or...So they told me.

408
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,950
I could never get that
stupid door to open.

409
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,260
Contractor says the entire
sub level is flooded, though.

410
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,720
It was a water main break.

411
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,660
A super hacker is trying
to take over the city
and I'm worried about you.

412
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,400
I still get to be worried,
right?

413
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Yes.

414
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,670
And if you
really have to,

415
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,010
You can even be
judgmental--

416
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,140
Occasionally.

417
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,840
Someone told me
recently

418
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,680
That a family is
pretty precious.

419
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,950
And love,
in spite of
everything,

420
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,150
Is what makes it
precious.

421
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,220
Right now,
the  Queen family
is just you and me.

422
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,990
So let it just be you and me.

423
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,630
And don't take Merlyn's money.

424
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm trying to meet you
halfway here, Ollie.

425
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,000
The other half
is up to you.

426
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,310
[cell phone vibrates]

427
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,860
Myron forest.

428
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,330
You have failed this city.

429
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,470
Tell him he has to retract
all the infected packets

430
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,440
From subsystem mainframes
within the city.

431
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,970
Tell me how
to shut down the virus.

432
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,910
You think I'm behind
the cyber attacks?

433
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,610
Sounds like
a brother eye to me.

434
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,850
I head up the it department
of an accounting firm.

435
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,450
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.

436
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,920
I'm one of the sheep lunatics
like these guys hate.

437
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,120
Why would I do this?

438
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,290
Digital fingerprints
are all over this code.

439
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,020
There's an x-axis
bionumeric algorithm.

440
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,630
The code's an x-axis
bionumeric algorithm
that you've used before!

441
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,560
In college.

442
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,530
My roommate
and his girlfriend.

443
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,500
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we developed it.

444
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,800
We called it a super
virus, but that doesn't
mean I'm the eye guy!

445
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,440
Have you tried
Felicity Smoak?

446
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,810
She's innocent.

447
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,210
Then it's got to be
someone else.

448
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,580
After we graduated,
I might have showed

449
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,380
The code off
to a few people.

450
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,710
Who were they?!
I don't remember.

451
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,850
It was five years
ago. I didn't think
it was a big deal.

452
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,090
We were just kids
playing with matches.

453
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,420
I am running out
of expletives!

454
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,390
We need
to track down

455
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,860
Whoever
myron shared
your code with.

456
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,990
I hacked all of his emails
and all his text messages

457
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
From five years ago
and all I got was depressed.

458
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,270
Ok. What
about your ex?

459
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,100
I already told you,
he didn't do it.

460
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Why? Because he's
your ex-boyfriend?

461
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,410
Because...

462
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,540
My senior year of college,

463
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,780
Cooper and I did
a stupid thing.

464
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,410
He got arrested
and he went to prison.

465
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,850
So he went
to prison.
Maybe he got out.

466
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,760
How do you know?
Because he's dead.

467
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,990
He hung himself
before sentencing.

[exhales]

Felicity, I...

470
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,300
I just really
need to be
alone right now.

471
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,680
Ah. I'm glad
you're here.

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,110
When I launched
my plan to rebrand

Starling
into star city,

474

I didn't count on
cyber terrorism.

475
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,420
I'm looking
for a partner

With whom
to drown my sorrows

477
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,420
And you definitely

478
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,630
Look like someone
who could use a drink.

479
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,070
My mother...

481
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,870
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

482
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,010
You ok?

483
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,080
You're an inventor.

484
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,710
Did you ever create

485
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,320
Anything that you didn't
think was important,

486
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,780
Turns out,

487
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,650
It's very important?

488
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,090
Of course.

489
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,460
Those turn out to be
the best inventions.

490
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,790
Not always.

491
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,430
You want to talk about it?

492
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,800
Of course
I'd find you here.

493
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,370
Could you just wait
one second?
Wait?

494
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,940
[scoffs] I'm sorry;

495
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,210
I've already waited
two hours for you
at your apartment,

496
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,940
And before that,
it was two hours
in the club.

497
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,280
[sighs]

498
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,920
Is there any way
that you could be
anywhere else but here?

499
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,160
Thanks, mom.

500
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,690
That wasn't
the least bit mortifying.

501
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,200
Only half as bad as parents'
week in freshman year.

502
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm sorry I've been
reduced to stalking
my own daughter.

503
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,600
Because you can't
seem to comprehend

504
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,370
That I can't make
the whole world stop

505
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,880
Because you decided to
show up on my doorstep.

506
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,910
I have responsibilities!

507
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,280
Yes, I know, Felicity.

508
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
You have work.
You have work,
work, work, work.

509
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,350
No, no, no,
you don't
understand.

510
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,920
It is so much more
than work.

511
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,820
But all you care about
it my love life

512
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,260
Or how much cleavage
I don't show.

513
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,290
That is not true!

514
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,530
That is completely true!

515
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,300
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that
I'm terminally single.

516
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,660
I'm sorry I have
an actual job.

517
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,830
I'm sorry that I don't
dress like a porn star!

518
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,330
Which I realize is
a compliment to you.

519
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,640
So I'm so sorry
that I am such

520
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,140
A disappointment to you!

521
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,950
I'm not as smart
as you, Felicity,

522
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,250
Or your father.

523
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,350
Even when you were only
six years old, I could
barely keep up with you two.

524
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,690
And...

525
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,760
Maybe I wasn't always
the mother you wanted,

526
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,530
But I was always there.

527
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,060
I stayed and I tried.

528
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,600
He...

529
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
He left me.

530
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,900
He left us.

531
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,270
But when I look at you,

532
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,240
All I see
is what he gave you.

533
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,750
There is nothing of me...

534
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,250
In you.

535
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,720
You know,
it's so funny. I was--

536
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,450
I was always so afraid
that one day,

537
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,960
You were going to leave me,
too. [chuckles]

538
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,930
But now I finally realize...

539
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,500
You already did.

540
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,920
There are people
on the other end
of this thing, right?

541
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,220
People we can hit?

542
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,720
We need Felicity.

543
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm here.

544
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,690
The super virus
has 3,407 traceable
access notes.

545
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,860
Hopefully I didn't
put a firewall in
every one, though.

546
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,700
Of course I did,
because I'm smarter
than that.

547
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,630
Seriously, if I had
two less iq points,

548
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,670
We never would have
gotten in this mess.

549
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,770
Are you all right?

550
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,970
Where's your mom?
I don't know.

551
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,680
Probably back
at my place,

552
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,050
Wishing she had
a different daughter.
It's a long story.

553
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,150
So go see her.
Take an hour.

554
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,210
The city
is under attack.

555
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,180
You're our best chance
of stopping it,

556
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,220
But not like this, Felicity.
Your head's not in the game.

557
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,250
I will get it
together.

558
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,120
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour.

559
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,090
Go talk to your mom.

560
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,590
I do not have
anything
to say to her.

561
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,800
You know, earlier today,
Thea told me

562
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,270
That she literally
has to put up with me

563
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,970
Because family is precious.
And that it's love,

564
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,540
In spite of everything,

565
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,770
That makes it precious.

566
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,680
Go.

567
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,190
Where's Sara?

568
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,960
The nanny came
to pick her up.

569
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,090
Said he was from a company
called a.R.G.U.S.

570
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,760
I don't know,
I've never heard of it.

571
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,360
I think
that's the point.

572
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,770
Well, I'm glad
you're still here.

573
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,770
[scoffs]

574
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,940
You are a terrible liar,
Felicity.

575
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,410
Might be the only thing
we have in common.

576
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,280
I have blonde hair.

577
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,710
You dye it.

578
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,380
You're right.

579
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,420
And it's always
going to be that way.
And it's not easy--

580
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,920
No, you know
what, it's--

581
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,820
It's totally my fault
for just showing up
here uninvited.

582
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,090
Seriously. I think
I just got so excited

583
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,460
About this free flight.

584
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,130
What?

585
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,300
My plane ticket.
I got an email that said
I'd won some contest.

586
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,570
Free first class
round trip to Starling.

587
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,070
Email?

588
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,040
[exhales]

589
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,350
Mom.

590
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,810
Someone wanted you
to be here.

591
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,320
[both shrieking]

592
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,850
Mom!

593
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,730
Baby!
Mom!

594
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,760
Are you ok?

595
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,930
I'm ok.
Oh!

596
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,300
Oh, thank god!

597
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,740
[sobbing]

598
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,770
Where are we?

599
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,910
[gasping]

600
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,580
Felicity Smoak,
just the woman
I wanted to see.

601
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,010
What the hell
do you want from me?!

602
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,810
Who are you?

603
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,480
You really don't know?

604
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,720
I thought you'd never
forget your first love.

605
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,170
You died.

606
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,940
They told me--

607
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,200
That I committed
suicide, right?

608
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,340
The nsa needed
a hacker with game
for cyber espionage,

609
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,240
And I needed
to not be in prison

610
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,780
For the rest of my life.

611
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,210
Because of what the nsa
wanted me doing,

612
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,580
It was...Advantageous
for me to be dead.

613
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,650
When I found out you died,

614
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,250
I was devastated.

615
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,060
I loved you.

616
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,860
I loved you, too.

617
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,130
After I finished my time
with the nsa,

618
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,090
I was going to find you.

619
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,760
To let you in on this.

620
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,830
And then I discovered
you'd become this

621
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,100
Corporate lap dog.

622
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,600
Broke my heart.
You changed.

623
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,040
If you ever thought
I was capable of doing
something like this,

624
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,670
You never really
knew me at all.

625
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,210
When you wrote this
virus, Felicity,

626
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,640
You knew exactly
what it was capable of.

627
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,210
All I'm doing
is unleashing
the true potential

628
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,550
Of what you made.

629
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,380
Why?!

630
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
This isn't who you are!

631
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,950
Five years with the nsa,

632
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,850
You learn a lot about
how the world works.

633
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,560
How we can't be saved
or salvaged.

634
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,360
How it's every man
for himself.

635
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,460
You also learn that when
a city bank goes under,

636
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,260
Say, financial
cyber attack,

637
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,230
The mayor will reach out
to the treasury department

638
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,540
And request an influx
of fresh cash.

639
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,310
Cash which is transported
by armored trucks

640
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,240
Navigating according to
a closed-end gps system,

641
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,350
Which directs them
to city deposit.

642
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,410
If the drivers
deviate from the route,

643
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,720
The trucks are shut down.

644
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,190
But you're going to hack
into the system

645
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,490
And direct the cash
to come here.

646
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,890
It was about money,
and I'm the sell-out?

647
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,960
No.

648
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,630
No, babe.

649
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,430
You're the one who's
going to help me.

650
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,730
See, breaking into
the treasury's

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,000
Asymmetric
encryption

652
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,770
Is beyond even
my capabilities.

653
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,810
I'm going to politely decline.

654
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,010
Don't!
That's why I flew

655
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,310
Some motivation
into town for you.

656
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,950
She's been mia
for over an hour.

657
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,890
Well, you did tell her
to go home. I just
had an a.R.G.U.S. Agent

658
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,990
I could have them go back,
check things out.

659
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,060
Yep.

660
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,390
Ok.

661
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,230
[sighs] Felicity's

Than five feet
from her phone.

663
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
[sighs]
something's wrong.

[cell phone vibrating]

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,670
No! No!

666
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,710
That terminal's
configured
to only connect

667
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,180
With the treasury's ip.

668
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,420
I mention this
so you don't try

669
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,720
To do anything stupid,
like alert the police.

670
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,350
I'm so sorry.

671
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,620
Mom...Right now's
not really

672
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,460
The best time, ok?

673
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,360
But it might be
the last time, hon,

674
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,560
And I want you to know

675
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,660
That all I've ever wanted...

676
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,030
Is for you to be happy.

677
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,170
Let's say we hit pause
on the dr. Phil episode.

678
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,510
It's done!
It's done.

679
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,080
There's a reason
you wanted me, right?

680
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,910
They'll be at your front
door in five minutes.

681
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,850
Guards will be armed.

Stay put, ok?

684
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,290
Just because
we used to screw

685
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,600
Doesn't mean
I won't use
this gun.

What's that?

689
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,110
Huh? Oh, that,
that's the watch.

690
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,540
It's the watch
Mr. Palmer gave me.

691
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,320
It chimes on the hour,
and I guess when we're
about to be killed.

692
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,620
We're not going
to be killed.

693
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,820
We're going to get
out of here.

694

It basically
replaces
your computer.

You know I don't know
what that means.

696
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,720
It means it has wifi.

697
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,560
Really?

698
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,540
Ok.

699
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,800
When they're in range...

You know what to do.

701
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,990
I did what you wanted.

702

You don't have
to kill us.

703

Really?

That I'd become the grue?

Hey.

You want to wave
that gun at me, fine,

708
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,540
But don't you dare
threaten my daughter.

709

Here I thought you were
all nails and hair.

710

Try single mom who's
worked 60 hour weeks

I may not understand
all this cyber whatever,

But I know without that gun,

714
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,290
You wouldn't last 10 seconds
against my girl.

715
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,530
Too bad she doesn't have
10 seconds.

Put the gun down.

You were always good,

Before,

You were right to keep
pressing on cooper.

Turns out he's not
as dead as I thought.

I've had some
experience
with that.

And you learn
not to judge.

Yes.

I guess so.

you're never

how to teach you.

going to be?

Let's not miss
each other anymore.

I mean, it was so
much easier to be in
each other's lives

When we were
underneath
the same roof.

So...Why don't you
move in with me?

I mean, clearly I
have enough space.

And I...

I swear once
the club starts
making a profit,

I will donate all

I'm officially off.

I mean, my flight doesn't
leave till tonight,

But I figured you'd be
working, so we can--

00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,470
We can just
say good-bye now.

00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,210
You were right.

800
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,880
About what?
I haven't always

801
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,950
Been appreciative
of you.

802
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,080
You were always
there for me
every day,

803
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,050
And night.

804
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,520
So if I haven't said
thank you enough,

805
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,020
Thank you.

806
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,320
[laughs]

807
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,990
But you were
wrong, too.

808
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,130
Mm-hmm?

809
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,360
When you said
all you saw
in me was dad;

810
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,400
There was nothing
of you in me.

811
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Well, I can't
really explain it,

812
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,040
But over the past
two years, I have
been through a lot.

813
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,540
And I have learned
that I am a lot
tougher than I thought.

814
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,510
That...

815
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,810
I get from you.

816
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,650
Don't cry.

817
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,490
So I took another look
at those cogeneration numbers.

818
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,560
You want to...

819
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,590
Oh.

820
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,820
Hi again.
Hi.

821
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,190
How's that new smart wearable
working out for you?

822
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,390
Oh, it's, um,

823
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,900
It's a real life saver.

824
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,970
Yeah.

825
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,140
Ray, I can't come
into work today.

826
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,270
I am...
[coughs]

827
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,940
Calling in sick.

828
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,510
"feel better."

829
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,510
Thank you.

830
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,550
Thank you.
See you later.

831
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,320
[indistinct chatter]

832
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,660
That's actually
pretty genius.

833
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,960
Man: Hello, Sara.

834
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,830
What are you
doing here?

835
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,480
[gasping]
