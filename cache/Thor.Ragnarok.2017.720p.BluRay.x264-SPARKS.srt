1
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,174
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:00,173
Oh no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?

3
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:03,234
Well, sometimes
you have to get captured,

4
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:05,036
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,918
It's a long story but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

6
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,640
See, I spent some time on Earth...

7
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:16,340
fought some robots saved
the planet a couple of times.

8
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:19,005
Then I went searching
through the cosmos for some...

9
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,520
magic, colorful, Infinity Stone things.

10
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:23,452
Didn't find any.

11
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,962
That's when I came across
a path of death,

12
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:28,526
and destruction,

13
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:31,973
which led me all the way here
into this cage,

14
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,665
where I met you.

15
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:42,690
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

16
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:59,653
Thor, son of Odin.

17
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,884
Surtur,

18
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,471
son of...

19
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,526
a bitch.

20
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,580
You're still alive.

21
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:09,999
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

22
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,478
I cannot die.

23
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,770
Not until I fulfill my destiny,

24
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:16,008
and lay waste to your home.

25
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,543
It's funny you should mention that.

26
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:20,182
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

27
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,746
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

28
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:25,409
And you, Surtur are
at the center of all of them.

29
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:29,524
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

30
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,636
The great prophecy...
Hang on.

31
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:32,806
Hang on.

32
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:37,010
I'll be back around shortly.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,559
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

34
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,599
Ok, so Ragnarok.

35
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,467
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

36
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,306
My time has come.

37
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:51,744
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame.

38
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,495
I shall be restored to my full might.

39
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:56,891
I will tower over the mountains,

40
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,847
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

41
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,924
Hang on. Give it a second.

42
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:03,952
I swear I'm not even moving.

43
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:05,288
It's just doing this on its own.

44
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,137
I'm really sorry.

45
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,413
Ok so, let me get this straight.

46
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,828
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame,

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,257
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

48
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:17,500
A mountain!

49
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,560
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

50
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:23,467
Odin is not on Asgard.

51
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:27,269
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

52
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,549
Ok, so where is it?
This crown?

53
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:33,013
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

54
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,916
That's a crown.

55
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,566
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

56
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,696
It's a crown.

57
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:41,722
Anyway, it sounds like all I have
to do to stop Ragnarok is...

58
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,390
rip that thing off your head.

59
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:46,894
But Ragnarok has already begun.

60
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:49,563
You cannot stop it.

61
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,872
I am Asgard's doom,

62
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,142
and so are you.

63
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:03,826
All will suffer,

64
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,946
all will burn.

65
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,507
That's intense.

66
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:09,850
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big,

67
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:12,429
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,454
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B,

69
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,993
where I bust out of these chains,

70
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,780
knock that tiara off your head,

71
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,005
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

72
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:24,117
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

73
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,710
Why fight it?

74
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,098
Because that's what heroes do.

75
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,524
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

76
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,716
And, now!

77
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,887
You have made
a grave mistake, Odinson.

78
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,405
I make grave mistakes all the time.

79
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:55,058
Everything seems to work out.

80
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:15,484
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

81
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,227
but I could really use a fast exit.

82
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,070
Heimdall?

83
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,134
Heimdall was an idiot.

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,384
This job should have made him rich.

85
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,774
Now, the job ain't easy,

86
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,081
but it does have its benefits.

87
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,623
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

88
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,392
the Nine Realms has to offer.

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,691
I mean it's all mine for the taking.

90
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,256
Behold,

91
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,834
my stuff.

92
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,881
I'm particularly fond of these.

93
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:50,349
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

94
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:51,964
I even named them.

95
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:53,949
Des and Troy.

96
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,050
You see, when you put them together,

97
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,252
they destroy.

98
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,096
Heimdall, come on.

99
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,357
Stay!

100
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,241
Heimdall?

101
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:46,281
I'm running short on options.

102
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,727
<i>Heimdall?</i>

103
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:50,423
Skurge?

104
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,122
Is that important?

105
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:03,906
You girls are in for a treat.

106
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,665
Girls!

107
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,601
Well, well, well.

108
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,435
Look who decided to pop in.

109
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,039
Thanks for scaring away
my company

110
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,903
and drenching
my workplace in brains.

111
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:08,770
Who are you?

112
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,052
Don't you remember?

113
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:11,011
I'm Skurge.

114
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:12,312
We fought together on Vanaheim.

115
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:13,132
Right.

116
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:14,953
Where is Heimdall?

117
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:17,988
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

118
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:19,143
Traitor?

119
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:21,188
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

120
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,423
with negligence of duty,

121
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,596
but he disappeared before the trial.

122
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,030
Hard to catch a guy who can
see everything in the universe.

123
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:28,115
Sure. Hold on. Hold on.

124
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,021
I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

125
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:56,162
What the hell is that?

126
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:05,120
Brother.

127
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:06,755
This is it.

128
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,807
I take my leave.

129
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,470
You fool, you didn't listen!

130
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:12,491
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:13,808
Lady Sif, get help!

132
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,330
Somebody, help!

133
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,189
Sorry for all I've done.

134
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,378
It's alright. Hold on.

135
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,335
I'm sorry,

136
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:22,574
I tried to rule Earth.

137
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:24,417
They'd be lucky to have you.

138
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:27,395
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

139
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:29,387
I just couldn't help myself.
I know.

140
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,534
I'm a trickster.
Yes.

141
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:31,905
So mischievous.

142
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,432
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

143
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:37,081
It was a wonderful joke.

144
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,060
It was indeed hilarious.

145
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,999
You are the savior of Asgard.

146
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,790
Tell my story.
I will.

147
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,336
Build a statue for me.

148
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,066
We will build a big statue for you.

149
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,913
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

150
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:53,073
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

151
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:54,871
I didn't do it for him.

152
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,467
I didn't do it for him.

153
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:12,021
No!

154
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,064
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

155
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,365
giving his life for ours.

156
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,981
He fought back those disgusting elves,

157
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:22,884
he brought peace to the realm.

158
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:25,664
Loki, my boy,

159
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:27,199
it was many moons ago,

160
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:30,460
I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.

161
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:33,483
On that day, I did not yet see in you,

162
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,366
Asgard's savior. No.

163
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:37,208
You were merely,

164
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,538
a little blue baby icicle,

165
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,153
that melted this old fool's heart.

166
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:49,436
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

167
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,140
Father.

168
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:57,147
Shit.

169
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,912
My son, Thor, has returned!

170
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:01,604
Greetings, my boy.

171
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,248
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

172
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,944
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

173
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:09,238
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

174
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,678
Indeed they should.

175
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,819
I like the statue.

176
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:14,667
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

177
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,847
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

178
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,820
Do you know what this is?

179
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,100
The skull of Surtur.

180
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:23,464
That's a formidable weapon!

181
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:25,467
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault,

182
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,236
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

183
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:28,520
and destroy the whole planet.

184
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,932
Thank you, dear.

185
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:34,580
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

186
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,412
Nope.

187
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,824
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

188
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,785
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

189
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,620
That's just a silly dream,

190
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:45,587
signs of an over active imagination.

191
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:46,688
Possibly.

192
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,796
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.

193
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:52,839
And what do I find, but the
Nine Realms completely in chaos.

194
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:56,321
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,

195
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:57,316
all while you,

196
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,330
Odin, the protector
of those Nine Realms,

197
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,166
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.

198
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:04,720
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

199
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:05,763
Yes of course,

200
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:07,727
the freedom to be massacred.

201
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,947
Yes, besides I've been rather
busy myself.

202
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:12,909
Watching theater. Well...

203
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,863
Board meetings and security
council meetings,

204
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,317
You're really gonna make me do it?

205
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:17,193
Do what?

206
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,978
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir

207
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:24,803
as it returns to my hand.

208
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:26,381
Not even your face.

209
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,281
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

210
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,783
Then I'll see you on
the other side, brother.

211
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,245
Alright, I yield.

212
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,030
Behold!

213
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:47,132
Thor,

214
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:49,772
Odinson. No.

215
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:52,958
You had one job.

216
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:54,124
Just the one.

217
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:56,824
Where's Odin?

218
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,444
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

219
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:00,918
Everything was fine without you.

220
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,649
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

221
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:05,541
Ask them. Where's Father?

222
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,984
Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.

223
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:08,386
You had the independence
you asked for.

224
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:09,812
Ok.

225
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,575
I know exactly where he is.

226
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,351
I swear I left him right here.

227
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:28,757
Right here on the sidewalk,

228
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,681
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

229
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,335
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?

230
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:34,077
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

231
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:36,200
No? Then why do you dress like one?

232
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:38,381
Hey.
I can't believe you're alive.

233
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:40,082
I saw you die.

234
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:42,132
I mourned you, I cried for you.

235
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,216
I'm honored.

236
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:44,406
Ask him.

237
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:46,576
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

238
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,432
Sure.

239
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:50,479
Start figuring out where he is.

240
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:52,079
My God.

241
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,761
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

242
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:56,389
She didn't dump me, you know.

243
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,919
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

244
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,979
What's this? What are you doing?

245
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,118
This isn't me.

246
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:09,497
Loki.

247
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:35,909
Thor Odinson.

248
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,501
God of Thunder.

249
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,589
You can put down the umbrella.

250
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,292
So, Earth has, wizards now?

251
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,362
The preferred term is

252
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:20,466
Master of the Mystic Arts.
You can leave that now.

253
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:22,599
Alright, wizard.

254
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,476
Who are you? Why should I care?

255
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,636
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

256
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,425
and I have some questions for you.

257
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,129
Take a seat.

258
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:35,893
Tea?

259
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:39,804
I don't drink tea.

260
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,083
What do you drink?

261
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,378
Not tea.

262
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:47,725
So, I keep a watch list

263
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:49,693
of individuals and beings
from other realms,

264
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,261
that may be a threat to this world.

265
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:55,071
Your adopted brother Loki,
is one of those beings.

266
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,826
He's a worthy inclusion.

267
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,403
Then why bring him here?

268
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:02,929
We're looking for my father.

269
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,501
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,

270
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:09,371
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

271
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,216
Promptly.

272
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,063
Great! Then I'll help you.

273
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,656
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

274
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:17,590
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.

275
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,224
Your father said he had
chosen to remain in exile.

276
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,561
And you don't have a phone.

277
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,196
No, I don't have a phone,

278
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:27,536
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

279
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:28,740
It's called an email.

280
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,830
Yeah, do you have a computer?
No. What for?

281
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:32,902
Anyway,

282
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:34,803
my father is no longer in exile.

283
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,505
So if you could tell me where he is,

284
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:37,567
I can take him home.

285
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,588
Gladly. He's in Norway.

286
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:43,274
I'm just seeing whether this incantation

287
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:46,258
requires any Asgardian modifications.

288
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:47,312
Nope.

289
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:49,428
We don't need that.

290
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,452
Will you stop doing that?

291
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:02,035
I need just one strand of your hair.

292
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:03,096
Let me explain something.

293
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,036
My hair is not to be meddled with.

294
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,801
We could have just walked.

295
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:18,831
He's waiting for you.

296
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:20,485
Alright.

297
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,338
Don't forget your umbrella.

298
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,504
Yes.

299
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:32,662
Sorry.

300
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:39,535
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

301
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:41,330
Yeah. Right.

302
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,794
I have been falling...

303
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,611
for 30 minutes!

304
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,612
You can handle him from here.

305
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:54,249
Yes. Of course.

306
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,683
Thank you very much for your help.

307
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:56,818
Good luck.

308
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,889
Handle me? Who are you?

309
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:00,688
Loki.

310
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,931
You think you're some
kind of sorcerer?

311
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:03,925
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate,

312
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:04,993
Bye-bye.

313
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,206
Father?

314
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,515
Look at this place.

315
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:35,643
It's beautiful.

316
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,414
Father, it's us.

317
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,018
My sons.

318
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,146
I've been waiting for you.

319
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,940
I know. We've come to take you home.

320
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,743
Home, yes.

321
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:56,605
Your mother,

322
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:57,904
she calls me.

323
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,316
Do you hear it?

324
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:04,786
Loki, lift your magic.

325
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,836
Took me quite a while to
break free from your spell.

326
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,650
Frigga would have been proud.

327
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,997
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

328
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,934
I know that we failed you.

329
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,312
But we can make this right.

330
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,015
I failed you.

331
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,083
It is upon us.

332
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:29,992
Ragnarok.

333
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,833
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

334
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:34,381
No.

335
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,030
It has already begun.
She's coming.

336
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:40,540
My life was all that held her back but...

337
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,195
my time has come.

338
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,389
I cannot keep her away any longer.

339
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:48,304
Father, who are you talking about?

340
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,369
Goddess of Death.

341
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,717
Hela.

342
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:54,103
My firstborn.

343
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,688
Your sister.

344
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,702
Your what?

345
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,777
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

346
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:09,162
I couldn't stop her, so...

347
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,118
I imprisoned her.

348
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,342
Locked her away.

349
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,075
She draws her strength
from Asgard and...

350
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:19,721
and once she gets
there, her powers will be...

351
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,698
limitless.

352
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:24,304
Whatever she is,
we can stop her together.

353
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:25,636
We can face her together.
No, we won't.

354
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,061
I'm on a different path now.

355
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,330
This you must face alone.

356
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,542
I love you, my sons.

357
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:37,978
Look at that.

358
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,014
Remember this place.

359
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:46,615
Home.

360
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:28,160
Brother.

361
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,516
This was your doing.

362
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,271
So he's gone.

363
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:28,122
That's a shame. I would have
liked to have seen that.

364
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:30,231
You must be Hela.

365
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:33,635
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

366
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,771
Really?

367
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,050
You don't look like him.

368
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:39,136
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

369
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:41,250
You sound like him.

370
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:44,393
Kneel.

371
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:45,702
Beg your pardon?

372
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:51,332
Kneel.

373
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:56,509
Before your queen.

374
00:23:58,114 --> 00:23:59,355
I don't think so.

375
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:11,681
It's not possible.

376
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:16,811
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

377
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:38,351
Bring us back!

378
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:39,131
No!

379
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:49,559
Loki!

380
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:37,496
Who are you?

381
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:38,727
What have you done with Thor?

382
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:44,492
I'm Hela.

383
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,037
I'm just a janitor.

384
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:53,364
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

385
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,770
How would you like a job?

386
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:10,458
Are you a fighter?

387
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:12,607
Or are you food?

388
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:14,862
I'm just passing through.

389
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,020
It is food.

390
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,435
On your knees.

391
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,574
He's mine.

392
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:12,650
Wait!

393
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:22,437
Wait!

394
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,381
He's mine.

395
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,452
So, if you want him,

396
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:29,922
you go through me.

397
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,340
But we've already got him.

398
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:34,144
Alright, then.

399
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:35,876
I guess I go through you.

400
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,478
More food.

401
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:14,516
Thank you.

402
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,022
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

403
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:55,686
I've got something special.

404
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,938
Hey! Where are you taking me?

405
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:00,821
Answer me!

406
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:01,987
Hey!

407
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:05,720
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

408
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,976
Many apologies, your majesty.

409
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:39,958
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

410
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,800
I am Hela,

411
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,130
Odin's firstborn,

412
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,755
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,

413
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,305
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.

414
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:03,846
My father is dead.

415
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,513
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

416
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,527
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the cosmos.

417
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,674
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

418
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:15,858
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

419
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,972
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

420
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:24,142
And I am here to restore that power.

421
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,583
Kneel before me,

422
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:30,702
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

423
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,803
Whoever you are,

424
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,576
whatever you've done,

425
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:37,486
surrender now!

426
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,686
Or we will show you no mercy.

427
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,524
Whoever I am?

428
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,697
Did you listen to a word I said?

429
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,153
This is your last warning!

430
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,703
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

431
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,370
Fine.

432
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:12,455
Charge!

433
00:34:06,603 --> 00:34:08,680
I've missed this.

434
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:10,661
Still, it's a shame.

435
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:13,497
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

436
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,505
all because they couldn't see the future.

437
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,206
Sad.

438
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:20,391
Look, still alive.

439
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:29,537
Change of heart?

440
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,781
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

441
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,405
You evil demoness!

442
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,377
Let's go see my palace.

443
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:14,404
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

444
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,614
<i>You are home,
and there is no going back.</i>

445
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:22,967
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

446
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:24,992
<i>But what is this place?</i>

447
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,226
<i>The answer is...</i>

448
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:29,217
<i>Sakaar.</i>

449
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:32,855
<i>Surrounded by cosmic gateways,</i>

450
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:36,312
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

451
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:37,704
<i>It is the collection point</i>

452
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:39,740
<i>for all lost and unloved things,</i>

453
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,376
<i>like you.</i>

454
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:44,757
<i>But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.</i>

455
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:46,216
<i>You are valuable.</i>

456
00:35:46,513 --> 00:35:47,916
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

457
00:35:48,242 --> 00:35:49,226
What the hell?

458
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:51,996
<i>And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.</i>

459
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:53,842
<i>He is the original,</i>

460
00:35:54,578 --> 00:35:56,609
<i>the first lost and the first found,</i>

461
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:58,402
<i>the creator of Sakaar,</i>

462
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:00,790
<i>and father of the Contest
of Champions.</i>

463
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,199
<i>Where once you were nothing,</i>

464
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,456
<i>now you are something.</i>

465
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,388
<i>You are the property
of the Grandmaster.</i>

466
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,566
<i>Congratulations!</i>

467
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:14,039
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster
in 5 seconds.</i>

468
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:16,248
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

469
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:19,282
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

470
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,310
<i>You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.</i>

471
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,066
He's wonderful. It is a he?

472
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:40,444
It is a he.

473
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:41,614
Yeah.

474
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:44,362
I love when you come to visit, 142.

475
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,996
You bring me the best stuff.

476
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,865
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,

477
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,768
about Scrapper 142,

478
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,913
what do I always say?

479
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:53,538
She is the...
And it starts with a B.

480
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,417
Trash.

481
00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:57,253
No, not trash.

482
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:59,710
Were you waiting just to call her that?

483
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:00,929
It doesn't start with a B.

484
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:02,371
Booze hag.

485
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,718
I'm so sorry. No, best.
I was thinking about best.

486
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,018
Because I always say you're the best.

487
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,087
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

488
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:13,056
You say that every time she's here.

489
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:14,498
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

490
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,892
A contender.

491
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:16,676
A what?

492
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:19,147
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

493
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:21,281
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

494
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:34,977
Pay this lady.

495
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,913
Just wait a damn minute.

496
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:39,090
I'm not for sale.

497
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,211
Man he's, he's a fighter.

498
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:48,576
I take 10 million.

499
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:49,809
Tell her she's dreaming.

500
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,156
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

501
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:00,672
You'll pay for this.

502
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:02,326
No, I got paid for this.

503
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:05,423
Here's what I wanna know.

504
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:08,271
Who are you?

505
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:13,314
I am the God of Thunder.

506
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:18,199
I didn't hear any thunder but
out of your fingers was that like...

507
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:19,534
sparkles?

508
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,378
We've located your cousin.

509
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,485
Good!

510
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,616
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.

511
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:26,899
There he is.

512
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:28,163
Hey, cuz.

513
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:31,416
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

514
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:32,286
Hi.

515
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:34,747
So,

516
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:36,064
Please.

517
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:38,791
Plea... I'm sorry.

518
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,667
Yeah.

519
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:41,277
Carlo,

520
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:43,945
I pardon you.

521
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,894
Thank you.

522
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:46,823
Thank you.

523
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,316
You're officially pardoned.

524
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:50,139
From life.

525
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:56,960
Help! Help me.

526
00:38:57,828 --> 00:39:00,446
My God!

527
00:39:00,663 --> 00:39:02,812
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

528
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:06,518
The sm... The smell.

529
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,178
What does it smell like?

530
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,341
Burnt toast.

531
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:11,948
What happened to my manners?

532
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,263
I haven't properly introduced myself.

533
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:15,082
Come on.

534
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,448
Follow me.

535
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:18,340
My name is Grandmaster.

536
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:20,519
I preside over a little harlequinade

537
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,388
called the Contest of Champions.

538
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:23,608
People come from far and wide

539
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,294
and to unwillingly participate in it.

540
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,251
And you my friend, might
just be part of the new cast.

541
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,145
What do you say to that?

542
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:31,628
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

543
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,062
I'm going back to Asgard.

544
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:34,020
Ass-gard.

545
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,755
One, two, three, four.

546
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:41,968
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

547
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,267
At that moment,

548
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:44,893
I let go.

549
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:46,200
Loki?

550
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,195
Loki! Loki!

551
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:50,411
Over here.

552
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:51,530
Over here.

553
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:54,315
Excuse me one second.
Loki!

554
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:57,640
What? You're alive?

555
00:39:57,747 --> 00:39:59,446
Yes, of course I'm alive.
What are you doing here?

556
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,565
What do you mean, what am I doing?

557
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:01,792
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

558
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:03,288
Where's your chair?
I didn't get a chair.

559
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,755
Get me out of this one.
I can't.

560
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:06,126
Get me out. What?
I can't.

561
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:07,291
I've made friends with this man.

562
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:08,371
He's called the Grandmaster.

563
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,829
He's crazy!
I've gained his favor.

564
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,454
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

565
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:12,664
Weeks ago?
Yes.

566
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:13,834
I just got here.

567
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:15,135
What are you whispering about?

568
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:17,991
Time works real different
around these parts.

569
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:21,034
On any other world I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

570
00:40:21,354 --> 00:40:22,562
But here on Sakaar,

571
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:30,234
In any case, you know this...

572
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:32,784
this you call yourself Lord of Thunder?

573
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:34,949
God of Thunder. Tell him.

574
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:36,891
I've never met this man in my life.

575
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:38,891
He's my brother. Adopted.

576
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:40,092
Is he any kind of a fighter?

577
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:42,194
You take this thing out of
my neck and I'll show you.

578
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:44,263
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

579
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,097
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

580
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,702
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg,

581
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:49,636
Asgard.

582
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:52,555
Any contender who defeats
my champion,

583
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,649
their freedom they shall win.

584
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:56,608
Fine. Then point me in the direction

585
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,302
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

586
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,896
That's what I call, contender.

587
00:41:00,944 --> 00:41:03,278
Direction would be,
would be this way, Lord.

588
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:04,948
Loki!

589
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:11,606
Hey, hey, hey.

590
00:41:11,608 --> 00:41:13,160
Hey, hey. Take it easy, man.

591
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:15,443
Over here.

592
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:17,394
The pile of rocks waving at you.
Here.

593
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:19,674
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

594
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:21,914
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

595
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:23,585
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

596
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,356
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

597
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,956
But don't let that intimidate you.

598
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,545
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

599
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:32,476
Just a little rock-paper-scissor
joke for you.

600
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:35,538
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

601
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:38,253
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

602
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:40,478
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

603
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:41,694
That I am.

604
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:43,018
How'd you end up in here?

605
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:45,222
Well, I tried to start a revolution,

606
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:46,691
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

607
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:48,214
So hardly anyone turned up,

608
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:50,740
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

609
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:52,850
As punishment, I was forced to...

610
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:54,397
be in here and become a gladiator.

611
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:56,480
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

612
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:59,286
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

613
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:01,513
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.

614
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:02,798
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

615
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:06,723
How did you,

616
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,309
Yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

617
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:10,963
But not a real circle,

618
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:12,601
more like a freaky circle.

619
00:42:13,085 --> 00:42:14,317
This doesn't make any sense.

620
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,740
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

621
00:42:15,892 --> 00:42:17,257
The only thing that does make sense,

622
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:18,840
is that nothing makes sense.

623
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:21,251
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

624
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,467
Doug has.

625
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:23,317
Doug!

626
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:24,918
Our luck, Doug's dead.

627
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:25,732
That's right.

628
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:28,713
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

629
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,233
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

630
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:33,523
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

631
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:35,406
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

632
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:37,037
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

633
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,263
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?

634
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:40,374
Yes, I am.

635
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:42,654
Gonna fight him, win,

636
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:44,393
and get the hell out of this place.

637
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:46,783
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

638
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:48,596
See you later, new Doug.

639
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:00,672
Does no one remember me?

640
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,236
Has no one been taught our history?

641
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,549
Look at these lies.

642
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:13,321
Goblets and garden parties?

643
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,458
Peace treaties?

644
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:18,289
Odin,

645
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:20,207
proud to have it,

646
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,349
ashamed of how he got it.

647
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,210
We were unstoppable.

648
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:47,741
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

649
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:54,128
One by one, the realms became ours.

650
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,325
But then,

651
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:58,745
simply because my ambition
outgrew his,

652
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,418
he banished me, caged me,

653
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,513
locked me away like an animal.

654
00:44:04,027 --> 00:44:06,875
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,

655
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:10,199
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

656
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,826
Odin's treasures.
Fake.

657
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:27,706
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

658
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,587
Or weak.

659
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:34,124
Smaller than I thought it would be.

660
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,304
That's not bad.

661
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:38,150
But this,

662
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,231
The Eternal Flame.

663
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,760
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

664
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:43,089
Fenris my darling,
what have they done to you?

665
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,806
With the Eternal Flame,

666
00:45:48,142 --> 00:45:49,899
you are reborn.

667
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:07,083
I've missed you.

668
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,664
I've missed you all.

669
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:13,252
Odin,

670
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:16,763
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,

671
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,322
where the brave shall live forever.

672
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:23,484
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

673
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:26,574
for those that have died,
the glorious death.

674
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:35,664
Hurts, doesn't it?

675
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,402
Being lied to.

676
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:39,645
Being told you're one thing and...

677
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,632
and then learning it's all a fiction.

678
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,653
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

679
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:49,890
This place is disgusting.

680
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,805
Does this mean
you don't want my help?

681
00:46:55,095 --> 00:46:57,366
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

682
00:46:57,404 --> 00:46:58,680
It took me time to win his trust.

683
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:00,331
He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

684
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,758
What I'm telling you is,

685
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:03,668
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

686
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,854
Perhaps in time,

687
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:08,374
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster and then...

688
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:16,941
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

689
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:20,846
Our sister,

690
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:23,518
destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.

691
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,456
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

692
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:27,582
You don't stand a chance.

693
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,484
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

694
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,359
Fine.

695
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,351
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

696
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:43,134
Like I've always done.

697
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:46,865
Would you say something?

698
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:50,938
Say something!

699
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:53,987
What would you like me to say?

700
00:47:55,154 --> 00:47:56,639
You faked your own death,

701
00:47:57,455 --> 00:47:59,912
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,

702
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:01,725
stranded him on Earth to die,

703
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:03,250
releasing the Goddess of Death.

704
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,242
Have I said enough or would
you like me to go back

705
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:07,180
further than the past two days?

706
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:10,239
You know, I haven't seen this

707
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,366
beloved champion he talks of,

708
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:14,811
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

709
00:48:15,218 --> 00:48:17,591
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

710
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:20,446
Don't let me down.

711
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:25,534
Piss off, ghost!

712
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,396
He's freaking gone.

713
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:39,116
Yuck!

714
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:41,664
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

715
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,298
Guys, can you clean up the weapons

716
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,532
once you finish your fight?

717
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:45,812
Disgusting slobs.

718
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:47,667
Thor,

719
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,987
wanna use a big wooden fork?

720
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:51,891
No.

721
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:53,253
Yeah, not really useful.

722
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:55,195
Unless you're fighting off
three vampires,

723
00:48:55,197 --> 00:48:56,524
that were huddled together.

724
00:48:57,581 --> 00:48:59,176
I really wish I had my hammer.

725
00:48:59,763 --> 00:49:00,435
Hammer?

726
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:02,259
Quite unique.
It was made from this...

727
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,802
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

728
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:08,095
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.

729
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:09,134
You rode a hammer?

730
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:10,848
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

731
00:49:10,988 --> 00:49:12,214
The hammer rode you on your back?

732
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:14,223
No, no. I used to spin it really fast,

733
00:49:14,225 --> 00:49:15,957
and it would pull me off the...

734
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:18,166
Oh my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

735
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,993
The ground.
It would pull me off the ground,

736
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:21,784
up into the air and I would fly.

737
00:49:22,205 --> 00:49:23,792
Every time I threw it, it would always...

738
00:49:24,146 --> 00:49:25,090
come back to me.

739
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:26,607
Sounds like you had a pretty special

740
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:28,208
and intimate relationship
with this hammer,

741
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,280
and that losing it was almost
comparable to losing a loved one.

742
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,513
That's a nice way of putting it.

743
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:37,420
I said they're mine.

744
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,822
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

745
00:49:40,824 --> 00:49:43,044
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

746
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,135
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

747
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,677
They are hard to perish.

748
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:48,189
Asgardian?

749
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:50,918
Hey.

750
00:49:51,642 --> 00:49:52,166
Hey.

751
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:53,770
Hey.

752
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:56,296
Do not zap me with that thing.

753
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:57,394
I just wanna talk.

754
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,097
Asgard is in danger.

755
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,103
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

756
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,269
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,

757
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,614
until I found out
that you were all women.

758
00:50:11,616 --> 00:50:13,252
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

759
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:14,235
I love women.

760
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:15,721
Sometimes a little too much.

761
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,886
Not in a creepy way just more of a...

762
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:19,240
respectful appreciation.

763
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,700
I think it's great that there is...

764
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:23,402
an elite force of women warriors.

765
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:24,996
It's about time.

766
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:28,102
Are you done?

767
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:29,236
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

768
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,370
Please, help me.
I need your help.

769
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:31,094
Bye.

770
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:33,558
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.

771
00:50:33,628 --> 00:50:35,511
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

772
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:38,529
Listen closely, your majesty.

773
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:40,379
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

774
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:41,873
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

775
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:47,341
Bring him in for processing.

776
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:49,836
And no one escapes this place.

777
00:50:49,979 --> 00:50:51,580
So you're gonna die anyway.

778
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:04,516
Now, don't you move.

779
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,524
My hands ain't as steady as
they used to be.

780
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:10,907
By Odin's beard, you shall
not cut my hair,

781
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:13,587
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

782
00:51:17,985 --> 00:51:20,142
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

783
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:22,886
Please! No!

784
00:51:23,257 --> 00:51:24,359
No!

785
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,313
<i>Look at all of you.</i>

786
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:40,939
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

787
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:41,978
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

788
00:51:43,276 --> 00:51:45,094
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

789
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:46,405
<i>Big round of applause</i>

790
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:48,586
<i>for all of our undercard competitors,</i>

791
00:51:48,682 --> 00:51:51,649
<i>who today, died so gruesomely.</i>

792
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:52,678
<i>Good sports.</i>

793
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:54,730
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

794
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:58,773
<i>This is what you've come for,
and so have I.</i>

795
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:07,866
<i>And now, without further ado,</i>

796
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,031
<i>it's main event time.</i>

797
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:13,837
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

798
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,396
<i>though he looks quite promising,</i>

799
00:52:15,642 --> 00:52:17,375
<i>got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.</i>

800
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:20,376
<i>I'll say no more, see what you think.</i>

801
00:52:20,814 --> 00:52:22,452
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you,</i>

802
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,071
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

803
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,002
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

804
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,850
<i>Ok, this is it.</i>

805
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,027
<i>Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.</i>

806
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,405
<i>He is a creature.</i>

807
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:07,848
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

808
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:10,360
<i>Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.</i>

809
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,827
<i>I feel a special connection with him.</i>

810
00:53:14,665 --> 00:53:15,868
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

811
00:53:17,535 --> 00:53:18,870
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

812
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:22,740
<i>He's the defending.</i>

813
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:25,128
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

814
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:26,311
<i>I give you,</i>

815
00:53:31,283 --> 00:53:34,886
<i>Your Incredible,</i>

816
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:40,458
Hulk!

817
00:53:41,058 --> 00:53:42,591
Yes!

818
00:53:46,347 --> 00:53:48,037
I have to get off this planet.

819
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:50,909
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

820
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,437
Hey! Hey!

821
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,492
We know each other.

822
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,934
He's a friend from work.

823
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:15,015
Where have you been?

824
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:16,971
Everybody thought you were dead.

825
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:19,441
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

826
00:54:20,563 --> 00:54:21,558
I lost my hammer.

827
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:23,603
Like yesterday so...

828
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:24,924
that's still pretty fresh.

829
00:54:25,402 --> 00:54:27,802
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

830
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:29,003
He's up there.

831
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:30,719
Loki! Look who it is!

832
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:36,209
Banner, I never thought
I would say this but...

833
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:37,667
I'm happy to see you.

834
00:54:39,806 --> 00:54:41,767
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

835
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:43,768
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

836
00:54:43,924 --> 00:54:46,007
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

837
00:54:46,606 --> 00:54:47,418
Banner.

838
00:54:48,491 --> 00:54:49,344
Hey, Banner!

839
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,178
No Banner. Only Hulk.

840
00:54:52,729 --> 00:54:53,484
What are you doing?

841
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:55,681
It's me. It's Thor!

842
00:55:16,018 --> 00:55:17,585
Banner, we're friends.

843
00:55:17,587 --> 00:55:19,147
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

844
00:55:26,495 --> 00:55:28,364
Here we go. Here we go.

845
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:48,092
What?

846
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,069
Hey, big guy.

847
00:56:02,164 --> 00:56:03,960
The sun's getting real low.

848
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:16,077
That's it.

849
00:56:16,188 --> 00:56:17,368
The sun's going down.

850
00:56:20,682 --> 00:56:22,170
I won't hurt you anymore.

851
00:56:22,784 --> 00:56:23,958
No one will.

852
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:38,663
Yes! That's how it feels!

853
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,403
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

854
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,230
Alright.

855
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,343
Screw it.

856
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:04,623
I know you're in there, Banner.

857
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,610
I'll get you out!

858
00:57:14,901 --> 00:57:17,001
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

859
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:18,171
I told them we were friends!

860
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,854
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

861
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:57,776
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

862
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:02,541
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

863
00:59:30,636 --> 00:59:32,689
Another day, another Doug.

864
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:44,255
What is that noise?

865
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,437
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

866
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,146
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

867
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,557
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

868
00:59:59,094 --> 00:59:59,761
Well,

869
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:01,862
me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum...

870
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,662
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.

871
01:00:03,795 --> 01:00:05,491
What I meant was,

872
01:00:05,526 --> 01:00:06,889
what's your ambition?

873
01:00:08,704 --> 01:00:09,544
I just want a...

874
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,669
chance to prove myself.

875
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:13,532
Recognition.

876
01:00:13,942 --> 01:00:15,224
When I was young,

877
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:18,598
every great king had an executioner.

878
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,382
Not just to execute people,

879
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,592
but also to execute their vision.

880
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:26,310
But mainly to...

881
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:28,055
execute people.

882
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,810
Still, it was a great honor.

883
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:34,185
I was Odin's executioner.

884
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:36,563
And you...

885
01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:40,088
shall be my executioner.

886
01:00:45,406 --> 01:00:47,410
Let's begin our conquest.

887
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,423
Skurge, where's the sword?

888
01:01:05,993 --> 01:01:09,244
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

889
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:11,497
Those people you mentioned,

890
01:01:11,499 --> 01:01:13,246
the ones who aren't falling into line,

891
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:15,231
round them up.

892
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:40,190
Excuse me.

893
01:01:52,702 --> 01:01:53,685
Sorry about that.

894
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:55,932
These bloody things are everywhere.

895
01:01:56,794 --> 01:01:57,863
Come on.

896
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:34,515
You'll be safe here.

897
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:45,380
Are we cool?

898
01:03:48,919 --> 01:03:50,454
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

899
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:53,357
So how long have you been like that?

900
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:55,025
Like what?

901
01:03:55,379 --> 01:03:56,473
Like this.

902
01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:58,705
Big, green and stupid.

903
01:04:00,163 --> 01:04:01,718
Hulk always Hulk.

904
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:07,999
How'd you get here?

905
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:10,208
Winning.

906
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:11,395
You mean cheating?

907
01:04:11,787 --> 01:04:13,758
Were they wearing one
of these when you won?

908
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:15,725
How'd you arrive here?

909
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:19,770
Quinjet.

910
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:22,728
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

911
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:29,457
That's naked.

912
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:31,066
He's very naked.

913
01:04:34,756 --> 01:04:36,951
It's in my brain now.

914
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:38,898
Quinjet.

915
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:50,794
Yes. Yes.

916
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:52,096
I'm getting us out of here.

917
01:04:52,615 --> 01:04:53,731
This is a terrible,

918
01:04:53,733 --> 01:04:54,952
awful place.

919
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:56,660
You're gonna love Asgard.

920
01:04:56,662 --> 01:04:59,187
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

921
01:04:59,238 --> 01:05:00,371
Hulk stay.

922
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:01,698
No, no, no. My...

923
01:05:01,888 --> 01:05:04,116
My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

924
01:05:04,962 --> 01:05:06,695
We must prevent Ragnarok.

925
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:08,162
Ragnarok?

926
01:05:08,164 --> 01:05:10,161
The prophesied death
of my home world.

927
01:05:10,162 --> 01:05:11,691
The end of days, it's the end of ev...

928
01:05:13,503 --> 01:05:15,744
If you help me get back to Asgard,

929
01:05:15,972 --> 01:05:17,685
I can help you get back to Earth.

930
01:05:18,121 --> 01:05:19,255
Earth hate Hulk.

931
01:05:19,288 --> 01:05:21,262
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

932
01:05:21,277 --> 01:05:22,476
You're one of the Avengers.

933
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:24,348
One of the team, one of our friends.

934
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,413
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

935
01:05:26,415 --> 01:05:27,681
You're Banner's friend.

936
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:29,948
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

937
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:31,028
Banner's friend.

938
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,319
I don't even like Banner.

939
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,783
I'm into numbers
and science and stuff.

940
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:37,491
Thor go. Hulk stay.

941
01:05:37,493 --> 01:05:38,275
Fine.

942
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:40,261
Stay here.

943
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:43,379
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

944
01:05:43,382 --> 01:05:46,115
The red, the white.
Just pick a color.

945
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,270
Ridiculous.

946
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,018
Smash you.

947
01:05:49,304 --> 01:05:51,672
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

948
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:54,010
I smashed you.
Yeah, sure, sure.

949
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:55,682
Baby arms.
What?

950
01:05:55,943 --> 01:05:56,830
Baby.

951
01:05:57,065 --> 01:05:58,799
Moron! You big child.

952
01:05:58,850 --> 01:05:59,764
Thor go!

953
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:00,907
I am going.

954
01:06:06,053 --> 01:06:07,299
Thor go again.

955
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:13,076
Thor home.

956
01:06:23,334 --> 01:06:24,723
Hulk trains.

957
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,004
That's great. Have fun.

958
01:06:27,063 --> 01:06:29,020
Hey, big guy. Angry girl.

959
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:30,236
What have you been up to?

960
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:31,388
Winning.

961
01:06:42,016 --> 01:06:44,969
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

962
01:06:46,771 --> 01:06:48,775
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

963
01:06:50,698 --> 01:06:51,968
Help me see.

964
01:07:02,308 --> 01:07:04,426
I see you, but you're far away.

965
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:06,917
What's going on here?

966
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:08,179
Come see for yourself.

967
01:07:10,957 --> 01:07:14,215
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.

968
01:07:14,217 --> 01:07:17,579
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

969
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:19,392
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

970
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:24,367
We won't last long if we stay.

971
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,159
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.

972
01:07:28,161 --> 01:07:28,939
Come on.

973
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,606
Hela is ravenous.

974
01:07:34,939 --> 01:07:36,006
If I let her leave,

975
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:37,800
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

976
01:07:38,378 --> 01:07:39,218
We need you.

977
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,497
I'm working on it. But I don't
even know where the hell I am.

978
01:07:41,582 --> 01:07:43,450
You're on a planet
surrounded by doorways.

979
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:44,860
Go through one.
Which one?

980
01:07:45,043 --> 01:07:46,275
The big one.

981
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:16,564
Thor sad.

982
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:17,733
Shut up.

983
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:22,028
Thor sad.

984
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:24,721
I'm not sad, you idiot.

985
01:08:25,262 --> 01:08:26,126
I'm pissed off!

986
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:30,720
Angry. I lost my father.

987
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:33,004
I lost my hammer.

988
01:08:34,082 --> 01:08:35,898
You're not even listening.
Whining and crying.

989
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,567
Cry like baby.

990
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:39,238
Don't kick stuff.

991
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:42,739
You're being a really bad friend.

992
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,027
You bad friend!

993
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:45,427
You know what we call you?
No.

994
01:08:45,429 --> 01:08:47,391
We call you the stupid Avenger.

995
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:49,323
You're tiny Avenger!

996
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:53,290
What, are you crazy?

997
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:54,087
Yes.

998
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,039
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

999
01:09:17,676 --> 01:09:18,594
No.

1000
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:23,080
I'm sorry...

1001
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,970
I said those things.

1002
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:26,765
You're not the stupid Avenger.

1003
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:28,816
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

1004
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:30,737
It's ok.

1005
01:09:31,261 --> 01:09:33,922
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.

1006
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:36,672
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.

1007
01:09:36,827 --> 01:09:39,026
Hulk always, always angry.

1008
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:41,370
I know. We're the same, you and I.

1009
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:43,731
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

1010
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:47,704
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

1011
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,539
We're kind of both like fire.

1012
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:52,355
But Hulk like real fire.

1013
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,977
Hulk like raging fire.

1014
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:58,573
Thor like smoldering fire.

1015
01:10:00,783 --> 01:10:02,717
Hulk, I need you
to do something for me.

1016
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:10,485
Angry girl.

1017
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:20,079
What's going on? What are you...

1018
01:10:29,445 --> 01:10:31,444
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell,

1019
01:10:31,446 --> 01:10:33,356
when someone's hiding all
the way across the universe

1020
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:34,448
and wants to be left alone.

1021
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,954
We need to talk.
No, you wanna talk to me.

1022
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:38,776
I need her to stay.

1023
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:39,625
Stay?

1024
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:41,309
Block.

1025
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:44,428
Stay.

1026
01:10:45,027 --> 01:10:46,896
Please.
Please.

1027
01:10:49,665 --> 01:10:50,666
Alright.

1028
01:10:52,802 --> 01:10:54,016
Here's the deal.

1029
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:56,626
I'll listen to you,

1030
01:10:57,735 --> 01:10:59,037
till this is empty.

1031
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,071
Asgard is in danger,

1032
01:11:02,073 --> 01:11:02,876
and people are dying.

1033
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:04,462
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1034
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:08,516
Finished. Bye.

1035
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:11,520
Odin is dead.

1036
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:17,216
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1037
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:20,087
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1038
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,037
I'm going to stop her.

1039
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:23,917
Alone?
Nope.

1040
01:11:24,066 --> 01:11:25,412
I'm putting together a team.

1041
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,259
It's me, you and the big guy.

1042
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:30,908
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1043
01:11:31,106 --> 01:11:32,697
It's me and you.

1044
01:11:32,973 --> 01:11:34,064
I think it's only you.

1045
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,491
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1046
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:39,333
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1047
01:11:39,881 --> 01:11:42,552
I'm not getting dragged into another
one of Odin's family squabbles.

1048
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:44,419
What's that supposed to mean?
Your sister.

1049
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:46,587
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1050
01:11:46,589 --> 01:11:48,025
When it grew beyond Odin's control

1051
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:49,487
she massacred everyone in the palace,

1052
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:50,744
and tried to seize the throne.

1053
01:11:51,197 --> 01:11:52,888
When she tried
to escape her banishment,

1054
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:54,713
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

1055
01:11:56,631 --> 01:11:58,229
I only survived because...

1056
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:03,499
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne...

1057
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,415
and it cost me everything.

1058
01:12:05,523 --> 01:12:07,014
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

1059
01:12:07,029 --> 01:12:09,701
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1060
01:12:09,776 --> 01:12:10,766
I agree.

1061
01:12:11,945 --> 01:12:13,382
Don't get familiar.

1062
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:15,218
I agree.

1063
01:12:15,483 --> 01:12:17,014
That's why I turned down the throne.

1064
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:18,951
But this isn't about the crown.

1065
01:12:18,953 --> 01:12:20,341
This is about the people.

1066
01:12:20,343 --> 01:12:22,478
They're dying and they're your people, too.

1067
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:23,492
Forget it.

1068
01:12:24,824 --> 01:12:25,789
I have.

1069
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:26,983
Ok.

1070
01:12:26,985 --> 01:12:27,759
Ok.
Good.

1071
01:12:27,942 --> 01:12:28,861
Great.
Great.

1072
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:30,176
Thank you.

1073
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,489
For what?
For this.

1074
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,378
Didn't see that, did you?

1075
01:12:36,809 --> 01:12:37,548
There...

1076
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:39,268
That's better.

1077
01:12:40,806 --> 01:12:42,387
You know, go ahead.

1078
01:12:42,742 --> 01:12:44,169
Stay here and...

1079
01:12:44,171 --> 01:12:46,776
enslave people for that lunatic.

1080
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:48,685
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1081
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:49,591
But me...

1082
01:12:52,152 --> 01:12:53,985
I choose to run toward my problems

1083
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,417
and not away from them.

1084
01:12:56,523 --> 01:12:57,393
Because that's what...

1085
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:04,137
Because that's what heroes do.

1086
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,508

1087
01:13:29,787 --> 01:13:30,629
Yes!

1088
01:13:45,637 --> 01:13:46,639

Yeah.

1126
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:37,729
What happened to your hair?

1127
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,604
Some creepy old man cut it off.

1128

It looks good.
Thanks.

1129

Nat is good, I'm sure.
Is she ok?

1132
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,806

Sokovia?

1133

Did we save it?

1134

Banner, listen.
What?

1135
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:54,160
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1140
01:15:59,635 --> 01:16:00,710

We need to move.

1164
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:06,939
No.

1165
01:17:09,136 --> 01:17:10,369
This is bad.

1166
01:17:10,371 --> 01:17:12,608
This is really, really bad.

1167
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:16,100
Thor,

1168
01:17:17,252 --> 01:17:18,827
I think I'm freaking out.

1169
01:17:19,212 --> 01:17:20,212
No, no, no.

1170
01:17:20,351 --> 01:17:22,447
Don't freak out. You're ok.
Put these on.

1171
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:23,815
These are Tony's clothes.

1172
01:17:23,817 --> 01:17:24,863
I know, come on.
Is he here?

1173
01:17:24,926 --> 01:17:27,053
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, ok?

1174
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:29,354
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1175
01:17:29,356 --> 01:17:30,657
Sun's going down.

1176
01:17:38,197 --> 01:17:39,687
I'm upset!

1177
01:17:43,102 --> 01:17:44,647
I'm very upset.

1178
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:46,561
You know what I like about being upset?

1179
01:17:46,563 --> 01:17:47,228
The blame.

1180
01:17:47,339 --> 01:17:49,707
Right now,
that's the mindset that I'm in.

1181
01:17:49,709 --> 01:17:50,975
And you know who I'm blaming?

1182
01:17:50,977 --> 01:17:52,476
Grandmaster, I can...
Hey! Hey!

1183
01:17:52,478 --> 01:17:53,599
Don't interrupt me!

1184
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:54,596
Here you go.

1185
01:17:55,482 --> 01:17:57,507
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1186
01:17:57,897 --> 01:17:58,972
He was interrupting.

1187
01:17:59,026 --> 01:18:00,961
That's not a capital violation.

1188
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,462
Where was I?

1189
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:05,043
My precious champion
has come up missing,

1190
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:07,223
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1191
01:18:07,427 --> 01:18:09,727
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1192
01:18:09,809 --> 01:18:13,223
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, you know.

1193
01:18:13,225 --> 01:18:14,197
I'm sure there is a big history.

1194
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:15,373
And your contender...

1195
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,192
My dear friend,

1196
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:19,253
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1197
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:20,685
I could bring them both back to you.
Alive.

1198
01:18:20,873 --> 01:18:22,275
I could do it in two.

1199
01:18:23,174 --> 01:18:24,211
I could do it in one.

1200
01:18:24,544 --> 01:18:25,638
Let's stop there.

1201
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:27,211
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1202
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:28,901
thinking about a public execution.

1203
01:18:30,249 --> 01:18:31,482
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little...

1204
01:18:32,485 --> 01:18:34,094
Who's gonna get him first?

1205
01:18:35,521 --> 01:18:37,516
So... you're on the clock.

1206
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:40,918
What have you done?

1207
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,286
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1208
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,324
It's Loki.

1209
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:45,401
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1210
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:51,172
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1211
01:18:51,174 --> 01:18:52,677
I don't help anyone.

1212
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,560
You're a Valkyrie.

1213
01:19:05,514 --> 01:19:07,884
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1214
01:19:08,657 --> 01:19:10,357
Choose your next words wisely.

1215
01:19:10,555 --> 01:19:11,726
I'm terribly sorry.

1216
01:19:12,065 --> 01:19:13,750
Must be a very painful memory.

1217
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,677
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1218
01:20:10,314 --> 01:20:11,579
The sun's going down.

1219
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:13,380
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low, shoot.

1220
01:20:13,382 --> 01:20:15,861
Sun's getting low.
Would you stop saying that?

1221
01:20:15,863 --> 01:20:17,084
I just need you to stay calm.

1222
01:20:17,086 --> 01:20:19,023
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1223
01:20:19,156 --> 01:20:21,088
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.

1224
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:22,032
Yeah. One.

1225
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,871
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1226
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:25,392
It's a new experience.
Oh my gosh.

1227
01:20:25,394 --> 01:20:27,395
My neurons, they're firing faster

1228
01:20:27,397 --> 01:20:29,311
than my brain can handle
the information.

1229
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:31,687
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1230
01:20:32,135 --> 01:20:34,002
I mean in the past, I always
felt like Hulk and I...

1231
01:20:34,322 --> 01:20:35,503
each had a hand on the wheel.

1232
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,433
But this time, it's like he had the keys

1233
01:20:37,435 --> 01:20:39,068
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1234
01:20:39,174 --> 01:20:41,005
Alright, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

1235
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,284
No, it's not what matters.

1236
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:43,476
What I'm trying to tell you, is that

1237
01:20:43,478 --> 01:20:45,145
if I turn into the Hulk again,

1238
01:20:45,313 --> 01:20:46,651
Banner may never come back.

1239
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:48,443
And we're stranded on a planet

1240
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:50,286
that is designed to stress me out.

1241
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:51,418
We're not stranded.

1242
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,012
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1243
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:54,323
Thank you.

1244
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:56,825
Not your home, though.
Asgard. My home.

1245
01:20:56,992 --> 01:20:57,747
What?

1246
01:20:57,911 --> 01:21:00,104
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1247
01:21:00,143 --> 01:21:02,663
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,

1248
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:04,345
who also happens to be my sister.

1249
01:21:04,347 --> 01:21:06,423
Ok, that is so wrong on so many,

1250
01:21:06,425 --> 01:21:07,927
I don't wanna fight your sister.

1251
01:21:07,937 --> 01:21:09,542
That's a... That's a family issue.

1252
01:21:09,544 --> 01:21:10,866
No, she's an evil being.

1253
01:21:10,868 --> 01:21:12,373
I don't care what she is.

1254
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,731
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.

1255
01:21:14,977 --> 01:21:16,176
What?
I just told you.

1256
01:21:16,178 --> 01:21:17,645
If I turn into the Hulk,

1257
01:21:17,647 --> 01:21:19,314
I am never gonna come back again.

1258
01:21:19,316 --> 01:21:20,314
And you don't care.
No.

1259
01:21:20,316 --> 01:21:22,283
No. No, no.
I'm putting together the team.

1260
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:23,684
The Hulk is the fire.

1261
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:25,618
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1262
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,307
What? What, no!
It's gross.

1263
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:29,243
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1264
01:21:29,277 --> 01:21:31,142
No! I don't even like the Hulk.

1265
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:32,524
He's all like,

1266
01:21:32,526 --> 01:21:34,260
Smash, smash, smash.

1267
01:21:34,262 --> 01:21:35,431
I prefer you.

1268
01:21:36,587 --> 01:21:37,384
Thanks.

1269
01:21:38,066 --> 01:21:39,564
But if I'm being honest,

1270
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:41,266
when it comes to fighting evil beings,

1271
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:42,935
he is very powerful and useful.

1272
01:21:42,937 --> 01:21:45,037
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1273
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:46,271
Is he though?
Ok.

1274
01:21:46,273 --> 01:21:48,157
How many PhDs does Hulk have?
Zero.

1275
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,082
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.

1276
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,378
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1277
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,064
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1278
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,126
What are you doing with that?

1279
01:22:00,127 --> 01:22:01,539
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1280
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,709
I need a disguise.
You are the disguise.

1281
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,735
I'll be Tony Stark.
What?

1282
01:22:05,897 --> 01:22:07,829
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1283
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:10,496
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1284
01:22:10,498 --> 01:22:12,064
Then why
did you dress me up like Tony?

1285
01:22:12,066 --> 01:22:13,197
Because you were naked.

1286
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,378
Ok, I'll give you that.

1287
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,468
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1288
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,103
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1289
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:19,066
Stop it!
I'm sorry.

1290
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:21,263
Why are you being so weird?
I don't know.

1291
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:24,108
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years,

1292
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:26,711
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1293
01:22:26,713 --> 01:22:27,418
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1294
01:22:27,911 --> 01:22:29,097
It's ok.
You're good.

1295
01:22:29,397 --> 01:22:31,215
Calm down. Calm down. Come on.

1296
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:32,718
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard,

1297
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,851
and you're not gonna have
to think about the Hulk ever again.

1298
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:35,728
Alright?
Alright.

1299
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,995
Hulk!

1300
01:22:44,216 --> 01:22:45,262
This is bad.

1301
01:22:49,535 --> 01:22:51,071
Banner! Banner!

1302
01:22:54,753 --> 01:22:55,510
Banner!

1303
01:23:09,887 --> 01:23:10,724
Banner!

1304
01:23:11,323 --> 01:23:12,286
Thor!

1305
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:24,678
Hi.

1306
01:23:24,942 --> 01:23:25,576
Hi.

1307
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:27,516
I was gonna do that.

1308
01:23:27,573 --> 01:23:28,835
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1309
01:23:29,023 --> 01:23:31,391
That's good.
What are you doing here?

1310
01:23:31,599 --> 01:23:33,424
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1311
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:34,877
Alright. I got sidetracked.

1312
01:23:35,314 --> 01:23:36,422
What's with the...

1313
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:37,750
It's my disguise.

1314
01:23:37,968 --> 01:23:39,301
But I can see your face.

1315
01:23:39,452 --> 01:23:40,952
Not when I do this, you can't.

1316
01:23:41,753 --> 01:23:43,620
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1317
01:23:43,622 --> 01:23:45,437
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1318
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:52,458
What are those things on her eyes?

1319
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,926
Are those the people that she's killed?

1320
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,511
She's so beautiful and strong...

1321
01:23:55,733 --> 01:23:56,679
Who is this guy?

1322
01:23:57,068 --> 01:23:58,121
He's a friend.
Me?

1323
01:23:58,123 --> 01:23:59,271
I'm Bruce.
I feel like I know you.

1324
01:23:59,794 --> 01:24:01,278
I feel like I know you, too.

1325
01:24:06,344 --> 01:24:08,594
Look, I've spent years in a haze,

1326
01:24:08,763 --> 01:24:09,779
trying to forget my past.

1327
01:24:10,141 --> 01:24:11,542
Sakaar seemed like the best place

1328
01:24:11,544 --> 01:24:13,682
to drink and forget and to die, one day.

1329
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:15,877
Well, I was thinking
that you drink too much,

1330
01:24:15,879 --> 01:24:17,253
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1331
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:18,655
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1332
01:24:19,647 --> 01:24:20,969
But I don't wanna forget.

1333
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:22,633
I can't turn away anymore, so...

1334
01:24:23,461 --> 01:24:24,938
if I'm gonna die, well...

1335
01:24:25,429 --> 01:24:27,163
it may as well be driving my sword,

1336
01:24:27,165 --> 01:24:28,698
through the heart
of that murderous hag.

1337
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:30,166
Good.
Yeah.

1338
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:31,902
So, I'm saying,

1339
01:24:32,075 --> 01:24:33,301
that I wanna be on the team.

1340
01:24:34,023 --> 01:24:35,049
Has it got a name?

1341
01:24:35,506 --> 01:24:38,375
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1342
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:39,338
Revengers?

1343
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:41,127
Because I'm getting revenge.

1344
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:42,688
You're getting revenge.

1345
01:24:42,689 --> 01:24:45,111
You too. Do you want revenge?

1346
01:24:45,944 --> 01:24:47,716
I'm... I'm un... undecided.

1347
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,375
Ok.

1348
01:24:48,445 --> 01:24:50,922
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1349
01:24:54,526 --> 01:24:56,273
Surprise.

1350
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,264
Just had to be sure.

1351
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:09,340
Hello, Bruce.

1352
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:14,275
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.

1353
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:15,810
Where are you at these days?

1354
01:25:15,812 --> 01:25:17,714
It varies from moment to moment.

1355
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,256
Is that a Dragonfang?

1356
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,180
It is.

1357
01:25:21,588 --> 01:25:22,888
Oh my God.

1358
01:25:24,095 --> 01:25:25,904
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1359
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:29,322
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as
far apart as any two known systems.

1360
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:32,071
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1361
01:25:32,101 --> 01:25:34,202
Refuel on Xandar
and we can be back in Asgard

1362
01:25:34,204 --> 01:25:35,886
in 18 months.

1363
01:25:35,899 --> 01:25:36,634
Nope.

1364
01:25:37,118 --> 01:25:39,020
We are going through the big one.

1365
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:40,734
The Devil's Anus?

1366
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:41,787
Anus?

1367
01:25:42,172 --> 01:25:43,100
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1368
01:25:43,102 --> 01:25:45,260
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.

1369
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:47,525
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star,

1370
01:25:47,527 --> 01:25:49,637
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1371
01:25:49,639 --> 01:25:50,938
We need another ship.

1372
01:25:51,142 --> 01:25:52,641
That would tear mine to pieces.

1373
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:54,258
She's right. We need
one that can withstand

1374
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,077
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1375
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:57,961
And has an offline
power steering system,

1376
01:25:57,963 --> 01:26:00,275
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1377
01:26:00,346 --> 01:26:02,970
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die, so...

1378
01:26:03,173 --> 01:26:03,890
drinks!

1379
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,224
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

1380
01:26:06,226 --> 01:26:07,716
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

1381
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:08,858
What do you say?

1382
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,774
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1383
01:26:11,935 --> 01:26:13,193
Talk about an adventure.

1384
01:26:14,228 --> 01:26:15,440
We need a ship. Need a ship.

1385
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:16,470
There are one or two ships.

1386
01:26:16,794 --> 01:26:19,107
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose,

1387
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:24,400
But, the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1388
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,580
I may even have stolen

1389
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:28,477
the access codes
to his security system.

1390
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:29,683
And suddenly you're overcome

1391
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:30,951
with an urge to do the right thing.

1392
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:31,842
Heavens, no.

1393
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,820
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,

1394
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:35,676
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,

1395
01:26:35,743 --> 01:26:37,622
I'm asking for safe passage,

1396
01:26:37,997 --> 01:26:39,005
through the Anus.

1397
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:40,965
You're telling us that you can get us

1398
01:26:41,223 --> 01:26:44,131
access into the garage,
without setting off any alarms?

1399
01:26:44,312 --> 01:26:45,669
Yes, brother. I can.

1400
01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:46,785
Ok, can I just, just a...

1401
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,706
A quick FYI.

1402
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:50,670
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago,

1403
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:53,406
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1404
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,243
He did try to kill me.

1405
01:26:54,245 --> 01:26:56,239
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1406
01:26:56,346 --> 01:26:58,010
There was one time
when we were children he...

1407
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,912
he transformed himself into a snake,

1408
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,277
and he knows that I love snakes.

1409
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,150
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it,

1410
01:27:03,213 --> 01:27:04,718
and he transformed back into himself

1411
01:27:04,763 --> 01:27:05,869
and he was like, Yeah, it's me!

1412
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:07,030
And he stabbed me.

1413
01:27:07,339 --> 01:27:08,960
We were eight at the time.

1414
01:27:09,575 --> 01:27:10,620
If we're boosting a ship,

1415
01:27:10,622 --> 01:27:12,608
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1416
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,325
Why not set the beast loose?

1417
01:27:14,327 --> 01:27:15,116
Shut up.

1418
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:16,594
You guys have a beast?

1419
01:27:16,596 --> 01:27:18,743
No, there is no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1420
01:27:19,195 --> 01:27:20,646
We're going to start a revolution.

1421
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,460
Revolution?
I'll explain later.

1422
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:24,847
Who's this guy again?
I'll explain later.

1423
01:27:26,101 --> 01:27:28,473
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1424
01:27:28,475 --> 01:27:30,009
all the stuff that's coming out of you...

1425
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,108
or are they eggs?

1426
01:27:32,266 --> 01:27:33,468
Looks like eggs.

1427
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:44,332
I'm looking for Korg.

1428
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:45,602
Who's asking?

1429
01:27:45,992 --> 01:27:47,258
I know you're asking, just...

1430
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:49,459
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1431
01:27:49,802 --> 01:27:51,764
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1432
01:27:55,367 --> 01:27:56,971
The revolution has begun.

1433
01:27:57,527 --> 01:27:58,523
Revolution?

1434
01:27:58,525 --> 01:27:59,694
How did this happen?

1435
01:27:59,805 --> 01:28:00,685
Don't know.

1436
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:02,940
But the arena's mainframe

1437
01:28:02,942 --> 01:28:04,973
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated,

1438
01:28:04,975 --> 01:28:06,778
and the slaves
have armed themselves.

1439
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,775
I don't like that word.

1440
01:28:08,828 --> 01:28:10,192
Which? Mainframe?

1441
01:28:10,334 --> 01:28:12,716
No. Why would I not like ainframe?

1442
01:28:12,718 --> 01:28:13,660
No, the...

1443
01:28:13,866 --> 01:28:14,886
S word. S word.

1444
01:28:14,987 --> 01:28:17,790
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1445
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:20,594
Ok, that's better. That's better.

1446
01:28:26,665 --> 01:28:28,534
Hey, so, listen. We...
We should talk.

1447
01:28:29,936 --> 01:28:31,040
I disagree.

1448
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,743
Open communication,

1449
01:28:32,745 --> 01:28:34,538
was never our family's forte.

1450
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:35,683
Yeah you have no idea.

1451
01:28:35,887 --> 01:28:38,392
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1452
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:39,666
Hello.

1453
01:28:40,363 --> 01:28:40,905
Hi.

1454
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:50,179
Odin brought us together.

1455
01:28:51,089 --> 01:28:53,633
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1456
01:29:00,186 --> 01:29:01,593
We might as well be strangers now.

1457
01:29:02,433 --> 01:29:03,623
Two sons of the crown,

1458
01:29:04,242 --> 01:29:05,205
set adrift.

1459
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,021
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1460
01:29:11,677 --> 01:29:12,775
Here's the thing.

1461
01:29:13,062 --> 01:29:14,682
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1462
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:16,328
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1463
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:19,695
Did you just agree with me?

1464
01:29:19,832 --> 01:29:21,349
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1465
01:29:21,603 --> 01:29:23,342
It's savage, chaotic, lawless,

1466
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:24,996
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1467
01:29:25,456 --> 01:29:27,026
Do you truly think so little of me?

1468
01:29:29,278 --> 01:29:30,677
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1469
01:29:31,962 --> 01:29:34,463
I thought we were gonna
fight side by side forever but...

1470
01:29:35,154 --> 01:29:37,291
at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1471
01:29:38,403 --> 01:29:40,065
I don't know, maybe
there is still good in you but...

1472
01:29:40,904 --> 01:29:44,069
let's be honest our paths
diverged a long time ago.

1473
01:29:49,046 --> 01:29:49,917
Yeah.

1474
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:53,591
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.

1475
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:55,120
That's what you always wanted.

1476
01:29:59,457 --> 01:30:00,633
Hey, let's do Get Help.

1477
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:02,425
What?
Get Help.

1478
01:30:02,866 --> 01:30:03,332
No.

1479
01:30:03,494 --> 01:30:04,559
Come on, you love it.
I hate it.

1480
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:05,669
It's great. It works every time.

1481
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:07,038
It's humiliating.
Do you have a better plan?

1482
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:08,376
No.
We're doing it.

1483
01:30:08,932 --> 01:30:10,643
We are not doing Get Help.

1484
01:30:11,776 --> 01:30:13,292
Get help! Please!

1485
01:30:13,518 --> 01:30:14,502
My brother, he's dying.

1486
01:30:14,683 --> 01:30:16,367
Get help! Help him!

1487
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:19,507
Classic.

1488
01:30:20,151 --> 01:30:21,009
Still hate it.

1489
01:30:21,303 --> 01:30:23,155
It's humiliating.
Not for me, it's not.

1490
01:30:23,846 --> 01:30:25,706
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1491
01:30:26,382 --> 01:30:27,306
The Commodore.

1492
01:30:27,821 --> 01:30:28,488
Right.

1493
01:30:31,688 --> 01:30:33,563
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1494
01:30:37,535 --> 01:30:38,356
Loki.

1495
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:40,829
I know I've betrayed you
many times before,

1496
01:30:40,831 --> 01:30:42,839
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1497
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:44,366
The reward for your capture,

1498
01:30:44,634 --> 01:30:45,900
will set me up nicely.

1499
01:30:46,055 --> 01:30:47,568
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1500
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:49,029
Easier to let it burn.

1501
01:30:49,573 --> 01:30:50,574
I agree.

1502
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:00,544
That looks painful.

1503
01:31:01,572 --> 01:31:02,634
Dear brother,

1504
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:04,345
you're becoming predictable.

1505
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:05,683
I trust you,

1506
01:31:05,754 --> 01:31:08,202
you betray me round
and round in circles we go.

1507
01:31:08,724 --> 01:31:09,902
See Loki, life is about,

1508
01:31:09,904 --> 01:31:12,159
it's about growth.
It's about change but...

1509
01:31:12,161 --> 01:31:15,099
you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1510
01:31:15,965 --> 01:31:17,798
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

1511
01:31:18,259 --> 01:31:20,351
you'll always be the God of Mischief,

1512
01:31:20,957 --> 01:31:22,426
but you could be more.

1513
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:27,007
I'll just put this over here for you.

1514
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:30,568
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck I guess.

1515
01:31:36,285 --> 01:31:37,918
Alright, I can figure this out.

1516
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:39,695
It's just another spaceship.

1517
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:54,226
<i>Loyal Sakaarians,</i>

1518
01:31:54,701 --> 01:31:56,598
<i>Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship</i>

1519
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,200
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

1520
01:31:59,674 --> 01:32:01,581
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.</i>

1521
01:32:01,921 --> 01:32:02,941
<i>Bring him down.</i>

1522
01:32:02,943 --> 01:32:04,589
<i>Do not let him leave this planet.</i>

1523
01:32:17,758 --> 01:32:19,126
Good shot! Thanks.

1524
01:32:21,896 --> 01:32:23,015
<i>Open the doors.</i>

1525
01:32:23,196 --> 01:32:23,925
Ok.

1526
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:31,871
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1527
01:32:31,873 --> 01:32:32,740
Why?

1528
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:47,218
Shouldn't we be
shooting back or something?

1529
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:48,350
Yes, we should.

1530
01:32:48,588 --> 01:32:50,621
Where are the guns on this ship?

1531
01:32:50,623 --> 01:32:51,917
<i>There aren't any.</i>

1532
01:32:51,919 --> 01:32:53,719
It's a leisure vessel.
<i>What?</i>

1533
01:32:53,721 --> 01:32:55,666
Grandmaster uses it
for his good times,

1534
01:32:55,668 --> 01:32:56,861
orgies and stuff.

1535
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:59,663
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?

1536
01:32:59,835 --> 01:33:00,507
Yeah.

1537
01:33:00,968 --> 01:33:02,103
Don't touch anything.

1538
01:33:22,498 --> 01:33:23,500
No! No!

1539
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:28,029
No! No!

1540
01:33:35,001 --> 01:33:36,200
Get inside!

1541
01:33:36,202 --> 01:33:37,585
In a minute.

1542
01:33:49,215 --> 01:33:51,077
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1543
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:52,677
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1544
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:54,579
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1545
01:33:54,886 --> 01:33:58,123
No, no, no. None of them
are for flying alien spaceships!

1546
01:34:32,456 --> 01:34:33,356
Ok, come on.

1547
01:34:33,765 --> 01:34:35,282
There's got to be a gun
on this thing.

1548
01:34:35,993 --> 01:34:36,941
That looks like a gun.

1549
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:39,728
♪ <i>It's my birthday</i> ♪

1550
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:41,431
♪ <i>It's my birthday</i> ♪

1551
01:34:41,433 --> 01:34:42,913
♪ <i>It's my birthday</i> ♪

1552
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:51,863
Yeah!

1553
01:35:09,192 --> 01:35:11,396
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1554
01:35:18,438 --> 01:35:19,235
There she is.

1555
01:35:19,555 --> 01:35:21,000
Our ticket out of here.

1556
01:35:21,938 --> 01:35:23,085
Hey, what's this?

1557
01:35:28,384 --> 01:35:29,071
Thank you.

1558
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:32,140
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1559
01:35:32,148 --> 01:35:32,974
You wanna come?

1560
01:35:33,681 --> 01:35:35,284
You do seem like...

1561
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,775
you're in desperate need
of leadership.

1562
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,005
Why, thank you.

1563
01:35:43,192 --> 01:35:44,262
Here we go.

1564
01:35:50,933 --> 01:35:51,999
Shit.

1565
01:36:09,285 --> 01:36:10,784
Asgardians,

1566
01:36:11,408 --> 01:36:13,737
some misguided soul,

1567
01:36:14,557 --> 01:36:16,418
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1568
01:36:16,977 --> 01:36:18,761
Tell us where it is,

1569
01:36:19,294 --> 01:36:21,667
or there will be consequences.

1570
01:36:25,887 --> 01:36:26,988
Bad ones.

1571
01:36:30,173 --> 01:36:31,078
Well?

1572
01:36:38,246 --> 01:36:39,113
You.

1573
01:37:15,633 --> 01:37:16,660
Well?

1574
01:37:17,997 --> 01:37:19,207
Executioner?

1575
01:37:24,592 --> 01:37:25,629
Wait!

1576
01:37:26,234 --> 01:37:26,779
Wait!

1577
01:37:29,497 --> 01:37:30,648
I know where the sword is.

1578
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:15,191
I never thought I'd be back here.

1579
01:38:19,411 --> 01:38:20,959
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1580
01:38:21,217 --> 01:38:23,079
I mean, not that it's not nice.

1581
01:38:23,081 --> 01:38:24,582
It's. It's. It's. It's just, it's on fire.

1582
01:38:24,584 --> 01:38:25,992
Here, up here in the mountains.

1583
01:38:26,055 --> 01:38:28,452
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1584
01:38:28,454 --> 01:38:29,587
She's coming for them.

1585
01:38:29,589 --> 01:38:31,679
Ok, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.

1586
01:38:31,681 --> 01:38:33,123
And get yourself killed?

1587
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:34,894
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1588
01:38:34,896 --> 01:38:36,016
While I'm dealing with Hela,

1589
01:38:36,018 --> 01:38:37,806
I need you two
to help get everyone off Asgard.

1590
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,495
How the hell are we supposed
to do that?

1591
01:38:40,133 --> 01:38:41,636
I have a man on the ground.

1592
01:38:47,833 --> 01:38:48,835
Asgard.

1593
01:38:52,003 --> 01:38:53,095
She's here.

1594
01:39:05,058 --> 01:39:06,782
Now, the ship has a gun.

1595
01:39:06,784 --> 01:39:07,918
I'll take it from here.

1596
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,397
I found this in the armory.

1597
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,184
Good luck.

1598
01:39:18,005 --> 01:39:18,895
Your Majesty,

1599
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:22,340
don't die.

1600
01:39:25,177 --> 01:39:26,591
You know what I mean.

1601
01:40:25,735 --> 01:40:27,328
We must keep moving!

1602
01:40:28,372 --> 01:40:29,887
Go to the Bifrost!

1603
01:41:12,594 --> 01:41:13,501
Sister.

1604
01:41:16,185 --> 01:41:17,695
You're still alive.

1605
01:41:18,154 --> 01:41:19,804
I love what you've done
with the place.

1606
01:41:20,122 --> 01:41:21,534
Redecorating, I see.

1607
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:23,790
It seems our father's solution

1608
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:26,529
to every problem was to cover it up.

1609
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:29,237
Or to cast it out.

1610
01:41:31,358 --> 01:41:32,969
He told you you were worthy.

1611
01:41:33,621 --> 01:41:35,046
He said the same thing to me.

1612
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,984
You see?

1613
01:41:37,969 --> 01:41:39,258
You never knew him.

1614
01:41:40,375 --> 01:41:41,499
Not at his best.

1615
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:45,411
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations

1616
01:41:45,413 --> 01:41:47,008
in blood and tears.

1617
01:41:47,215 --> 01:41:49,593
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

1618
01:41:50,484 --> 01:41:51,297
And then,

1619
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:54,775
one day he decided
to become a benevolent king.

1620
01:41:55,357 --> 01:41:57,214
To foster peace, to protect life,

1621
01:41:59,161 --> 01:42:00,405
to have you.

1622
01:42:01,202 --> 01:42:02,620
I understand why you're...

1623
01:42:02,622 --> 01:42:07,098
angry and you are my sister and
technically have a claim to the throne.

1624
01:42:07,702 --> 01:42:09,703
And believe me I would love
for someone else to rule.

1625
01:42:09,705 --> 01:42:11,844
But it can't be you. You're just...

1626
01:42:13,388 --> 01:42:14,708
The worst.

1627
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:17,441
Ok, get up.

1628
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:19,903
You're in my seat.

1629
01:42:21,167 --> 01:42:22,909
You know, Father once told me,

1630
01:42:23,416 --> 01:42:26,185
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1631
01:42:26,187 --> 01:42:28,622
But must always be ready for it.

1632
01:43:00,687 --> 01:43:01,708
Go back!

1633
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:08,422
Go!

1634
01:43:43,974 --> 01:43:45,700
To be honest, I expected more.

1635
01:43:49,235 --> 01:43:51,039
Heimdall!

1636
01:43:52,638 --> 01:43:54,440
The sword!

1637
01:43:59,216 --> 01:44:00,819
Here's the difference between us.

1638
01:44:00,874 --> 01:44:02,411
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1639
01:44:02,413 --> 01:44:04,880
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1640
01:44:05,424 --> 01:44:06,685
And you're nothing.

1641
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:19,995
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

1642
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,611
Now you remind me of Dad.

1643
01:44:36,265 --> 01:44:38,255
The stupid dog won't die!

1644
01:45:00,018 --> 01:45:02,573
Everything's gonna be alright now.
I got this.

1645
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,387
You wanted to know who I am?

1646
01:45:05,876 --> 01:45:07,709
What the hell are you talking about?

1647
01:45:07,711 --> 01:45:09,247
You'll see!

1648
01:45:57,794 --> 01:46:00,095
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

1649
01:46:00,097 --> 01:46:01,730
I'll get that sword,

1650
01:46:01,732 --> 01:46:03,790
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1651
01:46:31,243 --> 01:46:32,278
Hey, man.

1652
01:46:33,661 --> 01:46:35,128
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1653
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:36,497
We're gonna jump on that spaceship

1654
01:46:36,499 --> 01:46:37,918
and get out of here. Wanna come?

1655
01:46:47,476 --> 01:46:51,348
Your savior is here.

1656
01:46:58,521 --> 01:47:00,059
Did you miss me?

1657
01:47:00,556 --> 01:47:02,229
Everyone, on that ship now.

1658
01:47:06,428 --> 01:47:08,694
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1659
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:09,830
Of course you did.

1660
01:47:27,195 --> 01:47:29,223
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1661
01:47:29,877 --> 01:47:30,840
You see,

1662
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:33,032
I'm not a queen,

1663
01:47:33,205 --> 01:47:34,646
or a monster.

1664
01:47:36,803 --> 01:47:38,290
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1665
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:41,562
What were you the god of, again?

1666
01:47:52,906 --> 01:47:54,567
Even when you had two eyes,

1667
01:47:55,733 --> 01:47:57,382
you'd see only half the picture.

1668
01:47:58,946 --> 01:48:00,116
She's too strong.

1669
01:48:00,173 --> 01:48:01,920
Without my hammer, I can't.

1670
01:48:03,015 --> 01:48:04,207
Are you Thor,

1671
01:48:04,443 --> 01:48:05,663
the God of Hammers?

1672
01:48:09,689 --> 01:48:13,158
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.

1673
01:48:14,434 --> 01:48:15,879
It was never your source of strength.

1674
01:48:16,744 --> 01:48:19,013
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1675
01:48:20,134 --> 01:48:22,572
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1676
01:48:24,092 --> 01:48:25,328
This could be Asgard.

1677
01:48:26,506 --> 01:48:28,640
Asgard is where our people stand.

1678
01:48:29,576 --> 01:48:30,689
Even now,

1679
01:48:31,518 --> 01:48:32,600
right now,

1680
01:48:33,008 --> 01:48:34,519
those people need your help.

1681
01:48:42,066 --> 01:48:43,607
I'm not as strong as you.

1682
01:48:46,936 --> 01:48:47,774
No,

1683
01:48:49,326 --> 01:48:50,352
you're stronger.

1684
01:48:59,639 --> 01:49:01,070
Tell me, brother.

1685
01:49:01,236 --> 01:49:03,487
What were you the god of again?

1686
01:51:19,141 --> 01:51:20,100
You're late.

1687
01:51:20,102 --> 01:51:21,295
You're missing an eye.

1688
01:51:21,444 --> 01:51:22,853
This isn't over.

1689
01:51:30,153 --> 01:51:31,922
I think we should
disband the Revengers.

1690
01:51:33,389 --> 01:51:34,703
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1691
01:51:34,824 --> 01:51:37,441
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.

1692
01:51:37,443 --> 01:51:38,444
It did nothing.

1693
01:51:42,198 --> 01:51:44,575
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1694
01:51:45,238 --> 01:51:46,386
It won't end there.

1695
01:51:47,102 --> 01:51:50,133
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1696
01:51:50,773 --> 01:51:51,941
She'll hunt us down.

1697
01:51:52,475 --> 01:51:54,241
We need to stop her here and now.

1698
01:51:54,243 --> 01:51:55,552
So what do we do?

1699
01:51:56,212 --> 01:51:57,484
I'm not doing Get Help.

1700
01:52:09,870 --> 01:52:12,286
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1701
01:52:15,296 --> 01:52:16,212
Loki,

1702
01:52:16,359 --> 01:52:18,731
this was never about
stopping Ragnarok.

1703
01:52:18,733 --> 01:52:20,505
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1704
01:52:20,902 --> 01:52:22,404
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1705
01:52:23,885 --> 01:52:24,976
It's the only way.

1706
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:27,409
Bold move, brother.

1707
01:52:28,844 --> 01:52:29,999
Even for me.

1708
01:52:33,482 --> 01:52:34,569
Shall we?

1709
01:52:35,817 --> 01:52:36,819
After you.

1710
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:03,356
This is madness.

1711
01:53:17,197 --> 01:53:18,866
Go! Go, now!

1712
01:54:20,018 --> 01:54:21,387
For Asgard.

1713
01:54:35,601 --> 01:54:36,692
Hela!

1714
01:55:01,525 --> 01:55:02,981
With the Eternal Flame,

1715
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,638
you are reborn.

1716
01:55:17,086 --> 01:55:18,610
Hela, enough!

1717
01:55:22,212 --> 01:55:23,601
You want Asgard,

1718
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:24,908
it's yours.

1719
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:28,253
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

1720
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,454
You can't defeat me.

1721
01:55:31,154 --> 01:55:32,276
No, I know.

1722
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:35,226
But he can.

1723
01:55:39,462 --> 01:55:40,400
No.

1724
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:52,267
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1725
01:55:52,767 --> 01:55:55,085
I am your reckoning!

1726
01:56:03,987 --> 01:56:05,140
The people are safe.

1727
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:07,459
That's all that matters.

1728
01:56:09,693 --> 01:56:11,558
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1729
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,960
I hate this prophecy.

1730
01:56:13,016 --> 01:56:14,854
So do I, but we have no choice.

1731
01:56:15,165 --> 01:56:16,863
Surtur destroys Asgard,

1732
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:19,236
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1733
01:56:19,536 --> 01:56:22,112
But we need to let him
finish the job otherwise...

1734
01:56:24,073 --> 01:56:24,844
No!

1735
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:29,203
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1736
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,686
Hulk, stop.

1737
01:56:39,688 --> 01:56:42,632
Just for once in your life,
don't smash.

1738
01:56:44,059 --> 01:56:45,365
Big monster!

1739
01:56:45,815 --> 01:56:47,027
Let's go!

1740
01:56:48,861 --> 01:56:49,714
Fine.

1741
01:57:14,223 --> 01:57:16,948
I am Asgard's doom!

1742
01:57:40,114 --> 01:57:41,681
The damage is not too bad.

1743
01:57:42,316 --> 01:57:44,200
As long as the foundations
are still strong,

1744
01:57:44,451 --> 01:57:46,017
we can rebuild this place.

1745
01:57:46,485 --> 01:57:48,451
It will become a haven,

1746
01:57:48,591 --> 01:57:51,396
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

1747
01:57:58,165 --> 01:58:00,615
Now those foundations are gone.
Sorry.

1748
01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:17,384
What have I done?

1749
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:21,085
You saved us from extinction.

1750
01:58:21,588 --> 01:58:23,457
Asgard is not a place,

1751
01:58:24,859 --> 01:58:26,231
it's a people.

1752
01:58:55,654 --> 01:58:56,910
It suits you.

1753
01:58:59,859 --> 01:59:02,463
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

1754
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:04,265
Maybe not.

1755
01:59:05,431 --> 01:59:06,425
Thank you.

1756
01:59:07,367 --> 01:59:09,362
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1757
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:14,922
I'm here.

1758
01:59:39,465 --> 01:59:40,558
Your throne.

1759
01:59:55,924 --> 01:59:56,784
So...

1760
01:59:58,136 --> 01:59:59,780
King of Asgard.

1761
02:00:09,693 --> 02:00:10,686
Where to?

1762
02:00:11,896 --> 02:00:13,040
I'm not sure.

1763
02:00:13,731 --> 02:00:15,096
Any suggestions?

1764
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:19,769
Miek, where are you from?

1765
02:00:19,771 --> 02:00:21,270
Miek's dead.

1766
02:00:21,976 --> 02:00:24,710
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1767
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:26,676
I've just felt so guilty,

1768
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:28,284
I've been carrying him around all day.

1769
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,881
Miek, you're alive!

1770
02:00:31,883 --> 02:00:33,204
He's alive, guys.

1771
02:00:33,206 --> 02:00:34,603
What was your question again, bro?

1772
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:37,124
Earth it is.

1773
02:00:37,437 --> 02:00:39,437

1774
02:02:54,088 --> 02:02:56,781
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?

1775
02:02:56,991 --> 02:02:57,990
Yes, of course.

1776
02:02:58,056 --> 02:03:00,041
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

1777
02:03:00,894 --> 02:03:02,459
Let me rephrase that.

1778
02:03:02,963 --> 02:03:04,864
Do you really think it's a good idea

1779
02:03:04,866 --> 02:03:06,299
to bring me back to Earth?

1780
02:03:06,768 --> 02:03:08,422
Probably not, to be honest.

1781
02:03:08,936 --> 02:03:10,435
I would not worry, brother.

1782
02:03:10,637 --> 02:03:12,390
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

1784
02:09:42,788 --> 02:09:43,791
Boy.

1785
02:09:52,331 --> 02:09:53,721
I just... I got to say.

1786
02:09:54,002 --> 02:09:55,493
I'm proud of you all.

1787
02:09:56,603 --> 02:09:58,642
This revolution has been
a huge success.

1788
02:09:58,783 --> 02:09:59,822
Yay, us!

1789
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:00,989
Pat on the back.

1790
02:10:01,606 --> 02:10:02,523
Pat on the back.

1791
02:10:02,781 --> 02:10:03,457
Come on.

1792
02:10:04,167 --> 02:10:04,746
No?

1793
02:10:05,444 --> 02:10:07,567
Me too. Because I've been
a big part of it.

1794
02:10:07,569 --> 02:10:10,206
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

1795
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:12,154
So, you're welcome.

1796
02:10:12,742 --> 02:10:14,851
And, it's a tie.
