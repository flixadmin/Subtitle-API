the acid would work on Neuman.

You didn't know, sir. Marvin,

The CIA is bankrolling you.

All due respect, ma'am,

324

you can always put Butcher back in charge.
He's right outside.

She goes by Annie now.

327

Can Annie burn out Neuman's
fucking eyes, debilitate her?

328

If she can get close enough to her without
getting her head popped off, who knows?

could scratch each other's backs.

into that posh VP slot,

558

Oh, you mean that nasty little virus
they cooked you up at Godolkin?

562
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,998
Yeah, I know about it,

563
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,376
and I know it ain't strong enough
to kill Homelander yet.

564
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,129
And then there's the hard place.

565
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:02,092
The full weight of the CIA
and my Boys working 24/7 to top you.

You need me.

from the Red River Group Home.

Mm. Stops them from printing it.

Sure. And Jeff Epstein killed himself.

591
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,985
No, the only thing these teens are
at risk of is being groomed

Homelander's verdict will
1,000% be innocent,

Annie, I'm happy to organize the protest
and-and make the speech,

but no one wants to hear it

599

-Well, neither am I.
-Then, tell that to her.

601
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,266
The whole reason I quit was
to get away from her.

602
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,352
Now, you're killing it
with the Starlighters.

You don't need me.

If... just if... you were Starlight,

then maybe we'd drum up
some real donations.

but as Annie January.

-Just Sage.

Right.

Based on your public appearances,

now it's every 2.4 weeks.

-or is she hiding it?

You've been washing them more often,

658
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,995
so likely you've been
peeing more often, which makes sense.

659
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,914
You got a lot of power, but you do age.

660

Plus, there's that small matter
your own father almost killed you.

[chuckles] Wow.

You are welcome to laser me,

666

Hmm.

668
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,067
I need advice.

From someone on my level.

670
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,367
Of course, if you breathe a word of this,
I'll pull you apart bit by bit.

Naturally.

And yet they control everything.

and I couldn't even give him that.

I didn't ask.

that's the end of the world.

Be the man that I married.
