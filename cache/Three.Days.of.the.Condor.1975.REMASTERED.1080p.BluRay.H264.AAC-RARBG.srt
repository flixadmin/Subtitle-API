00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:09,124
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR

2
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:50,791
TeIl her what you got. - MaIe,
Caucasian, appears to have been shot.

3
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,875
Where? - In his room.
- Very funny, HaroId.

4
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:59,833
The wound is just beIow the heart.
- Shot once? - Seems to have been.

5
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,040
Turner ...?

6
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,541
Dr. Lappe, l'm sure he's going to be
here any second now. - ReaIly?

7
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,541
Mr. Turner is late again.

8
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,332
Let's get back to work.
- We can do that in five minutes.

9
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,958
You know what Joey would say?
- Come on!

10
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:46,249
What kind of a slug?
- You're missing the point.

11
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,583
The machine wilI come back with a
rephrase. - What do we feed in?

12
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:59,124
Turner, Joseph. - 1 7 minutes Iate.
- Make it 1 2, there was a headwind.

13
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,791
Dr. Lappe, anything in the
earIy pouch for me?

14
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,499
Dr. Lappe?

15
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,833
Nothing in response to your report.

16
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:13,249
Please analyze the book on your desk
by 4 o'cIock. - Yes, sir.

17
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,624
I'd move the Tolmiea to the light,

18
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,249
the leaves are getting a blight.

19
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,040
At ease, Sarge, at ease.
It's going to rain today, at 1 0:20.

20
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,082
There must be more details.
- I only read two chapters.

21
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:36,583
No other clues?
- What time did they find him?

22
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:41,583
Doesn't say. Just early evening.
- They never said what caIiber.

23
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,166
Apparently a .38.
- Why "apparently?"

24
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:49,791
The entry wound was characteristic of
a .38, but the sIug wasn't recovered.

25
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,708
Hey, we're getting somewhere.
- You guys figure it out.

26
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,166
l have Far East journaIs to read.
- Was the slug in the waIl?

27
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,207
No, there was no exit wound.

28
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,791
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book.

29
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,791
Hi. What we've got so far ...

30
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,666
Ice.

31
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,666
lnstead of Iead. lce.

32
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,624
The murderer pours water into a .38
caliber mold and freezes it.

33
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:26,624
He shoots the guy with the ice buIlet.
The cops find a few drops of water.

34
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,374
No bulIet, no baIlistics.
- That's great!

35
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,374
What is this?

36
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,249
Beautiful caIligraphy.
- What is it? - It means heaven.

37
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:47,499
Nothing eIse? - It can mean
"the best" or "tops". Why?

38
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,082
l'm not sure. - We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

39
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:57,124
TaIk to Sam about it.
- About this?

40
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,624
I did. He said, "that's interesting,
but it's not my department."

41
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,499
Which means he doesn't think there's
anything, just like Dr. Lappe.

42
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:11,499
And you. - There's not much.
A mystery that's been translated.

43
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,875
A mystery that didn't selI and has
been transIated into odd languages.

44
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,416
Turkish, but not French.
Arabic, but not Russian or German.

45
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,416
Dutch.
- Spanish?

46
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,875
Yes.

47
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:32,291
Where did you get that about the ice?
DashielI Hammett? - Dick Tracy.

48
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,541
Are you sure about this ideogram?

49
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,708
Look at this face. Could l be wrong
about an ideogram?

50
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:45,332
It's a great face.
But it's never been to China.

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ray, when can I get some
computer time? - Dick Tracy?

52
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,958
A very underrated detective.
- There's some free time at 2:45.

53
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,082
No, stay on scheduIe, l'Il get it.

54
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,541
Four pieces, right?
- Right. - HoId it!

55
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,833
Five.
- Affirmative, five.

56
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,291
Where is Mr. Heidegger? - He calIed
in sick. - ProbabIy hung over again.

57
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,374
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the fiIes and I

58
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,082
came across an inquiry he sent
to Persian GuIf command.

59
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,583
He did that for me.
- lt never went through my office.

60
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,040
I asked for some research,
he didn't feel it was important.

61
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:39,875
l wish you peopIe
wouId go through channeIs.

62
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,207
What's on your mind?

63
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,833
This was in the pouch
from New York Central.

64
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,833
HQ in LangIey says there's no other
source to support your theory.

65
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,457
CaIl this working on that book?
- l'Il have it by 4pm.

66
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:56,875
We have peopIe to service machines.
- These things just Iook compIicated.

67
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,666
l wonder if you are
entireIy happy here.

68
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,666
Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious Iimits?

69
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:10,040
I can't teIl people what I do.
- Why can't you accept that?

70
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,875
l actuaIly trust a few peopIe.
That's the problem.

71
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,332
lt's your turn to bring in lunch.

72
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,332
What time is it?

73
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:26,332
1 1 :22.
- The rain's gonna stop by 1 1 :30.

74
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,916
You can wait 8 minutes.

75
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:20,791
That's not a proper exit! - He always
goes out that way when it rains.

76
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,875
PersonneI should enter and exit
by authorized means onIy!

77
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,124
Shakespeare, how is it? - Terrific.
The rejection slips just pile up.

78
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,082
Know the feeling.
I aIways wanted to be Escoffier.

79
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:27,583
Maybe it's not too late. Van Gogh
was 30 before he began to paint.

80
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,291
No mayonnaise on Dr. Lappe's.

81
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,166
On the other hand, Mozart was 3 when
he started piano, and composed at 6.

82
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:41,207
Fast starter, probably better.
- Van Gogh never sold a painting

83
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,875
and Mozart died a pauper.
- Am l in the Public Library?

84
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,416
Hey, that's a very bright man!
- EducationaI. That's why I come here.

85
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,708
l come in here to get sick,
just like everybody else.

86
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:56,583
No butter on Ray's sandwich.
He gets very panicky about butter.

87
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,708
Mr. Jennings is in the back.
He'lI sign for it.

88
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,332
Here are the ...

89
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,457
Mrs. RusselI, the Curtis report ...

90
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,875
Would you move
from the window, pIease?

91
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:58,457
Pardon?

92
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,374
Would you move from the window?

93
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,833
I won't scream.

94
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,332
I know.

95
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,082
SmaIl breakdown in security there?

96
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,833
What are you doin'?

97
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,583
What the helI are you doing?
SIeep at night, wilI ya?

98
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,666
This is the Major.
- Joe Turner.

99
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:36,624
ldentification? - My name is Turner.
I work for you. Now Iisten ...

100
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,875
ldentify yourself.
What is your designation?

101
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:46,708
Condor. Section 9, Department 1 7.
The section has been hit. - Level?

102
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:53,499
LeveI of damage! - Everybody.
Dr. Lappe, Janice, Ray, HaroId ...

103
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,457
Are you on a company line?
- No, I'm in a phone booth.

104
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,291
You're in vioIation of
communication procedures, Condor.

105
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:07,000
Listen, you S.O.B.. l came back with
lunch and the whole house was dead!

106
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,958
Has the incident been discovered
by anybody outside the company?

107
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,207
l don't know. I don't think so.
- Are you damaged?

108
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,749
Damaged ...? No.
- Are you armed?

109
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,416
I have Mrs. ...I can't remember
her code name ... NightingaIe.

110
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:30,416
She was afraid of being raped.
l've got her gun. - ldentify it.

111
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,875
lt's a .45 automatic.
WiIl you guys bring me in, please?

112
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,249
I'm not a field agent.
l just read books! - Leave the area.

113
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,416
Alright.
Do I come into headquarters now?

114
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:45,875
Negative. Find a secure Iocation.
- Where?

115
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,124
Avoid any pIace you are known.
Do not go home.

116
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:54,000
Surface again in two hours
and caIl the Major.

117
00:21:55,709 --> 00:22:00,499
That'lI be 14:30 your time.
- Wait a minute, 2:30, right.

118
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,958
WaIk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up. - Don't hang it ...?

119
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:21,416
This is the Panic Officer.
Section 9-1 7 may have been hit.

120
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:28,040
Activate foIlowing procedures:
NY 1 -2-7, D.C. 4-6-9.

121

Researcher, Tidepool,
Iikes to read comics.

130
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,207
Who is it?

131
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,708
Hey, you ring my buzzer?

132
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,332
It was a mistake, buddy.

133
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,875
Not you guys!

134
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:07,583

Okay, button it up, Augie.
I'lI send you more janitors.

Grover speaking. - Higgins, Deputy
Director, NY. Give me Department 1 7.

139
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:36,749
Somebody took out
one of your sections: 9-1 7.

140
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,374
New York. Somebody got mugged, maybe?
- They were hit.

141
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:46,624
They're bookworms! - They got 7 out
of 8. We're on the shuttIe. 30 mins.

No. Can he say what happened?
- He was literaIly out to lunch.

144
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:58,499
What happened? - He's not in yet.

They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.

Who's this? - Deputy Director Higgins,
New York Center. Where are you?

00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,666
I need a code name, why don't you?

155

Where are you?

156
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:41,833
Here.

157
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,082
You alright?
- Are you insane? Everybody's dead!

158
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:51,875
Take it easy and we'Il bring you home.
Here's how:

159
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:58,040
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?
- Broadway and 71 st. - 73rd.

160
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:02,833
There's an aIley behind the hoteI.
One hour from now, at exactIy 1 5:30,

161
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:07,499
I want you to enter that aIley
from the 73rd Street side.

162
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,249
WiIl you be there?

163
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,457
The head of department came from D.C..
He'lI bring you home.

164
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:21,416
I've never met him. - Don't worry.
He's studying your photos now.

165
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:35,332
I don't know you either.
- We'Il meet.

166
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:40,583
He'lI carry a WaIl Street JournaI.
- There were two guys at my house.

167
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:45,124
What were you doing there?
- I was homesick. Who were they?

168
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:49,332
They were ours.
- What were they doing in my house?

169
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:53,958
I'm not going in any aIley
and fuck the WaIl Street JournaI!

170
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:58,749
Turner, it's been a Iong, bad day.
You've been under ... - Damn right!

171
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,749
Alright. We'Il bring a familiar face.
Somebody you know.

172
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,875
Who's Ieft? - You've got a friend in
statistics named Sam Barber.

173
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,541
You guys are something ...
- WiIl he do?

174
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,291
Yes. Sam wiIl do.

175
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:30,249
AIright, Turner. Stay welI
for 60 minutes and you're home.

176
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,457
Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

177
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,749
What is happening?
- l'Il talk to you in 60 minutes.

178
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,040
You've got 55.

179
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,916
This is ridiculous.
- It's standard procedure.

180
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,916
To pick up a friend?
- And you, Mr. Wicks? - No, thanks.

181
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,583
Side arm?
- Have you got a .45?

182
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,875
You bet.
- Hey, let me help you with that.

183
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,583
How Iong have you known Condor?
- Joey ...

184
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:11,416
Before he was a bird even.
We went to CCNY. My wife Mae, too.

185
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,749
Was she ever Condor's girI?
- Here you go, Mr. Wicks.

186
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,249
TelI me what happened today.
- When?

187
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,624
This morning. About those murders.

188
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,207
What murders?

189
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,000
Here he is.

190
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,000
Hey, Sam. Where's that other ...

191
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,583
What are you doing?
lt's him, it's him!

192
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,000
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.

193
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,332
08-1 1-56 ...

194
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:33,207
...1 72-208-875. Amount $51 ,86

195
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:37,249
Where's there enough snow this early?
- ln Vermont.

196
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,708
What's open, Sugar Bush?
- Not downhilI.

197
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:44,207
This is cross-country.
- Don't Iike the Iift lines?

198
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,749
474, thank you.

199
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,207
Kathy!

200
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,000
Kathy, where have you been?
Let me give you a hand.

201
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,374
Wait, I don't know ...
- Be quiet.

202
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:10,207
Get in the car.
Don't make a sound, don't be dumb.

203
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:22,708
Please don't hurt me. - Where
do you live? - BrookIyn Heights.

204
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,124
AIone?
- l Iive with a friend ...

205
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,958
You live alone. Come on, let's go.

206
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,958
Leave the stuff.

207
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,583
Hi, Kath.

208
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,040
You should have said helIo.

209
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,791
Where is it?
- Here.

210
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,166
"Condor shot us both."

211
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,082
That was the onIy statement he couId
make before they operated on him.

212
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:35,749
And the other man, Barber? Is he dead?
- Before he hit the ground.

213
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,708
A remarkable shot.
A half-inch above his flak jacket.

214
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,207
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?

215
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:52,833
"Two years military service,
Signal Corps,

216
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,541
Telephone lineman, switchboard
maintenance, 6 months overseas,

217
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:01,082
Separated 9/61 , worked at
communication research colIege."

218
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:05,040
The question was:
ls he quaIified with a handgun?

219
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,875
No, sir. M-1 rifle and carbine.

220
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:10,624
EvidentIy it was sheer luck.

221
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,332
Or else ...

222
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:18,541
Or eIse what? - Condor isn't the man
his fiIe says he is.

223
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,833
Where did he Iearn the basic moves?
- He reads.

224
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:27,000
What the heIl does that mean?
- He reads everything.

225
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,624
I don't understand ...
- Yes ... very good.

226
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:35,708
Has Operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing. - Extraordinary.

227
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,875
lt was very weIl executed.
- It requires planning, communication,

228
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:44,082
tracks.
I'm not asking for footprints

229
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:47,541
but a blade of grass,
a broken twig ...

230
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:52,708
Yes, sir. Wicks seems to be
aIl we've got. - Where do we have him?

231
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,958
We don't.

232
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:00,916
They rushed him to emergency
before we got word.

233
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:05,040
Maybe we should Ieak the name of the
hospital. Get Condor to make a move.

234
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:09,166
Don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

235
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:13,958
He does seem rather more interesting
than just another reader researcher.

236
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:20,583
ExampIe: Has he gone into business
for himself? Was he turned around?

237
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:25,541
Does someone operate him?
SexuaI? Broke?

238
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:30,291
VulnerabIe?
Could he be a soldier of fortune?

239
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:33,040
Did he arrange the hit?

240
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,749
Is that why he's stiIl in flight?

241
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,332
StilI, he may be an innocent.

242
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:45,207
But then, why didn't he
come in gently, with Mr Wicks?

243
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
"Tentrex Industries". - lt's a cover.
I work for the ClA.

244
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,958
Jesus, your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girI.

245
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:03,000
Look it up. "Tentrex lndustries".

246
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:09,374
And Iook up the number for the ClA in
New York. - You mean it's Iisted?

247
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,624
Under US Government Agencies.

248
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,374
ls this what you do?
This photography?

249
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:29,499
lt's the same number. You could have
had the card made. - But I didn't.

250
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,291
You reaIly get into it, don't you?
- Sit down!

251
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,583
l toId you I had a friend.

252
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:45,958
I take 1 5,5/34. What size are you?
- What are you, a cIown?

253
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:50,082
l'm scared! - So am I! - What for?
You've got a gun! - Yes!

254
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,166
That is not enough.

255
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:17,332
I work for the ClA,
I'm not a spy.

256
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,666
I just read books.

257
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,791
We read everything
that's published in the worId.

258
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:39,457
And we feed the plots,
dirty tricks, codes

259
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,457
into a computer and the computer

260
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,082
checks against
actual ClA plans and operations.

261
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:48,332
l Iook for leaks,
I look for new ideas.

262
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:54,791
We read adventures
and novels and journaIs ...

263
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,583
Who'd invent a job like that?

264
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,166
Listen!

265
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:11,875
People are trying to kilI me! - Who?
- l don't know, but there's a reason.

266
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,040
There is a reason!

267
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:22,416
And l just need some safe quiet time
to puIl things together.

268
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,708
Here?
- Here.

269
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,499
lt's onIy fair ...

270
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:52,666
Where's the guy with the shirts?
- He's skiing in the Green Mountains.

271
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,249
We want to go cross-country skiing

272
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:01,207
for a couple of weeks.
Away from everything.

273
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:09,875
What time's the news go on? Six?
- Six o'cIock. - 40 Minutes.

274
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,332
No, please ...

275
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:34,875
Lie down against the walI.

276
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,082
Put this arm behind you.

277
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,166
Now you Iisten to me:

278
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,124
I am tired.

279
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:49,082
l've got to cIose my eyes for a whiIe.

280
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:51,875
l can't think straight.

281
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:57,416
lf you try to move
or climb off the bed,

282
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,207
l'Il know it. I'lI feel it,

283
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:03,833
and l promise I'lI hurt you.

284
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:08,082
Can't I stay in the other room?

285
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:15,249
l beIieve what you told me.

286
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,708
No, you don't.

287
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:21,291
I don't know if l do.

288
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,749
That includes Condor, of course.

289
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,207
Yes, l owe you Condor.

290
00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:29,666
Otherwise ...
- "Otherwise" does not exist.

291
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:35,082
WiIl Condor take long?
- Do you want an estimate?

292
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:39,166
There is a time factor.
- AIways with you peopIe.

293
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:46,207
Condor is an amateur.
He's lost, unpredictable

294
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:49,457
and perhaps even sentimental.

295
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:52,124
He couId fooI a professionaI.

296
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,332
Not deliberateIy,
but preciseIy because he is Iost.

297
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,958
He doesn't know what to do.

298
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:05,374
UnIike Wicks, who has always been
entirely predictable.

299
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,207
The man Condor kilIed
in the alIey? - Some friend of his.

300
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:19,124
A close friend? - I suppose so. Why?
- It interests me.

301
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,499
What was his name?
- I don't know. He was nobody.

302
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,833
He was somebody for Condor.

303
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,749
Get his name and address.

304
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,291
Have it for me when I caIl you.

305
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,457
What about Wicks?

306
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:42,332
Do you want the firm to question him?

307
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:44,791
They wiIl, you know.

308
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:48,040
We don't want that.

309
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,749
Cost you nothing.

310
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,624
I was careIess with Condor.

311
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,708
Wicks wiIl be done for nothing.

312
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:05,040
What time is it?
- It's news time.

313
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:56,040
LoneIy pictures.

314
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,875
So?

315
00:48:03,709 --> 00:48:05,332
You're funny.

316
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:12,624
You take pictures of empty streets
and trees without leaves ...

317
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,708
It's winter.

318
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,040
Not quite winter ...

319
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,833
They look like ...

320
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:25,291
... November.

321
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,207
Not autumn, not winter, in-between.

322
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:35,000
l Iike them.

323
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:39,708
Thanks.

324
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:51,082
The shootings behind
the Hotel Ansonia remain a mystery.

325
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,457
The victims' identities
have not been reveaIed ...

326
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:57,708
Victims?

327
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:02,833
Can you say anything about a motive?
- Not at present.

328
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,374
Have you identified the victims?
- Insurance company empIoyees. - What?

329
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,166
Did the victims know their assaiIants?
- AbsoIuteIy not.

330
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:19,583
One man dead, one seriously wounded
in an alIey in Manhattan.

331
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:25,000
And the man with the gun
is stilI at large. - Sam!

332
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:32,457
Jesus Christ, victims ...
What is he saying?

333
00:49:35,584 --> 00:49:37,666
What happened in that alIey?

334
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:44,249
I didn't shoot him.
You shot somebody. - But not Sam!

335
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,207
Nobody in that alIey
said anything about the CIA.

336
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,374
But they were there.

337
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,207
You're telIing me ... - They had to
have been to change that story.

338
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,332
What did Higgins say?
He said he wouldn't be there.

339
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:13,541
The section chief was coming in ...

340
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,708
He'd have to reach Sam.

341
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,207
Sam wouId have to caIl Mae.

342
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:54,291
l need your car. - Grand theft! You
don't want troubIe with the poIice.

343
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,666
This guy in Vermont. What'Il he do
if you don't show up?

344
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,749
He probabIy caIl soon.

345
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,416
WilI he show up here?
- The gun gives you the right

346
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:12,332
to rough me up ... - Rough you up?
- Yes, what are you doing in my house?

347
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:16,416
Have l raped you?
- The night is young.

348
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:35,749
You don't believe anything l've said.

349
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:43,000
l beIieve
you're in trouble. In danger.

350
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:50,875
But l don't know what kind and I'm
not sure how much of it is made up.

351
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:55,583
It doesn't matter.

352
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,374
Wait a minute.
l'm trying to understand ...

353
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:06,374
What are you doing? Let me go!

354
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:15,791
You buIly!

355
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,457
Don't tie me up, please!

356
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:23,875
This is ...

357
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:28,332
... unfair!
- I know.

358
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:42,666
You're early.

359
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:44,583
Come on in.

360
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:48,708
Is Janice working Iate?

361
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,583
So is Sam.

362
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,040
Pour one for me, too, wilI you?

363
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:06,249
lt's their own fauIt
if we're zonked when they get here.

364
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,666
We'Il give 'em an hour and if they're
not here, it's just you and me,

365
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:17,082
just Iike old times ...

366
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,040
What is it?

367
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:26,749
What is it, Joey?

368
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:29,249
What's wrong?

369
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,249
How do you know Sam's working late?

370
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,000
What do you think he's doing?
- Did he calI? - 2 or 2:30.

371
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,040
What did he say exactIy?

372
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,082
He had the Center calI.

373
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:47,791
Who? - I didnt't recognize the voice.
lt wasn't the usuaI Iady.

374
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:07,207
Third damn time tonight.
lt's some creepy burglar.

375
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:11,332
l want you to get out of here.
- I can't, Joey, l'm cooking!

376
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:14,708
Go to BiIl and EiIeen's.
Stay there tilI l calI you.

377
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,916
Don't argue! Move!

378
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:23,666
Go upstairs and stay there.

379
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:27,916
Do what l'm telIing you!
Stay there.

380
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,666
I'lI calI you.
- Joey, you're scaring me!

381
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:27,332
Yours?

382
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,000
No.

383
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,958
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.

384
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,749
Kids ...

385
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,708
Probably the same everywhere.

386
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,749
That's the second floor.

387
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,708
l do it alI the time.

388
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,833
After you.
- Go ahead.

389
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:39,416
Anybody here good with a coat hanger?

390
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:44,040
l Iocked my keys in my car.
I'lI give you some money.

391
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:49,499
You can't telI me you never busted
into a car before. 5 bucks.

392
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:54,124
l don't have much time.
Okay? Come on.

393
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:57,082
Alright, 5 bucks.

394
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,499
l want you to answer the phone.

395
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:58,374
l'm not answering any phone!

396
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:01,207
Answer it!

397
01:01:01,709 --> 01:01:04,457
TelI him what a great
son of a bitch you are!

398
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,040
l want you to be casuaI and nice.

399
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:16,374
Where the heIl are you?

400
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:19,249
Ben?
- Who do you think it is?

401
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:27,124
You're supposed to be up here by now.
- l know ...

402
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,082
l was held up.

403
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:37,207
That's no excuse. Come on.
Does this trip matter to you?

404
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:40,082
lt matters.
- Yeah, sure ...

405
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:45,416
No, it does! - This has happened over
and over. Last minute some excuse.

406
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:49,457
No, this is different.
- What's up?

407
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,416
The car ...

408
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:58,291
... broke down.
- What broke down?

409
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:03,207
The generator went.
- That's gonna take for ever.

410
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:09,000
Maybe not.
I tried to caIl you before, but ...

411
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,833
The generator ...
... it's going to take too Iong.

412
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:16,207
Look, forget about the car.
Take the bus first thing tomorrow.

413
01:02:16,709 --> 01:02:18,916
I'lI try.

414
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:24,624
Try ...?
What's going on? Are you okay?

415
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:30,499
I'm okay. I'm fine.
- You don't sound so fine.

416
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,916
l wish you would understand.

417
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:40,416
I do. I do. It's just that
l'm disappointed, that's alI.

418
01:02:41,834 --> 01:02:47,833
I realIy wanted
to be with you up here.

419
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,291
I know.

420
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,583
We'lI have time.
- Yeah.

421
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:02,457
Get the very first bus
out in the morning, okay?

422
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,291
Alright.

423
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:09,332
Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

424
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,833
Listen, l'Il be going.

425
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:52,833
In the morning.

426
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,833
Where?

427
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,749
Was it aIright?

428
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:14,583
AIright?

429
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,958
Outside. Was it safe?

430
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,166
l'm not sure.

431
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,499
l wish l knew more.

432
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,207
About you.

433
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,082
Yesterday ...

434
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,791
Today ...

435
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,249
I don't remember yesterday.

436
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:58,374
Today it rained.

437
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,541
Why did you tie me up Iike that?

438
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:10,583
You thought l'd calI the poIice.

439
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,249
l wouldn't have.

440
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,124
Why?

441
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,791
Sometimes ...

442
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:28,124
... l take a picture
that isn't like me,

443
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:34,207
but l took it, so it is like me.

444
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:41,000
l put those pictures away.

445
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,624
l'd Iike to see those pictures.

446
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,291
We don't know each other that weIl.

447
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:58,749
Do you know anybody that weIl?

448
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,791
I don't think
l want to know you very weIl.

449
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,082
I don't think
you're going to live much longer.

450
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:13,416
WelI, I may surprise you.

451
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,875
You're not teIling the truth.

452
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:23,000
What? - You want somebody,
who's not gonna live much longer.

453
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,833
At Ieast somebody who'd be on his way.

454
01:06:29,292 --> 01:06:30,708
You take pictures.

455
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,499
BeautifuI pictures ...

456
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:40,666
... of empty streets and trees
with no leaves in November.

457
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:45,249
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

458
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:52,624
How much do you want?

459
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:02,833
I just want to stop it.

460
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,166
For a few hours,

461
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:16,374
for the rest of the night.

462
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,833
Then l'Il go.

463
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:37,958
What was his name?

464
01:10:38,876 --> 01:10:41,082
What did Higgins say?

465
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:44,833
Your Department Head'Il bring you in.
- l've never met him.

466
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,916
Anything in the early pouch?

467
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:11,708
HQ at Langley says there's no other
source to support your theory.

468
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,207
Wicks!

469
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:14,457
You didn't sIeep welI.
- You didn't?

470
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:16,457
No, you didn't.

471
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,457
You were up earIy.

472
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:23,291
I had some thoughts.

473
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:26,541
l've got a pIan.

474
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:30,499
l don't know
if it'Il work or not, but ...

475
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:37,416
... I'lI need your help.
- Have l ever denied you anything?

476
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,708
When things quiet down,

477
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:50,666
you reaIly are
a very sweet man to be with.

478
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,416
You had bad dreams.

479
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:59,000
You talked in your sIeep.

480
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:04,166
What did l say?
- Who's Janice?

481
01:13:09,709 --> 01:13:13,624
Was she a voIunteer,
or a draftee like me?

482
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,040
She was ...

483
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,082
... a friend.

484
01:13:21,584 --> 01:13:22,958
She's dead.

485
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:32,207
Do I have permission to shower?
- You don't have to heIp.

486
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:36,583
I'lI heIp. You can aIways depend on
the spy fucker.

487
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:48,374
I'm sorry ... - No.
- No, l didn't mean ...

488
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:54,082
l didn't mean to say that.
l'm realIy sorry.

489
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:58,291
l'd Iike to help you.

490
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:25,166
1 8 ... Isn't that ...?
- Yes.

491
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:30,374

Somebody's got to sign for it.

01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:55,749
She's not here.

01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,749
Okay, you can sign.

Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:15,207
Wonderful. - Government pens.

Let me speak to Mr. Wicks.

He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calIing?

515
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:58,583
How do you feel? Okay?
- What did you do to those peopIe?

516
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,082
What people?
l don't know who they are.

517
01:19:02,584 --> 01:19:06,708
l fiIe a report
and a guy in Washington reads it.

518
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:10,000
Then he comes to New York to shoot me.
- Did you know him?

519
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:15,666
No. - Did you know the maiIman?
- No,

520
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:21,291
but the guy in Washington did. - And

Has he gone doubIe or dirty?

01:19:33,959 --> 01:19:36,875
Iinking Arabic-speaking countries
with Spanish-speaking?

525
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:40,082
We're aIready visibIe,
let's not become conspicuous.

526
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:43,374
If our agents aren't enough,
use freeIance.

527
01:19:43,876 --> 01:19:46,624
Use whatever it requires, but end it.

528

Okay, Iet's get it over with.

He's in CIearance.
You passed it on your Ieft.

01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,457
Sorry, thank you.

535
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:32,708
I didn't get the job.

536
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,457
Looks good ...

537
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:42,833
l have this friend and he asked me
to give you a message.

538
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:49,958
Quote: "Mr Higgins, this introduces
a friend of mine, 'Sparrow Hawk'.

539
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:57,166
PIease accompany her
to the Nassau Street exit, now."

540
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:04,166
PersonalIy, l'd do it,
because he has this huge gun

541
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:08,166
and he's Iooking at us right now.

542
01:23:08,876 --> 01:23:12,624
l'Il save this for you. ShalI we?

543
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,040
To your left, pIease.

544
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:44,082
Okay, sit up!
Back up against the paneI.

545
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:47,916
Take it easy, I'm not armed.

546
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:51,916
They could be DF-ing us if you have a
transmitter hidden. What's this?

547
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:57,499
DF? You do read everything, don't you?
- Something is rotten in the Company!

548
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,833
You never compIained tilI yesterday.
- You never kiIled my friends before!

549
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,749
Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit. Society?

550
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:07,541
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

551
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,332
"Five Continents Imports".
Ring a belI?

552
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:15,457
Where did you get that?
- The maiIman.

553
01:24:15,959 --> 01:24:19,207
The one you sent
with the uniform, automatic gun ...

554
01:24:19,709 --> 01:24:24,833
We never use mailmen. - Would you
know a taIl bIond man, 6ft 4?

555
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:31,249
Strong like a farmer, not American.
Accent, maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

556
01:24:57,834 --> 01:25:00,166
Yes?
- Was the letter delivered?

557
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:05,749
The return receipt has not arrived.
- You shouId have done it yourseIf.

558
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:09,583
A more complicated package
had to be handIed.

559
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,332
But l might have
underestimated this one.

560
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:16,124
I was toId
you never make that kind of mistake.

561
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,499
What wiIl you do?
- Wait.

562
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,958
Then what? - PeopIe who move
Ieave word of change of adress.

563
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:29,082
l want to see that report.
- Do you know him?

564
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:31,791
ProfessionaIly, yes.
- He kilIs peopIe!

565
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Yes.

566
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:38,541
He works for the Company?
- Did once. He's a contract agent.

567
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:42,374
Freelance.
Where did you see him?

568
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:49,291
It would heIp if l knew.
- Help who?

569
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:53,124
Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody. - Terrific answer!

570
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:56,624
I know.
- What's his name?

571
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,374
When I knew him, Joubert.

572
01:25:59,876 --> 01:26:04,291
Who'd hire him?. You don't Iook him up
in the YeIlow Pages! - Right.

573
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:07,916
Have to be somebody in the Community.
- Community?

574
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:13,833
lnteIligence field. - "Community"?
You guys are kind to yourseIves!

575
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:19,749
l want to see that report. - It went
to headquarters and disappeared.

576
01:26:20,584 --> 01:26:23,624
Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

577
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:27,291
You teIl me.

578
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:34,958
l pick up traces of an inteIligence
network the company doesn't know.

579
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:40,499
And I report it. Now why is that
going to make anybody mad?

580
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:45,374
Unless it was the Company's network
and you didn't want it blown!

581
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:48,749
Somebody is lying, Higgins.

582
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:54,457
Come on. Why is everybody so shy?

583
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,457
I'm not shy.

584
01:26:58,709 --> 01:27:01,875
I don't know. That's what worries me.

585
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:06,749
l don't know.
- Ask Wicks. - Wicks died.

586
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:14,416
Someone yanked him off the
Iife-support system at the hospital.

587
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,708
Get me in, Higgins.

588
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:33,749
What good wouId that do, if they are
inside, what good wouId that do?

589
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,457
What should l do?

590
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:41,666
I'm sorry.

591
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:53,332
You're sorry?

592
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:58,583
l get it.

593
01:28:00,584 --> 01:28:03,541
You expect me to draw fire!

594
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:10,124
Like a penny arcade bear parading
back and forth waiting for somebody!

595
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:13,791
And you'lI pick him up
before he does it, or after?

596
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,916
l'm gonna cross-check aIl the names.

597
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,124
Nice taIking to you, Higgins.
- Wait, where wilI l find you?

598
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,207
I'lI find you.

599
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:34,082
Do you trust him?

600
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:37,416
Trust ...
- Does he trust you?

601
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:42,374
He can't trust anybody. - How couId
anybody sneak in and fool them?

602
01:28:42,876 --> 01:28:45,207
Maybe nobody did. - Then ...

603
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:48,457
Maybe there's another ClA ...

604
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:51,166
... inside the ClA.

605
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,374
The light's gone off!

606
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,666
lt's a hoteI room.
- What hoteI?

607
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:35,332
There's no tag. It's Room 81 9 in New
York. - There's a code on the edge.

608
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,708
You in the trade?

609
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:41,124
l read about it in a story.
- A story about locksmiths?

610
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:44,875
The Iock manufacturer
can give you the name of the hoteI.

611
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,958
l don't want to read
about you in the newspapers.

612
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,791
WiIl you make the calI?

613
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,166
l'm doing a survey.

614
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:37,124
Do you beIieve the condor
is an endangered species?

615
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,791
Your room number, please.
- 81 9.

616
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:10,332
I just had an interesting calI.
- Who is this?

617
01:31:10,834 --> 01:31:14,124
In reference to
an aIl but extinct bird, the condor.

618
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:17,082
Have you had such a caIl?
- You're a fool to calI me here!

619
01:31:17,584 --> 01:31:20,040
You had no such calI?
- No.

620
01:31:20,834 --> 01:31:25,416
Must have been the Audubon Society.
They're stilI in New York City.

621
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,666

I'lI be damned.

656
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:59,082
You Iook paIe.
- lt's the Iight in here.

657
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:05,624
What wiIl you do there?

658
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:09,124
See a guy.
- More secrets ...

659
01:37:09,584 --> 01:37:11,833
Like those pictures you hide.

660
01:37:12,959 --> 01:37:14,040
Yes ...

661
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:18,708
Someday I'd like to show them to you.

662
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:22,666
If you Iive through this.

663
01:37:23,667 --> 01:37:25,916
You could drive me to Washington.

664
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,791
No.

665
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:43,791
You have a lot of very fine quaIities.

666
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:47,332
But ...
- What fine quaIities?

667
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:58,416
You have good eyes.

668
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:03,583
Not kind, but they don't Iie,

669
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:08,374
and they don't Iook away much
and they don't miss anything.

670
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:13,791
I could use eyes like that.

671
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,291
You're overdue in Vermont.

672
01:38:23,876 --> 01:38:26,040
Is he a tough guy?

673
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:29,457
He's pretty tough ...

674
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:36,166
What wiIl he do?
- Understand. ProbabIy.

675
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,624
Boy ...

676
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,833
That is tough.

677
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:47,791
AIl aboard for Baltimore
and Washington D.C..!

678
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:54,040
Kathy ... I need time.

679
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:59,958
Eight hours or so, that's alI.
TilI noon, to do what I have to do.

680
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:03,833
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No.

681
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:06,207
Are you going right to Vermont?

682
01:39:08,458 --> 01:39:09,541
Yes.

683
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:13,875
What I mean is, don't calI anyone.

684
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:18,416
Don't stop, pIease.

685
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:21,499
Don't teIl anyone about ...

686
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:36,249
Jesus, I didn't ...

687
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:46,166
Hey, you take care of yourself.
- l'Il do my best.

688
01:39:48,667 --> 01:39:50,082
Do your best.

689
01:39:59,584 --> 01:40:03,249
Why aren't you further along?
- With the Company, sir?

690
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:07,040
You seem perfect for it.

691
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:11,541
Are you perfect for it, Mr. Higgins?

692
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:14,291
I try to be, sir.

693
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:20,332
You were recruited out of schooI?
- No, interviewed in Korea.

694
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,291
You served with
CoIoneI Donovan in the OSS?

695
01:40:24,792 --> 01:40:29,791
l saiIed the Adriatic
with a movie star at the helm.

696
01:40:30,292 --> 01:40:34,875
lt doesn't seem like
much of a war now, but it was.

697
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:37,499
I go even further back than that.

698
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,416
Ten years after the Great War,
as we used to caIl it

699
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:45,291
before we knew enough to number them.

700
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:49,207
Do you miss that kind of action?
- No.

701
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:53,833
I miss that kind of clarity.

702
01:40:57,667 --> 01:40:58,749
Yes?

703
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,124
Thank you.

704
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:06,374
He's being heId at New York Center.

705
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:16,916
Mr. Higgins, you do understand
the Company's position?

706
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,833
There's nothing in the way
of your doing this, is there?

707
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:09,040
What is this? What's going on?

708
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:40,666
Who are you?

709
01:42:41,167 --> 01:42:42,791
What are you doing here?

710
01:42:44,584 --> 01:42:46,291
I'm Condor.

711
01:42:49,959 --> 01:42:51,457
Sit down.

712
01:42:53,041 --> 01:42:55,040
What do you do for a living?

713
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,291
Don't be ridiculous.

714
01:42:59,417 --> 01:43:00,916
What do you do ...

715
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,332
... exactly?

716
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:09,541
Deputy Director of Operations.

717
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:13,082
What section?
- Middle East.

718
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,833
What are you working on?

719
01:43:20,292 --> 01:43:21,875
What are you doing?

720
01:43:23,709 --> 01:43:27,541
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the A.L.H.S.?

721
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:31,416
There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

722
01:43:31,917 --> 01:43:32,833
Yes.

723
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:40,708
lt was your network l turned up.

724
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:48,833
Doing what?

725
01:43:49,959 --> 01:43:54,541
What does Operations care about
a bunch of books, a book in Dutch?

726
01:43:56,167 --> 01:43:58,040
A book out of VenezueIa ...

727
01:43:58,876 --> 01:44:00,082
Mystery stories in Arabic.

728
01:44:00,584 --> 01:44:03,291
What is so important about ...

729
01:44:09,167 --> 01:44:10,708
... oil fieIds?

730
01:44:14,876 --> 01:44:15,916
OiI ...

731
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:30,583
That's it, isn't it?

732
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:38,791
This whoIe damn thing was about oiI!

733
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:42,000
Wasn't it?

734
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:45,291
Yes, it was.

735
01:44:46,876 --> 01:44:48,082
Don't turn around.

736
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,583
Put your thumb on the hammer.

737
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,583
ReIease it sIowly.

738
01:45:02,959 --> 01:45:04,833
Set down the gun on the desk.

739
01:45:11,542 --> 01:45:12,916
Don't move.

740
01:45:32,584 --> 01:45:34,666
You were quite good, until this.

741
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,332
This move was predictable.

742
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,583
What?

743
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:12,000
Did you touch anything eIse?

744
01:46:14,542 --> 01:46:16,374
You're working for the Company again!

745
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,958
The desk? The lamp?

746
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:24,332
Jesus, they took you back!

747
01:46:25,542 --> 01:46:28,207
Just for this. For Atwood.

748
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:33,583
He's with the Company! Why ...?

749
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:40,291
l'm not interested in "why", more in
"when", sometimes "where".

750
01:46:40,792 --> 01:46:42,541
Always "how much".

751
01:46:43,834 --> 01:46:46,749
l suspect
he was becoming an embarassment.

752
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:49,666
As you are.

753
01:46:57,709 --> 01:47:00,374
So you're not finished?
- Pardon?

754
01:47:00,876 --> 01:47:04,291
Oh, no, l had no arrangement
with the Company concerning you.

755
01:47:04,792 --> 01:47:08,291
They didn't know you wouId be here.
l knew you would.

756
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:14,833
Didn't you send the maiIman?

757
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:18,833
That was a business
arrangement with Atwood.

758
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:20,875
But you see ...

759
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:28,958
Come on.

760
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:14,541
TeIl me about the girl.

761
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:19,875
What about the girl?

762
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,708
She was chosen ... how?

763
01:48:24,834 --> 01:48:30,249
By age? Her car? Appearance?
- At random.

764
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:33,749
Chance.
- ReaIly ...?

765
01:48:37,792 --> 01:48:40,040
Can l drop you?

766
01:48:45,292 --> 01:48:47,875
l'd Iike to go back to New York.

767
01:48:50,584 --> 01:48:53,082
You have not much future there.

768
01:48:58,876 --> 01:49:00,457
lt wilI happen this way:

769
01:49:01,876 --> 01:49:03,374
You may be walking,

770
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:08,624
maybe the first sunny day of spring.

771
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:12,207
And a car wiIl slow beside you,

772
01:49:12,709 --> 01:49:17,416
and a door wiIl open
and someone you know, even trust,

773
01:49:17,917 --> 01:49:19,416
wiIl get out.

774
01:49:21,625 --> 01:49:25,000
And he wilI smile. A becoming smiIe.

775
01:49:26,959 --> 01:49:29,541
But he wilI Ieave open the car door

776
01:49:31,667 --> 01:49:34,166
and offer to give you a Iift.

777
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,082
You seem to understand it aIl so welI.

778
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:46,916
What wouId you suggest?

779
01:49:48,167 --> 01:49:52,916
PersonalIy, l'd prefer Europe.
- Europe? - Yes.

780
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:59,000
The fact is,
what I do is not a bad occupation.

781
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:02,374
Someone is aIways wilIing to pay.

782
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,000
l would find it ...

783
01:50:09,834 --> 01:50:14,583
... tiring. - Oh, no, it's
quite restfuI. It's aImost peacefuI.

784
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:18,749
No need to beIieve in either side,
or any side.

785
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:23,583
There is no cause.
There's onIy yourself.

786
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:26,499
The beIief is in your own precision.

787
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:35,374
l was born in the US, Joubert.

788
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:40,583
I miss it when I'm away too long.

789
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:42,958
A pity.

790
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,166
l don't think so.

791
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:52,708
Can you drop me at the station?

792
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:56,166
It would be my pIeasure.

793
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:07,000
For that day.

794
01:51:27,584 --> 01:51:28,416
Higgins!

795
01:51:50,792 --> 01:51:53,875
Why do calI so Iate?
We were worried. - Likewise.

796
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:58,583
ls the car for me? - Yeah, it's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

797
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:07,916
Let's say for the purposes of
argument, I had a .45 in my pocket,

798
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:12,624
you'd take a walk with me, right?

799
01:52:14,667 --> 01:52:16,124
Which way?

800
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:19,958
West. SlowIy.

801
01:52:20,458 --> 01:52:23,082
Stay in front of me 3 or 4 steps.

802
01:52:31,876 --> 01:52:33,416
Where are we going?

803
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:36,875
Wave them on ahead.

804
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,958
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

805
01:52:50,458 --> 01:52:53,249
Are you crazy?
- Am I?

806
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:57,000
Do we have pIans?
- No, absolutely not.

807
01:52:57,584 --> 01:52:59,791
We have games. That's aIl.

808
01:53:00,292 --> 01:53:05,624
We pIay games. What if?
How many men? What would it take?

809
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:08,499
How can we destabilize a regime?

810
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,666
That's what we're paid to do.
- WaIk on.

811
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:14,499
Go on.

812
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:23,708
So Atwood just took the games too
seriousIy. He was reaIly gonna do it.

813
01:53:24,208 --> 01:53:30,416
Renegade operation. There was no way.
Not with the heat on the Company.

814
01:53:30,917 --> 01:53:36,000
What if there hadn't been any heat?
What if I hadn't stumbled on the plan?

815
01:53:37,125 --> 01:53:41,875
Different baIl game.
There was nothing wrong with the pIan.

816
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:46,124
The plan was alright.
The plan wouId've worked.

817
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:49,207
What is it with you peopIe?

818
01:53:49,709 --> 01:53:52,833
You think not getting caught lying
is the same as teIling the truth?

819
01:53:53,417 --> 01:53:55,666
No. lt's simpIe economics.

820
01:53:56,167 --> 01:53:57,749
Today, its oiI.

821
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,624
ln 1 0 or 1 5 years it'Il be food,
pIutonium. Maybe even sooner.

822
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:06,332
What do you think the peopIe
wilI want us to do then?

823
01:54:07,792 --> 01:54:09,833
Ask them.
- Not now, then.

824
01:54:10,333 --> 01:54:11,916
Ask them when they're running out.

825
01:54:12,542 --> 01:54:16,833
Ask them when there's no heating.
When their engines stop.

826
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:20,374
When people who've never
known hunger go hungry.

827
01:54:20,876 --> 01:54:25,791
They won't want us to ask them,
they'Il just want us to get it.

828
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:28,416
Boy ...

829
01:54:29,542 --> 01:54:32,166

And the other side does too.

835
01:54:52,542 --> 01:54:54,958
That's why we can't
Iet you stay outside.

836
01:54:55,417 --> 01:54:56,875

How do you know they'Il print it?

848
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:18,916
You can take a waIk
but how far if they don't print it?

849
01:56:19,709 --> 01:56:21,708
They'Il print it.
