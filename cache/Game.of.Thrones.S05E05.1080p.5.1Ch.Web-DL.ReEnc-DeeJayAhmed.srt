is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

what happens to them?

You're condemning them to death.

Are you still angry with him after he...

331
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:09,570
What he did?

332
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:11,894
Don't worry.

333
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:13,972
The North remembers.

334
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:17,133
I punished him for it.

335
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,045
He's not ironborn anymore.

336
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:23,367
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

337
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:25,208
He's a new man.

338
00:29:26,924 --> 00:29:28,813
A new person, anyway.

339
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:30,531
Aren't you, Reek?

340
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,169
Yes, master.

341
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:35,167
That's his new name, Reek.

342
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:37,248
Why are you doing this?

343
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,329
Because Reek has something to say to you.

344
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:44,005
Don't you, Reek?

345
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:56,168
An apology?

346
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:04,814
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

347
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:09,368
Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

348
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,611
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:20,133
Look at her, Reek.

350
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:25,574
An apology doesn't mean anything if
you're not looking the person in the eye.

351
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:35,009
- I'm sorry.
- RAMSAY: Sorry about what?

352
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:37,809
For killing your brothers.

353
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:51,972
There, over and done with.

354
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:54,695
- Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.
- (SNIFFLING)

355
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:57,774

356
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:00,011
Whew.

357
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,247
You know what, my lady?

358
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:09,209
What with him having murdered your brothers

359
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:11,572
and the rest of your family gone,

360
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:18,168
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

361
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,133
that you have left.

362
00:31:20,884 --> 00:31:21,885
Reek.

363
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,095
You will give away the bride.

364
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:31,691
Someone has to. What better person?

365
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,050
Good?
Good?

366
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:36,451
Yes, yes, very good.

367
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:38,135
Wonderful.

368
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:43,811
Walda and I have some good news as well,
since we're all together.

369
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:51,525
We're going to have a baby.

370
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,888
I'm very happy for you.

371
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:04,367
From the way she's carrying,
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

372
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:21,689
RAMSAY: How can you be sure?

373
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:24,004
Sure of what?

374
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:25,415
That she's pregnant.

375
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:27,574
I mean...

376
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:29,654
How can you tell?

377
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:32,450
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

378
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:44,766
So, how did you manage it?

379
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,448
Manage what?

380
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:47,810
Getting her pregnant.

381
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:50,932
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

382
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:55,168
Of course, but how did you find it?

383
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:57,491
You disgraced yourself at dinner,

384
00:32:58,204 --> 00:33:00,366
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

385
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:01,849
- And if it's a boy?
- (CHUCKLES)

386
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:06,774
You're worried about your position.

387
00:33:06,844 --> 00:33:08,846
My position is quite clear.

388
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,894
I'm your son

389
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:14,485
until a better alternative comes along.

390
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:25,135
You've never asked me about your mother.

391
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,175
Why would I?

392
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:35,565
She had me, she died.

393
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:38,289
And here we are.

394
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:41,328
BOLTON: She was a peasant girl.

395
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:44,133
Pretty in a common sort of way.

396
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,248
She was the miller's wife.

397
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:50,606
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent,

398
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,049
so I had him hanged,

399
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:55,733
and I took her
beneath the tree where he was swaying.

400
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:57,448
She fought me the whole time.

401
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,772
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

402
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:04,489
A year later she came to my gates
with a squalling baby in her arms.

403
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:06,686
A baby she claimed was mine.

404
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:08,688
I nearly had her whipped,

405
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:10,766
and the child thrown in the river.

406
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:17,855
But then I looked at you,

407
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,691
and I saw then what I see now.

408
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:22,775
You are my son.

409
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:38,367
Stannis Baratheon
has an army at Castle Black,

410
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:40,607
but he won't stay for long.

411
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:44,330
He wants the Iron Throne,

412
00:34:44,404 --> 00:34:47,806
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

413
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,488
He means to take the North.

414
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,286
But the North is ours.

415
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:57,129
It's yours and mine.

416
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,567
Will you help me defeat him?

417
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:04,050
Yes.

418
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:14,805
Is this every book there is?

419
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:17,847
Every book there is?

420
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:20,175
In the world.

421
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:21,965
Well, no.

422
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:25,844
There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

423
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:27,768
This library is rather small, actually.

424
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:29,812
Where you grew up, were there more books?

425
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:32,490
My father's not the most literate man.

426
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:38,765
They say the Citadel
has the largest library in the world.

427
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:40,005
Where's that?

428
00:35:41,644 --> 00:35:42,645
The Citadel?

429
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:45,455
In Oldtown.

430
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:54,167
I'm sorry I don't know things.

431
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,935
Oh, Gilly, look at me.

432
00:35:57,564 --> 00:36:00,568
You know how to do
a hundred things I can never do.

433
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:03,011
You can build a fire with wet wood.

434
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:05,564
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

435
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:08,375
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

436
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:09,445
Well...

437
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:11,891
Why does the Citadel
have the biggest library?

438
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:14,685
It's where they train the maesters.

439
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:16,808
Like MaesterAemon?

440
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,125
I wanted to be one when I was young.

441
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:26,208
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

442
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:31,365
Far more adventure up here anyway.

443
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:35,093
I wouldn't have met you.

00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,693
I am, Your Grace.

00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,887
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

449
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:03,495
Defeated my brother at
the Battle of Ashford.

450
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:07,325
Only battle Robert ever lost.

451
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:09,893
I told him he shouldn't go
so far west so soon,

452
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:11,295
but he never listened.

453
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,928
Fine soldier, your father.

454
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:18,689
You don't look like a soldier.

455
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,684
But I'm told you killed a White Walker.

456
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,969
I did, Your Grace.

457
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,131
How?

458
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:28,127
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

459
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:29,450
Dragonglass?

460
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:30,730
What the maesters call obsidian.

461
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:33,614
I know what it is. We
have it in Dragonstone.

462
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,573
Why would obsidian kill a Walker?

463
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,248
I don't know.

464
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:38,894
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

465
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:40,204
hoping to find something,

466
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:41,410
and all I've learned

467
00:37:41,484 --> 00:37:44,613
is that the Children of the Forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

468
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:48,245
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

469
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,975
I've seen it, Your Grace.

470
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,134
Seen what?

471
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:57,013
The army of the dead.

472
00:37:58,124 --> 00:37:59,171
And when they come...

473
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:01,372
We have to know how to fight them.

474
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,088
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

475
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:27,015
It's time.

476
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,529
Uh, Your Grace.

477
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:31,927
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

478
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:35,167
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

479
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:38,293
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
We can't wait that long.

480
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:42,050
We have the advantage,
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

481
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:45,094
But every day we wait,
the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

482
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:47,166
This could turn to winter at any moment.

483
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:50,327
We have to act now. Give the order.
We march at sunrise.

484
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:54,773
I'll choose a dozen men to stay
and guard the queen and the princess.

485
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:56,255
No need. They're coming with us.

486
00:38:58,764 --> 00:39:00,653
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

487
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:02,886
- Won't they be safer...
- Here?

488
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:07,211
Half these Watchmen are
killers and rapists.

489
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,693
No, they march with us.

490
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:15,212
As you wish,
Your Grace.

495
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:46,689

496

Bran the Builder, and King Dorren, and...

First things first. It's
a long march ahead.

498
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:55,088
And then we have to take the castle.

499

Is there going to be a battle?

Aye, princess,
but you won't be anywhere near...

That's enough talk of battle,

I failed my queen.

You failed no one.

You fought bravely.

You were ambushed, outnumbered.

There was no way you could have known.

This is not why.

there is no shame for this.

I am ashamed

because when the knife go in

537
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:23,126
and I fall to the ground,

538
00:43:24,564 --> 00:43:26,054
I am afraid.

539
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:29,727

No, not death.

I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

543

Now you have given the Masters
what they deserve.

If I give everyone what they deserve,
I'll have no one left to rule.

I should kill the former Masters,

548
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:36,212

I can only tell you what I have seen,

556
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:06,893
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

557
00:45:08,524 --> 00:45:12,131
I have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking,

558
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:15,567
and weigh the choices they put before you.

559
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:19,212
And I have seen you ignore your counselors

560
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:25,409
because there was a better choice.

561
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:27,486
One that only you could see.

My queen,
please do not do this.

563

What about "Valar Morghulis"?

564
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:52,410
I did not want to die a coward.

565
00:45:57,244 --> 00:46:00,054
Apparently I do not want to die at all.
(SNIFFLES)

566
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:04,132

And to admit a mistake.

568
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:11,885
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

569
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:17,415
I was wrong, and you were right.

570
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:21,126
About tradition.

571
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,735
About bringing the people
of this city together.

572
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:31,013
I will reopen the fighting pits.

573
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,893
To free men only.

574
00:46:34,204 --> 00:46:37,970
Slavery will never return to Meereen,
not while I live.

00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:40,246
Yes, my queen.

576
00:46:43,724 --> 00:46:47,410
And in order to forge a lasting bond
with the Meereenese people,

577
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:50,085
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

Thankfully a suitor is
already on his knees.

I'll be fine. Nothing
broken, I don't think.

584
00:47:43,764 --> 00:47:46,688
and an occasional punch in the face.

The Mormont way.

586
00:47:54,284 --> 00:47:57,049
Let's start over.

587
00:47:58,404 --> 00:48:00,884
I apologize for before.

588
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:03,729
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

589
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:06,411
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

590
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,847
We're going to be spending a lot of
time together on the way to Meereen.

591
00:48:14,924 --> 00:48:15,925
We are.

What would make our time together
truly enjoyable

593
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:22,449
would be some wine.

594
00:48:23,764 --> 00:48:24,765
No wine.

595
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:31,131
I am a person who drinks.

596
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:35,325
People who drink need to keep drinking.

597

Otherwise, they're not...

And then they weren't.

00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:53,529
Thank you for saving me.

659
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:01,125
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if
you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.

660
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:07,893
TYRION: So, what now?

661
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:11,810
JORAH: We walk up the coast.
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

662
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:13,964
Maybe another boat.

663
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:15,809
Without luck?

664
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:18,765
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

665
00:54:21,284 --> 00:54:23,730
I'll get some wood for a fire.

666
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:25,849
Try to get some rest, huh?

667
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:29,452
That's the best idea you've had all day.
