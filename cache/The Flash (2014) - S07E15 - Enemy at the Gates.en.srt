You, Snowflake.

831
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:28,071
[bang, clatter]

832
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,686
What the hell was that?

833
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:50,076
Sucrose and potassium chlorate my ass.

834
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,602
Mark!

835
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,951
- Barry?
- Mm.

836
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,287
Stop worrying.

837
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,592
You're gonna be a great dad.

838
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,333
- [chuckles]
- We all know it.

839
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,596
Thanks, Cecile.

840
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,381
I just...

841
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,659
wish Iris was feeling
better and could be here.

842
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:21,764
I know, I know.

843
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,377
But you're gonna call
her as soon as we're done.

844
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,825
Yeah.

845
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,130
Okay, what is it?

846
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,221
Oh, I was just thinking. I'm...

847
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,701
I hope our child has

848
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,573
Iris's heart.

849
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,009
And her fearlessness.

850
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh, she will.

851
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,331
It's... it's negative.

852
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:58,553
I don't...

853
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,249
I...

854
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,861
I mean, my dream.

855
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:07,299
Nora said everything was gonna work out.

856
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,648
It will, honey.

857
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,696
- I know it will.
- How?

858
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:16,266
If... if this isn't the
future for me and Iris...

859
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,793
What is?

860
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:33,806
[crickets chirping]

861
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,594
Creyke hasn't shown up all day.

862
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:42,247
Maybe he moved on?

863
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,249
No, he'll be here.

864
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,774
I can feel it.

865
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,334
It's strange,

866
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:51,471
being so close to
almost closing this case.

867
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:56,394
Are you worried about
arresting an old friend?

868
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,744
After we joined the service,

869
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,400
I went into intelligence.

870
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:06,009
Adam ended up in special forces.

871
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:07,651
Turns out he had a knack for killing.

872
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:08,795
Oh.

873
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:11,017
One the army used to great effect.

874
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:15,674
Something changed in him, West.

875
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,260
And I didn't see it.

876
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:22,092
And since you two grew
up so much alike...

877
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,726
Now you're worried
that whatever broke him

878
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,146
might break you too?

879
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:30,412
All our lives, we had
each other's backs.

880
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,954
'Till he stabbed me in mine.

881
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,087
Left me for dead.

882
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:46,182
What could change a
person enough to do that?

883
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,654
What the hell is that?

884
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,049
Get out of the car!

885
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:16,803
