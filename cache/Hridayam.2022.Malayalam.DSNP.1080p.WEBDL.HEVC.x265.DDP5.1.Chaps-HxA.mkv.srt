1
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,560
For the kind attention of passengers.

2
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,590
Train no. 6602...

3
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,280
Chennai Mail from
Mangalore to Chennai,

4
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,240
will reach platform
number 1 at 19:35 hours.

5
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,780
Sir, my friend got late
to leave from home.

6
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,370
He will reach by 7:45 PM.
Will the train wait here until then?

7
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,470
Why not?
I'll tell the driver!

8
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,530
Thank you, sir.

9
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,860
-Such a nice man.
-Yeah, right!

10
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,180
As if Indian Railways
is his ancestral property!

11
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,070
Shucks!

12
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,710
Please, sir. I'm no. 10 on the waiting list.
Get me a seat somehow.

13
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,190
This waiting list
is not a license...

14
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,840
for people who don't have a ticket
to board the train.

15
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,640
There are no berths
even for RAC tickets.

16
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm fed up of Malayali students
like you, who come to Chennai.

17
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,740
Please, sir.
Just try! Somehow!

18
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Somehow...
Please, sir.

19
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,920
Do one thing. There's a loser over there
who's no. 57 on the waiting list.

20
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,960
Go and sit with him.

21
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,760
Okay.
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

22
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,290
But sir...

23
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,990
Where is he sitting?

24
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,210
You'll know when you see him.

25
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,590
Got it?
Get going.

26
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,990
[singing a famous Malayalam song]

27
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,880
Pass the snack, please.

28
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,420
Excuse me.

29
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,090
-What is it?
-Err....

30
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,830
Are you no. 57 on the waiting list?

31
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,700
That's correct.
How did you know that?

32
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Well, the ticket examiner
had told me.

33
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,330
Is that so?
Sit down.

34
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,580
Come on!

35
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,110
Are you studying in Chennai?

36
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm going to join... KC Tech.

37
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,380
I'm also joining KC Tech.

38
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,620
New admission, ECE.

39
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,990
I'm also doing ECE.

40
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,710
So we're classmates, dude!

41
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,260
He has also done ECE.

42
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,070
He's working in LSB Corp now.

43
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,850
-Andrew.
-Arun.

44
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,710
I studied in KPR college.

45
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,800
Isn't it a good college?

46
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,120
It's a good college, alright.

47
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,200
But there's only one problem.

48
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,680
If we talk to girls,
we'll be dismissed immediately.

49
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,500
-Seriously?
-Yeah!

50
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,680
This problem isn't limited
to students alone.

51
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,520
The same rule applies
for the teachers there.

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,370
Separate seating for girls
and boys in the college bus,

53
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,650
with an iron rod in the centre.

54
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,540
-It's too much, man!
-But your college gives a lot of freedom.

55
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,360
KC Tech, Karappakkam.

56
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,480
Oh, it's a beautiful campus!

57
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,760
Brother...

58
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,410
-How's Chennai?
-Chennai?

59
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,830
You're going to be there
for the next four years, right?

60
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,440
When you board the train back home
once you finish your studies,

61
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,420
you'll feel as if someone is tugging
at your heartstrings.

62
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,970
At that moment, you'll realize
what Chennai is.

63
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,110
♪ Do you hear the voice? ♪

64
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:19,120
♪ Do you hear the voice of Mother Thamizh
Who lets her visitors flourish? ♪

65
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,400
Our college!

66
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,070
♪ Is it inviting you? ♪

67
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:31,760
♪ Is the college road inviting you,
Showering flowers upon you? ♪

68
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,930
-Step forward.
-Get lost.

69
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,290
Step forward.

70
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Silence!

71
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,070
Varikkappara, go check!

72
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,850
Didn't you hear it?
Silence!

73
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,030

Do you hear the voice? ♪

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,560
Arun, look at that.

76
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,650
They have a Tabla too.
It will be awesome.

77
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,770
-Arun Neelakandan, first year ECE.
-Prateek Tiwari, first year CSE.

78
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,550
-Antony.
-Ankur Saxena.

79
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,370
So, you guys are musicians?

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,850
Ah, well.

81
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,190
-We try.
-Sort of!

82
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,580
I see you play the guitar as well.

83
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,830
Yeah, a lil'.

84
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,530
Cool, bro.

85
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,550
We should jam sometime.

86
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,980
Why not!
Jam Jam!

87
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,000
-Anto, from Kottayam.
-I'm Lijo, from Kottayam.

88
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,170
Are you both from Kottayam?

89
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,060
Are you from Kottayam?

90
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,440
-Yeah, I'm from Kanjikkuzhi.
-I'm from Lakkattoor.

91
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,990
-Ron.
-Where are you from?

92
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,510
-Abu Dhabi.
-Where? Abu Dhabi?

93
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,310
-Yeah, dude.
-Oh! Nice gold chain!

94
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,540
It will be useful later.

95
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,970
-Arun, right?
-Arun.

96
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,910
-I'm from Palakkad.
-Which one's your room?

97
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,810
-Ours is at that corner.
-But it's the toilet at the corner, right?

98
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,310
You see this?
This lock and grill is to protect you...

99
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,960
from a major part
of the ragging.

100
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,500
So you don't have
to worry that much.

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,390
What is he saying?

102
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,820
Dude, this grill will be locked
at 9:30 PM.

103
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,880
So the Malayali seniors cannot come
downstairs and rag us.

104
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,340
Ragging is rampant here, huh?

105
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,320
Yes, mostly among Malayali students.

106
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,950
Our people are like this,
wherever we go!

107
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,970
Don't smile!

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,530
Does anyone of you ride a horse?

109
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,890
You do horse-riding?

110
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,360
Err, no.
I'd like to learn, though.

111
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,400
Cool. Join me!

112
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,410
-You do horse-riding?
-No, I'll come walking.

113
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,460
-Okay.
-What's all this?

114
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,720
Organ and music system?

115
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,800
This is not allowed here.

116
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,680
Throw it out!
Come on!

117
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,080
Keep the volume down.

118
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,070
-Who is it? Come here.
-Get lost!

119
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,160
-Are you in first year?
-Yes, sir.

120
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,170
Twins, huh?

121
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,300
Hey! Ask him to
switch on the motor!

122
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,650
Hey Manoharan!
You scoundrel!

123
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,370
-Who called me scoundrel?
-I did, you scoundrel!

124
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,010
-Who called me scoundrel?
-Switch on the motor!

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Come, dude!

126
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,480
The first years will be introduced
to the college.

127
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,510
-Didn't you have it in your school?
-No, Kanjikkuzhi doesn't have all this.

128
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,750
Which damn school
did you study in?

129
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,000
We always put our students
as the highest priority

130
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,100
when it comes to academics,
in KCG College of Technology.

131
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,370
We have a great
academic curriculum.

132
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,680
So students, I welcome you all
to this prestigious institution.

133
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,330
This is the main quadrangle.

134
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,470
This side, if you can see,
there's the mechanical laboratory here.

135
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,660
And our IT department
is on that side.

136
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,700
So guys, this is the analog circuit lab.

137
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,280
You know what has to be done here!

138
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,020
There's something very
special about this space.

139
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,460
Can you see that door?

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,490
That actually leads to an alley.

141
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,020
That is known as the secret alley.

142
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,880
Hey! What's she saying?

143
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,840
Do you see the door
at that corner?

144
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,960
It's called 'The Secret Alley'.

145
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,730
Annie?

146
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,330
Not 'Annie', it's Alley!

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,440
That means, a secret path.

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,940
So, on the last day...

149
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,310
When we're in our final year,

150
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,930
on the last day of college,

151
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,900
the Vice-Principal will give us
the key to that alley.

152
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,050
Only on that day can
we see what's inside.

153
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,190
God, I hope I'll be able
to reach final year.

154
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,620
Can't we get a duplicate key
to this alley?

155
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,700
We'll see.

156
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,830
So what's actually
inside the secret alley?

157
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,950
I'll know it at the end
of my college days.

158
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,050
So, till then, let it be a secret.

159
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,310
-Okay.
-Yeah.

160
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,360
-It's gonna be epic.
-It's good to wait for good things.

161
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,940
-Akash Gupta?
-Yes, sir.

162
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,550
-Akhil Sathyan?
-Yes, sir.

163
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,000
Alan George Akkara?

164
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,420
Antony Thadikkaran?

165
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,350
Sir!

166
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,910
-Arun Neelakandan?
-Present, sir.

167
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,590
-Puneet Singh?
-Yes, sir.

168
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,390
Ron Valiveettil?

169
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,210
Sir, it's 'Valiyaveettil'.

170
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,780
Valiveettil. That's right.

171
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,850
Sit down, man!

172
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,390
Why Tamil people are like this?

173
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,470
-Selva Soundarrajan.
-Yes, sir!

174
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,190
Students!

175
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,000
I am very strict about one thing.

176
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,670
No arrears in my class.

177
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,730
-What does 'arrears' mean?
-Supplementary exams!

178
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,360
-Oh! 'Supply'!
-Sir?

179
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,130
-Your name?
-Alan George.

180
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,160
Come in.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,720
So, today we discuss about
engineering mechanics.

182
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,430
The seniors have called all the
Malayali juniors to the hostel.

183
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,330
Welcome to St. Thomas Hall.

184
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,980
There are certain things that
you need to be aware of, while you're here.

185
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,940
There are some rules
that you have to follow.

186
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,840
The first one is...

187
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,530
'Engineer's salute!'

188
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,650
Farooq!

189
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,830
Explain it to them.

190
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,370
Place your left hand
on your forehead.

191
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,760
Cover your groin area
with your right hand,

192
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,230
thrust your backside forward,

193
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,880
and make the sound - 'Phyung'!

194
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,630
Who laughed now?

195
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,710
Which pig laughed now?

196
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,750
Huh?

197
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,020
Laugh!

198
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,830
Laugh again!

199
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,090
Baiju!

200
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,860
Repeat what Farooq said.

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Engineer's salute!

202
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,430
Repeat!

203
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,400
'Phyung'!

204
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,500
Good.

205
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,010
Now, on to the next point.

206
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,820
As Indian citizens,

207
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,350
it is the duty of each one of you,

208
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,330
to support local industries.

209
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,590
-Isn't that so?
-Yes.

210
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,940
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

211
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,110
So,

212
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,170
for this entire academic year,

213
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,500
you will only use Indian-made clothes,

214
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,130
and Indian-made undergarments.

215
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,630
Okay?

216
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,510
What underwear are you wearing, kiddo?

217
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,280
Which one was it?

218
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,000
-Jockey.
-Ah!

219
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,660
What about you?

220
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,810
Calvin Klein.

221
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,840
Huh? Calvin Klein?

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,220
Hey you!

223
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,470
If you wear a foreign brand ever again,

224
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,460
you'll face a barrage of punches.

225
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,450
Go to some shady shop in Thiruvanmiyur
or Adyar today itself,

226
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,620
and buy shirts, pants and underwear,
that are unfashionable and ill-fitting.

227
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,130
You heard me?

228
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,630
And... one more thing.

229
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,670
The sleeves of your shirts should
be rolled down and buttoned.

230
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,200
And since watches and shoes
are against Indian culture,

231
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,230
you won't use them.

232
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,270
You can use Indian sandals though.

233
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,760
Farooq...

234
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,780
Tell them about the ID card,
as well.

235
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,890
And wherever you see Malayali seniors,

236
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
you should salute us,

237
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,770
and show us your ID cards.

238
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,780
Okay, right?

239
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,910
It is okay.

240
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
So, Farooq...

241
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,500
Give them their
Indian names, as well.

242
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,090
Give them great nicknames.

243
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,590
-Kanaran!
-Huh?

244
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,930
Damu!

245
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,120
Moosa!

246
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,520
Syedali!

247
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,990
Korah!

248
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,000
Ambadi.

249
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,040
Purushu!

250
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,450
-Ambu!
-Salute!

251
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,370
Phyung!

252
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,580
Repeat!

253
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,610
Phyung!

254
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,650
My Indian name is quite pathetic.

255
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,000
Damu!

256
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,130
What's yours?

257
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,990
Kanaran!

258
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,900
Mine's not so bad then.

259
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,110
Do they get to decide
what clothes we should wear?

260
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,270
This is too much!

261
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,120
-Shall we complain?
-Ah!

262
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,340
Mess with them
as soon as you join!

263
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,990
Dude, this ragging won't last
for the entire year.

264
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,420
It will loosen up
after the first semester.

265
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,860
-Then they will become friends with us.
-Of course!

266
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,270
And in my opinion,

267
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,970
let's listen to those guys for now.

268
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,780
Which college doesn't have ragging now?

269
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,820
Not in Kanjikkuzhy, though.

270
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,250
And when we get to second year,
we can do all this too, right?

271
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,290
That's all!

272
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,250
Cut chart paper to the size
of your college ID,

273
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,590
and stick your photo here.

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,290
Your name, Indian name,
name of your course and your underwear.

275
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,680
That's how it should be written.

276
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,650
Also, the name of your underwear,

277
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,640
should be cut out from your underwear
and stapled on to your ID.

278
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,390
The ID should be laminated.

279
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,220
-Hey! A rickshaw is coming.
-Bro!

280
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,430
-Hey Lijo!
-Take us to Karappakkam.

281
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,890
-This cab is too small, man!
-Shut up!

282
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,040
Scoundrel from Abu Dhabi!

283
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,350
Hey!

284
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,780
-Good morning, sir.
-Where's your ID card?

285
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,820
-Where is it?
-Sir...

286
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,850
Here it is, Sir.

287
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,240
-Salute us quickly and get going.
-Fools!

288
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Phyung!

289
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,990
Who's next?

290
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,500
'Don't know' is not a movie!

291
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,020
Hit him!
Come on!

292
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,140
Whom do we catch next?

293
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,170
Yes, this should be fun.

294
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
What is the...

295
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,040
chemical name of Potassium,

296
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,210
in Chemistry?

297
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,290
-"P".
-P?

298
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,830
Pee in your mouth, man!

299
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,420
It's 'K', man!
Hit him! Hit him!

300
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,780
Harder! Come on!

301
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,430
How many states in Tamil Nadu?

302
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,790
Tamil Nadu?
How many states?

303
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,170
Fast!
How many states in Tamil Nadu?

304
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,170
-Tell me.
-44.

305
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,220
Forty four?

306
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,180
-Congratulations! Great! Great!
-Thank you.

307
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,260
Give him a prize!

308
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,000
Tamil Nadu itself is a State, you dumbo!

309
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,640
Hit him! Hit him!

310
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,470
Hit him hard!

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,390
How many checks in your shirt?

312
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,690
It's not mine.
It's his shirt.

313
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Is he cursing us?

314
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,370
Dude, that bald HOD is coming.
Let's escape.

315
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,100
Dude, those guys have left.
Come on, get up.

316
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,540
Get up.
They have left.

317
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,580
Get up, dude!

318
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,430
I don't know what it is.

319
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,860
There's something about her.

320
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,650
Her eyes,

321
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,100
hair...

322
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,660
Her smile...

323
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,280
I want to know her name!

324
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,010
-I want to find out now.
-Calm down!

325
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,370
We'll ask someone.
It's okay.

326
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,230
I don't want to know her name
by asking someone else.

327
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,830
The fact that I want
to know her name...

328
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,450
She should know that first.

[Singing Kannalane from Bombay]

330
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,780
Such a beautiful voice!

331
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,610
I want to romance a girl like her
and marry her somehow.

332
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,650
I can listen to songs
all the time, right?

333
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,220
Why go for someone like her?

334
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,290
Romance this girl itself
and get married to her!

335
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,630
Come, it's time for the lab session.

336
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,300
Let her be.
She'll be here.

337
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,250
She's good, right?

338
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,430
Yaay!

339
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,650
-Wow!
-Really nice voice.

340
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,370
But we need somebody to back her up.

341
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,550
What about a guitar?

342
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,990
Do we have a guitarist?

343
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,270
There's someone from first year ECE.

344
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,960
Okay.
You talk to him then.

345
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,490
When are we starting
the rehearsals?

346
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,090
We should start practising soon.

347
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,300
You have a beautiful voice.

348
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Thanks.

I'm Darshana.

I am Arun.
First year, ECE.

Okay.

354
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,130
I'll see you again.

355
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,230
You are so damn confident, man!

356
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,630
Once you like a girl,
you should never shy away.

357
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,790
It's bad enough to not do
anything about it.

358
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,470
Stalking is even worse.

359
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,290
We should approach
them directly.

360
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,500
If she's single,

361
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,150
she'll be thinking about me now.

362
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,470
What if she's committed?

363
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,650
May I know your name?

She's not committed.

366

Bro, you're gonna perform with Darshana.

367
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,360
For Fresher's day?

368
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,900
Yes, sir.

No, no.

'Poyi Pollikk Mone'
(Go, burn it)

375
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,610
It's not 'Pollikk'.

You've been putting up quite a show,

Do it!

384

are you guys doing here?

If any of you even touch him again,

446
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,260
I swear I'll smash
your skulls so hard,

447
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,070
your bloody brains will fall
out of your mouth!

I swear I'll smash
your skulls so hard,

458

460
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,830
Get out!

461
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,360
He and his damn English!

462
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,990
He thinks that we don't know English!

463
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,150
I was just listening
to my music, okay?

464
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,950
Then I hear screams
from the other room.

465
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,820
And these guys were beating
him so badly, dude!

466
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,770
Prateek, he was just
talking to Darshana.

467
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,650
And... they were rehearsing together.

468
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
-Because he spoke to Darshana?
-Yeah.

469
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,820
How can you just beat somebody up
because he's talking to somebody?

470
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,060
What are you trying to do?

471
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,540
-Nishant Bhai?
-Yeah, Arun.

472
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,570
Do you have sunglasses?

473
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,580
Once your greatest fear in life,
occurs in all its glory,

474
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,660
nothing else matters,
thereafter.

475
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,300
Once we gain that confidence,

476
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,130
then we're awesome!

477
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,570
Frickin' awesome!

478
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,740
You haven't had enough, huh?

479
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,620
Where's your ID card?

480

You...!!

They hit him very badly.

483
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,690
When did this happen?

484
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,730
Yesterday.

485
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,070
Come with me.

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,100
Where are we going?

487
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,130
Vice-Principal's office.

488
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,560
Okay, let's go.

489
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,260
-Are you sure that he's alone there?
-Yes.

490
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,040
-Who told you?
-Our spy.

491
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,930
Shall we complain?

492
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,590
Bro, you're gonna perform
with Darshana.

493
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,830
I'm performing with Darshana?

494
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,490
We don't encourage
ragging in this campus.

495
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,340
Okay.

496
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,880
And if the seniors
have done this,

497
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,880
strict action will be taken
against them.

498
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,920
Thank you, sir.

499
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,790
Are you afraid of them?

500
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,580
I'm not afraid of anyone!

501
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,400
Come!

502
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,300
-We must beat him up!
-We will!

503
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,360
Let's make this
more interesting.

504
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,710
You go ahead.
I'll follow you.

505
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,520
Has anyone dared to mess with us
in the past three years?

506
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,950
When I asked for the ID card, he...

507
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,910
I'm telling you!
We'll teach him a lesson!

508
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,720
She walked along with me,
showing her middle finger...

509
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,530
to the seniors
who beat me to pulp.

510
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,840
I had my arms around her.

511
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,730
In that moment,

512
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,040
I felt like a king.

513
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,160
Smack him!

514
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,190
Punch him hard!

515
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,070
Why are you laughing?

516
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,690
Why are you laughing?

517
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,450
Hit me with everything you've got, bro!

518
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,640
I don't give a damn!

519
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,990
You know why?

520
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,430
'coz Darshana is mine!

521
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,300
And there's nothing you can
do to change that, you sucker!

522
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,070

Can I have your number?

Wait! Wait! Wait!

534
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,450
Darshana, we will be here
for four years.

535
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,750
Four academic years.

536
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,730
Around 800 days in total,
not counting the holidays.

537
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,400
Out of that, twenty days
have already passed.

538
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,480
I don't want to regret
not having told you earlier.

Darshana!

549
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,690
Please don't tie your hair up.

550
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,910
Just try leaving it loose.

Maybe!

566
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,980
And you're coming to college
like this, you dumbo?

567
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,140
You do one thing.

568
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,310
Go to our room.

Over there, on top
of the record book,

570

you can find my compact

Take whatever you like.

573
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,180
Then, there's a pink colour box.

574
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,330
Once you open it,
you'll find a tiny little thing inside.

575

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,900
I went overboard, I know.

586
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,020
-Please! Sorry.
-Can you ride a bike?

587
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,870
[indistinct chatter]

588
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,460
It makes a lot of sound, right bro?

589
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes, it does.

590
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,280
But that sound strikes straight into the heart
of the girl who's sitting behind.

591
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,900
Guys who can ride,
know these things.

592
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,070
It's your first outing, right?

593
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,180
Yeah.

594
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,210

00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,680

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,730
So, the security sleeps
at 12 o'clock, okay?

598
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,400
So you can come
through the main gate.

599
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,140

600
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,570
Okay.

Ever since you proposed to me,

00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
every day when you come to the college,

611

in making you wait...

is something you've already told me.

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,490
Say it again?

636
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
I love you!

637
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,780

00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,540
And your mouth is stinking too!

641
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,690
Go and get ready.
See you in college.

642

-Aren't you going to your hometown today?
-Yes.

643
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,420
Can you come to Kochi with me?

644
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,980
What's the matter?

645
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,200
There's a girl who I used to chat with,
on Yahoo Messenger.

646
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,720
She was very co-operative, online.

647
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,790
What happened then?

648
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,430
My computer was struck by lightning
during the monsoon.

649
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,730
By the time I got it repaired
and came back online to chat,

650
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,160
she fell for someone else.

651
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,990
But now,

652
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,650
she has come back
with a vengeance, bro!

653
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,780
I want to celebrate
her comeback!

654
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,650
And you want me to come along,
for this ribaldry?

655
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Huh?

656
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,300
In my life so far,

657
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,900
nothing has happened!

658
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,110
Nothing at all!

659
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,130
Can you come with me?

660
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,720
I will.

661
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,150
Bro!

662
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,530
We'll have a blast in Kochi!

663
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,710
What is this?
Crushed pickle?

664
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
-'Morning Sir.
-Hi.

665
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,090
Thanks.

666
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,990
Sir, that's a finger bowl.

667
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,280
I know!

668
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,440
It doesn't have sugar.

669
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,730
It's for washing your hands.

670
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,990
But it's good water.
We can drink it.

671
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,840
Aren't you done yet?

672
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,320
I mean, are you done?

673
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,870
What do you think?
Are they serious?

674
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,110
Didn't you ask your friend?

675
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,570
No. She asked me to come
and I tagged along.

676
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,730
Your campus life must be awesome
in Chennai, right?

677
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,150
Hostel, full freedom...

678
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,550
When I see students going
back home on the bus,

679
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,920
I feel slightly jealous.

680
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,990
Home-cooked food, parents...
I miss all that.

681
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,910
My parents are divorced.

682
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,830
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,800
Don't be!
They were always at loggerheads.

684
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,700
So, isn't it better
to get separated?

685
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,050
I like your hair colour.

686
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,360
I like your eyes.

687
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,410
Do you have a girlfriend?

688
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,010
No!

689
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,340
That side is fully occupied.
Let's sit over there.

690
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,800
One second.
I'll be right back.

691
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,720
How much does this umbrella cost?

692
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,760
250 Rupees.

693
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,280
Run! Run!
Those scoundrels are here!

694
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,890
-Damn! I should've just worn pants!
-Don't run away, dear!

695
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,930
-Get lost, you dog!
-I came all the way from Madras for this!

696
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,650
Wait! Let's go to some isolated place.

697
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,030
Wait, please!

698
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,130
Chicken Lasagunia!

699
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,240
Beef stick!

700
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,340
Lime juice without sugar!

701
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,900
And the bus tickets, to and fro.

702
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,440
I am such a colossal disaster, Oh God!

703
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,430
Shucks!

704
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,810
I cheated on Darshana.

705
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,860
Aargh!

706
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,620
Don't keep repeating yourself!

707
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,850
You didn't even touch that girl.

708
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,240
I couldn't touch my girl either.

709
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,530
Yet, I chose to forget
her for a while,

710
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,430
and had other
thoughts in mind, right?

711
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,390
Look at me!
Who doesn't have such thoughts?

712
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,240
Even Mahatma Gandhi
has had such thoughts!

713
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,930
Read his autobiography
if you have a doubt.

714
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,030
And... don't go and blabber
anything to her, out of guilt.

715
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,210
Listen, you haven't done anything to her.

716
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,820
Let's just...

717
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,310
forget this day!

718
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,480
Bloody Chicken Lasaguniya!

719
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,940
-Lasagna!
-I know! Don't rub it in!

720
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,980
I felt sad watching
the news yesterday.

721
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,760
Can't anyone in Kerala be in love?

722
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,680
Those were not family
members or relatives.

723
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,120
Some random people
were beating up those kids.

724
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,860
They took an umbrella from a boy
and hit him on his head.

725
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,390
One boy wearing a T-shirt like yours,
was running for his life.

726
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,160
Okay, I'll message you
once the lab session is over.

727
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,920
Let's bunk class
and go for a movie.

728
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,030
Darshana!

729
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Yes?

730
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,600
I have to tell you something.

731
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,940
I don't know how
you're going to take it.

732
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,860
Arun!

733
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,570
I got here on time, thanks to this umbrella
I found in your room!

734
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,500
Darshana!
Darshana, wait!

735
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,170
-Let go of me.
-Darshana, please!

736
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,620
-Darshana, listen to me!
-Let go!

737
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,460
Darshana, I haven't
done anything wrong!

738
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,670
When Antony said he wanted
to meet a girl, I went along.

739
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,550
I sat on that bench
with her friend.

740
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,640
When she asked me if I had a girlfriend,
I said no.

741
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,150
I haven't done anything wrong.

742
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,730
Why did you say that
you don't have a girlfriend?

743
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,620
Well, when such a hot chick
is in front of me..

744
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,280
Shucks!

745
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,630
What the hell did you tell her, dude?

746
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,160
Shucks!

747
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,620
Hello, Megha?

748
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,190
Don't call on my friend's phone, okay?

749
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,900
Darshana, please listen to me.

750
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,910
There's nothing between us any more.

751
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,620
Forever!

752
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,280
Just listen to me, Darshana.
Please!

753
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,150
I'm really sorry.

754
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,230
But don't think that
I will spare you!

755
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,340
I'll romance another guy and walk around
hugging him, right before you.

756
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,490
You wanted to kiss me, right?

757
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,640
I'll kiss him a hundred times,
right in front of your eyes.

758
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,690
With that umbrella in your hand,
you can stand and watch,

759
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,180
you bloody pervert!

760
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,530
Will you do that?

761
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,830
Will you do that?

762
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,140
Then listen to this, as well.

763
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,240
After running away from there,

764
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,120
Antony and I checked in
at Hotel Kochi Courtyard with those girls.

765
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,620
He was in 202...

766
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,770
and I was in 203.

767
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,470
It was awesome!

768
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,890
Go and say this to all
the girls in your hostel!

769
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,350
That's not necessary.

770
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,110
All of them are listening.

771
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,540
You're on loudspeaker, you moron!

772
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Aargh!!

773
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,120
Yet again, I've become a colossal disaster
for no reason at all, dear God!

774
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,500
Sandeep!

775
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,000
-Hey Arun!
-Are you happy now?

776
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,710
-Let go of him!
-She broke up with me!

777
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,430
That umbrella! Didn't you
do it deliberately, you dog?

778
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,070
-Let go of him!
-Move away!

779
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,450
I know, you dog!

780
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,300
You snitched on me to the seniors
and ruined my life, you piece of shit!

781
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,240
-I will kill you.
-Wait. Calm down!!

782
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,650
What do you even know?

783
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,110
He told the seniors everything that
happened here, because they beat him up.

784
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,910
He didn't give that umbrella
to you, on purpose!

785
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,150
-Let go of him!
-Move aside!

786
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,840
Who is he to beat me up!

787
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,870
There's nothing between us any more.

Untie your hair, Maya.

811
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,480
What?

812
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,830
I'm your senior!

813
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,050
Okay, Sir.

814
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,450
Awesome!

815
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:08,390
Sandeep!
All well, huh?

816
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,410
Yaay!

817
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,440
What is this?
A church procession?

818
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,690
Sir, it's Joe's birthday.

819
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,650
-Aha! Happy Birthday!
-Joe? Who's Joe?

820
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,390
-Thank you.
-No alcohol or what?

821
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,010
This is a Levi's shirt, isn't it?

822
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,040
Sir, it's my Mumma's birthday gift.

823
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,100
Haven't we told you not
to wear branded clothes?

824
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,580
-That's the rule.
-Please, sir.

825
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,130
Please don't hit him, sir.

826
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,340
Let's have a birthday bash!

827
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,750
Sir, please!
Please, sir.

828
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,870
-Sir, don't hit him!
-Please, sir.

829
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,080
-Sir! No, sir!
-Don't hit him, sir!

830
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,100
You won't listen to what I say?

831
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,970
Darshana, I haven't done
anything wrong!

832
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,930
At least someone should
listen to what I say!

833
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,170
Enough, dude.

834
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,390
Arun, don't!

835
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,770
Don't hit him, sir.

836
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,060
Sir, please!

837
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,900
Don't hit him, sir. He has pancreatitis.
He will die if you hit him like this!

838
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,300
Joe, are you okay?

839
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,120
Get him some water.

840
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,490
-Joe!
-Bring it quickly!

841
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,880
-Where's the water?
-Joe!

842
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,800
Joe, get up!

843
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,030

00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,280
-Where are you?
-I came to the hostel...

00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,120
-to get some books.

00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:56,910
Let's go out tonight.

861
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,240
-Where?
-My friend has an apartment.

862
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,510
No one's there now.

863
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,470
We'll stay there tonight.

over at your friend's place.

Err... How do I, Arun?

866
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,420
You don't want to stay with me?

867
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,550
Is it?

868
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,140
Maya!

869
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,220
Come, let's go.

870
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:22,950
What?

871
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,300
You wooed her so quickly?

872
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,420
She's an easy catch.

873
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,210
-Do you want it?
-It looks like dosa.

874
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,310
Did you brush your teeth?

875
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,340
How's the sambar?

876
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,340
What is this?
Dosa or rubber sheet?

877
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,000
This is so stale!

878
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,750
This food is so terrible!

879
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,090
-How many times do we tell them?
-Come on, guys!

880
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,420
-Shall I finish this and come?
-Come on!

881
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,740
Hey Varikkappara!

882
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,880
We won't eat this
terrible food any more.

883
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,920

or else, get lost!

884
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,610
Aren't we paying
you for the food?

885
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:48,940
What the hell have you done?

886
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,280
Will your dad come
and clean this?

887
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,360
How dare you swear at my dad?

888
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,570
Dear Lord, a fight!!

889
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,110
Come on, try swearing
at my father again!

890
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,910
Hey! Let go of me!

891
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,580
Didn't I say sorry?

892
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,530
I'm sorry!
Let go of me!

938

00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,460
Oh my God!

974
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,460
-Serves him right!
-Shruthi!

975
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,280
Shruthi!

976
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,930
George, Kedar is not here.

977
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,680
-I think he has left.
-Stop it, dude!

978
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,860
What are you trying to prove?

979
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,890
I know what to do
with people who hurt me.

980
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,530
I don't need help from anybody!

981
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,870
And not even for a moment should you
think that you're any better than him!

982
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,580
Can't you see that
two people are talking?

983
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,400
And you're grinning
in between that?

984
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,930
Come.

985
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,510
What?
Do you want to hit me?

986
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:46,800
No, bro.

987
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,160
I've come to take him.

988
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,740
This is the fourth time you're getting
beaten up this month. Aren't you fed up?

989
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,680
Shut up!

990
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,410
Reverse! Reverse! Reverse!

991
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,380
-Brother, go to the hospital quickly.
-Okay.

992
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,660
My father is really sick.

993
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,760
I've been thinking about
going to my home town.

994
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,040
What about the exams?

995
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,650
I am feeling really stressed
staying here.

996
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:38,540
Go and come back soon.

997
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,640
Have you ordered any food, bro?

998
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:53,240
-Woah!
-Oh my God!

999
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,470
Shut up!

1000
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,310
Oh my darling!

1001
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,450
Losers!

1002
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,660
Where does he get
these girls from?

1003
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,610
-Oh my God!
-Learn from him!

1004
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,310
Don't destroy our image as well.
Keep quiet!

1005
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,670
-I can't bear this, you dog.
-It's alright. Just chill.

1006
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,800
-Who cleaned all this?
-Hey!

1007
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,690
Get the snacks. Joji, the opener
must be somewhere over there.

1008
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:03,440
-Bring it.
-I'll open it with my mouth.

1009
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,660
It's so hot.

1010
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:07,070
-I can't find it here.
-Bring it quickly, dude.

1011
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,540
Bro, can you give me
that girl's number?

1012
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,350
Hi sir.

1013
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,540
Arun, pay for it.

1014
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,570
I'll pay you later.

1015
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,200
I don't have money.

1016
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,960
Sorry, sir.
I can't take it back.

1017
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:17,990
You can't?

1018
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,790
-No, sir.
-Then you shove it up!

1019
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,680
What is this?
Didn't I say that I'll return the money?

1020
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,340
When have you ever
returned the money?

1021
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:28,340
You come here only to drink
and sleep with girls, right?

1022
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,720
Why are you talking like this,
you scoundrel?

1023
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,790
There's a limit to how much
a person can tolerate.

1024
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,590
Is this even a house?

1025
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,520
Is there even an inch
of clean space here?

1026
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,970
Whenever I walk in, this place
reeks of vomit and urine.

1027
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,640
I even throw your condoms
into the garbage.

1028
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,110
Hey Arun!

1029
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:52,840
Don't go overboard.

1030
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,320
Here you are!

1031
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,620
Change your name from Lijo
to 'Anto's lackey'.

1032
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,980
Why do you alone have
such an issue with me, you prick?

1033
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,380
No one else has any issue.

1034
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,420
That's right.

1035
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:12,750
I'm the only one
who has an issue.

1036
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,500
None of you have any issue!

1037
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,320
Right?

1038
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,760
Arun, come on.
Let's arrive at a compromise.

1039
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,230
You know, right?
It's Anto! It's our Anto!

1040
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,930
Come on.
Let's arrive at a compromise.

1041
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:32,960
Compromise?

1042
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,730
You go compromise.

1043
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,840
You guys can rot inside this filth
for the next two years and die!

1044
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,980
Hey!
Come in!

1045
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:52,680
Dude...

1046
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,820
-Just for tonight.
-What's this, man?

1047
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,120
Come inside.

1048
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,320
Mom, this is Arun!

1049
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,480
Hello!

1050
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,920
The food will be ready now.

1051
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,820
-Akku..
-You can go and freshen up, son.

1052
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,880
-Show him the room.
-What is this? Why are you like this?

1053
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,380
Come, go and get freshened up.

1054
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,870
We'll have dinner after that, okay?

1055
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,710
-Sir?
-Over?

1056
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,340
No, sir.
Additional sheet, please.

1057
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,260
Thank you.

1058
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,240
It's been two days
since he came here.

1059
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,880
He hasn't spoken to me at all.

1060
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,150
I told you, right?

1061
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,400
Didn't you notice his face and his body?

1062
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,620
I have a strong feeling
that he has been drinking.

1063
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,260
Please talk to him.

1064
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,930
I'm well aware...

1065
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,210
of how I lived my life,
when I was your age.

1066
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,960
That's why I don't advise you,

1067
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,780
though your mother
keeps compelling me to.

1068
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,880
I know that you're away from us.

1069
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,130
But...

1070
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,410
don't think
that you are alone.

1071
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:14,890
For anything and everything,

1072
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,540
your father is here for you.

1073
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,430
Understood?

1074
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,150
You should quit alcohol.

1075
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,740
Dad...

1076
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:29,080
I don't really...

1077
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,470
drink.

1078
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,550
What hurts me more than
you drinking alcohol,

1079
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,390
is the fact that
you're lying to me.

1080
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:38,920
Will you quit?

1081
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,450
If you won't feel embarrassed,

1082
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,330
can I give you a hug?

1083
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,090
What is this, son?

1084
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,690
So, just like the last time,

1085
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,930
-Puneet Singh is first.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1086
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,480
Selva Soundarrajan is second.

1087
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,540
-Good job, Selva.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1088
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,050
-Akhil Sathyan is third.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1089
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,540
-Lokesh is fourth.
-Thanks, Ma'am.

1090
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,210
-And Dhruv is fifth.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1091
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,690
Congratulations, guys.
Most of you have improved,

1092
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,620
except for the Malayali students.

1093
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,140
Arun has cleared one paper.

1094
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,320
Rest, all of you are washed out.

1095
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:34,860
Can't you join some other course?

1096
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,440
Wasting so many
seats unnecessarily!

1097
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,270
Arun!

1098
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,170
Bye!

1099
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,670
-Awesome job, bro!
-How, bro?

1100
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,370
There's nothing like that, bro.

1101
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,570
Hey!

1102
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,150
Our classmate, Selva?

1103
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,310
He's running a combined study group.

1104
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:03,810
Shall we ask him if we can also join?

1105
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,770
He has no airs about himself.

1106
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,030
We'll ask him, huh?

1107
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:11,940
Yes.

1108
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,400
Combined study it is, then.

1109
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,630
Hey! Over there.

1110
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:21,860
Hey Selva!

1111
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,610
-Selva!
-Yes!

1112
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,580
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

1113
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,600
Selva!

1114
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:30,360
Will you let us join your
combined study group?

1115
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,980
Oh! You may join!
Hold this.

1116
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,190
-Usha Akka! I've kept the water here.
-Selva, the milk packet!

1117
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,620
-They kept it here?
-It's leaking!

1118
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,870
Come on.

1119
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,270
-Hey! Keep it there.
-Here?

1120
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,370
There's no water here.

1121
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,300
This has been a never ending
problem in our city, for many years.

1122
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,280
Come, dude!

1123
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,820
This is our area!

1124
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:56,810
-Maari Anna!
-Yes!

1125
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,550
Pay your electricity
bill today itself.

1126
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,680
They will disconnect
it otherwise.

1127
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:00,820
-Okay, Selva.

1128
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,280
Hey!
Careful, guys!

1129
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,220
Lachu Paatti (grandma)!

1130
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,000
Five minutes!

1131
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,600
-Sambar Saadham is getting ready.
- Okay!

1132
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,690
Hey Arun!
Come, dude!

1133
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,580
What is this?
A bandit's hideout?

1134
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:28,550
Come on!

1135
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,090
-Hey! Give me your hand!
-Selva!

1136
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,270
This is our place!

1137
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,080
Anyone can come here...

1138
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,190
and learn!

1139
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,530
75% of the people here...

1140
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,110
are not from
well-to-do families.

1141
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,230
They were sidelined
because they were poor.

1142
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,450
But wait and watch!
Ten years from now,

1143
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:52,840
each student in this group
will be going places!

1144
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,780
Don't look at it as just
another combined study group.

1145
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,080
This is a student movement.

1146
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,680
To change our destiny,

1147
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,100
we initiated this
silent revolution.

1148
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,550
Shucks!

1149
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,790
x-u=t

1150
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,180
dx=dt

1151
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,610
x=t+u

1152
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,530
-Yaay!
-Yes!

1153
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,840
-Raja!
-Selva!

1154
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,630
His name is Raja.

1155
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,840
He's from Pannaipuram.

1156
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,580
He creates amazing music.

1157
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,240
You have arrears in the
fourth semester, right?

1158
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:46,270
Yes.

1159
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,350
Third semester?

1160
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,400
Yes.

1161
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,500
Second?

1162
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,180
We have arrears
in every semester, Selva.

1163
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,230
Don't hurt our feelings
talking about all that.

1164
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,590
So, let's start with Maths and Physics.

1165
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,220
If you understand
Maths and Physics,

1166
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,180
it's like you've understood
the whole world.

1167
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,210
Here you go.

1168
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Kaali!

1169
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,580
-First semester, Maths.
-We've just started. Come on!

1170
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,790

- Yes!

01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,730
You're going to
become an engineer.

-So what?
-Have you really thought about it?

1191
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,400
To think about all possibilities
and plan everything in advance,

1192
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,160
do you think I'm a Malayali?

What's your dream, Selva?

1204
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:57,360
I dream of the day my parents
can sleep without a worry.

1205
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,650
What more can I ask for?

1206
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,440
The semester results are quite
surprising this time.

1207
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,250
Selva is first!

1208
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,900
-Selva!
-Thank you!

1209
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,150
-Puneet Singh is second.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1210
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,860
Gia D'Costa is third.

1211
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,810
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Girl power, finally!

1212
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,150
-Akhil Sathyan is fourth.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1213
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,280
Arun Neelakandan is fifth.

1214
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,140
Bro!

1215
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,010
Awesome!

1216
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:33,540
Arun, you've cleared 18
back papers in one stretch?

1217
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,320
Yes, Ma'am.

1218
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,410
Wow!

1219
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:45,090
Superb, bro!
That's awesome.

1220
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,460
Congratulations!

1221
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,850
And you too, Antony!

1222
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,090
You also have cleared
a lot of papers.

1223
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:51,750
Me?

1224
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:53,940
Good going!

1225
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,680
I'm too good, bro!

1226
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:57,710
Arun!

1227
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,040
When are you giving us a treat?

1228
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:00,760
We have class only
till noon today, right?

1229
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,130
Let's go to Hotel Crescent
and have Mutton Biriyani.

1230
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,270
-Can I call our boys?
-Call everyone!

1231
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,300
Super!

1232
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,130
By the way, bro...

1233
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,740
After that, can you come
with me to meet Selvi?

1234
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,080
I have...

1235
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,600
bought a saree for her.

1236
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:16,560
Huh? You're already
buying her sarees and all?

1237
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,100
Hey! Don't yell bro!

1238
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,470
I hope the people there
don't pummel you!

1239
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Shut up!

1240
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,680
-What is it?
-Forget it.

1241
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,940
Hey!

1242
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:36,700
Please stop at an ATM
counter on the way.

1243
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:39,870
Do you even have to say?
We're going to make you splurge!

1244
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,620
Calm down!
Please calm down!

1245
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,570
Don't go forward.

1246
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,080
You cannot go forward.

1247
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,380
There has been a small accident.

1248
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,750
What accident, sir?

1249
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,790
I'll tell you later.

1250
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,120
Move back now.

1251
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,330
-Go back, please.
-What happened, sir?

1252
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,400
The bus ran over
a third year student!

1253
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,610
-Hey!
-What?

1254
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,970
Selva!!!

1255
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,350
Selva!

1256
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,740
Selva!

1257
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,070
Selva!

1258
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:26,530
Move away!

1259
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,550
Make way!

1260
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,630
I found this in Selva's bag.

1261
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,660
The saree he bought for Tamizhselvi.

1262
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:09,920
Arun...

1263
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,120
His house is near Arakkonam.

1264
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,480
Since it's outside the city,

1265
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,560
I don't think many students
would come there.

1266
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,030
Shouldn't we go and see him?

1267
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,990
I can't see him like that!

1268
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,310
Don't come if you don't want to.

1269
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,360
I will go!

1270
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,670
I won't let him burn to ashes
without anyone by his side.

1271
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,460
I will go!

1272
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,190
Amma, how do we go
to the cremation ground?

1273
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,310
-Go straight.
-Straight?

1274
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,180
Selva!

1275
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,590
Where have you gone,
leaving us behind?

1276
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:44,780
Selva!

1277
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:45,980
Selva!

1278
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:52,400
Look at our Selva.

1279
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:55,010
Whom do we have now?

1280
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,040
Selva's parents.

1281
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,840
What's your dream, Selva?

1282
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,790
I dream of the day my parents
can sleep without a worry.

1283
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,150
What more can I ask for?

1284
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,530
We shouldn't cry, brother.

1285
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,200
It's just his body that's
being consumed by the fire.

1286
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:17,570
Just his body.

1287
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,240
Is he just that?

1288
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,810
Is that all there is to Selva?

1289
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,330
He is hiding.

1290
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,220
He is here, somewhere.

1295
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:50,440
I have always considered
Selva as my own son.

1296
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:52,790
My son is abroad
and earning well.

You are all my children.

1298

What difficulty would I have
in cooking for my children?

1299
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,500
This group should not dissolve.

1300
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,050
We should continue
what Selva started.

1301

We should continue
what Selva started.

1303
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,420

Maya?

1319
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,240
Maya, what happened?

1320
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,800
I'll come right away.

1321
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,080
Maya's father....

1322
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:45,920
I have to go.

1323
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,320
Shall I leave?

1324
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,800
-Okay.
-You go home and freshen up.

1325
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,160
I'll go later.

1326
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,350
I couldn't do anything
when Selva died.

1327
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:32,350
Maya needs me now.

1328
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,750
Yeah, I can understand.

1329
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,490
Okay.
Tell me if there's anything.

1330
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:36,800
Call me.

1331
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,780
Shall I get you something to eat?

1332
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,300
I don't want anything.

1333
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:45,990
Mom has fallen asleep.

1334
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,270
You can leave now, Arun.

1335
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,180
Okay.

1336
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,460
Bye.

1337
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,230
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1338
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:12,520
What happened?

1339
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,560
Papa...

1340
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,510
He was wearing this shirt
even this morning.

1341
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:26,060
We have no one now, Arun.

1342
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:38,420
If I ask you something,

1343
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:40,960
will you say the truth?

1344
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:44,920
Have you ever...

1345
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:48,000
loved me the way you
loved Darshana?

1346
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,810
That was a night which made me
feel extremely lonely and guilty.

1347
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:23,710
Someone who was always around,
but someone whom I'd never spoken to...

1348
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:26,340
On that night, I noticed
a cycle tea-seller.

1349
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,550
I felt like talking to him.

1350
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,340
How many years has it been
since you came to Chennai?

1351
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:36,200
I came here when this city
was called Madras.

1352
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,640
When I came here,

1353
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,670
none of this was here.

1354
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,280
Did you come here
in search of a job?

1355
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,850
Cinema!

1356
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:48,120
Acting?

1357
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,700
In the '80s,

1358
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:58,490
I had produced around
seven to eight Malayalam films.

1359
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,730
What's your name?

1360
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,690
A heavy downpour happened
and ceased over the same night.

1361
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,370
Semester exams began, soon after.

1362
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,670
None of us realized how
another year went by.

1363
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:20,810
Campus placements,

1364
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,690
preparations for higher studies...

1365
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,580
In the meanwhile, I patched up
with my Malayali friends.

1366
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,840
I'm asking this because we've royally
flunked all our exams.

1367
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,850
Shall we join
your combined study group?

1368
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:32,830
Why not! You should all come.
We'll see.

1369
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:33,860
That's great.

1370
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,030
-How much?
-200 Rupees.

1371
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:37,070
Two Hundred...

1372
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,720
Hey Arun!
I'll pay!

1373
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,550
Let's split it.

1374
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,790
All the top students in my class...

1375
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,440
were targeting foreign
universities and studying accordingly.

1376
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,450
Darshana, Kaali and I...

1377
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,420
got jobs in
campus placements.

1378
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,780
The ones who clear a lot
of back papers at one go,

1379
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:58,230
will be adept at meeting deadlines.
Due to this finding by the HR department,

1380
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:01,640
even our Malayali group could
secure jobs at good companies.

1381
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,170
-Yaay!
-Maya!

1382
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,570
During the last semester,

1383
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:12,400
I could see an extremely happy Maya
laughing out loud.

1384
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,920
Joe!

1385
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,290
I'm really sorry, Joe.

1386
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:34,300
It's okay, sir.

1387
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,810
You don't have to call me Sir.

1388
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:38,930
Call me Arun.

1389
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,240
Okay, Arun.

1390
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Arun...

1391
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,550
Can I ask you something?

1392
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,970
Maya...

1393
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:52,160
Why did she break up with you?

1394
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,270
She deserved someone better.

1395
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:07,180
That day, finally,
I got a load of guilt off my chest.

1396
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,960
Then, finally came...

1397
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:11,750
the last day in KC Tech.

1398
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,980
The last day of college.

1399
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,480
It was beautiful!

1400
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,800
We all felt really close
to each other.

1401
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,500
All of us were together.

1402
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:23,550
Except Kaali.

1403
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,570
Selva!

1404
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:28,670
Selva!

1405
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:43,920
Which train are you taking?

1406
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,280
Mangalore Mail.

1407
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:47,990
I will come.

1408
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,510
Guys, guys!

1409
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,240
I got the key to the secret alley!

1410
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,220
-Woah!
-Secret alley?

1411
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,890
All of us ran towards
the secret alley,

1412
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,340
which our senior
Jasleen had shown us,

1413
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,680
in the first year of college.

1414
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:13,490
Dude, it's totally dark out here.

1415
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:15,000
Hey Puneet, pull the lever!

1416
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:16,730
-Someone turn on the switch.
-Pull the lever, man!

1426
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,820
They all had something to say.

1427
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,300
But I...

1428
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:48,180

Any clothes to be pressed?

1432
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,510
I have completed my course.

1433
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:19,540
I'm going back to Kerala.

1434
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:21,090
-Is it?
-Here's a gift for you.

1435
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:29,140
Thanks, brother.
It's really superb.

1436
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:32,930
Who told you that I like
green coloured sarees?

1437
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,180
Antony and the others took
the express train, right?

1438
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,870
Yeah.

1439
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:48,930
Do you feel like leaving?

1440
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,140
In the blink of an eye,

1441
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:54,150
four years just flew by.

1442
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,310
Arun,

1443
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:02,330
if I had forgiven you
in the first year,

1444
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,460
would we still be together?

1445
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:43,640
Arun! Bro!
We got stuck in traffic, bro!

1446
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,660
Only do what your heart tells you, bro!

1447
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:50,230
We'll always be there for you, bro!
No matter what!

1448
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,310
Where is Kaali?

1449
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:52,740
Kaali?
Hey Kaali! Come on!

1450
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,810
Give it quickly.
You have a safe journey, bro!

1451
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,010
Arun!

1452
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:57,960
Sambar Saadham!

[Traditional folk song]

1502
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,000
I keep watching your videos.

1503
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:43,710
Food vlogging.

1504
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:44,830
Nice!

1505
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:46,670
It's gaining popularity.

1506
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,290
Our subscriber base
has been growing.

1507
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,230
You must be making a lot of money
from YouTube, right?

1508
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,010
It barely covers my fuel bills.

1509
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,650
Slog like a slave, get paid peanuts,
feel like a queen.

1510
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:56,920
That's my present situation.

1511
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,270
It's a new venture, right?

1512
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,800
It will take some time
to convert to cash.

1513
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,580
But there's one thing.

1514
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,460
I feel really peaceful.

1515
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,330
That feeling...

1516
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,460
I have no idea how
to achieve that.

1517
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,700
I don't have any
particular passion either.

1518
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,600
I don't know what to do.

1519
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:16,630
You do one thing.

1520
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:18,660
-Quit your job.
-And?

1521
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,030
Wander around like you?

1522
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:22,280
Wander around for a bit.

1523
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,490
Then, find what you really like.

1524
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:25,660
And get into that.

1525
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,320
Money will follow.

1526
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:28,370
What if it doesn't?

1527
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,570
You will starve!

1528
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:32,870
My grandmother used to say...

1529
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,740
"When we're really hungry,

1530
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,870
we'll find ways
to feed ourselves"

1531
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:38,200
And where's your grandma now?

1532
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,370
She's dead!

1533
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:41,490
But she had a point.

1534
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,740
Are you a photographer?

1535
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,160
I click photos, yeah.

1536
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:18,950
How's this camera?

1537
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,530
-It's okay for me.
-Is it?

1538
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:22,820
-Can I have a look?
-Err...

1539
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:29,490
Oh!

1540
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:34,700
Woah!

1541
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:36,200
-This is beautiful.
-Thank you.

1542
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,660
-What's your name?
-Arun.

1543
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,820
I am Jimmy.

1544
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:40,990
I'm a wedding photographer.

1545
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:41,950
What about you?

1546
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,870
I was with Infomax,
but now I'm not working.

1547
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:45,570
-So you're not working currently?
-Nope.

1548
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,740
Not working currently!

1549
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,140
Do you believe in destiny?

1550
01:39:52,730 --> 01:39:55,270
-I don't know much about all that.
-Ah! It's good that you don't.

1551
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,360
You'll go crazy!

1552
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,270
You know how it is for me?

1553
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:00,190
If I wish for something,

1554
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,690
it will be brought right before me.

1555
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,570
-By whom?
-God!

1556
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,820
I was just thinking
of quitting my job,

1557
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:09,320
starting my own wedding
photography company

1558
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,480
and hiring a good photographer.

1559
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,190
And here you are!

1560
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,570
Don't think any further.
Let's collaborate!

1561
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:17,690
-Well, I..
-Why? You don't want to collaborate?

1562
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:18,980
I didn't mean that.

1563
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,860
-I'm not a professional.
-That's not a problem.

1564
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,220
And, we just met, right?

1565
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,080
Yeah! We should have met
much earlier.

1566
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,070
We got late.
I felt so too.

1567
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:31,020
I have great contacts.

1568
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,190
I'm serious.

1569
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,740
We can cover at least four
or five weddings in a month.

1570
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:38,480
I'll pay you Rs. 20,000
for each wedding.

1571
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:39,770
What say?

1572
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:42,070
-How much?
-Err... 20,000 Rupees.

1573
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,480
Okay!
Twenty five!

1574
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:50,820
Fine! 30,000.
Don't ask for more than that. Please!

1575
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:52,730
I need to think about it.

1576
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:54,610
Go ahead.
I'll be right here.

1577
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:57,400
-Sir, ticket?
-I didn't buy it?

1578
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,480
No.

1579
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:01,190
I forgot!

1580
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:03,320
I keep forgetting
things wherever I go.

1581
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:06,150
You rascal! Even you managed
to get married?

1582
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:07,220
Here!
Look over here!

1583
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:09,230
-Hey!
-Move away!

1584
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,650
Smile, please!

1585
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,440
Who's that?

1586
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,070
-Hey Sathish!
-Move away, you!

1587
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,940
Don't crowd around.
Please move!

1588
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:19,700
-Over here!
-Excuse me!

1589
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,890
Smile, damn it!

1590
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,150
Come on, stand here, you hag!

1591
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:28,230
Get lost!

1592
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,070
The feast is ready
at the dining hall.

1593
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:32,230
After getting photos clicked,

1594
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:34,020
all of you may proceed
to the dining hall.

1595
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:35,820
Smile!
Smile!

1596
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,710
And they shall become one.

1597
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:40,830
Even if he is starving,
he should feed her.

1598
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,150
Even if he is starving...

1599
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:43,570
Feed, feed!

1600
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,970
-Please! Just one!
-Get lost!

1601
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:05,190
-Phew!
-Oops!

1602
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,400
Careful!

1603
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,400
Hey!

1604
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:09,650
What is this?

1605
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:11,640
What kind of photos are these?

1606
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:15,230
You've covered the groom's family
really well.

1607
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,270
-We're the ones paying you, right?
-There's still more to pay.

1608
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:19,040
-I'm the bride's mother, right?
-Yeah!

1609
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:20,690
Have you clicked a single photo
of me smiling?

1610
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,330
No.

1611
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,110
What kind of photographer are you?

1612
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,430
-What's your name?
-Jimmy!

1613
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:27,490
Nice name!

1614
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:28,730
Take this with you!

1615
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:30,650
-But I..
-Just get lost!

1616
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:33,690
What?

1617
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:37,710
They think they can say anything
if they are paying us!

1618
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:39,320
But they want
everything to be done!

1619
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,820
It's a grand wedding, right?

1620
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:43,150
Candid photography,
traditional photography...

1621
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:44,610
Traditional with candid photography...

1622
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:46,360
Helicam, Jimmy Jib and what not!

1623
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:49,070
Where do I take all this?
To that town hall!

1624
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:50,430
And that place has no AC or fridge!

1625
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:51,830
I mean... no fans!

1626
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:53,620
And there are those
saree-clad aunties,

1627
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:55,850
sweating like they just took a steam bath.

1628
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:59,370
Didn't that hag say that
there's no smiling photo of hers?

1629
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:01,950
To make people smile when they don't,
have I learned morphing?

1630
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,660
-Jimmy bro!
-What?

1631
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,030
Come here.

1632
01:43:06,450 --> 01:43:07,950
What do you think
about these photos?

1633
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:10,620
They are really nice.

1634
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:14,410
They were clicked in Chennai
by a photographer named Danny

1635
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:16,160
for a company called
'Weddings by Alpheus'.

1636
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:18,410
This company doesn't
cover grand weddings.

1637
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:20,890
They cover only small weddings
of people who are educated,

1638
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,310
wise and mature enough.

1639
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:25,740
With just immediate family members
and close friends in attendance,

1640
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,950
Intimate weddings!

1641
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:30,510
There's no brand which specializes
exclusively in intimate weddings,

1642
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:31,660
currently in Kerala.

1643
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:33,070
Why don't we start one?

1644
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,820
Why not?
Let's start it today itself.

1645
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,950
So that we can sit at home
from tomorrow.

1646
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:39,160
Dude, what do you think?

1647
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:42,530
You think weddings are conducted
in Kerala to get two people married?

1648
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,450
A wedding here is a huge
celebratory event,

1649
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:46,120
where people invite relatives,
friends and acquaintances...

1650
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,490
... to show off their pomp and grandeur.

1651
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,820
Take your intimate concept to
them and watch how they react!

1652
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,530
-Sheesh!
-Jimmy bro!

1653
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,280
Many people are reconsidering
the idea of having grand weddings.

1654
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,240
Most Hindi actors are getting
married like this now.

1655
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:59,200
Even our actor Prithviraj
got married like this!

1656
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,450
Oh yeah!
Rajuettan is awesome!

1657
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:03,870
If we target Kerala alone,
we'll be in a fix.

1658
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,410
We should market our company
all over India.

1659
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,620
If we start this now,

1660
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,530
when intimate weddings
start trending in Kerala,

1661
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,490
we will be the kings here!

1662
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,410
Everyone is running
after grand weddings now.

1663
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:21,910
Should we run along with them,
or ahead of them?

1664
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,280

-Prateek Tiwari?
-Yes.

1677
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,950
Dude, he's a top singer in Bollywood.

1678
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:15,570
He charges millions for an ad.
Don't you know all this?

1679
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,620
-We needn't pay him in millions.
-How much, then?

1680
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,240

Hey guys!
I'm in Mumbai.

1683
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,240
And we're performing
here tonight.

1684
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,780
So, please do come, see us.
Okay?

1685
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,780
I have something to share
with you guys.

1686
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:37,660
I have a friend, Arun Neelakandan.

1687
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:40,240
And he's one of the best photographers
that I know personally.

1688
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,990
Dude, he's hyping you up!

1689
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,280
Now he's starting his own
wedding photography brand...

1690
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,780
...called Blue Eye
Intimate Weddings.

1691
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:46,820
Ours?

1692
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:49,370
So, the first couple to book
their wedding with this brand,

1693
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,160
I will sing at their wedding,

1694
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,240
for free!

1695
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:56,280
Did he say that he'll sing for free,
at our first wedding?

1696
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,950
Did he just say free?
Are you sure?

1697
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:00,030
-Prateek, I love you man!
-I love you too, dude!

1698
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,240
Who is he?

1699
01:46:01,950 --> 01:46:02,950
He is my friend!

1700
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:06,700
Friend?

1701
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,160
Sure, sir.
Sure, sir.

1702
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:09,570
We can do all that.

1703
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:11,700
With that single video
from Prateek Tiwari...

1704
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:15,740
we received around 20 wedding
enquiries in two days.

1705
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,950
The most surprising fact was that
many of them were from Kerala.

1706
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:21,200
If we get all this advance money,
we'll rock it!

1707
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:22,450
Your idea is fantastic, man!

Why is your email ID like this?

1710
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:30,370
It's been like that since 10th grade.

My dad is my hero.

1712
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:34,870
So I just modified my
dad's name a little bit.

So creative!

1716
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:40,780
Don't pull my leg, Jimmy bro!

1717
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:41,990
What's your family name?

1718
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,120
Is it Mangalassery?

1719
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:44,950
-No!
-No?

1720
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:46,870
-Not at all?
-No!

1721
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:07,280
As I started covering weddings
of my choice,

1722
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,620
I began enjoying wedding
photography thoroughly.

1723
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:14,430
Framing, lighting,
composition, technique...

1724
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:15,760
None of this mattered.

1725
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,320
I gradually learnt that capturing
the hearts of the people before you,

1726
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:19,820
is what photography is all about.

1727
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,140
I started anticipating.

1728
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:23,990
Happiness!

1729
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,240

1730
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:27,660
Tears!

1732
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,160
Romp!

1733
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,870
I was loving what I was doing.

1734
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,070
The greatest attraction
of wedding photography...

1735
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:43,320
is the freedom that we get.

1736
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:47,700
We can keep clicking photos of all
the girls attending the wedding,

1737
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:48,740
with no restrictions.

1738
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:52,990
When we go for certain weddings,

1739
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:54,780
we feel that the bride
is nothing...

1740
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:57,330
in front of her cousins, friends
or bridesmaids. So many girls!

1741
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:59,370
Sigh!
O' dear God!

1742
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:08,450
And at one such wedding,

1743
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:10,200
I saw her for the first time.

1744
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,200
She wasn't like the other girls 

1745
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,130
whom I'd forget immediately
after clicking them.

1746
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,070
-Nithya!
-Her face...

1747
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,490
Nithya!

1748
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:20,160
It pierced right into my heart.

1749
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:24,160
Many years after Darshana,

1750
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:27,200
I couldn't take my eyes off a girl.

1751
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,280
Nithya.

-I'll come later.

-Come on!

Fine, don't come!
So much attitude!

1757
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:35,240
I can send the photos on WhatsApp
if you want them.

1758
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:38,530
Aww! Nice try to get my number!

1759
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:41,570

1760
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,870
If you won't mind,
may I say something?

1761
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,120
Okay.

1762
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:48,780
I didn't like even a single photo
of yours that I clicked.

1763
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:51,320
You're very beautiful!

1764

Yeah.

It was lovely meeting you, Nithya.

I'm Arun.

Yeah, yeah!
I'm seeing everything.

I'm going to marry her.

Yeah, right!
Have you seen her?

1779
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:34,320
A girl like her!

1780
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,030
Do you think boys... that too, the
boys of Kochi, would forsake her?

1781
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,990
Do you really think so?

1782
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,530
She must be committed.
I am sure!

1783

She's not committed.

Nithya has e-mailed us.

1787
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:21,700
She showed the photos
we sent to her family.

Everyone liked it.

She has asked us if we can cover her
cousin sister's wedding in Chennai.

Don't miss this work.

We should meet Nithya, in person.

I can't believe it!

he's this kind of a guy.

All this happened
when I was in college.

Maybe, he's a changed man now.

1800

Ask your family to enquire
about him, once again.

-What about lights?

01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:34,100
Good morning!

1933
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:40,900
Hi kiddo!

1934
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:45,520
-Hey!
-Bro!

1935
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:46,600
-How are you?
-Hi.

1936
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:48,350
-Who is this, bro?
-My friend.

1937
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:49,770
-Your friend? Hello.
-Hi.

1938
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:51,520
-Come on.
-Now tell me.

1939
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:53,140
-Who's the client?
-The client?

1940
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:54,810
You've come so far.
Now see for yourself.

1941
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,850
It's my daughter's wedding.

1942
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,640
We'll make it grand!

Identify all the relatives and close
friends of the bride and groom.

1953
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,140
Okay.

1960
02:00:01,930 --> 02:00:02,930
Thank you.

-Oh wow! Hi!
-Can you tell me...

1963
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:13,430
-who the close relatives are?
-I'll tell you. You're really beautiful!

1964
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:14,980
I am a production
controller in the movies.

1965
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:17,000
I'll get you a chance
to act as a heroine.

1966
02:00:17,010 --> 02:00:17,950
Give me your number.

1967
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:19,140
I won't chat with you.

1968
02:00:19,230 --> 02:00:20,730

Arun!

02:00:43,230 --> 02:00:45,230
I've got all the details.
It's all set.

1977
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,520
This is my old camera.
You can join me.

1978
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:49,980
I don't know how to use this.

1979
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,100
Just make sure
that the photos are in focus.

1980
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:53,140
Oh! Photography is so easy, huh?

1981
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:54,680
Oh!
Give it back!

1982
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:56,520
No!

paid the electricity bill?

02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:18,390
I'll pay it today!

1993

02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:41,270

Lachu Paatti?

1997
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,730
No. We've been staying
here for three years.

1998
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:51,020
There's no one like that here.

1999
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,850
-Okay.
-Okay.

2000
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,640
Arun bro!

2001
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:13,310
-How are you, dear?
-I am great.

2002
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,310
I am married now.

2003
02:03:14,350 --> 02:03:15,350
I can see that.

2004
02:03:16,810 --> 02:03:17,810
Are you happy?

2005
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:19,150
I am at peace, brother.

2006
02:03:19,770 --> 02:03:21,520
I had gone to Lachu Paatti's house.

2007
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:22,730
But nobody is there.

2008
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:23,730
Lachu Paatti?

2009
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:27,430
You want to see her?

2010
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:32,310
Hey Arun!

2011
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:33,850
-Grandma!
-Come on in!

2012
02:03:33,890 --> 02:03:34,890
Please come.

2013
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:38,850
I'm seeing you
after so many years!

2014
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:40,980
-It's been really long, Grandma!
-Don't you remember this grandma?

2015
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:43,180
-It's not like that.
-As soon as you left after your studies,

2016
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:44,520
you forgot this grandma, right?

2017
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:45,930
Have I forgotten you?

2018
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:46,980
Never!

2019
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:48,430
Vijay!

2020
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:49,810
-Look who's here!
-Hi!

2021
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:50,810
-Hi.
-Hi. Vijay.

2022
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:51,850
Arun.

2023
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:53,180
Grandma has told me
a lot about you.

2024
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:55,480
Okay. Please carry on.
I'll see you later.

2025
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,140
Wait.
I'll bring coffee for you.

2026
02:03:57,730 --> 02:03:58,730
Grandma!

2027
02:03:58,770 --> 02:04:00,180
Can I get some Sambar Saadham?

2028
02:04:01,890 --> 02:04:03,020
Wait, I'll bring it.

2029
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:20,070
The two of you should always
stay together and be happy.

2030
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,100
Grandma, we're just friends.

2031
02:04:23,770 --> 02:04:25,600
Oh! Friends, huh?

2032
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:28,850
Seems like the two of you
are best friends?

2033
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:29,890
No.

2034
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:31,850
I swear, we're just friends, Grandma.

2035
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:37,020
Are you that crazy about him?

2036
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:38,390
He's a sweetheart, sis'.

2037
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,730
You had a boyfriend
in college, right?

2038
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:43,180
What was his name?
Tin? Aluminium?

2039
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:44,180
Tinson!

2040
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:47,100
-Is this guy like him?
-No! He's not like that loser!

2041
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,770
Back then, he had
his eyes on me.

2042
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:51,600
That's just your imagination.

2043
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:54,020
Okay, agreed.
He had his eyes on you.

2044
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:56,770
Now, please talk to Papa
and Mumma about this.

2045
02:04:57,730 --> 02:04:58,730
Let me see.

2046
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:00,310
Thank you!

2047
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,560
Wedding photographer?
No way!

2048
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:05,930
Why not?

2049
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:08,770
She is an engineer working
at a software company.

2050
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:09,930
He's also like that.

2051
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:11,600
When he got bored,
he quit that and started this.

2052
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,810
What does he earn by doing this?

2053
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:15,270
He earns much more than
what you earn in a month, Papa.

2054
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:17,310
-Sis'!
-Through wedding photography?

2055
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:18,730
But it won't work out.

2056
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:20,920
There are a thousand
still photographers,

2057
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:22,490
walking around with cameras.

2058
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,310
It's an extremely competitive field.

2059
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,810
If he goes jobless tomorrow,
who will take care of her?

2060
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:28,100
Why should he take care of me?

2061
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:29,310
I can take care of myself.

2062
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:31,430
And if he's jobless,
I'll take care of him, as well.

2063
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:33,770
What?
Do you think I can't, Papa?

2064
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:36,730
My dear, you don't know
how men are!

2065
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:38,560
They are really complicated!

2066
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,100
If they lose their jobs,

2067
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:42,310
or if the wife earns
more than the husband,

2068
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:44,140
they will have all sorts of complexes.

2069
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:45,680
It will create huge problems
in your family life.

2070
02:05:45,730 --> 02:05:47,350
-Papa, he's not like you.
-He's not?

2071
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:50,430
Today's boys are not as problematic
as the men from your generation.

2072
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:53,230
Now you don't join them
and make them like you.

2073
02:05:54,730 --> 02:05:55,730
Papa...

2074
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,560
If you say no,

2075
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:58,930
I won't marry him.

2076
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:03,560
But some other clever girl
will definitely snatch him away.

2077
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:05,520
If that happens,

2078
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:07,180
I will never forgive you, Papa.

2079
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:10,770
In case he develops a complex,

2080
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:13,040
and it becomes an issue
like you mentioned,

2081
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:14,730
I won't wait even for a second.

2082
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,600
I'll get divorced and come
back to you immediately.

2083
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,640
You spoiled brat!

2084
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,100
What is this?

2085
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,680
Pampered her, didn't you?
Deal with it!

2086
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:24,770
Papa!

2087
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:26,350
Eventually I'm going to get married.

2088
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,140
Might as well marry
someone I love.

2089
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:29,920
Please agree, Papa.

2090

Please!

2091
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,230
-Please?
-Please agree, Papa!

2092
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:35,390
Agree, Papa!

2093
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:37,100
-Please agree.
-Do whatever you want!

2094
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:38,730
Say it happily!

2095
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:40,020
Do whatever you want!

2096
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:41,350
A little more!

2097
02:06:41,390 --> 02:06:43,060
More happiness, Papa!
Come on!

2098
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:44,730
Marry whoever you want!

2099
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:46,560
Awww! Thank you!

2100
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,730
Thank you, Papa!

2101
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:58,180
-Huh?
-Oh no!

2102
02:06:58,640 --> 02:06:59,640
Arun!

2103
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:02,310
-My friend Arun is getting married.
-God bless him.

2104
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,360
Same to you!

2105
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:05,480
-Hello?
-Hey!

2106
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:07,020
All set, huh?

2107
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:08,180
Bro!

2108
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:09,640
Congratulations!

2109
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:12,640
Bro, I'm working as an assistant
in Allu Arjun's film.

2110
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,850
I'm at the sound mixing studio.
I'll be there.

2111
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:18,180
More punch, bro!
More punch!

2112
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:19,560
I'll be there, for sure.

2113
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,270
Okay!

2114
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:24,230
Congratulations, bro! I'll be there
the night before! I'll call you!

2115
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:26,980
I will come, dude!

2116
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:28,810
We'll have a blast!

2117
02:07:30,730 --> 02:07:31,730
Okay!

2118
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:34,540
-Two double large, please.
-Can't give you any more, sir.

2119
02:07:34,570 --> 02:07:36,110
Hey! Congratulations, buddy!

2120
02:07:36,350 --> 02:07:38,140
-Thank you.
-Okay. Check my Facebook live.

2121
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:39,350
I'm doing something for you.

2122
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:40,890
I'm doing something
special for you, okay?

2123
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:42,680
-All the very best, Prateek.
-Cheers!

2124
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,060
Hello Mumbai!

2125
02:07:46,350 --> 02:07:47,890
How are you, public?

2126
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:49,680
Woah!

2127
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:51,520
It's a lovely night, guys!

2128
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:54,600
And I just got a message
from a very dear friend of mine.

2129
02:07:54,850 --> 02:07:56,180
His name is Arun.

2130
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:58,520
In college I used to call
him Mallu Aunty.

2131
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:00,230
And he's getting married!

Thank you so much for coming.

2155
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:44,680
Come in.

-Why are you so late?
-Sorry! Sorry!

2158
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:51,810
So let's dedicate the next song
to Darshana!

-Yaay!
-That's awesome!

Hey Puneet, pass the guitar
to Arun, no?

2161
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:57,560
-O' dear! Another acoustic song?
-Come on, Arun!

2162
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:58,680
Arun, 3-4.

He has thrown you out, huh?

02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,100
I'm shifting to the apartment
next door.

2175
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:39,060
What's this?

2176
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,640
The wedding night
is tomorrow, right?

2177
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:42,390
This is a trial for the decorations.

2178
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:43,850
It needn't flop
tomorrow, right?

2179
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:45,980
Hey Darshana!

2180
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:47,310
-Hey!
-Where were you?

2181
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:49,060
Sorry, I got a little late.

2182
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,430
This is Nithya's wedding dress.

2183
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,640
It was given for alteration.

2184
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:53,430
Hey! Why did you
bring it here now?

2185
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:55,640
Why disturb them at midnight?
I'll give it in the morning.

2186
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:57,100
-Okay.
-I'm so hungry!

2187
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:58,140
-Have you eaten?
-No.

2188
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:00,140
-Come on then.
-I'll have dinner with him then.

2189

It's all perfect once I
have a couple of drinks.

2195
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,930
Strike one more, if you dare.

2196

Darsh...

What happened, Darshana?

2201
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,810
He is getting married, Antony!

2202
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,850
When he was in other relationships,

2203
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:16,980
I never felt anything.
But...

2204
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:20,430
Now he'll be gone!

2205
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:23,770
He'll just go, forever!

2206
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:27,560
I can't bear it, Antony!

2207
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:35,570
Only those who wish him well
should be present at his wedding.

2208
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:36,830
I'm leaving.

2209
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:37,850
Hey! Wait!

2210
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:46,230
He should never know
whatever I told you now.

Arun! I love you, man!

2213
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:09,180
Where's the bar, bro?
I want to drink like a fish!

2214
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:10,230
Shut up, you nincompoop!

2215
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:11,270
Arun, bye!

2216
02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:13,140
Bye, Antony!

2217
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:14,810
Hey! Where did Darshana go?

2218
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:19,730
There was a death in her family.
She had to leave quickly.

2219
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:22,230
Don't call her now.

2220
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,100
I mean...
She is okay.

2221
02:15:24,980 --> 02:15:26,770
It's past 12 AM.
Don't you want to sleep?

2222
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:30,270
Get some sleep, man! You might
not be able to sleep tomorrow.

2223
02:15:30,430 --> 02:15:31,850
Look at your silly smile!

2224
02:15:50,730 --> 02:15:51,850
It's raining cats and dogs.

2225
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:54,640
I had asked you to book
the indoor stadium.

2226
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,730
Do you ever listen to me?

2227
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:57,930
A cricket tournament is going on
at the indoor stadium!

2228
02:15:57,930 --> 02:16:00,020
How come it's raining
so much in April?

2229
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:01,390
Are you asking me that?

2230
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:03,430
Great! Who am I asking!
Sorry!

2231
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:05,890
A low-pressure area must have
formed over the Bay of Bengal.

2232
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:07,730
You made me wear this
Churidar in the morning.

2233
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:08,810
Uncle, it's not a Churidar.
It's a Kurta.

2234
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:10,600
What's the difference
between your outfit and mine?

2235
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:11,640
Even the stole is the same.

2236
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:13,270
-Can you keep quiet, please?
-Arun...

2237
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:15,230
Arun, the auspicious
time is about to pass.

2238
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:16,640
What do we do now?

2239
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:17,730
What do you think?

2240
02:16:17,730 --> 02:16:19,520
Shall we get married in the rain?

2241
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,680
It will be unique.

2242
02:16:20,770 --> 02:16:22,230
The pictures will be awesome, right?

2243
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,730
You convince your family.
Let me talk to mine.

2244
02:16:24,730 --> 02:16:25,680
Okay.

2245
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,850
What did she say?

2246
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:28,310
She said we needn't wait for
the auspicious time to be over...

2247
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:30,020
-and that we'll get married in the rain.

02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:31,140
-Mommy..
-Yes.

2249
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:33,810
Mommy, shall we get
married like this?

2250
02:16:33,850 --> 02:16:35,390
-Won't it be awesome?
-In this rain?

2251
02:16:35,390 --> 02:16:36,700
It will be fine, Uncle.
We needn't waste time.

2252
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:37,840
What if someone catches a fever?

2253
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:39,280
We can serve medicines
along with the feast.

2254
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:41,060
Uncle, relax.
Come, let's have a couple of drinks.

2255
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:42,430
Oh God! Please take him away!

2256
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:44,180
I won't step out in the rain,
wearing this Churidar.

2257
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:45,140
It's not a Churidar.
It's a Kurta!

2258
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:46,730
Can you stop being
so ridiculous, Uncle?

2259
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:48,980
Don't talk to me in English!
You know, right?

2260
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:50,730
I won't accept this!

2261
02:16:50,730 --> 02:16:52,390
-It's only for a short while.
-No way.

2262
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:54,640
-I wanted the indoor...
-Mommy, please.

2263
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:56,980
There are too many people.
Everyone will catch a fever.

2264
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:57,980
We'll see.

She didn't agree, huh?

You idiot! Don't mess with me.

I can't come so quickly.

I sense something wrong!

2371
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:03,430
I checked Darshana's Facebook
and Instagram accounts.

2372
02:23:03,730 --> 02:23:06,140
She has liked and commented
on every photo Arun has posted.

2373
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:07,460
But she has not
liked or commented

2374
02:23:07,460 --> 02:23:08,910
on even a single photo
in which I'm with him.

2375
02:23:08,970 --> 02:23:10,430

don't give him a chance to cheat.

is bad, right?

2397

What happened?

2398
02:25:04,310 --> 02:25:06,100
Around 10:30 PM,

2399
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:07,730
Nithya started having labour pain.

2400
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,730
At 11 PM,

2401
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,980
we brought her to the hospital.

2402

Since then,

I had been waiting here.

2404
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:22,060
Around five minutes back,

2405
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:23,930
the nurse came out
and asked for me.

2406
02:25:25,930 --> 02:25:26,930
Then...

2407
02:25:28,770 --> 02:25:31,930
she placed a tiny little
thing into my palms.

2408
02:25:34,730 --> 02:25:35,730
It's a boy!

2409
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:40,730
I've become a father!

2410
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:46,180
You're the first person
I felt like calling.

2411
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:50,060
If I continue talking,

2412
02:25:50,930 --> 02:25:51,930
I might lose it.

2413
02:25:52,390 --> 02:25:53,390
I'm hanging up.

2414
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:18,100
Darshana!

2415
02:26:18,810 --> 02:26:19,810
What happened?

2416
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:22,480
Arun just had a baby!

2417
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:24,680
Even your ex-boyfriend had a baby!

2418
02:26:25,350 --> 02:26:27,150
When are we going to talk
about marriage?

2419
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:29,730
Woah!

2420
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:31,390
Darshana, answer him!

2421
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:35,140
Answer him, Darshana!
Come on!

2422
02:26:50,190 --> 02:26:51,480
Didn't you tell me that...

2423
02:26:53,150 --> 02:26:55,160
we'll call him by the name
that comes to your mind,

2424
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:56,290
when you see him?

2425
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:00,450
What do we call him?

2426
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:03,190
What if you don't like
the name I call him?

2427
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:05,320
He's our baby!

2428
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:07,820
Call him what you like!

2429
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:27,940
Selva!

2430
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:31,190
Selva!

2431
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:36,730
Nice name.

2432
02:27:39,730 --> 02:27:40,730
Selva Arun.

2433
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:42,480
No.

2434
02:27:45,730 --> 02:27:47,440
Selva Nithya Arun.

2435
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:50,190
Thank you!

2436
02:28:11,570 --> 02:28:12,690
It's nothing, dear.

2437
02:28:12,730 --> 02:28:14,820
Why has the baby been
crying for so long?

2438
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:16,320
Give him to me.

2439
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:17,650
Let me see.

2440
02:28:17,690 --> 02:28:19,030
-Come.
-He's not crying now.

2441
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,230
He started crying only now.

2442
02:28:25,570 --> 02:28:26,730
That's enough.

2443
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:27,900
Give the baby to me.

2444
02:28:29,230 --> 02:28:30,480
Don't cry, dear.

2445
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,110
You must not feed
formula milk to the baby.

2446
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:34,650
You must only feed
him mother's milk.

2447
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:37,190
Can we let the baby starve
until she produces milk?

2448
02:28:37,230 --> 02:28:38,940
Why should you make
the baby wear diapers?

2449
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:40,110
Ask her to put him
on a rubber sheet.

2450
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:41,400
If we put him on a rubber sheet,

2451
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:43,570
how many times do we clean it?
Will she do it?

2452
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:45,980
Are you feeding him
with a plastic bottle, dear?

2453
02:28:45,980 --> 02:28:47,360
This is really bad for him.

2454
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:49,570
This is not ordinary plastic.
It's BPA free.

2455
02:28:49,610 --> 02:28:51,480
Plastic is plastic!

2456
02:28:51,570 --> 02:28:53,070
Why don't you take the baby
out in the sun in the morning?

2457
02:28:53,070 --> 02:28:54,190
He needs to get
Vitamin D, right?

2458
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:56,320
You come and sleep with
the baby at night, then.

2459
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:57,980
We aren't able to sleep
because the baby keeps crying.

2460
02:28:57,980 --> 02:29:00,280
He has to get enough milk, right?
That's why he doesn't sleep.

2461
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:02,400
My daughter is feeding him very well.

2462
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,940
Babies cry! It's the same,
all around the world.

2463
02:29:04,980 --> 02:29:07,030
Can all of you please
leave this house?

2464
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:08,730
I want to sleep!

2465
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:12,400
It's been two days since I slept!

2466
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:14,570
What a temper she has!

2467
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:16,690
Couldn't you fall in love
with a docile girl?

2468
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:21,190
If these three women
stay here together,

2469
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:22,780
you will be done for!

2470
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:23,940
That's for sure!

2471
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:26,030
What should I do now?

2472
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:29,230
I have taken leave
for three months.

2473
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:30,690
I can take care
of my wife and son.

2474
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,130
I don't need help from anyone!

2475
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:33,440
If you don't want it,
we don't want it either.

2476
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,070
You became a father
only now, right?

2477
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:36,940
-Neelan, control yourself!
-No!

2478
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:39,360
We won't stay here
even for a second longer.

2479
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:41,320
Dhanya, go pack our bags!
Come on!

2480
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:44,820
What are you waiting for?
Go and pack our bags!

2481
02:29:45,030 --> 02:29:46,320
Sorry.
Please pack our bags!

2482
02:29:48,670 --> 02:29:50,170
He'll get it from me.

2483
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:51,280
What a performance!

2484
02:29:52,110 --> 02:29:53,360
You guys should have
been in the movies!

2485
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:54,400
We should've, right?

2486
02:30:10,570 --> 02:30:12,010
You should never
listen to the advice

2487
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:13,670
from your father
and father-in-law...

2488
02:30:13,690 --> 02:30:14,900
about raising a baby.

2489
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:16,800
I learned that lesson
on that very day.

2490
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:20,570
Though they may create a ruckus,

2491
02:30:20,570 --> 02:30:22,230
with no women in the house,

2492
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,860
we are doomed!

2493
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:27,070
Didn't I tell you not
to order it online?

2494
02:30:27,390 --> 02:30:29,350
-Why can't you buy it from a shop?
-I'll buy it right away.

2495
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:30,480
Oh God!

2496
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:31,940
You've been shopping
for so long!

2497
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:33,480
Don't you want to come home?
Come quickly!

2498
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:35,570
I just got into the lift.
I'm pressing the button.

2499
02:30:48,980 --> 02:30:50,570
Baby!!!

2500
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:54,650
Please don't cry, baby!

2501
02:30:55,530 --> 02:30:57,900
My back is aching, Arun!

2502
02:30:58,030 --> 02:30:59,570
Shall I get you some
Amrutanjan balm?

2503
02:30:59,610 --> 02:31:01,280
Go give it to that ex
of yours, you idiot!

2504
02:31:01,730 --> 02:31:03,070
I'll bring Volini spray.

2505
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:04,730
Oh God! I wonder
where the Volini is.

2506
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:06,030
Oh! Baby!

2507
02:31:06,570 --> 02:31:07,650
Don't cry, dear.

2508
02:31:07,690 --> 02:31:09,400
Dude, the trailer of
Baahubali 2 is out.

2509
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,440
Did you watch it?

2510
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:11,440
Me?

2511
02:31:12,030 --> 02:31:13,230
You're asking me?

2512
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,150
-Hello?
-Were you asleep?

2513
02:31:24,070 --> 02:31:25,070
It's okay.
Tell me.

2514
02:31:25,730 --> 02:31:28,070
What's your opinion
about me getting married?

2515
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,440
What?

2516
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:33,570
What's your opinion...

2517
02:31:33,610 --> 02:31:37,110
about me getting married
and starting a family life?

2518
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:39,440
Very good opinion!

2519
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:42,570
Very, very good opinion!

2520
02:31:45,230 --> 02:31:47,190
Don't delay it any further.
Do it immediately!

2521
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:54,480
I haven't seen you
in so many years.

2522
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:55,780
Arun!

2523
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:56,900
I recognized you only
when you told me.

2524
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:58,360
We had met back in Kerala, right?

2525
02:31:58,360 --> 02:31:59,940
-How are your kids doing?
-They are fine.

2526
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:02,030
Bro! Welcome back to Madras!

2527
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:03,690
-Thank you! How's it going?
-Hey Nithya! How are you?

2528
02:32:04,820 --> 02:32:07,110
-Was it too much trouble for you?
-It's alright. How was his journey?

2529
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:08,900
-It was okay.
-Woah! He's crying a lot, huh?

2530
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:10,860
I'm fed up of these Malayali
students who come to Chennai.

2531
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:13,320
They get in with a waiting
list ticket and ask for seats..

2532
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:14,530
Do you know him?

2533
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:16,460
I've seen him somewhere.

2534
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:26,110
Where does Darshana stay?

2535
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:28,620
Darshana bought an apartment
worth 1.5 Crores in Kottivakkam.

2536
02:32:28,670 --> 02:32:29,710
Her life is set!

2537
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:31,030
How does she have so much money?

2538
02:32:31,070 --> 02:32:32,900
Dude, the reach for her videos
is unbelievable.

2539
02:32:32,940 --> 02:32:34,570
She has so many fans
and followers.

2540
02:32:34,570 --> 02:32:36,900
And she gets paid really well
for collaborations too.

2541
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:40,480
Shucks!
I missed a millionaire, huh?

2542
02:32:42,690 --> 02:32:43,900
I love you, baby!

2543
02:32:44,110 --> 02:32:45,110
I love you, baby!

2544
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:46,780
-Get lost.
-What is this, man?

2545
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:48,860
It's nothing, dear.

2546
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:51,860
-I don't have a place to stay.
-You can stay with me.

2547
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:53,110
-Hey! That's Arun!
-Hey, yeah!

2548
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:56,570
Hello!

2549
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:58,610
Didn't you guys go to the hotel?

2550
02:32:58,650 --> 02:33:00,530
No. He wanted to drop by.

2551
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:03,640
[indistinct chatter]

2552
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,650
We'll take care of the child.

2553
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:07,650
We'll bring him soon.

2554
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:10,820
-Nithya, they will bring the child.
-You guys carry on.

2555
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:12,110
He's so cute!

2556
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:13,820
-Where's the apartment?
-Arun! Arun!

2557
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:19,230
-Arun, our baby!
-He'll be fine. Come!

2558
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:20,440
Arun! Hey!

2559
02:33:20,770 --> 02:33:22,270
You should have brought
it earlier, right?

2560
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:24,460
Why do you have to keep
everything for the last minute?

2561
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:27,570
You're in full form early
in the morning itself, huh?

2562
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:29,330
-When did you reach?
-Just now.

2563
02:33:29,730 --> 02:33:31,530
I thought I'll see you
and head to the hotel.

2564
02:33:32,070 --> 02:33:33,280
Darshana, Hi!

2565
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:34,860
It's so nice to finally meet you!

2566
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:37,030
I keep watching all your videos.
I mean, I'm a huge fan!

2567
02:33:37,030 --> 02:33:39,620
That video you shot
in Rajasthan, was awesome!

2568
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,420
Thank you.

2569
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:42,190
And what you've managed
to do for yourself

2570
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:44,920
in just 6-7 years is just amazing!

2571
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:47,190
The video you shot
in Punjab was so good.

2572
02:33:47,230 --> 02:33:49,400
-Nithya, that's enough.
-Sorry, I'm going on and on.

2573
02:33:49,650 --> 02:33:51,280
-Must be just excited or something.
-Darshana!

2574
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:52,320
-Did you see him?
-Aww!

2575
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:54,610
Awww!

2576
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:57,190
He's so cute!

2577
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:01,980
He actually looks a bit
like Arun, no?

2578
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:10,530
Hey! He's crying.

2579
02:34:10,570 --> 02:34:12,150
Megha, can you hold him please?

2580
02:34:12,190 --> 02:34:13,610
Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

2581
02:34:13,690 --> 02:34:14,980
-Hey baby!
-Aww!

2582
02:34:15,690 --> 02:34:17,230
Who is this?
Who is this?

2583
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,480
Is this your Papa?

2584
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:44,780
♪ The face, as beautiful
As the full moon in the sky ♪

2585
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:59,940
♪ The mind, as pure and constant
As the elixir ♪

2586
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:04,860
Did you have food from outside?

2587
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:07,190
-We'll eat from the hotel.
-Why don't you eat here?

2588
02:35:07,230 --> 02:35:09,190
-There's idli and sambar here.
-Have you eaten?

2589
02:35:09,230 --> 02:35:12,030
You look so different in a saree.

2590
02:35:13,530 --> 02:35:16,440
If your food vlogging fans see this,

2591
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:17,730
they will snatch you away!

2592
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:20,650
Arun!
Did you have food?

2593
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:21,940
-No.
-Come!

2594
02:35:21,980 --> 02:35:23,570
Come, come.
Everybody, come!

2595
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:36,840
Once the function is over...

2596
02:35:36,860 --> 02:35:38,980
Mom, don't serve him idli.
He likes upma.

2597
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:40,360
Give him upma.

2598
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:42,860
Do you like upma?

2599
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:44,780
Yes, I love it.

2600
02:35:46,730 --> 02:35:48,360
But you never told me that.

2601
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:51,650
Does anyone keep telling
everyone that they like upma?

2602
02:35:57,070 --> 02:35:58,280
How's the upma?

2603
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:00,190
Yeah!
Terrific!

2604
02:36:10,860 --> 02:36:11,860
Darshana?

2605
02:36:12,070 --> 02:36:13,150
I need to talk to you.

2606
02:36:13,730 --> 02:36:14,940
Come to Palavakkam beach.

2607
02:36:15,150 --> 02:36:16,150
Darsh...

2608
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,320
Arun!

2609
02:36:43,530 --> 02:36:44,650
Where are you going?

2610
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:51,690
Err.. my friends are partying
in another hotel nearby.

2611
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:54,580
I'll be back soon.

2612
02:37:29,610 --> 02:37:30,610
Darshana had called.

2613
02:37:32,570 --> 02:37:33,820
She said she wants to meet me.

2614
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,360
Shall I go?

2615
02:37:42,730 --> 02:37:43,730
Go and come back soon.

2616
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:19,440
Do you remember this place?

2617
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:33,320
I've been thinking
for the past two days,

2618
02:38:33,730 --> 02:38:35,570
whether I should
get married or not.

2619
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:39,730
Once I get married,
will I lose my freedom?

2620
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:44,190
Will I be able to continue working
the way I am now?

2621
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:48,190
Will I be able to take care
of my parents like I am now?

2622
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:52,460
Will another person have control
over my financial matters?

2623
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:54,820
So many things on my mind!

2624
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:57,290
And then I was thinking...

2625
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,190
Vishak is a great guy!

2626
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:03,990
I fight a lot with him!

2627
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:07,320
But he gets it!
He's...

2628
02:39:07,820 --> 02:39:09,230
He's so understanding.

2629
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:16,320
I'm probably overthinking
these things, right?

2630
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:17,900
Absolutely!

2631
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:25,820
Arun,

2632
02:39:27,030 --> 02:39:29,690
if I had forgiven you
during our first year in college,

2633
02:39:30,580 --> 02:39:32,330
would we be together even now?

2634
02:39:35,690 --> 02:39:37,650
When you asked me this
at the station that day,

2635
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:39,440
I didn't have an answer.

2636
02:39:39,820 --> 02:39:41,280
And do you have an answer now?

2637
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:48,320
A few days after my son was born,

2638
02:39:49,230 --> 02:39:50,570
one morning,

2639
02:39:53,030 --> 02:39:54,480
I sat down for a while,

2640
02:39:54,510 --> 02:39:57,800
just looking at
the two people lying next to me.

2641
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:04,190
There are some moments in life,

2642
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:06,190
that make you realize
what you're living for.

2643
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:08,400
It was a moment like that.

2644
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:12,400
There will be a phase
like that in your life too.

2645
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,110
What if it were like this...

2646
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:16,320
What if it were like that...

2647
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:18,980
You'll stop thinking
about all that.

2648
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:21,320
You will understand,

2649
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:23,150
"This is it!"

2650
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:24,610
This is how it's going to be!

2651
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:28,440
All this sounds great, but...

2652
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:33,110
But I see so many marriages
just falling apart, it's...

2653
02:40:37,400 --> 02:40:39,440
What if these moments
you had in your life,

2654
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:41,200
don't happen in mine?

2655
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,820
If they don't,
you are doomed!

2656
02:40:45,730 --> 02:40:47,570
It's your wedding tomorrow!

2657
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:49,030
Stop racking your brains,

2658
02:40:49,070 --> 02:40:51,110
go home and sleep peacefully.

2659
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:54,180
It's not tomorrow.
It's today!

2660
02:40:55,950 --> 02:41:13,160
♪ The face,
As beautiful as the full moon in the sky ♪

2661

2672
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:09,400
The flight is delayed by two hours.

2673
02:42:09,530 --> 02:42:10,570
Shucks!

2674
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:12,160
Arun, in that case...

2675
02:42:12,170 --> 02:42:14,280
Mithra has a shop
in Thoraippakkam, right?

2676
02:42:14,390 --> 02:42:15,800
Shall I go shop there?

2677
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:17,540
Okay.
We have time anyway.

2678
02:42:20,110 --> 02:42:21,320
What is it, dear?

2679
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:23,530
Brother!

2680
02:42:23,860 --> 02:42:25,110
Brother, please take a U-turn.

2681
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:26,320
-Okay, sir.
-What happened?

2682
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:28,860
Shall I visit my college?

2683
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:30,070
We have time, right?

2684
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:31,540
You finish your shopping
and come back.

2685
02:42:33,460 --> 02:42:39,670
♪ O' heart! ♪

2686
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:42,320
Brother, you can drop
me outside the gate.

2687
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:43,360
Okay, sir.

2688
02:42:46,030 --> 02:42:47,360
So, I'll see you in a bit?

2689
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:48,480
Okay.

2690
02:42:53,530 --> 02:42:54,530
Say bye!

2691
02:42:54,570 --> 02:42:55,570
Bye, Papa!

2692
02:43:58,110 --> 02:43:59,110
Arun?

2693
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:03,600
I'm Jasleen.

2694
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:04,780
Remember?

2695
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:06,190
Your senior?

2696
02:44:08,210 --> 02:44:11,040
Darshana... jumping over the wall?

2697
02:44:11,610 --> 02:44:12,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2698
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:14,110
Oh my God!
How come...

2699
02:44:14,330 --> 02:44:15,330
How come you're here?

2700
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:17,440
I helped many people
get out of this college.

2701
02:44:17,650 --> 02:44:18,860
I got stuck here!

2702
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:19,940
I'm teaching.

2703
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:21,280
Seriously?

2704
02:44:21,480 --> 02:44:22,480
Yeah!

2705
02:44:22,570 --> 02:44:23,570
Oh God!

2706
02:44:24,690 --> 02:44:25,730
"Oh God?"

2707
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:28,550
So...

2708
02:44:29,730 --> 02:44:31,530
Who else...
I mean...

2709
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:33,500
Who else is here
from our college days?

2710
02:44:33,570 --> 02:44:34,730
Who else...?

2711
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:36,360
There are mainly four factors.

2712
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:37,650
Effect of temperature,

2713
02:44:37,690 --> 02:44:39,030
effect of grain size,

2714
02:44:39,190 --> 02:44:41,030
effect of heat and...

2715
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:47,780
Oh! You've got a beard now?

2716
02:44:48,030 --> 02:44:49,280
Like you've got gray hair.

2717
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:51,530
I coloured it gray,
to get that look!

2718
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:52,980
Yeah, right!

2719
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:55,650
I came for Darshana's wedding.

2720
02:44:55,820 --> 02:44:57,530
-I'm on my way back.
-Missed it!

2721
02:44:57,690 --> 02:44:58,860
Special class!

2722
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:04,480
Ma'am.... could you give me
the key to the secret alley?

2723
02:45:05,190 --> 02:45:06,230
Arun, you know right?

2724
02:45:06,230 --> 02:45:08,690
We give it only on
the final day of the final year.

2725
02:45:08,730 --> 02:45:09,820
It's the Principal's rule.

2726
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:11,400
I'm in no position to change it.

2727
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:13,480
Sorry!

2728
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:14,820
It's okay.

2729
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:25,320
Vijayetta!

2730
02:45:25,610 --> 02:45:26,610
All well?

2731
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:28,570
You can call me Varikkappara.

2732
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:30,110
I heard that you've come.

2733
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:32,690
I'm working as the Vice-Principal's
staff now.

2734
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:36,400
There was a friend of yours
who thrashed me back then, right?

2735
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:37,480
What was his name?

2736
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:39,900
-Anto!
-Yes.

2737
02:45:40,230 --> 02:45:41,530
Where is he now?

2738
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:42,820
He's in America now.

2739
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:44,230
Convey my regards to him.

2740
02:45:44,570 --> 02:45:45,570
Sure!

2741
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:48,110
Keerthy Ma'am asked me
to give you something.

2742
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:51,610
Return it quickly, okay?

2743
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:56,230
Thank you, Vijayetta.
