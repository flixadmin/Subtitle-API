1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,879
<i>I just got served a black hand.</i>

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,794
<i>Everybody will have got one.
They're coming for us all.</i>

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,280
<i>These men will
not leave our city</i>

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,600
<i>until the whole family is dead.</i>

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,912
<i>This was all my fault.
It was me that shot the old man.</i>

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,673
John's dead because of me.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,073
<i>Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison</i>

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,992
<i>every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.</i>

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,754
<i>We're going back.
Back to Small Heath.</i>

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,116
<i>That's how it works. An eye for an eye.</i>

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,520
<i>It's called vendetta.</i>

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,355
We are an organisation,
but different. Imagine...

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,477
<i>None of you will survive.</i>

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,873
<i>And how is Tommy Shelby OBE,
going to stop a revolution?</i>

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,474
<i>If I getJessie Eden's trust,</i>

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,711
<i>she gives me the names
of the instigators,</i>

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,439
<i>I'll give them up to the Crown forces.</i>

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,592
<i>I want you to help my son
achieve his ambition.</i>

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,160
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,880
<i>We control him,
run the book, control the odds.</i>

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,394
<i>We got a lot going on, that's all.</i>

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,153
So it might be a good time
to get around?

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,720
Mr Shelby will give you a 20% cut

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,634
if you put Goliath down
in the fourth round.

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,518
So you're gonna take my boys

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,996
and you're gonna bring them
to the ring as seconds.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,595
Yeah, Tommy Shelby
was right about you. Wasn't he?

Yeah, you're like me, Tommy,

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
you can't bear to watch a fight
which has got rules.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,679
Tommy, right, imagine...

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,276
Imagine that you could not see.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,072
At all, you was born blind.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,280
Then one day you open up your eyes

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,636
and you can see everything

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,515
in the world.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,638
When before you could only

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,392
touch it or smell it.

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,676
Hmm. There it is.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
The revelation.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Innit?

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,920
I've had one.

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,315
Yeah, saw a beautiful house
down in Margate.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,631
Great big white building...

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,518
Monkey puzzle tree
against the sky blue.

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,677
Beautiful. A piece of heaven.

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,710
Actually, you see, the way the Earth,
it curves, I thought to myself,

61
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,759
"Alfie, what are you doing?"

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,559
"What are you doing?"

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,792
"Why don't you just sell
every ounce of gold and sell"

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,635
"every barrel of rum you got and just
buy yourself some time, mate?"

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,360
I need to buy myself some time.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,320
You're moving to Margate?

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,677
I am actually, yeah.
I need to get myself some rest.

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,240
I need some rest.

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,317
Plus, the Americans are
here now, aren't they?

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,232
So, that's it.

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,996
Yeah. It's been that way ever since
the war, innit? The Americans.

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,719
Big fucks small.

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,833
Always, actually.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,270
Hmm?

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,558
And there is a fight going on,
out there, between big and small.

76
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,436
Big will fuck small.

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,437
Right. Margate then. Blue skies, heaven.

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,672
I will see you, Tommy.

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,994
Might appear.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,438
Stay and watch the fight, Alfie?

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,034
No, you're all right.

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,352
I already know who wins.

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Don't I?

84
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Cheer up.

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,631
Round one!

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Left, right.

87
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,197
Oh!

88
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,194
Bonnie! Bonnie!

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,837
I know he's a big bastard
but you got to...

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,276
- Where's Solomons?
- Apparently he doesn't watch.

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,314
Look at that corner. Look.

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,437
The men there,
they don't know fighters.

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,113
I don't like it.

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,431
You feel it though, Tom, don't ya?

95
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,398
I feel it. We're all right.

96
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,437
We're surrounded by soldiers, Arthur.

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,115
Alfie's men were strip searched.
We're all right.

98
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,757
Right, come on, Gypsy boy, let's go.

99
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Round two!

100
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,790
So what did Tommy say
when you told him?

101
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,117
He said I'd get a weekly allowance.

102
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,759
Oh, he can be romantic.

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,079
Course as company treasurer,

104
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,231
I shall be questioning that expense.

105
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,392
He said something like, "We've had
enough death, let's have some life."

106
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,233
Poll...

107
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,192
This fight is fixed, isn't it?

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,917
Poor Gypsy boy's getting
battered out there.

109
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,711
Right. You said you have some news?

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,439
Lizzie has some news.

111
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Polly.

112
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,319
Well, tell her. Now!

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,073
While the men are screaming for blood.

114
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,991
Have a swig. You're gonna need it.

115
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,997
I'm up the duff.

116
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,793
And it's Tommy's.

117
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,394
How far gone are you?

118
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,517
If I were going to London
I'd be in Coventry.

119
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,398
And are you carrying on past Coventry?

120
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,199
All the way to fucking
Piccadilly Circus.

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,296
You found out whether
she's having a boy or a girl, Poll?

122
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
No.

123
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,476
Go on then.

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
It's a girl.

125
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,430
Call her Ruby.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,275
Ruby Shelby.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,595
She'll be a star in a Hollywood movie.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Hmm.

129
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,480
Congratulations.

130
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,556
Hey, Linda.

131
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,350
Welcome to the extraordinary general
meeting of the Shelby ladies club.

132
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,595
Is there spit on my back?

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,353
There were men out there spitting.
It's fucking disgusting.

134
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,671
No, there's no spit on your back.

135
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,915
Don't let us stop you doing
what you came in to do.

136
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
What?

137
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,271
It's helped me get through the fucking
nightmare of being stuck in this city.

138
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,430
Well, since you're here
and you're almost family,

139
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,749
Lizzie's got some news.

140
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,436
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh?

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,240
And who's the father, have you
managed to narrow it down?

142
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,679
Yes, it's Tommy.

143
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,680
Congratulations.

144
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,759
You've won the raffle at last.

145
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,235
Yeah. She's a real
Shelby lady now, Linda.

146
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,509
Just like you.

147
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,119
Right, ladies,
let's rejoin our gentlemen.

148
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,399
And just remember, Linda,

149
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,234
if they spit, just spit back.

150
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,631
- I'll see you out there.
- All right.

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,480
Come on, Bonnie!

152
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,594
Put him away!

153
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,435
Right. Who's with me, boys?

154
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,320
Come get your loyalty, boy.

155
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,273
You still in control, Bonnie?

156
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Yes.

157
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Then take him.

158
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,753
I give ya two to one!

159
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,312
On the big Cockney Goliath, here.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,198
Take it or leave it, boys.

161
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,112
Take it or leave it, boys.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,760
Two to one! Two to one!

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,478
Look at them men in his corner. Look.

164
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,879
They don't know fighters.

165
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,792
They don't know the fucking ropes.

166
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,395
It's the pills and the booze
spooking you, Arthur.

167
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,834
Round three!

168
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,636
Ah, look at them. They don't
stand right. They don't move right.

169
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,996
They don't even care
if he fucking wins.

170
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,474
It's the fucking pills, brother.

171
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,670
All right?

172
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,518
Come on, Bonnie!

173
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,476
Whoo! Come on, Bonnie!

174
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,400
What the fuck are they laughing at?

175
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,909
Send her back.

176
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Too strong.

177
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Come on, Bonnie!

178
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,472
- Arthur, leave it.
- Where is he going?

179
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,995
Sit down and watch
the fight, eh, Arthur!

180
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,275
Come here!

181
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,636
Let me do my fucking job!

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,116
Bonnie!

183
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,157
Bonnie! Are you okay?

184
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,271
I'll give you two to one
now on the Cockney.

185
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,034
Right.

186
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,112
That's it. One, two. One, two!

187
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,952
Come on, Bonnie boy!

188
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,918
Bonnie, come on, get him!

189
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Come on!

190
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,279
Where are Tommy and Arthur?

191
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
Punch him!

192
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
I don't know.

193
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,110
Come on, Bonnie!

194
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,160
Come on!

195
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Arthur!

196
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
You fucking bastard.

197
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,200
Arthur!

198
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,677
I declare Bonnie Gold the new
welterweight champion

199
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,037
of the Midlands South...

200
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Yes!

201
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,115
Yes! Bonnie!

202
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Tommy, what's happened?

203
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,915
Arthur's dead.

204
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,037
He's dead.

205
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,916
Tommy, we have the other wop.

206
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,673
Cunt had a wire in his pockets.

207
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,196
Go on, Finn!

208
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Go on, Finn!

209
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,434
Take his eyes, Finn.

210
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,476
Do it for Arthur.

211
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,553
Take his fucking eyes!

212
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,880
No. No!

213
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,799
Close the doors!

214
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,877
No one fucking leaves!

215
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,560
My brother is dead.

216
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,358
You hear me!

217
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,239
My brother is dead!

218
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,360
Tommy.

219
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,110
Hello, Michael.

220
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,474
There's been a change of plan.

221
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,840
<i>Mr Gold will come and get you.</i>

222
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Arthur's dead.

223
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,680
Tommy, I've been trying to
think of words...

224
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Don't.

225
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,314
Words don't work.

226
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,950
Michael, we're in a grave situation.

227
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,955
Tommy has a plan.

228
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,193
Instead of going to Australia,

229
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,835
you're going to New York.

230
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Why?

231
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,714
'Cause the company has business
to attend to in America.

232
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,629
Will I be coming back?

233
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,034
Train leaves in an hour, Michael.

234
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,435
You made a choice.

235
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,080
You knew I was gonna be shot

236
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,960
and you chose not to tell me.

237
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,235
I chose my mum.

238
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,193
When all this business is over

239
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,236
we'll all be free to make
our own choices.

240
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
So is that it?

241
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,357
<i>You get the train to Liverpool then
the SS Monroe.</i>

242
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,115
Boat sails tomorrow.

243
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Now you can go.

244
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,113
I need an overseas connection, please.

245
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
USA.

246
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,911
- Tommy!
- It's all right, let her come.

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Please.

248
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,675
Once we're all finished.

249
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,072
<i>Your note talked about
making terms for peace.</i>

250
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,480
But my son says there are no terms.

251
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,440
You took my husband and my son.

252
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,433
We took two of your brothers.

253
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
The vendetta is done.

254
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,359
We say the vendetta is won.

255
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,630
We will take everything you have.

256
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,393
All your businesses,

257
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,914
signed over to us.

258
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,834
You agree to this.

259
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Or my son will kill you all.

260
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,553
One by one.

261
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,394
The vendetta is won.

262
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's it.

263
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
No more killing.

264
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,394
Who do you think you were, Mr Shelby?

265
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,720
Why don't you let him know
we're hereto buy his business?

266
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,520
Mr Solomons!

267
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,636
Mr Changretta's here to see you!

268
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Come now.

269
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,196
My Peaky!

270
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,600
They say he was a captain.

271
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Oh, yeah?

272
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,400
Then you might wanna tell them
not to open that fucking door.

273
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,078
Seems Mr Solomons
already left town.

274
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,559
So all this is mine.

275
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Huh.

276
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
You don't knock?

277
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,754
You don't know my new address?

278
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,160
Hello, Lizzie, how are you?

279
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,560
I know your new address, Lizzie,

280
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,536
because it was me who bought you
the new fucking house.

281
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,994
Then why don't you visit it?

282
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,675
We have been busy.

283
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,509
Busy doing what?

284
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,229
Preparing for tomorrow.

285
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,429
Why, what's tomorrow?

286
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,838
Luca Changretta is coming to Birmingham.
It's our turn.

287
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,833
He's already taken over
Alfie Solomons, Sabini,

288
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,116
Titanics... All of them.

289
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,517
And now he's coming to take control
of Shelby Company Limited.

290
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,233
What are we going to do about that?

291
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,753
We're gonna let him have it.

292
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,837
All that's left of the Peaky
fucking Blinders.

293
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,760
I've had my lawyer draw up these papers.

294
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,753
Cover, uh, every enterprise
in your possession.

295
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,078
Bars, restaurants, warehouses.

296
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,000
Every fucking thing that you've taken
all these years to gather together.

297
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,239
You will sign them all over

298
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
to my family

299
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,680
or you're gonna die.

300
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,910
Right here.

301
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,638
I would've buried you all

302
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,591
but my mother, she, uh,

303
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,672
she knows you, she said.

304
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,760
It'll be worse for you
if I let you live

305
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,511
and take away everything
that you have.

306
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,429
Search him.

307
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,835
Especially don't trust this bitch.

308
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,956
So.

309
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,516
Sign.

310
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,678
Every fucking one of them.

311
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,272
You can sign them on your knees.

312
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,309
On the floor.

313
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,796
Get on your fucking knees and sign.

314
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,113
A friend of mine once said...

315
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,119
Big fucks small.

316
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,432
So I had to find someone
bigger than you.

317
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,078
Now, you may know there are
two families in Brooklyn,

318
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,674
who want take over your monopoly

319
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,956
on the import of liquor
into New York.

320
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,839
But if they move against you
in New York,

321
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,230
they'll start a war
between the families.

322
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,840
But if you were to die in a vendetta

323
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,833
with some fucking bookmaker
in Birmingham,

324
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,837
they could take over your business
without a war.

325
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,112
We also contacted
a businessman in Chicago.

326
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,153
He's also interested in moving into
the liquor business in New York.

327
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,113
His name is Alphonse Capone.

328
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,317
You been talking to that fat fuck?

329
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,360
You see, all the blood relatives
you brought with you

330
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,593
from New York, they're all dead,
Mr Changretta.

331
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,797
And these men here,

332
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,156
they work for money,
for the highest bidder.

333
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,759
They now have new orders.

334
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,955
Is that right?

335
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,640
Is that right?

336
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,352
And you, Matteo?

337
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,750
Hey.

338
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,520
Very fucking...

339
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,919
<i>Arthur's been injured
but he's all right, Poll.</i>

340
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,392
<i>We need to make them believe
that he's dead.</i>

341
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,919
<i>To everyone but you, me, and Linda,</i>

342
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,591
<i>Arthur Shelby is dead.</i>

343
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,200
<i>I've got it all worked out.</i>

344
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,879
<i>We can use his death to win this war.</i>

345
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,836
Tell your people in Chicago

346
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,037
that Michael Gray

347
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,635
will sign the import
licence to New York.

348
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,394
300 barrels of English dry gin
a month.

349
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Leave.

350
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
All of ya.

351
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,072
Tell your boss what you saw
here today.

352
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,115
And tell him...

353
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,430
You don't fuck with
the Peaky Blinders.

354
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,120
Nice. Hey!

355
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,680
Listen up. Um.

356
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,592
Before we go and eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

357
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,520
Last time we were all here,

358
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,716
it ended badly.

359
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Yeah.

360
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,999
And now, we're in a happier place.

361
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,797
That's it.
I'd just like to raise a toast.

362
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,670
Hold on.

363
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,516
A few words I want to say
from the heart,

364
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,239
and this time,

365
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,277
you're gonna let me finish, Tommy.

366
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,269
Now, as you all know,

367
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,995
Arthur Shelby is dead.

368
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,116
'Cause of that,

369
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,159
Tommy's offered me a way out.

370
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,075
A new identity.

371
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,272
Start a whole new life for meself.

372
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,275
I've thought about it.

373
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,190
Made a decision.

374
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,592
I ain't fucking going nowhere.

375
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,077
Our enemies are gone.

376
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,389
Dead, all of them.

377
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,390
For the first time since me,

378
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,949
my two kid brothers,

379
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,394
Tommy and John,

380
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,716
enlisted in the Warwickshire Yeomanry,

381
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,750
we have peace.

382
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,996
So.

383
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,037
I think I'd like to make a proposal

384
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,310
to all of you,
the Shelby Company Limited,

385
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,238
insist that Tommy here

386
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,960
take some time off.

387
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,199
Time you took a holiday, Tom.

388
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,470
Put your feet up.

389
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,876
War's over.

390
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,954
No one wants to kill us.

391
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,310
To peace.

392
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,799
To peace.

393
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,272
I do hope you're gonna leave the dog
out of this.

394
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,195
You were easy to find.

395
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
Yeah, well there's a good reason
for that, Tommy.

396
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,034
Because I wanted it to be here.

397
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,960
I once told you, Alfie,

398
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,670
that for business reasons
or in bad blood,

399
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,510
I would kill you.

400
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,238
I have no business reasons.

401
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,352
It seems you have retired.

402
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,439
So this is all purely for bad blood,
is it, Tommy?

403
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,113
- Yeah.
- Right. Yeah.

404
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,870
Told you.

405
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,274
I wanted it to be here.

406
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,191
- You gonna look after this dog?
- No.

407
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,797
Right then. Well, his name is Cyril

408
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,553
and he'll be very upset
and distressed,

409
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,393
so you'll need to find him someone.

410
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,313
- You're not armed?
- No.

411
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,595
Don't be daft.

412
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,757
The only thing I got on me

413
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,393
is fucking cancer, mate.

414
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,316
Yeah.

415
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,715
Riddled with it.

416
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,838
Doctor told me I might have picked it up
in France in the gas or something.

417
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,400
He even showed me a photograph

418
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,358
Alfie, stop talking.

419
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,875
So I said, "Margate" right,
and here I am.

420
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,599
- Come on, Tommy.
- Alfie, look at me.

421
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,275
There's an honourable reason now
to pull that trigger

422
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,840
Alfie, look at me.

423
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,196
Fucking get on with it.
Stop acting like a little girl.

424
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,636
Alfie!

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,119
I'll call Mrs Gray.

I know what this is...

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,759
It's just myself talking to myself

Since I know you won't go yourself,

447
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,199
I've been to a doctor on your behalf.

448
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,271
No, it's all right.
None of the boys know you're sick.

449
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,594
I'm not sick, Polly.

450
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,515
It starts when you stop,
when you rest.

451
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,435
Could be nerves.

452
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,834
The war.

453
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,634
It might be the alcohol.
Blue devils, they call that.

454
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,915
Yeah, well. Yeah.

455
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,275
Yeah, it's the fucking booze.

456
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,394
It's the booze, the booze got out
and the booze got in me bones.

457
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,600
Lizzie wants to see you.

458
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,990
No.

459
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,800
Tom, she's showing.

460
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,280
I don't want to see Lizzie, Poll.

461
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,353
Shit. Maybe it's in us.

462
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,910
It's with Shelbys.

463
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,154
It's in our Gypsy blood.

464
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,597
We live somewhere
between life and death,

465
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,079
waiting to move on.

466
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,315
And in the end,

467
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,550
we accept it.

468
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,953
We shake hands with devils

469
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,914
and we walk past them.

470
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,993
Mr Shelby, you're meant to be resting.

471
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,673
I've learned something, Frances.

472
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,116
There's no rest for me in this world.

473
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,675
Perhaps in the next.

474
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,994
Them there, you pay out.
This one, you have to think.

475
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,639
Use your fucking head, man.

476
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,074
Right, even money.

477
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,550
Whose fucking idea was it
that I go on holiday?

478
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,031
Welcome back, Tommy. How was it?
What'd you get up to?

479
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,520
Went fishing, played golf.

480
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,954
Golf's fucking boring.

481
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,156
Boring and easy.

482
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,630
Yeah, well, what's the plan?

483
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,397
<i>I need you to give
this toJessie Eden.</i>

484
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,755
<i>By hand.</i>

485
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,559
- Yes, Mr Shelby.
- By your hand.

486
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,077
This will be the last job
you'll do for me.

487
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,038
You can go to Glasgow
and be with your family.

488
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,840
You're free.

489
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,993
You need to sign all of these.

490
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,279
So you shook hands with the devil?

491
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,196
Yeah.

492
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,995
And I walked past him.

493
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
Poll.

494
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,149
I've had an idea.

495
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,836
Oh, fuck.

496
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,071
<i>"DearJessie,
now, more certainly than ever,"</i>

497
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,392
<i>"I believe things must change.
Things must change."</i>

498
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,799
<i>"The general strike is holding."</i>

499
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,920
<i>"We've not an hour to lose."</i>

500
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,750
<i>"Meet me."</i>

501
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,757
<i>- I've made up my mind, Jessie.
- About what?</i>

502
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,313
Your cause is now my cause.

503
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,550
I wanna help.

504
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,480
The strike is holding. I want to meet
the people who can take this further.

505
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,635
Are you serious?

506
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,280
Yeah.

507
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,240
I've done a lot of thinking.

508
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,514
Right. I'll arrange a meeting.

509
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,153
The operator knows my voice.

510
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,560
Give me the name and the number.

511
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,480
His name is Casey Douglas.

512
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,592
It's Sparkhill 453.

513
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,716
Right.

514
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,040
And he's the leader of the cell?

515
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,437
He's in contact with London
and Moscow.

516
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Good.

517
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,559
Yeah. Sparkhill 453.

518
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,516
<i>You are quite a creature,
Mr Shelby.</i>

519
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,195
<i>When I received your note,
I wasn't sure you could deliver.</i>

520
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,829
I've made contact

521
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,038
with a Soviet agent inside
the Birmingham Communist Party.

522
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,440
And do you have a name?

523
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,839
And an address and a telephone number.

524
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,040
I can be of great use to you.

525
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,395
I can give you the name
of any communist party member,

526
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,680
who is prepared to cross the line

527
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,870
into armed revolution.

528
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,229
We're in the fourth day
of a general strike,

529
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,595
which appears to be holding.

530
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,393
Even if it fails today,

531
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,233
tomorrow they may succeed.

532
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
Mmm.

533
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,555
And you're offering to help ensure
they never succeed.

534
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,635
If my cover is maintained,

535
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,112
I can begin to shape the movement
and organise it myself.

536
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,640
And undermine it?

537
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,354
Rise through the ranks of the wider
Socialist movements.

538
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,557
Of course.
You want something in return.

539
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,715
What this time? A knighthood?

540
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,670
My proposal.

541
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,715
And my conditions.

542
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,911
For the attention
of Winston Churchill?

543
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,040
He holds me in very high regard.

544
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,560
Are you serious?

545
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,597
Breaking up a revolutionary cell
is one thing.

546
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,189
Given my position of influence
in my home city.

547
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,000
I could be of much more use
to you than that.
