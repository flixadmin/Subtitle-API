a long haul figuring out your platform,

{\an8}but the good news is, we're almost done.

8

00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,868
Mmm, actually, only one.

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,580
I figured out where we're going to
hold Ollie's, uh, fundraiser.

It's going to be at Gerard's.

From what I remember,
that place is a little pricey,

our last talking point, the budget.

but she's just

been slammed at Palmer Tech
for the past few days.

She's really taking
this whole CEO thing seriously.

Well, one of us has to have a job
that actually makes money.

I'll speak with her,
I'll get those numbers for you.

My life is really complicated right now,

with my brother's campaign manager

is going to make it any easier.

No, you're right.
That was, uh, totally unprofessional,

{\an8}I will, however,
accept your undying support and backrub.

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,372
{\an8}-Shower.
-And take a nap.

159
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,708

00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,840
{\an8}I set an alert just in case

00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,268
Absolutely nothing.

-FELICITY: Oh, my God, Ray!
-Ray, where are you?

00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,735
<i>I don't know.</i>

172
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,278
<i>And if that wasn't enough,
I think I'm being held against my will.</i>

173
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,404
What?

00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,781
<i>They want my suit, or at least the tech.</i>

<i>The only good news is, the tech is
useless to them in my current condition.</i>

176
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,203
Ray, if you have your suit,
then why don't you just, uh...

177
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,664
<i>Bust my way out?</i> (SIGHS)
<i>Yeah, that's not really happening.</i>

178
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,874
What, the suit doesn't work?

00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,251
<i>Actually, it worked a little too well.</i>

180
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,100
<i>They want my suit, or at least the tech.</i>

-John is never going to believe this.
-Neither is Thea.

183
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,315
And, well, Ray is...

184
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,317
{\an8}The size of a tater tot.

185
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,695
{\an8}Ray modified his suit with
the same nanites I injected into him

186
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,863
{\an8}after Bad Arrow shot him.

187
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,157
{\an8}It's a long story
involving a lot of molecular physics.

188
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:14,786
{\an8}The bottom line is that Ray
jury-rigged a short-range message burst

189
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,163
{\an8}that was intercepted
by whoever's holding him captive.

190
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,206
{\an8}Ray thinks they want the suit
for its technology,

191
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,583
{\an8}but they can't use it while it's small.

192
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,084
LAUREL: And while he's small, it's like

193
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,336
looking for a needle
in a city of haystacks.

194
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,213
Ray has something he thinks could help.

195
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,925

I've got schematics for a machine</i>

Well, now that you're both filled in...

198
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,764
OLIVER: Where are you going?

199
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,766
To Palmer Tech, to pull up
the schematics for Ray's device.

200
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,934
I'll come with you.

201
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,061
Why? Are you going to build the thing?

202
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,688
(STUTTERS) No.

203
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,065
There must be some other way I can help.

204
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:45,357
There isn't.

205
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,410
This isn't over, you know.

206
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,995
You and me.

207
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,706
I'm so glad.

We need to get
a couple people in the water.

210
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,879
Dive down, see what you can find.

211
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,757
Everyone is tired.
We've been here for hours.

212
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,677
If you want them to work,
they have to be able to.

213
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,637
You their leader?

214
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,389
I'm the guy telling you to let them rest.

215
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,225
Okay.

216
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,602
You brought food.

217
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,563
Take 15 minutes and eat.

218
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,941
Well, ain't you employer of the month.

219
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,569
I'm going to need you
to keep an eye on them,

220
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,196
and I'm going to go
enjoy my lunch in peace.

221
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,039
CONKLIN: Hey, Ukraine.

222
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,916
My name is Vlad.

223
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,878
Well, Vlad,

224
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,297
how'd you like
your life to get a little better?

225
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,344
Dr. Palmer got miniaturization to work.

226
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,304
He made the space between atoms shrink.

227
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,600
I mean, this is like solving cold fusion
and ultimate theory. (CHUCKLES)

228
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,644
-Do you have any idea how amazing this is?
-Yes.

229
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,520
But the fact
that Ray is being held hostage

230
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,939
and could be killed at any moment
because he is the size of a Cheeto

231
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,233
has dampened my enthusiasm somewhat.

232
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,735
-Can you build this?
-Yes.

233
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,821
Uh, all the materials are here
at Palmer Tech, uh,

234
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,114
except for that.

235
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,491
That is a quantum manifold.

236
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,118
Never heard of it. Where do we get one?

237
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,787
Only one place. The manufacturer.

238
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,455
They hold the patent on it...
Well, actually, 16 patents.

239
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
-Curtis. Where?
-Kord Industries.

240
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,168
I'd ask them to do us a solid
and loan it to us, but...

241
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,460
They're our biggest competitor.

242
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,047
The good news is,
things can't get any worse. (CHUCKLES)

243
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,424
(DONNA SQUEALING)

244
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,801
You just had to go and say that.

245
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,179
There you are!

246
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,515
Mom. Oh. (LAUGHS)

247
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,188
Oh. (CHUCKLES) What are you doing here?

248
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:50,441
DONNA: Well, I went to your office,
Miss CEO,

249
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,819
and your assistant told me you'd be here.

250
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,321
So... Here I am.

251
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,365
Not here-here, Star City here.

252
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,076
Well, Oliver told me

253
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,078
that you've been working nonstop
this past month,

254
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,288
-so I suggested a visit from your mom...
-Uh-huh.

255
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,290
...is exactly what you needed,
and guess what?

256
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,834
-What?
-He agreed.

257
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,626
Oh.

258
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,088
Hi. (CHUCKLES) And who are you?

259
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,256
-Oh.
-Hi. I'm Curtis Holt.

260
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,508
-It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.
-Oh.

261
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,845
I can see where Felicity got her, uh...

262
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,806
Blonde hair. (CHUCKLES)

263
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,432
(ALL LAUGH)

264
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,517
Well, she dyes it, actually.

265
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,354
So, what do you want to do first?

266
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,356
A trip to the mall, mani-pedi...

267
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,483
You know what, you must be
exhausted from your flight.

268
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,318
Why don't I get a car
to take you back to my place?

269
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,029
A car? No, baby, I... (CHUCKLES)
I came here to see you.

270
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,823
I know! And you will.
It's just that, right now,

271
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,699
Curtis and I are trying
to figure out how to build

272
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,576
a very important piece of equipment,
or someone could die.

273
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,703
-Die? (GASPS)
-Metaphorically speaking!

274
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,874
You start constructing the machine,
and I will get you the manifold.

275
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,375
But it's proprietary.
How are you going to do that?

276
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,542
I'm not!

277
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,710
Awesome.

278
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,545
The Green Arrow's going to
be kicking some ass tonight.

279
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,506
-(CHUCKLES)
-If I don't kick his first.

280
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,844
-I thought it would be a good thing.
-FELICITY: <i>A good thing?</i>

281
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,720
What on Earth made you agree to this?

282
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,973
Well, you know, your mom doesn't really
take no for an answer.

283
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,642
You've faced down Mirakuru soldiers
and the League of Assassins.

284
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,270
Are you honestly telling me that
you couldn't say no to my mom?

285
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,813
She said she missed you,
and then she texted me

286
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,315
one of those emojis with the single tear.

287
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,109
You have been texting with my mother?

288
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>How long has that been going on?</i>

289
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,780
DIGGLE: You guys think we can find
a better time to fight about this?

290
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,698
John? I thought only
Oliver's line was open.

291
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,284
Nope. Mine is open.

292
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,535
-And mine.
-And mine.

293
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,997
I don't remember there being
so much chatter on these missions.

294
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,917
Are you okay?

295
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,543
Yeah.

296
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,336
I need a little normal.

297
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,673
And for me, this is
the kind of thing that passes.

298
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,966
FELICITY: <i>I hacked the security panel,</i>

299
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,717
but it needs
to be accessed from the inside.

300
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,594
Only problem is,
is that the building's interior

301
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,971
is protected
by pressure sensitive flooring,

302
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,098
which means Chatty Cathy, you're up.

303
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,142
-Chatty Cathy?
-Your new code name.

304
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,894
The only one appropriate
enough I could think of

305
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,353
to use in polite company.

306
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,729
<i>Once the loading dock's doors are open,</i>

307
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,273
<i>you'll have 90 seconds
to find the manifold</i>

What happened out there?

341
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,737
Sara, she, um,

342
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
had a moment with the security guard.

Laurel and Thea took her home.

344
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,785
Are you sure it was Darhk
that you saw on Ray's camera?

345
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,121
Just as sure as I am
that Ray is not getting out of this!

346
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,581
It's actually good that Darhk has Ray.

347
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:16,832
This would be the same level of delusion

348
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,585
that made you think my mother coming
to town would make me feel better?

349
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,128
Because it's Darhk,

350
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,671
that means that we have an asset.

351
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,590
-Lance.
-I'll ask him to get us a location.

And what if between then and now,

353
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,385
Darhk decides to squish Ray
underneath his shoe?

354
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,262
If Darhk wanted to hurt Ray,
he would have done it by now.

355
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,513
Dig's right. We stay focused.

356
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,433
We get Curtis the manifold,
keep him working,

357
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,603
and we unfortunately just have to
wait and see what Lance finds out.

358
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,771
I hate waiting and seeing.

359

I have to do something.

360

Your mother's in town,
spend some time with her.

361

We could do dinner. I'll cook.

362
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
You already made dinner plans
with my mother, didn't you?

363
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,907

We were having a nice conversation,

the subject turned to cooking,

368
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,919
I mentioned that I make
a spectacular chicken cordon bleu.

369
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,380
She said she'd never had one.

370
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,881
It's just dinner.

371
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,634
He's right, Felicity.
Besides, you look like you haven't

372
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,469
eaten or slept.

373
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,891
A man's life, a friend's life
is in danger.

374
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,478
Doesn't seem like
the right time for cordon bleu.

375
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,314
I promise you that
there is nothing that we can do

376
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,484
until we get what we need
from Lance and Curtis.

377
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,153
So, dinner.

378
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,821
7:00 p.m. I'll be there
as soon as I'm done with Lance.

381
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,678
I wasn't sure you were coming back.

382
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,680
Well...

383
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,348
I said that I would.

384
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,146
I guess it's no surprise to you,

385
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,691
but I have lost faith in people doing
what they said they're going to do.

386
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:11,113
Do you notice Reiter interested
in anything other than the camp or drugs?

387
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,489
Yeah.

388
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,451
He also enjoys
stealing people away from their families.

389
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,453
Have you seen him do anything, uh,

390
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,621
mystical, or even...

391
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,374
Magical?

392
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,502
He always has been a little odd.

393
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,712
And very religious.

394
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,840
He's even blessed some of the prisoners.

395
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,551
Claims he's healed their souls
or some craziness.

00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,387
(SIGHS) I'm beginning to think
that drugs are just a front

397
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,847
for what he's really doing here.

398
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,516
What could be more tempting
to a man like him than money?

400
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,105
I can't stay long.

401
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,732
I can't have Conklin
being any more suspicious of me

402
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,067
than he already is,

403
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,860
but you still need to stay here.

404
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,612
I'll come back as much as I can.

405

00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,274
For helping save Ray,
and for being so understanding

788
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,109
in the midst of my mini...

789
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,778
Gargantuan freak-out.

790
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,031
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm not the best listener.

791
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,243
But all of this is just... (EXHALES)

792
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,787
It's kind of new to me.

793
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,955
And to me.

794
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,998
I didn't exactly grow up

795
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,461
with the best example
of a normal, healthy relationship.

796
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,921
-Line forms behind me.
-(CHUCKLES)

797
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,132
It's kind of amazing
that we've made it this far.

798
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,259
We're going to be fine.

799
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,346
How can you be so sure?

800
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,308
Because we found ourselves in each other.

801
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,205
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

802
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,584
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

803
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,837
-DONNA: Feeling lonely?
-(SCOFFS)

804
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,172
You don't even know the half of it.

805
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,174
DONNA: I might.

806
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,639
I, um...

807
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:16,020
I came to town to visit my daughter,
but she kicked me out of her apartment

808
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,148
to finish a fight with the man I hope

809
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:20,900
will become my future son-in-law.

810
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,694
(CHUCKLES)

811
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,364
Okay, it's your turn.

812
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:31,201
Well, one of my daughters is leaving town
after being back a whole five minutes.

813
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,454
Sounds like a reason to drink.

814
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,581
I always got a reason.

815
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,082
But this is club soda.

816
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,710
Quentin.

817
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,550
Donna.

818
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,677

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

820
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,772
Hey, Thea, when your brother comes in,

821
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,148
could you have him sign these
for me, please?

822
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,357
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

823
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,859
You okay?

824
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,360
Just a little stressed out.

825
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,406
Maybe, um...

826
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,865
Maybe I need to get a drink.

827
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,410
It's a little early for a cocktail, but...

828
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,579
Not now. Later?

829
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,499
With you, at Gerard's?

830
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,667
-But I thought you...
-(SIGHS)

831
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,544
-I just want to have a normal life.
-(CHUCKLES)

832
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,171
Meet me there at 8:00?

833
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,090
Yeah, absolutely. Uh...

834
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,803
-I'll leave these here.
-(SIGHS)

835

Dr. Palmer's molecular realignment

838
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,023
was premised on a power draw
from our system, which resulted...

839
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,776
Just because I understand science
doesn't mean I'm not bored by it.

840
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,445
Bottom-line it for me.

841
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,364
We were able to recover some residue
from Dr. Palmer's dwarf star alloy,

842
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,658
and use it to fashion into a power source.

843
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,826
Good.

844
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,247
Test it out.

845
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,290
On this.
