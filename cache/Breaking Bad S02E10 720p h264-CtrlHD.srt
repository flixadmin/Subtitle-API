1
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:30,243
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:34,080
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,333
-What?
-Just take the rest of the week.

4
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,253
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,171
Don't push it.

6
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,508
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

7
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,263
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:54,142
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,686
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,772
Just family and a few friends.

11
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,234
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,780
Sounds good.

13
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,169
Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,004
Now...

15
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,090
...what are you supposed
to do today?

16
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,635
-Nothing.
-Excellent.

17
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,100
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:11,737
Can you meet?

19
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:19,036
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

20
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,705
...kicked.

21
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,249
Signed-- Signed off.

22
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,043
I was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,254
No such luck.

24
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:32,300
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,762
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,849
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,767
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,103
The upshot.

29
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:51,444
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:55,615
Damn.

31
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,203
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

32
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:05,791
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:08,628
In fact...

34
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,798
...the news is all good.

35
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,550
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,179
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:21,474
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

38
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:28,231
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,651
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

40
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,403
How significant?

41
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,781
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,158
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,453
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

44
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:47,667
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,837
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,756
That's-- That's great, man.

47
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:57,510
I mean, my aunt, she never--
I mean, you know, at your stage...

48
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,929
...I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,597
Yeah.

50
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,308
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,311
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,356
Of course. I am.

53
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:13,943
Okay, now we....

54
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,364
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,534
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,876
So how do you want to...

57
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:33,129
...you know, proceed...

58
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:36,007
...in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:43,389
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

60
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,600
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,435
And then....

62
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:54,233
Well, then I guess...

63
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,069
...I'm done.

64
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,259
-Batter up.
-Everyone?

65
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,721
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

66
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:28,893
-...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
-Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,939
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

68
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:38,361
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,863
But then again...

70
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:45,618
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

71
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,998
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,627
These last few months have been...

73
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:59,966
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,635
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:05,972
-All right.
-Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,849
We all are.

77
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:14,480
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,649
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:20,319
And for the first time
in a long time...

80
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,489
...we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,119
Okay, anyway...

82
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,997
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

83
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:36,169
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:39,338
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,299
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

86
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:44,510
...for those of you
who don't know them, are....

87
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:48,473
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:52,602
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

89
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,605
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,358
And they did.

91
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,152
So...

92
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:03,362
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:07,283
-To Gretchen and Elliot.
-Cheers.

94
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:10,369
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:11,954
-Speech.
-Yes.

96
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:13,664
-Speech.
-Yeah, Dad.

97
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:16,250
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,213
Well, it's....

99
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:21,964
It's kind of funny.

100
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:27,637
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

101
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:32,016
...I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,476
"Why me?"

103
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,230
And then...

104
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,734
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,281
...I said the same thing.

106
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,084
Anyway.

107
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,295
Thank you for coming.

108
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:05,091
And enjoy.

109
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:08,928
-All right, cheers.
-Yeah.

110
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:10,471
Cheers.

111
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,890
Inspirational.

112
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:16,352
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,603
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:21,399
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

115
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:25,736
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:28,739
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:31,617
Oh, that's the best part. It was a....

118
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:34,245
It was a.... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:38,124
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a....

120
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,835
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

121
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,172
Anyway...

122
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,134
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,636
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:55,558
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,144
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

126
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,021
Anyway.

127
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:02,064
Poetic.

128
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:06,277
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,404
I guess that's the word.

130
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:29,467
Go ahead.

131
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:36,015
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:55,368
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:59,705
-There's no worm in this, right?
-No, that would be mescal.

134
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,208
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,503
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,090
Had this firearm instructor
who was....

137
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,968
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:15,555
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:18,391
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,560
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,895
But-- Hey, hey.

142
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,067
Walt, what you doing there?

143
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:29,986
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,239
The kid's 16.

145
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,867
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,662
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,713
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,510
That's all right.

149
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,606
No.

150
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,447
Jesus.

151
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:24,165
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:27,543
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,129
Hey.

154
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:35,885
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:40,932
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,977
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,859
-It's all right.
-What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,277
Bring it back.

159
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:02,995
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:05,832
All right, pal?

161
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,546
-We good?
-The bottle.

162
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:14,674
Now.

163
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:23,975
What's going on?

164
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:30,815
Jesus.

165
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,280
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,157
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,369
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:49,917
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,420
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:04,849
This is your brain.

171
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,564
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,453
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:27,872
Ever or...?

174
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,711
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,422
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,217
No, I guess that'd be kind of--

177
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:42,762
No.

178
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:46,891
Need some help?

179
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,018
No, I got it.

180
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,314
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:55,358
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,778
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,947
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:04,325
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,920
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,132
It's huevos rancheros.

187
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:22,260
-I can tell.
-Yeah?

188
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,306
-Fork.
-Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,526
There you go.

190
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:43,281
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:46,993
-Whatever that means.
-No.

192
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:51,664
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,082
Really?

194
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:38,628
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

195
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,173
Hi.

196
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:46,636
I just wanted to say that....

197
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,054
No.

198
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:52,099
We'll talk tonight...

199
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:56,103
...but I wanted to say that...

200
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:01,108
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

201
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,236
...but it wasn't me.

202
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,615
And I'm sorry.

203
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,619
Love you.

204
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,610
Oh, boy.

205
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,549
<i>I just wanted to say that....</i>

206
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:07,967
<i>No.</i>

207
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:12,889
<i>We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that....</i>

208
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:14,474
Hey there.

209
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:18,603
-Wow, who brought the churros?
-That would be me.

210
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:22,273
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so....

211
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:28,488
They're actually-- They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,615
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,701
Actually...

214
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,536
...Walt's got....

215
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:41,667
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:45,379
-Skyler--
-And last week we got good news.

217
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:49,717
-I'm so sorry.
-But we're really optimistic.

218
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:51,260
Great.

219
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,096
-Great. Good news is great.
-Yeah.

220
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:56,766
Yeah, it is. It really is.

221
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:02,438
Well...

222
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:05,525
...feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,276
Yeah.

224
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:20,706
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,505
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:29,257
Yeah?

227
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,386
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,722
Sure. We got them.

229
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,559
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:42,854
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:46,274
It's not an issue.

232
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:50,361
You want installation, right?

233
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,199
-No. I'm gonna do it myself.
-That's what I like to hear.

234
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,964
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,217
That's Hover Man.

236
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:16,304
He can surf, skate, glide...

237
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:21,058
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,769
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,568
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:33,779
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,574
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,078
-And who's this in his pouch?
-His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:44,874
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

244
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,667
...fights crime.

245
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:49,837
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:52,465
You know that, right?

247
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,259
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

248
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:56,928
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:59,597
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:02,099
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:23:02,892 --> 00:23:05,269
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:11,859
-And this is?
-It's Backwardo.

253
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:15,780
Wait, no. I actually--
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,074
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:23:18,282 --> 00:23:19,951
He can make everything
go in reverse.

256
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,203
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

257
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,956
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,959
He walks backwards?

259
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:31,337
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,923
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:37,051
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,555
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:42,431
Okay.

264
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,143
Yo, I was a kid...

265
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,894
...when I drew all these.

266
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,647
It was like four years ago.

267
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:53,609
-They all look like you.
-What?

268
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,654
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,990
No.

270
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:02,201
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,579
Oh, shut up.

272
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,831
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

273
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:18,593
-Is that your door or mine?
-I don't know.

274
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:21,804
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,023
-I gotta go.
-Where?

276
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,194
Hey, where?

277
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:41,365
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,335
Jane.

279
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:05,765
Jane.

280
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:21,531
-Hey, Dad.
-There you are.

281
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:23,991
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,161
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:30,498
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:32,917
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:36,671
-Exactly.
-Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

286
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:39,632
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:41,092
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:46,013
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,975
-Yes.
-Hello.

290
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:50,434
Hi.

291
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,353
This is the new tenant.

292
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:55,189
-Donald.
-Jesse.

293
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:00,862
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,617
-No.
-Dad, why don't you come in?

295
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,411
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:11,581
-It was nice to meet you.
-You too.

297
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:43,654
Hey, Dad.

298
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:48,826
-Hey, son. Are you home early?
-No.

299
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:51,662
Oh, man.

300
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:55,291
It was a good day?

301
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:59,504
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,714
Yes. Yes, indeed.

303
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:05,426
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,011
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

305
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,307
-Hey, want to take her for a spin?
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:14,185
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:17,605
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,398
Okay.

309
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,361
Pilot in.

310
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:26,239
Ignition. Bingo.

311
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,032
Okay.

312
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:31,619
-Ready.
-All right. Let her rip.

313
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:41,712
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

314
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:43,923
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

315
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:46,551
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draught reducer...

316
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:49,220
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

317
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:51,514
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:53,891
And the energy savings. I mean....

319
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,227
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:59,230
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:02,066
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay.

322
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,779
Son...

323
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:11,409
-...about yesterday--
-I'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,914
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:19,834
See, your....

326
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:22,628
Your old man embarrassed himself...

327
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:25,089
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

328
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:29,093
I have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:35,808
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:39,353
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:43,441
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,947
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:53,826
I should have used
better judgement all around.

334
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:58,039
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

335
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:00,416
...and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,877
But I kept up, right?

337
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:08,966
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:18,559
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:22,123
Hey.

340
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,501
Yo.

341
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,879
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:32,758
Yo.

343
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:37,346
-What?
-What was that all about?

344
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:39,640
What?

345
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:42,268
Before. With your dad.

346
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,021
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:50,276
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:52,737
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

349
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:54,530
A favour?

350
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:57,450
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,369
-He seemed cool to me.
-Yeah, well.

352
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:03,915
-So, what's the deal?
-There's no deal.

353
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:07,460
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:10,213
-How's that?
-I mean...

355
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:14,509
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

356
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:16,761
I bought a filter.

357
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:19,347
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,600
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

359
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:24,268
So?

360
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:27,939
-So?
-You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:30,191
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,860
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

363
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:35,613
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:38,449
-Why do you even care about my dad?
-I don't.

365
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:40,952
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,789
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:47,416
-Us.
-Yeah.

368
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:49,627
You and me.

369
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:53,631
Who's you and me?

370
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:03,141
I'm out of here.

371
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,494
Oh, boy.

372
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:58,214
Dad?

373
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:06,013
Dad? Hello?

374
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:08,432
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:12,562
-What are you doing?
-We've got rot.

376
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,398
-Rot?
-Yeah. Here.

377
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:18,025
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:34:18,234 --> 00:34:19,277
Take a look at that.

379
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:24,740
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

380
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,703
-It's wood.
-It's wood...

381
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,621
...that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:32,540
Fruity what?

383
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,002
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,254
I don't really see anything.

385
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:41,924
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,760
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:47,388
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:51,184
Well, better get to it.

389
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,479
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:34:55,188 --> 00:34:57,148
Not if I can help it.

391
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:27,178
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,265
-Go home already.
-I will. I will.

393
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:36,020
Hey, can I just ask...

394
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:39,732
-...the Keller account?
-The Keller account?

395
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:43,611
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

396
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,865
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so....

397
00:35:48,074 --> 00:35:49,116
Oh, God.

398
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,537
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:56,040
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

400
00:35:56,249 --> 00:35:58,251
...with these little companies.

401
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:02,046
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:04,549
Right.

403
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:08,261
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:10,429
Sky?

405
00:36:12,598 --> 00:36:13,683
Skyler?

406
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,561
Jesus.

407
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:21,023
No, I'm fine.

408
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:26,320
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

409
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,365
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,915
What's wrong?

411
00:36:41,544 --> 00:36:43,379
I guess it just...

412
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:49,594
...doesn't feel any different.

413
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,101
The good news?

414
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:02,440
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:06,277
It's just postponed.

416
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:11,282
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:17,955
But lately, it just feels like....

418
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,542
More tunnel.

419
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,795
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:32,553
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:35,348
I don't know.

422
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:37,934
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:41,813
-What?
-My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:44,398
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

425
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,151
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

426
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,986
...we were over the moon.

427
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:52,448
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:55,660
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:58,746
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

430
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:01,833
-Great timing, huh?
-Yeah.

431
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:06,879
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,673
"Why now?"

433
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,719
Being that rock.

434
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,347
You know...

435
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:21,269
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

436
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,110
Yeah.

437
00:39:25,374 --> 00:39:27,376
<i>--causing the housing prices
to trend.</i>

438
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:31,088
<i>Foreclosures are being fuelled
by a spike in....</i>

439
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:38,304
<i>The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.</i>

440
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:42,266
<i>With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...</i>

441
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:44,936
<i>...the housing market
is unlikely to rebound...</i>

442
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:47,814
<i>...spelling more pain
for the economy.</i>

443
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,616
Yeah.

444
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:19,387
Are you going to work today?

445
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:23,933
Skyler, there's rot.

446
00:40:32,984 --> 00:40:34,485
I'm going back.

447
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:10,790
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

448
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:19,257
-Good night, Ted.
-Good night.

449
00:42:21,676 --> 00:42:23,678
Oh, damn.

450
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:27,640
-Clumsy.
-I got it.

451
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:30,101
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

452
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,717
<i>Get organised. Storage containers
to meet every need...</i>

453
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:05,511
<i>...big or small, on Aisle 3.</i>

454
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,390
<i>Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.</i>

455
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,614
<i>Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.</i>

456
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,992
<i>Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?</i>

457
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:30,828
<i>Go to Aisle 10 to go green.</i>

458
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:38,169
<i>Get a manager
on Check out 4, please.</i>

459
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,505
<i>Manager to Check out 4.</i>

460
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:52,099
<i>Pest problems? No problem.</i>

461
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:56,103
<i>Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.</i>

462
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:58,523
You're buying the wrong matches.

463
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,192
-What?
-Those matches.

464
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,652
They're the wrong kind.

465
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:06,030
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips...

466
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,116
...not the matches themselves.

467
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:12,036
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

468
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:18,209
More striker strips. You understand?

469
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,170
Those only have the one.

470
00:44:21,379 --> 00:44:23,881
And don't buy everything
in one place.

471
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,341
Do it piecemeal.

472
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,011
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

473
00:44:32,932 --> 00:44:34,475
Are you following me here?

474
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:42,733
<i>You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.</i>

475
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:45,486
<i>We have everything you need
to do the job right.</i>

476
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:52,160
-Thanks.
-Sure.

477
00:44:52,368 --> 00:44:54,412
-Next.
-Hi. Here you go.

478
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,777
-You didn't buy my stuff?
-No, I didn't.

479
00:45:26,986 --> 00:45:28,571
We don't have time for this.

480
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:38,289
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

481
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:59,435
Stay out of my territory.
