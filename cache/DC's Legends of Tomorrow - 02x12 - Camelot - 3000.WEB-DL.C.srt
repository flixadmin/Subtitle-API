1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,437
Time travel is real,

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,640
and all of history is vulnerable to attack,

3
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:06,342
which is why we must travel through time

4
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:09,151
to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations,

5
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:12,070
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,456
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,241
so please don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:17,659
We're something else.

9
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,960
We're legends.

10
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:22,581
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

11
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,549
We're The Justice Society of America.

12
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:25,834
Dr. Mid-Nite, Star Girl.

13
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,669
Copy that.

14
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,839
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

15
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:34,559
The Spear allegedly has the
power to rewrite reality.

16
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,178
I know that you're one of the protectors

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,930
of the Spear of Destiny,
and I know that you know

18
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:40,348
where the other pieces are hidden.

19
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,685
Oh... okay, okay.

20
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:45,270
The piece of the Spear's
inside your telescope.

21
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:47,155
Will you put the gun down, Jax?

22
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:49,858
He's with the Legion now.
Why are you protecting him?

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,827
I'm protecting you.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,715
Hello, Charles.

25
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,691
Oh, I see you found a way
to cure your blindness.

26
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:25,977
The future is full of
marvels, Captain Hunter.

27
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,315
Uh, no longer a captain, I'm afraid.

28
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:32,734
Wow.

29
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:34,569
What do we have here?

30
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:37,539
This is a bio-morphic implant,

31
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,992
capable of modifying its
host's neural processes.

32
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:44,663
One day, this could end
violence as we know it.

33
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:48,049
Or, by the same means, amplify it.

34
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:49,551
I thought none of us were supposed to

35
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,253
contact the other again.

36
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,721
A new threat, I'm afraid.

37
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:54,556
A cabal of sorts is after the Spear.

38
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,842
- I'm rounding up the fragments.
- Why?

39
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:59,177
They're safer apart than they are together.

40
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,146
They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.

41
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,764
Really?

42
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:05,650
You said the Time Masters
couldn't be trusted.

43
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:08,770
Did I? Bollocks, so I did.

44
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:10,605
I suppose we're gonna have to do this

45
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,657
the hard way, then.

46
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:17,195
Now, where is the fragment of the Spear

47
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:19,080
that I had you protect?

48
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:22,951
I don't know why you want
it, but you'll never find it.

49
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:24,536
Mm, well, seeing as you've been posing

50
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:26,454
as a researcher in cybernetic implants,

51
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:29,925
my guess is that you have
hidden the fragment...

52
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,461
Inside you.

53
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,806
- What's going on?
- Lily's algorithm located

54
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,358
a piece of the Spear of Destiny.

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,860
When? I mean, I know just
now, but where are we headed?

56
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,146
Detroit, the year 3000 AD.

57
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:52,898
Journey into the distant future.

58
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,949
How exciting.

59
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,400
Speak for yourself.

60
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,484
Come on, man, who doesn't like the future?

61
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:57,986
I like history. Yeah, I know,

62
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:59,871
it's filled with terror and violence,

63
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,623
- but the future just...
- It's uncertain.

64
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,208
Yeah, and it freaks me out a little.

65
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,826
Then just stay on the ship.

66
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:06,161
You think I should stay on the ship?

67
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:07,996
I don't care. It's up to you.

68
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,975
I am a time travel professional.

69
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:21,593
If you need me to visit the future,

70
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,261
I can visit the future.

71
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:25,513
And I'm just saying
it's entirely up to you.

72
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,599
And I'm just saying shut up.

73
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:28,817
Nate, you'll stay on the ship.

74
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,485
The rest of us will go find the Spear.

75
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,520
Unfortunately, the medallion
is no longer sensing

76
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:35,156
the presence of the Spear fragment.

77
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:36,858
So we came here for nothing?

78
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,743
Maybe not. Gideon,

79
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,863
do they have booze in the year 3000?

80
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,281
Better yet, Gideon,

81
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:45,417
do you have the last
position of the fragment?

82
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,671
Somebody find a light switch or something.

83
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:51,373
What the hell does a light switch look like

84
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,959
in the year 3000?

85
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:55,343
Huh...

86
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,878
Yeah, I guess there's not many places

87
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,213
you can go with a light switch.

88
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,548
But everything else is leaps and bounds

89
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,350
beyond our current science.

90
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:10,859
Amaya...

91
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:18,733
- Charles.
- How do you know the stiff?

92
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:21,036
This is Dr. Mid-Nite
of the Justice Society.

93
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:24,489
What's a member of the JSA
doing this far into the future?

94
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:25,874
Rest in peace.

95
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:27,242
That's sweet, Mick.

96
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:29,411
No, it's what he wrote on the floor...

97
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,246
R.I.P.

98
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,465
That's not "Rest In Peace."

99
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:36,835
It's the name of Dr. Mid-Nite's killer.

100
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:39,137
- I just don't get it.
- Please be more specific.

101
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,722
That could be a very long list.

102
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:43,091
Okay, even assuming

103
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:46,227
the Legion took the
Spear fragment from here,

104
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,429
how did they know it was here?

105
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,596
Without the medallion, you mean.

106
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:50,098
Rip must've told them.

107
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,517
Somehow, he remembers where
the pieces of the Spear are.

108
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,237
Well, then it's a good
thing you let him escape.

109
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,156
Do you wanna say something to me?

110
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:02,277
Jax told me about how he
was gonna kill Rip in 1776,

111
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,778
and about how you stopped him.

112
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,697
Because we're not killers, Amaya.

113
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,034
Except for yourself and Mr. Rory and...

114
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:10,785
I'll stop helping now.

115
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:12,420
I'm not condoning murder,

116
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:14,039
but the JSA would've captured Rip

117
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,457
without regard for sentiment.

118
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,541
You think I let Rip go,

119
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:18,126
- because of sentiment?
- Yes.

120
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,544
All right, let's just all take a breath.

121
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:22,931
I'm sorry that your friend got killed.

122
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,599
And it may be sentimental,

123
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,968
but my team comes before tactics.

124
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,305
And as a result, you've put
the whole of reality at risk.

125
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:33,308
Maybe this is why your team loses so often.

126
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,527
- Pardon the interruption...
- Excellent timing, Gideon.

127
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,312
Your daughter Lily's algorithm

128
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:39,647
has identified a location for
another piece of the Spear.

129
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,316
Well, when it rains, it pours.

130
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:42,617
Where is it, Gideon?

131
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,536
A small island known as Britannia

132
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:47,622
in the year 507 AD.

133
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,629
Medieval England.

134
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,414
See, this is what I'm talking about...

135
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,217
a nice, well-documented piece of history.

136
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:02,170
Knights in shining armor,
damsels in distress,

137
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:05,090
and best of all, jousts.

138
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:08,343
Heh, well, jousting didn't
appear in England till 1300 AD.

139
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:10,478
Don't take this away from me.

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,313
Raymond.

141
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,682
Just forget about history
for once, all right?

142
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:15,934
We're in the Age of Legend.

143
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:18,603
Well, remember as Santayana once said.

144
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,522
"Those who cannot remember history

145
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:22,607
are condemned to repeat it."

146
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,826
Was he a knight? I don't remember his name.

147
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:27,278
And I was pretty obsessed
with Arthurian lore as a kid.

148
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,747
Hmm, well, if you were,

149
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,698
you would know that there were not jousts.

150
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,284
Oh... well...

151
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,919
agree to disagree.

152
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,838
Fair.

153
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:46,798
Are you skipping Medieval
Times, as well, Professor?

154
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,018
Yes, I was just catching
up on some research.

155
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,886
Huh, what'd you do?

156
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,354
Excuse me?

157
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:54,889
Don't say excuse me.

158
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,108
It makes you sound guilty.

159
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,693
I haven't the foggiest
idea what you're talking...

160
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,897
- What are you doing?
- Thieves.

161
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,899
They have a certain smell.

162
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,901
I thought that was just
because you didn't bathe.

163
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,236
What'd you steal?

164
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:10,288
How dare you even suggest...

165
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,323
What did you steal?

166
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,245
Dr. Mid-Nite wouldn't be needing it,

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,747
so I figured I'd...

168
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,834
I couldn't resist.

169
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,919
Though I prefer the term "borrowed."

170
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:28,723
Impressive.

171
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,226
There's hope for you yet.

172
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,478
Look, all I'm saying is,

173
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,013
the stories you grew up on are just that.

174
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,431
They're stories, all right?

175
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,399
The Medieval world was a time of turmoil.

176
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:40,268
It was the collapse of Rome,

177
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,154
which led to the collapse
of civilization itself.

178
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:45,406
And don't even get me started
on the health and sanitation.

179
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,992
- Yeah, please don't.
- Cholera, diphtheria,

180
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:51,112
uh, typhoid fever, and I'm not
even touching skin diseases.

181
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:53,915
Speaking of which, why did you
choose to dress like a leper?

182
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,367
I didn't. This is historically accurate.

183
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:59,754
You all look like you're
going to a Renaissance Fair.

184
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:02,006
- What is it?
- We're being followed.

185
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,958
And by the way, even if I was a leper,

186
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,343
it'd be way less obvious than

187
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:07,262
a bunch of knights in shining armor.

188
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:15,687
Wait... I mean, ho...
I mean... I mean, hark!

189
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,388
Good knight, we intend you no harm.

190
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,641
We are but mere travelers in this land.

191
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:21,526
Your dialect is way off.

192
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:25,280
I, Raymond of the Palms,
and my band of merry men

193
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,616
and women, humbly request
safe passage to Camelot,

194
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,451
and an audience with King Arthur.

195
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,786
King Arthur?

196
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,454
Yes, you can his crest on their shields.

197
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,331
I am Guinevere.

198
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,466
We shall escort you to Camelot...

199
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:51,339
But your leper must remain
outside the castle walls.

200
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:52,507
I'm not a leper!

201
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,192
Still think this is just a story?

202
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,362
This place shouldn't exist.

203
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:16,281
There's no need of that here.

204
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,616
We're all equal in the court of Camelot.

205
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:21,202
That's why I love this guy.

206
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,503
Our paths crossed in the wood

207
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:24,789
while tracking the
Black Knight, Your Grace.

208
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,291
How then are we to know
that they're not in league

209
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:27,759
with that vile rogue?

210
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,677
- Ray?
- Your Grace,

211
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,462
I swear we are not your enemies.

212
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:35,133
We are warriors on a
quest, a race against evil.

213
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:37,885
A great evil haunts my
land these many days,

214
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,772
kidnapping my noble
Knights of the Round Table.

215
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:43,558
Therefore, it'll fall on my wisest adviser

216
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,727
to measure the truth of your words.

217
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,028
Oh, please don't say it.

218
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,062
Summon Merlin!

219
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,403
Get ready to fight our way out of here

220
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,038
if Merlin rules against us.

221
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,579
That's Star Girl.

222
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,417
What are you doing in Camelot?

223
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,604
This ship... it never ceases to amaze me.

224
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:23,490
Well, speaking of amazing... Merlin?

225
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,943
Just an identity I adopted
to fit into this era.

226
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:27,778
But are you even doing in this era?

227
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,115
Let me guess, it has something
to do with the Spear of Destiny.

228
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,951
We found Dr. Mid-Nite in year 3000.

229
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:36,170
He's dead, Courtney.

230
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,872
We think he was killed because he possessed

231
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,456
a piece of the Spear.

232
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,542
What do you know about
the JSA's final mission?

233
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,711
Obsidian told me that the JSA disappeared

234
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:46,046
after a trip to Leipzig in 1956.

235
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,182
The mission was to recover
the Spear of Destiny,

236
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,551
and keep it from falling into enemy hands.

237
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,774
And how was it that you were
all scattered throughout time?

238
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:57,975
We were joined on our mission by someone

239
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:00,945
who called himself a Time Master.

240
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,146
Rip Hunter.

241
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,364
Yes.

242
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:09,320
He said the Spear could
alter reality itself...

243
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:12,539
that it was too powerful for
any man or woman to possess,

244
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,576
so we broke it into four separate pieces.

245
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:16,961
Mr. Hunter took one...

246
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:17,962
And took the rest of you

247
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:19,546
to three different time periods.

248
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:22,383
When I arrived in Camelot,
it was a middling kingdom.

249
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,585
To help me protect my piece of the Spear,

250
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:27,554
I fashioned it into the
legendary court of King Arthur

251
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,506
and his Knights of the Round Table.

252
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:44,321
Courtney, I respect your devotion,

253
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:45,439
but shouldn't you at least tell me

254
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,690
where the fragment is hidden?

255
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,909
Don't worry, Amaya, I promise,

256
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:50,611
the piece is somewhere very safe.

257
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,531
Your tracking in the woods was excellent.

258
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,917
There's not many people that
can get the jump on me like that.

259
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,420
I was a warrior long before I was a queen.

260
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,872
Why does it sound like you preferred that?

261
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:05,709
Politics is not one of my passions.

262
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,212
But Arthur is a true friend and ally,

263
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:09,847
and I believe in his vision for a more just

264
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:11,715
and peaceful kingdom.

265
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:15,719
From what I see, Camelot
lives up to its reputation.

266
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:17,888
Where is the good king?

267
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,723
On the hunt...

268
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:22,393
no doubt chasing a boar
through the brush as we speak.

269
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:54,758
Do your worst, knave.

270
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,393
I'd rather die than surrender.

271
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:01,598
Then you are an idiot.

272
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,684
You're not going to run me through.

273
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,819
No.

274
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:09,440
We have something else in
mind for you, Your Majesty.

275
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,910
Huzzah!

276
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,947
Mmm.

277
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,701
Ah!

278
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,586
I can't believe Marty
and Mick are missing this.

279
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,421
Like, right? I mean, when's the next time

280
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:26,040
we're gonna get to feast in Camelot?

281
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,258
- Mm.
- Hey, guys, check it out.

282
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,627
- That's Sir Galahad.
- How do you know that?

283
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:32,513
Because he's sitting in the Siege Perilous.

284
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,548
- What?
- Come on.

285
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,799
Some kind of historian you are.

286
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,551
Siege Perilous is a special seat

287
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,303
reserved for only the purest of knights.

288
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:40,804
I don't how many times
I have to tell you...

289
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:43,524
there's a difference
between legend and history.

290
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:45,526
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

291
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Sir Galahad.

292
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,818
Oh, is this seat taken?

293
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,323
It is now, my friend.

294
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:01,375
Apologies, you must get this all the time,

295
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:04,078
but I must tell you, I am a really big fan.

296
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,381
A fan. So you make wind?

297
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,416
No, no, no, no, no, um...

298
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:10,717
Well...

299
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,469
I mean, maybe after all this food.

300
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,507
No, what I mean is I'm a...

301
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:19,927
I'm a big admirer of yours.

302
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,228
You've heard tale of my exploits?

303
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,813
Yes! Yes!

304
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,816
Since I was a wee lad.

305
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,651
It's hard to explain.

306
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,736
I am but a servant.

307
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,022
It is my honor to serve
the true inspiration

308
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,191
of Camelot's glory...

309
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:37,244
King Arthur, for was it not he

310
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:40,531
who said that might must serve right,

311
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,867
lest it bloom into the
cruel flower of tyranny?

312
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:45,786
Yet another reason I love him.

313
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:56,180
They sound the return of the king.

314
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:58,432
Arthur's captured the Black Knight.

315
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:03,470
Arthur, I was beginning to...

316
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,942
Oh, sorry about the ruse,

317
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,394
but I figure it was the
only way to get inside.

318
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:12,312
Oh! Hey, guys.

319
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:14,565
I see you've met my friend Arthur here.

320
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:17,901
Give us a smile, Arthur.

321
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:22,823
Arthur...

322
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:26,710
The king has left the building.

323
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:29,663
You don't get the reference? Ugh, pity.

324
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:35,335
Basically, your king now does
anything I want him to do,

325
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:38,055
so if you don't him to spill
your blood all over this floor,

326
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:42,392
I suggest that you hand over
your fragment of the Spear.

327
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:45,262
My patience is running short.

328
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:53,820
The fragment... where is it?

329
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:57,858
As long as I live, you will never have it.

330
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,246
That might turn out to
be shorter than you think.

331
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,965
Stand fast, or your king dies.

332
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:25,302
All I have to do is think it,
and he slits his own throat.

333
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:26,687
Ultimatum time.

334
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,273
Deliver the fragment to me by dawn,

335
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:33,694
or I'll come back with an army
just as obedient as Arthur here.

336
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,479
Choice is yours...

337
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:38,315
Camelot... or the Spear.

338
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,523
Galahad, may you rest in peace,

339
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,192
where sorrow and pain are banished.

340
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:18,112
May the everlasting light
of Camelot shine upon you.

341
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,281
How do you know this Black Knight?

342
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:23,751
His name's Damien Darhk.
He works with the speedster

343
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,137
who turned Rip Hunter against the JSA.

344
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:28,773
Well, Rip's not the only
one under their control now.

345
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,258
That thing's dark magic
has turned my king...

346
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,944
my own husband into my enemy.

347
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,880
- It's not his fault.
- And yet I watched him

348
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:38,182
strike down Sir Galahad with my own eyes.

349
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,551
You have to believe that
your husband can be saved,

350
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,436
or else he will be truly lost.

351
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,637
Unless we stop the Black Knight's army,

352
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:44,889
we may never find out.

353
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:46,640
My Queen, you must be strong.

354
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:48,526
With King Arthur missing,
the Knights of the Round Table

355
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:51,362
will look to you to lead them.

356
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:54,198
The mantle of king is Arthur's.

357
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,067
Not mine.

358
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,903
Guinevere, wait.

359
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:03,290
Look, sometimes the mantle...
it just falls into your lap.

360
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:07,244
Trust me. I know that it's hard.

361
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:09,380
You're clever,

362
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,165
you're brave,

363
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:14,418
and you are a natural born commander.

364
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,803
I know you can do this.

365
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:24,095
You saw what they did to Arthur.

366
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,480
Imagine what they could do with
an army of brainwashed knights.

367
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,100
- What are you suggesting?
- The fragment of the Spear...

368
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:30,684
we need to get it out of the castle.

369
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,069
How can your team protect the Spear?

370
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:35,573
You couldn't even protect Dr. Mid-Nite.

371
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:37,241
- That's not fair.
- I'm not going anywhere,

372
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:40,111
and neither is the fragment.

373
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:42,163
Fascinating. It seems to contain

374
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:45,449
some sort of sophisticated receiver.

375
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:48,419
Clearly it's the same technology I...

376
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,173
I-I found in Dr.
Mid-Nite's lab.

377
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,959
- Grey, you didn't.
- You bet he did.

378
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,595
Nicked it off the dead
guy. Even I was impressed.

379
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:00,514
I was simply curious.

380
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,016
And it's a good thing I did.

381
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:04,268
These components appear to be a set,

382
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,022
perhaps functioning together
as transmitter and receiver.

383
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:10,274
- Or commander and soldier.
- Exactly.

384
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,026
The commander wears the transmitter,

385
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,779
sending orders via an
electro-telepathic signal

386
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,781
to this receiver, worn by the soldier.

387
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:18,566
Well, anything with a
signal can get hacked.

388
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:19,950
That is the hope, yes.

389
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,986
So all we need to is somehow

390
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,988
boost the brain power of
whoever's wearing this.

391
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,539
Or find someone

392
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:30,077
with a preternaturally powerful brain.

393
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,829
You mean you?

394
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,380
Fine, if you insist.

395
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:38,335
Now, all we need is a test subject.

396
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:41,839
Someone who's mind is, uh, pliable.

397
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,392
What?

398
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:51,515
Hey, Sir
Drools-A-Lot,

399
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:55,019
prepare the rest of your tin
men to get ready to march.

400
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:02,076
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

401
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,197
Prepare your men, King Arthur.

402
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,701
As you wish, my liege.

403
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:13,120
Prepare to march.

404
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,206
Who knew these things would come in handy?

405
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:26,851
Now, Mr. Rory, I want you
to get up out of that chair.

406
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:32,723
No, I command you to
get up out of that chair.

407
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:37,561
Do... do you feel anything
at all, a foreign impulse,

408
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,363
just like twinge perhaps?

409
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:42,900
Wait, I'm picking up on something.

410
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:45,903
Oh, my God, it's working.

411
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,321
I'm hungry.

412
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:49,406
This is a disaster.

413
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:53,911
Wait.

414
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,051
It seems our adversaries are
sending a signal of their own.

415
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,588
- What does that mean?
- Oh, dear God.

416
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,259
It means the Legion is coming for Camelot.

417
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:16,600
Valiant Knights of Camelot,

418
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:19,520
I know the fear you feel.

419
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:23,574
We stand now on the precipice of doom.

420
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:26,110
Our king has been taken from us.

421
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:27,912
Evil draws close,

422
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:32,249
and hope, it seems, is lost.

423
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,669
But we must rise and face this challenge,

424
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,788
as Arthur would have wanted.

425
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,090
We must remember who we are.

426
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,426
We're brothers and sisters.

427
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,428
We're fighters and friends.

428
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,880
We are not mere knights.

429
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:49,216
We are Camelot!

430
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:51,302
We are Camelot!

431
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:55,889
We are Camelot! We are Camelot!

432
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:59,059
The dark army approaches.
It's reached the great wood.

433
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,395
It seems your wizard is too late.

434
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:03,063
Is she talking about Professor Stein?

435
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,565
No matter.

436
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:07,568
We shall settle this at
the point of our swords.

437
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,788
Camelot calls to you in its hour of need.

438
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,573
Will you answer?

439
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:17,044
Who will follow me onto
the field of battle?

440
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,166
Dude, what are they doing?

441
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,468
These guys don't stand a chance out there.

442
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,255
Is this really worth
the risk for some dream?

443
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:30,307
Yes, because a long time ago

444
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,977
that dream meant the world to a little boy,

445
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,928
and he still remembers.

446
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:49,276
This isn't gonna end well.

447
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,870
What are you doing?

448
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:02,623
If Star Girl won't give us the
fragment for safe-keeping...

449
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,625
You're stealing it?

450
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:06,960
She's not thinking straight.

451
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:18,022
I should have known.

452
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:22,192
You sure this is the way you wanna do it?

453
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,646
Star Girl was your teammate,
not to mention your friend.

454
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:28,232
The Legion of Doom are
closing in on us as we speak.

455
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:30,117
There's no time for sentiment.

456
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,785
Do you really wanna chance Damien Darhk

457
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:35,072
having the power to rewrite reality?

458
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:37,041
I guess not.

459
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:43,580
It's set in stone.

460
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:44,915
Not for long.

461
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,102
Damn, that was badass.

462
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,081
Let's get out of here.

463
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,199
Put it down.

464
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,139
We should attack now.

465
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,813
Let me tell you how an ultimatum works.

466
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,683
The so-called Legends have until dawn

467
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,518
to deliver the Spear.

468
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,852
You don't actually believe

469
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:45,571
that they'll hand it over, do you?

470
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:47,740
Perhaps not, but meeting on a battle field

471
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:50,943
is infinitely more wise than
laying siege to the castle.

472
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:52,861
Right.

473
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:55,698
I-I just thought that you
would want my expertise.

474
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,284
After all, I have already retrieved

475
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:00,869
two fragments of the Spear, but...

476
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,871
Word to the wise,

477
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:05,457
speak to me with respect.

478
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:08,460
That little thing on your
head doesn't control me.

479
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:11,513
I don't want to fight with you, Amaya,

480
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:13,382
- but I will if I have to.
- Then get ready,

481
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:15,050
because I'm not leaving
without the fragment.

482
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:16,602
Hey, we have enough enemies as it is

483
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:18,938
- without fighting each other.
- You left us, Amaya.

484
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,222
I was there to protect the Spear,

485
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:21,473
and I will continue to protect it

486
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:22,858
until I take my last breath.

487
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,226
Because you know that doing the right thing

488
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:26,695
is more important than
doing what feels right.

489
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:28,314
You're still a member
of the Justice Society.

490
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:31,317
No, I'm not. My heart belongs in Camelot.

491
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,618
Your heart?

492
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,286
You of all people should understand.

493
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:36,905
It wasn't duty that led
you to join the Legends.

494
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:41,293
You've fallen in love with Arthur.

495
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:44,964
Your make-believe kingdom
is a real soap opera.

496
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:47,833
How can you expect me to turn away

497
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:51,920
from the truest thing I've ever known?

498
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:54,923
All I know is that the Legion of Doom

499
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:57,843
will not stop until they get this,

500
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,261
and once they do,

501
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:03,649
the world, as we know it, is over.

502
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,487
Which is why you're taking it, Amaya.

503
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:12,992
I can't go, so you have to fulfill my oath.

504
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:14,576
Protect the Spear.

505
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,747
All right, you heard the wizard.

506
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:19,665
Let's boogie.

507
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:35,130
Ray, this is wrong.

508
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:38,350
Please tell me that's not Galahad's sword.

509
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:40,302
I know, it's not historically accurate,

510
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:41,437
but...

511
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,140
I couldn't resist.

512
00:26:47,945 --> 00:26:51,480
It's like a saber made of light.

513
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:52,948
Yeah.

514
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,650
Uh, just don't call it a light saber.

515
00:26:54,652 --> 00:26:56,985
- Major trademark issues, right?
- Yeah, trademark.

516
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:59,071
Have you lost your complete mind?

517
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,874
No, I focused the ionic
energy into Galahad's sword.

518
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:04,827
That's great, Ray, but Sara
says it's time to go, so...

519
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,912
What? But the battle hasn't even begun.

520
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,664
Precisely why we're leaving now.

521
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,716
Listen, Amaya found the fragment,

522
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:13,135
so there's need for this medieval warfare.

523
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:14,837
That's great news, right?

524
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,922
Let's go.

525
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:20,142
In case you weren't listening,
this is the part where we run.

526
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,012
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.

527
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:25,681
Left foot, right foot, repeat, let's go.

528
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:29,818
No, Nate, look around you.

529
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,488
All of these men are willing
to die on the battlefield...

530
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,991
not for some Spear, but for an idea.

531
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:38,744
And I get it now. Camelot
isn't about history.

532
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,529
It's not even about some dusty old books

533
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:43,499
that got a lonely kid through childhood.

534
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:47,753
It's about one noble idea...

535
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:50,339
that we can all stand up for what's right,

536
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:52,875
no matter what.

537
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,210
And I can't walk away from that.

538
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:57,346
I believe you, Ray.

539
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:01,216
I do. And Camelot's great.

540
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:02,634
But if you don't leave right now,

541
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:03,969
- you're gonna die here.
- Would it kill you

542
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:05,637
to be just a little bit more supportive?

543
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:07,389
You don't get it, man.
I checked the manuscript.

544
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:08,891
I saw your funeral.

545
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:15,731
Well, sounds to me like the
stuff Legends are made of.

546
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:19,151
All right, Gideon, let's
get ready for take off.

547
00:28:19,153 --> 00:28:21,370
- Yes, Captain.
- This doesn't feel right.

548
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:23,789
We don't just leave people in trouble.

549
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,991
They're knights, and they're
fighting so we can get away.

550
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,076
- With the piece of the Spear.
- And without Rip.

551
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:30,462
Take comfort we live to fight another day.

552
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:32,247
The Legion already has
two pieces of the Spear.

553
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,216
I don't like it, but we cannot risk them

554
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:35,751
getting a Yahtzee.

555
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:37,219
What the hell's a Yahtzee?

556
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,054
System's online, Captain Lance.

557
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:40,589
We are ready to time-jump.

558
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:45,677
Where's Raymond?

559
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,597
With this sword, I dub thee

560
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:54,019
Sir Raymond of the Palms,
defender of Camelot.

561
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:56,405
Rise, good knight.

562
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:02,277
I tried talking to him, but he's hell-bent

563
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,862
- on getting himself killed.
- Doesn't he know

564
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,447
that we have the piece of the Spear?

565
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:07,366
All he seems to care
about is being remembered

566
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:09,952
- in some BS bedtime story.
- We can't leave him behind.

567
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:11,870
We're not leaving him. He chose to say.

568
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:14,289
Amaya, I know you're following
JSA protocol at whatever cost,

569
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,291
but this is seriously screwed up.

570
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:18,093
We can't risk losing a piece of the Spear,

571
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:19,878
especially when the
Legion is being backed by

572
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,213
evil Knights of the Round Table.

573
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:22,631
I thought you were
gonna un-evil-fy them.

574
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,466
We were if we just had a little more time.

575
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:26,935
- We still can.
- And what happens if you can't?

576
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:30,138
Well, as much as
Haircut's a pain in my ass,

577
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,891
I'm not gonna let him fight alone.

578
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,776
Sit down. That's an order.

579
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:41,200
- What's an order?
- Don't test me, Mick.

580
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:42,818
Don't threaten me, blondie.

581
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,373
I can't believe I'm actually
agreeing with Mr. Rory.

582
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,825
- Sara.
- I said sit down.

583
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:51,710
Stop.

584
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:54,663
I've already lost one team.

585
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll be damned if my decision
rips the Legends apart too.

586
00:29:58,002 --> 00:30:01,136
- What are you saying?
- Listen to your gut, Captain.

587
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:03,055
Don't abandon Ray.

588
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:04,806
He may be sentimental, but the team

589
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,175
should come before tactics.

590
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,649
All right, let's do this.

591
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:15,400
Guinevere's knights are
not gonna able to last long

592
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:17,653
against Damien Darhk's
army unless you three...

593
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,321
Take out Mid-Nite's
mind-control tech.

594
00:30:19,323 --> 00:30:20,939
- We're on it.
- We are?

595
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:23,191
Amaya, Nate...

596
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:25,399
you ready to go get medieval out there?

597
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:35,324
Wait, you... you've got it reversed.

598
00:30:35,326 --> 00:30:37,543
I need the transmitting
device, not the receiver.

599
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,178
I got an idea.

600
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,130
What if it's not about brain power,

601
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,599
but about intensity? Like his.

602
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:44,800
We don't have time for this.

603
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,469
Put the dog collar on, Professor.

604
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:53,225
I have more patents than
Mr. Rory has felonies,

605
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,643
and that's saying something.

606
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,812
To think that his mind is
more powerful than mine...

607
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,063
Shut up.

608
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,369
Wait, did you shut up
because you wanted to,

609
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,704
or because he told you to?

610
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:08,407
- Hm.
- Make him answer.

611
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,209
Answer the man, Professor.

612
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,332
Astonishing.

613
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,666
It worked.

614
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,051
I knew it. Okay.

615
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:20,836
Now all we gotta do is amplify the signal.

616
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,004
What do you want me to do?

617
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,006
Just rest your brain, Mr. Rory.

618
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,474
We'll let you know when
it's time to take control

619
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:26,842
of the evil army.

620
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,812
Ah, finally I get to fulfill my destiny.

621
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:31,063
God help us.

622
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:50,175
So, came to fight for an
imaginary kingdom after all?

623
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,393
I came to fight for a friend.

624
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,481
A really dumb friend.

625
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,965
Okay, I need you to unleash the darkness

626
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,633
on those brainwashed knights.

627
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,052
Let 'em inside your head.

628
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,471
Fill their minds with
every brutish impulse...

629
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,022
every traumatic memory.

630
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,892
That just might be enough
to overload the system.

631
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,144
Spare nothing.

632
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,700
Poor babies.

633
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:13,842
Be gone, devilish sorcerer!

634
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,943
Damien...

635
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,532
Sorry, I don't do rescues.

636
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,699
Yah.

637
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,004
Damn it, Ray!

638
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:10,115
You're here to finish me off, Captain?

639
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,404
What are you doing?

640
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:20,709
Saving your life.

641
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:45,901
Give it up, Raymond.

642
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:49,404
You're a glorified nerd, not a knight.

643
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:51,607
I'm Sir Raymond of the Palms,

644
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,443
and on behalf of
my 12-year-old self,

645
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,911
allow me to retort.

646
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,811
Yield, Damien!

647
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:34,316
Okay, okay, I submit.

648
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:57,658
Ray!

649
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,210
Ray!

650
00:37:01,497 --> 00:37:03,497
Ray. Oh, come on, buddy,

651
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:05,666
open your eyes, you stupid bastard.

652
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:07,167
Ray, come on!

653
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:12,389
Ray!

654
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,609
Stop yelling at me.

655
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:21,682
Ray, you brilliant bastard.

656
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,684
It's not Ray anymore.

657
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:25,603
It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.

658
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,821
Yeah.

659
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:30,190
I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.

660
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,583
Thank you, Amaya. Tales of your deeds

661
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:42,369
will honor these halls for
longer than you can imagine.

662
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:44,371
The honor is mine, Your Grace.

663
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:56,016
Hey. So you're staying?

664
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:57,968
Like you, I found a new home.

665
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,354
- Like me?
- With the Legends.

666
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:01,889
The team suits you.

667
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,194
Take care of yourself, Courtney.

668
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:11,815
You too, Amaya.

669
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:17,821
What was that all about?

670
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:20,207
- Just a little friendly advice.
- Yeah?

671
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,909
We should get going. Where's Ray?

672
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,661
Um, he said something about

673
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:26,213
paying his respects to
the queen before we left.

674
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:28,082
Hm, funny,

675
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:30,584
Sara said the exact same thing.

676
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:35,306
I just wanted to say good-bye.

677
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:37,257
I enjoyed meeting you.

678
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:40,427
And I you, Sara Lance...

679
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:41,478
a lot.

680
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,897
Sara
Lance-A-Lot.

681
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:49,737
I should go.

682
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,822
Do you really have to leave?

683
00:38:51,824 --> 00:38:54,441
It is I, Raymond of the Palms, my lady...

684
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:56,493
come to bid my fair lady adieu.

685
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,829
Oh, well...

686
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:01,665
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

687
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,534
- Sara.
- It's okay, Ray, come in.

688
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:07,121
And a thousand thanks for
your service to the realm.

689
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,790
If ever your travels bring you back,

690
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:11,925
there will always be a
seat at the Round Table

691
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:14,461
for Sir Raymond of the Palms.

692
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:17,014
Thank you, My Lady.

693
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,772
You know, every good
legend ends with a kiss.

694
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:41,789
Good-bye, Guinevere.

695
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:53,801
Surely you must admit

696
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:55,552
that it's not a superior intelligence,

697
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:59,089
but rather the murky depths
of your mind that proved vital.

698
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:00,674
Just admit it,

699
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:02,142
my brain saved the day.

700
00:40:02,144 --> 00:40:04,178
I will admit nothing of the sort.

701
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,562
All right, I'll admit it,

702
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:07,931
walking around in a
legend felt just as real as

703
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:09,683
walking around any part of history.

704
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,819
And you know what? Maybe legend and history

705
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:14,321
aren't so different after
all. Maybe they're just stories

706
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:18,158
to remind us where we come
from and who we can become.

707
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,860
So what do you say? You wanna find out

708
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:21,195
how you're gonna be remembered

709
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:23,247
in everyone's favorite bedtime story?

710
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:25,249
Nah.

711
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:28,368
I think I'd rather make
up my future as I go.

712
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,587
Nice.

713
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:38,545
I got something I wanna say to you.

714
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,602
Well, I'm a captive audience, aren't I?

715
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:47,387
I was gonna kill you

716
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:49,306
for what you did to Sara,

717
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:53,110
but she stopped me, and I'm glad.

718
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:55,229
But make no mistake,

719
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:58,365
you are not Captain, and
this is not your ship.

720
00:40:58,367 --> 00:40:59,900
Not any more.

721
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:04,204
So if you even think about
hurting anyone on my team,

722
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:06,540
I will not hesitate to end you.

723
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:12,246
Feel good to get that
off your chest, did it?

724
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,771
Gideon.

725
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:29,260
I'm here, Captain.

726
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:34,090
You always are.

727
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:49,493
