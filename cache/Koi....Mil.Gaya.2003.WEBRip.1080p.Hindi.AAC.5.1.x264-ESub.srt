1
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:52,255
The universe is made of
several groups of stars...

2
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:54,188
which are called the galaxies.

3
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,054
The galaxy our planet Earth belongs to

4
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:01,626
is called the Milky Way.

5
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:06,125
My husband, who was a space scientist
firmly believed...

6
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,038
that like the Milky Way, there
exist several other galaxies...

7
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,972
on which there could be life.

8
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:19,307
He had just one goal in life:
To discover life on other planets.

9
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:27,319
He had invented several types of
gadgets to collect data.

10
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,653
He used to send sound signals
into space...

11
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,557
That it reverberates in space forever.

12
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:39,867
He was sure that some day...

13
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:46,001
someone from another world would
listen to his sound signals...

14
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:47,772
and respond.

15
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,005
One evening...

16
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,679
Sonia!

17
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:10,770
Coming, dear. What happened?

18
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:13,559
Look! They're responding!

19
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,769
These sounds...?

20
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:25,035
I used the word "OM" to make a
pattern on this octopad.

21
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:31,873
I converted it digitally on the computer
to send sound bytes into space.

22
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:36,442
And look at this. Someone from
another world is responding to me.

23
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,448
I've succeeded in my research !

24
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:40,289
I've achieved a breakthrough, Sonia!

25
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:43,053
We must inform the
space centre immediately.

26
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,675
You see this Research Centre, Dr Mehra?

27
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,744
This is what we have been
researching for years...

28
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:09,045
and they contacted you of all the people?
How is that possible?

29
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:13,453
Why not? I too have spent a
lifetime doing this research.

30
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,458
I sent them various sound waves.

31
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:23,450
in different variations and notes,
why isn't it possible that...

32
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:59,852
They say day-dreaming is a bad habit.

33
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:01,581
I must go home, to bed.

34
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:06,323
They don't realise that every discovery
or find is initially a dream.

35
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,231
Don't be disheartened.

36
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:14,971
People in the world always
reject new findings...

37
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,603
but accept them later.
That's what they're doing to us.

38
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,577
ls it possible for the worlds
in the universe...

39
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:30,553
separated by millions of miles...

40
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:34,687
to ever meet?- Why not?

41
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:39,989
Man has gone to the Moon. He has sent
space-shuttles to Mars and Jupiter.

42
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:43,458
Similarly, they must be trying
to find out about our world too.

43
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,593
Which is why UFO's
have often been sighted.

44
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:56,377
Why are the lights
going on and off?

45
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,546
What's happening?

46
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:11,453
Sanjay! Look there!

47
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,235
They didn't believe what I said.
But they've come!

48
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,101
No...

49
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,537
In a single moment, every dream
of our life was shattered.

50
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,405
The one who tried to
locate another world...

51
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,882
was lost to a world
no one knows about.

52
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:13,345
After his death, I had
no other support in Canada.

53
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:19,084
Rohit was very small,
so I came back home.

54
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:25,766
From what you say, I now understand
the whole case history.

55
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,229
These are the x-rays
of Rohit's brain.

56
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,577
See this white patch?
It's called the gliosys.

57
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,580
It's caused by an injury
to the brain.

58
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,584
But nothing of the sort
ever happened to Rohit, Doctor.

59
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:49,857
It did, Mrs Mehra, when you fell on
your stomach during the accident...

60
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,487
it caused an injury
to the baby's brain...

61
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:56,996
Who was in your womb and
this pan of his brain was damaged.

62
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:03,729
That's why he doesn't have a normal
mental growth and is weak in studies.

63
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:08,936
Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's.

64
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,406
I'm afraid, even when he grows up,
his mental faculties will be stunted.

65
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:24,692
There surely would be a cure, doctor?
- There is. A brain surgery.

66
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:29,030
However... - What?

67
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,429
Chances of success in this case
are very bleak.

68
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,638
If the surgery fails, his whole
body could be paralyzed.

69
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,704
or it could even result in death.

70
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,677
No. I've already lost
everything I ever had.

71
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:54,083
I have nothing except Rohit.

72
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:57,817
I can't afford to lose him.

73
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:10,639
“Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's“.

74
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:14,904
"Even when he grows up, his mental
faculties will be stunted".

75
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,538
Sorry, my foot! look at what you've
done to my house with that ball of yours.

76
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,679
I'm in the police force.
If you break another window pane...

77
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,508
I'll have you locked up.
Get that?

78
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,580
Argues with me.
Bloody crooks.

79
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:09,758
What harm have I done to you?
You've broken a window pane again!

80
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,928
I break your window pane.
But I do say sorry, don't I?

81
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:17,138
Are you doing me a favour?
How many years have I put up with you!

82
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:20,140
I'm not sparing you today. I'm not!

83
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,102
No one needs to be scared.
- Oh yes, let him come.

84
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:31,446
God! What have they done! They've
wrecked all the window panes!

85
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:36,617
The rain, the sunshine, the dust...

86
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,191
everything's in there, except me!

87
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:39,359
Don't get angry uncle.

88
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:42,694
When I grow up, I'll mend
all your windows Uncle.

89
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,734
How much more do you want to grow up?
You're as tall as a tree already.

90
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:51,473
You want to be the Eiffel Tower?
- Don't insult our friend.

91
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:55,205
We'll replace all your window panes.
- Go ahead and do it!

92
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:58,670
Let's have five hundred bucks first.
- Five hundred bucks? What for?

93
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:03,352
We'll have to buy new ones, you see.
So let's have the money.

94
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:05,681
Rascals! You ask a
policeman for money?

95
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,357
Get going before I give
you a thrashing! Scram!

96
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:14,019
Rohit, hurry up son.
You'll be late for school

97
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:18,296
Today's a very important day, Lord.
I'm going to a higher class.

98
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:23,532
The seventh standard.
Take care of me, Lord.

99
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,934
Ma, have you never been to school?

100
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,171
We don't carry old books to a new class.

101
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,877
I'll be given new books
in the seventh standard.

102
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,316
You're not going to
the seventh standard.

103
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,683
Why not? All my friends are!

104
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,054
You've failed your grades.

105
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:50,930
I've failed again?

106
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:53,702
Yes.

107
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:57,702
I'm not going to school. Never!

108
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:02,744
That teacher's a nasty man.
I do all my studies, he still fails me.

109
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:08,676
And he promotes everyone else.
That's why I will not go to school.

110
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:15,246
Study harder this time, Rohit.
You will surely pass.

111
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,014
No.

112
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,726
There will be new students
in my class, Ma.

113
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,889
They'll tease me and make fun of me.

114
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:26,497
They'll call me a tall stick and
other things. I'm not going to school.

115
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,630
Throw those books away.
I don't want them.

116
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:36,373
It is not possible, Mrs Mehra.

117
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,508
Forget about promoting Rohit
to the seventh standard...

118
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,977
he shouldn't be in this school
in the first place.

119
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:46,881
There are special schools
for children like him.

120
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,515
There is no school like that
in this town.

121
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:56,365
But I'm trying to get
a transfer to Delhi...

122
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,762
where there are special schools
for children like Rohit.

123
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:05,936
The chairman of the bank I'm working
for has even promised me a transfer.

124
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:11,069
It's only a matter of a year, sir.

125
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:16,949
One last favour, sir.

126
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,481
Teachers never consider educating
children a favour.

127
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:27,656
But giving him a promotion like this
won't help him in any way.

128
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:34,128
Father, I know Rohit will never
become what I wanted him to be...

129
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,438
nor what his father wished for him.

130
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,874
But still, for the sake
of Rohit's happiness...

131
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,448
please, I request

132
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,431
This is the last time.

133
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:05,373
lfx is equal to 12,
and y is equal to 8...

134
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:09,737
what would x plus 3y be?
Hurry up and write down the answer.

135
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,891
How much would x plus 3y be?
Show me your answer.

136
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,137
This is the right answer.

137
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:48,520
Yours ought to be the first hand to
rise in the class next time.

138
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:24,816
“The sight of the birds...“

139
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:29,822
"awakens a desire"

140
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:35,303
“Although we tread the earth...“

141
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:23,824
"Can you tell me how we will
fly so high, without any wings?"

142
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:31,234
“Anything is possible,
anything can happen...“

143
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:36,544
"we aren't so naive"

144
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:37,399
"You will see,
there will come a day..."

145
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,475
"a day like that
will surely come..."

146
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:50,911
"when everyone in the world
will want to shake hands with me"

147
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:29,017
"Happiness will embrace you"

148
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:34,158
"Life will change some day"

149
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:39,366
"The skies will bow
at your feet..."

150
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:44,529
"and there will be
no one like you around"

151
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,878
“The sight of the birds...“

152
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:04,725
"awakens a desire"

153
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:10,491
“Although we tread the earth...“

154
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:15,568
"we will reach for the skies"

155
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,401
"We will reach for the skies"

156
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,948
What are you shaking your head for?
You're all of six feet...

157
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:06,250
and you move around with these
two feet nothings. Aren't you ashamed?

158
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:07,588
Get out of our way.

159
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,189
We got here first,
so we'll cross first.

160
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:14,894
Get your bikes out of our way.

161
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:17,061
We do not believe in going in
the backward direction, moron.

162
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:20,496
We'll do the needful. You will always
keep moving in a backward direction!

163
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:25,633
He's begun to talk too much, Raj.

164
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:31,237
Rohit, these dogs are barking far too
much today. So let's give them a shot.

165
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:35,039
Oh yes, the formula... - 320!

166
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:49,830
Catch him.

167
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,038
Move....move.

168
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:06,368
May I ask, where you gentlemen
were going to, in such a hurry?

169
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:10,976
How dare you enter a no-entry zone?
- He knocked our bikes down, sir.

170
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:13,575
That doesn't mean you will
violate traffic rules.

171
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,144
Sukhwani, give them a ticket.

172
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:20,714
Excuse me, sir.
Perhaps you don't know who I am.

173
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:26,092
I know. You're Raj, the District
Magistrate Harbans Saxena's son.

174
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:29,256
Sukhwani, collect double the
fine from them. - Yes sir.

175
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:31,827
And have this news splashed
in the local newspapers.

176
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,369
People ought to know that when
Inspector Khan is in-charge...

177
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:41,336
no one can take things for granted.
Not even if he's Distt. Magistrate's son...

178
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:45,912
or the District Magistrate himself.
I hope you've got the message.

179
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:51,981
Colonel! Come on out!

180
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:58,121
Harbans! I have never seen
a moron like you!

181
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,622
Couldn't you even
come to receive me?

182
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:04,862
Malhotra, there can't be a bigger
idiot than you in the world!

183
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,100
You sent a fax that you were coming,
but you didn't tell me when and how!

184
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:11,238
Where would I have come
to receive you, you idiot?

185
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,801
Relax... must you welcome someone
with swear words like this?

186
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,877
But that's how this duffer is!
Look at him! He won't even embrace me.

187
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:28,050
My dear friend!
So nice to meet you.

188
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,114
Now that he has retired...

189
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,159
he has come to spend the rest of
his life with his friend.

190
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:35,996
And this friendship we will
celebrate for a whole year to come.

191
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:41,360
To begin with, we'll have a grand
party at our bungalow this evening.

192
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:46,333
At least come and sit down first.
- Come.

193
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:52,770
Well, well! I forgot to ask you
the most impoﬂant question!

194
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:57,051
Where's our little doll...?
Our tiny little girl?

195
00:24:57,752 --> 00:25:01,848
Your tiny little doll has grown up.
- ls it?

196
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:04,651
But where is she, lndu?

197
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,155
Why're you late?
- Not late at all.

198
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:27,660
The bus has yet to come...

199
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:30,095
and we'll have a blast watching
the three and half hour movie!

200
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:34,028
Three and a half hour movie?
- That's the fashion nowadays.

201
00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:35,971
The bus has arrived!

202
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:40,570
Come quickly....we may miss the bus.
Come quickly.

203
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:46,074
The bus has left, we miss the movie
and our holiday's in ruins!

204
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:58,269
I've just arrived in the city.
Can you tell me where Shanti Villa is?

205
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,948
Shanti Villa? Over there...
- No, it's on this side!

206
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:05,079
But... - The jeep's going empty...

207
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:08,347
the girl's gullible,
she'll drop us at the movies.

208
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:13,388
Let's go. We'll take you there.

209
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:30,078
By the way, my name is Nisha
What's yours?

210
00:26:36,084 --> 00:26:39,247
What places could one see here?
- Several.

211
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:46,856
How about the nightlife here?
What do folks do in the nights?

212
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:48,088
They sleep.

213
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:57,430
Are there no discos in town?
- There are. But kids aren't allowed.

214
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,266
Kids?

215
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:15,681
Hey! This is not Shanti Villa!
- This is a cinema hall.

216
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,322
But I... - You want to go Shanti Villa.

217
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:23,029
And we want go to the movie!

218
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:27,131
Shanti Villa's not far though,
Take a right, a left...

219
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:30,635
then right, left, left...
you'll reach Shanti Villa.

220
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:35,334
So you guys wanted a lift!
- Right, auntie!

221
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,809
You ought to be ashamed!
You fool people along with these kids?

222
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:47,410
And on top of that, you are laughing?
- I'm laughing at your nose.

223
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:51,420
When you scream, it twitches funnily!
Like a deflated balloon!

224
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:01,777
When someone asks for your help...

225
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,813
you must help him,
not make a fool out of him.

226
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:06,348
But I'd have missed the movie.

227
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,915
What did I read out to you
from the Gita ?

228
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:17,058
God is forever willing to help those
who help others.

229
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:22,535
Didn't I read that out to you?
- You did. But I forgot.

230
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:28,773
The next time you meet that girl,
you're going to apologise to her.

231
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:41,199
What's this, Ma?
- It's a computer your Papa made.

232
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,562
Papa built a computer?

233
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:48,304
Through the computer and
the instruments he invented...

234
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:53,104
he spoke to people who live
far away, on the stars.

235
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,216
There are people on the stars?
- Yes.

236
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,352
I can't see anything, Ma.

237
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:18,160
There are several things
one cannot see.

238
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:22,665
But they do exist.

239
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:31,211
What? - Party!

240
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:43,155
Know what, Harbans?
Your jokes are still as hilarious.

241
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,826
Nothing has changed in all these years.
- Why not, daddy?

242
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,659
Look at Raj. He used to be a little
kid, but he's now as tall as a pole.

243
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:52,729
I'm sure someone pulled his legs!

244
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:59,672
She used to be small and fat too,
crying, “Mummy!“ for everything.

245
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:05,075
You've met after years and
you've already started fighting?

246
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,314
Fights make the bond of
friendship stronger, Right?

247
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:36,809
One must eat on time
and sing praises of the Lord!

248
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:38,001
Give me more.

249
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,808
Their age to eat, all right.

250
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:47,012
So what's the spread like?
Where are the papad?

251
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,982
It's a queue. I'll come
in the line.

252
00:30:56,497 --> 00:31:00,730
ls that mutton?
Give me some, I do eat it.

253
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:05,394
Give us some food.
- You just took a plateful!

254
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,267
That's gone down already.
- Where's down?

255
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,533
Here.
- God! Amazing tummy!

256
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:14,679
300 million people in the country
live under the poverty line.

257
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:17,144
They don't get to see
a fistful of foodgrains...

258
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:20,384
and you're taking a second helping?
- That's none of your business.

259
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:22,320
Right.

260
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:24,419
Give us some food.

261
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:28,388
Bittu! Give me some more!

262
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,222
Wait.

263
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,264
Oh my god! Escape from here.

264
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,594
Let the boys continue drinking,
I'm famished.

265
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:40,638
C'mon!

266
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:58,976
Who does he think he is?
lfl could get my hands on him!

267
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:01,677
I'm not going to spare him!

268
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:57,265
What are you up to?
What were you stealing?

269
00:32:58,139 --> 00:32:59,436
No... I was only saying sorry.

270
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,567
Take a look.
That's his way of saying sorry.

271
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:04,904
By sticking chewing gum to the seat.

272
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,950
So you were sticking
chewing gum, were you?

273
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:14,114
He's was the one last night!

274
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,781
Jerk, you've started getting
too big for your boots?

275
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:21,351
You challenged us the day other
and you're now teasing girls?

276
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:24,260
He's the one who took me
to a cinema hall...

277
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:27,298
pretending to show me the house.
He even spilt food on my head!

278
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:29,930
That was nothing, Nisha. With what
he was doing today...

279
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:32,572
you'd have had to cut your hair!
Look at the chewing gum!

280
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:40,376
Such a rascal behind
that innocent face?

281
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:43,380
We ought to hand him over
to the police!

282
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:48,485
Oh no, why hand him over to the
police for something so trivial?

283
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:51,949
We'll let him go.
What say, Raj?

284
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:54,994
Scram.

285
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:56,996
Get lost.

286
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:05,904
Raj, why're allowing him to leave?
He should be taught a lesson.

287
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:30,388
Don't hit me! I'm telling you
the truth. I was only saying sorry.

288
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,939
Quite a champion with
your scooter, aren't you?

289
00:35:55,883 --> 00:35:58,113
To be honest, that madcap
isn't at fault Nisha.

290
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:00,944
The sight of you could
drive anyone crazy.

291
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:04,889
Are you flirting with me?

292
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:09,024
Not at all. On rare occasions,
I speak the truth.

293
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,961
He won't get into mischief anymore.

294
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:13,024
He's been given a solid punishment.

295
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:31,374
But my son isn't like you,
because God hasn't made him like you.

296
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,114
He's a youth, no doubt.
But he has the brains of a child.

297
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:40,293
A naive, innocent child..

298
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:43,592
who can't tell the difference
between good and bad.

299
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:50,395
You boys beat him up mercilessly
and broke his scooter!

300
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:53,166
Because you thought he was
teasing this girl?

301
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:57,276
He came here not to tease you
or to harass you...

302
00:36:58,078 --> 00:37:01,104
he came to apologise to you.
Look at this!

303
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:02,946
He wanted to say he was sorry.

304
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:09,857
Anyway, I can't hold this against you
because you are new to this town.

305
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:14,594
But Raj...?
He knows everything.

306
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:16,930
He used to be Rohit's class-fellow.

307
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,430
Because he's normal...

308
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:23,362
he moved ahead in life.
And my son remained where he was.

309
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:29,635
But you know something?
I don't regret it at all!

310
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:32,305
Because if normal people
are like what you are...

311
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:39,709
I'm glad my son is abnormal.

312
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:09,346
Rohit, what are you doing
in this computer class?

313
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:12,048
Rohit has also chosen computers
in his options, sir.

314
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:14,421
Go and take your seat.

315
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:19,121
I want to learn computers too, sir.

316
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,627
You need brains to learn computers.

317
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:26,966
And you're so bright,
you're still in the seventh.

318
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:30,600
My father was a great scientist, sir.
He even had a computer.

319
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:35,573
I want to become like my Papa, sir.
- So go and learn from your father.

320
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,104
He's no longer in this world, sir.

321
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,450
So go to the world he's in and learn.
And stop picking on my brains!

322
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,181
Go away. Out!

323
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,682
Avon cycle!

324
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,716
Ma...

325
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:37,823
ls this cycle for me, Ma?
- Yes, it's for you.

326
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:42,766
It's a very nice bicycle, Ma!
Avon! Thank you, Ma!

327
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:46,135
Say thank-you to her. She's the
one who brought it for you.

328
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:59,242
I'm not saying thank-you,
and I'm not saying sorry either.

329
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:00,781
I don't want the cycle.

330
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,456
Have you seen his anger?

331
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:25,110
It's true I've made a mistake.

332
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,106
But how was I to know that you
weren't up to any mischief...

333
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:35,453
and had come to say sorry to me?
Anyway, let bygones be bygones.

334
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,782
I'll say sorry to you now, okay?

335
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:51,096
And not just me...Raj, Monty and the
other boys will say sorry to you too.

336
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:54,337
And no one will
bother you ever again.

337
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,575
What if someone does bother me?

338
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:03,038
You and I will get together
and beat him up!

339
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:05,513
God! You too?
- Of course.

340
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:07,881
We're friends now, aren't we?
- Really?

341
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:08,554
C'mon!

342
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,661
All of you will now say
sorry to Rohit.

343
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:32,042
Didn't I tell you?
Are you happy now?

344
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:36,474
And listen everybody...
no fights ever again.

345
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:37,977
Only friendship.

346
00:41:41,988 --> 00:41:44,082
Wait here, I'll be back in a minute.

347
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:59,628
No, I don't know to dance.
- There's nothing you've got to know.

348
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,906
Just hold my body like this
and sway to the music.

349
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,645
No, I feel scared.
- What are you scared of?

350
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:09,076
I'll teach you.
- No, I don't want to learn.

351
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:11,414
Hey! You're breaking into a sweat.

352
00:42:13,453 --> 00:42:14,943
Oh yes, a bit of it.

353
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:29,467
It'll rid you of your fear
and you'll stop sweating.

354
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:31,398
But I'm all right.
- Have some.

355
00:42:34,974 --> 00:42:39,036
It's not nice at all...
- It's very nice. Have it. Go on.

356
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:40,542
Then, let's dance together.

357
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,228
You're forcing him to have liquor?

358
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:48,960
what harm will some Bacardi do?
He's not a kid anymore.

359
00:42:49,404 --> 00:42:53,204
I told you not to bother
Rohit anymore. But you guys...

360
00:42:54,943 --> 00:42:55,375
Let's go, Rohit...

361
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,521
“I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose...“

362
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:47,725
"who knows where I'm going..."

363
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:57,705
“I'm sliding...“

364
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:01,201
"what have you done to me?"

365
00:44:15,524 --> 00:44:18,016
“I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free...“

366
00:44:18,593 --> 00:44:21,290
"who knows where I'm going..."

367
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,335
"I'm giving way..."

368
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:34,736
“I'm moving with you“

369
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:17,778
"What spell is this..."

370
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:27,121
"that we slip, as we walk?"

371
00:45:27,496 --> 00:45:33,458
"We're having so much of fun,
things have changed so much"

372
00:45:52,888 --> 00:45:55,482
"Why have things changed?"

373
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:58,485
"They have changed, all right"

374
00:45:59,694 --> 00:46:02,163
“I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free...“

375
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,359
"who knows where I'm going..."

376
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,831
“I've begun to slide...“

377
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:12,571
"what have you done to me?"

378
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:04,558
"What's makes you so innocent?"

379
00:47:04,826 --> 00:47:07,625
"It's because you're so sweet"

380
00:47:07,996 --> 00:47:10,897
"And why do you find me so sweet?
Tell me"

381
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:14,067
"Why must I tell you?"

382
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:36,091
"Say something"

383
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:39,060
"What should I say?"

384
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:42,897
“I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose...“

385
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:46,095
"who knows where I'm going..."

386
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:49,530
“I've begun to slide...“

387
00:47:50,472 --> 00:47:53,442
“I'm moving with you“

388
00:47:54,776 --> 00:47:57,302
“I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose...“

389
00:47:57,812 --> 00:48:00,406
"who knows where I'm going..."

390
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:03,944
"I'm slipping..."

391
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:14,188
"what have you done to me?"

392
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:17,366
"Over to you, I come"

393
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,808
Mr Sukhwani...

394
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:33,377
What is it... ? Sister!

395
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:38,017
What madness is this?
- All thanks to your darling son!

396
00:48:38,392 --> 00:48:41,362
I've got into the habit of
living with broken windows.

397
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:45,355
I got breeze, water and even
the sunshine inside my house.

398
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:48,898
But ever since I fixed these panes,
it's suffocating and hot in there.

399
00:48:49,503 --> 00:48:54,270
But why must you break the panes?
Can't you just open the windows?

400
00:48:56,477 --> 00:49:00,778
Why didn't it occur to me!
Thanks for the suggestion.

401
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:05,118
Shame on me! I must be the first
Sindhi to cause losses to himself!

402
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:08,178
Really?

403
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:10,423
She's now your girlfriend.
- How?

404
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:14,222
She presented you a bicycle?
- She even took you to the club?

405
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,463
Yes, she danced with me too.
- She dropped you home...

406
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:19,531
and said good night?
- Did she give you a good-night kiss?

407
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:21,294
No.

408
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:24,530
So how does she become his girlfriend?
- Why not?

409
00:49:25,573 --> 00:49:28,474
They become boyfriend and girlfriend
only when they exchange kisses.

410
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:30,840
So what should he do?

411
00:49:31,245 --> 00:49:35,807
My Mummy's absolutely right.
Men are real idiots.

412
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:38,809
They don't even know that they
must further their friendship...

413
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:43,149
before getting down to kisses.
- I want to meet your Mummy!

414
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:45,824
She thinks we men are idiots?
- Oh yes.

415
00:49:46,494 --> 00:49:48,690
Know what, Rohit?
Give her a nice present.

416
00:49:49,697 --> 00:49:51,529
Where do I have the money
to give her a present?

417
00:49:51,966 --> 00:49:53,161
Ma gives me just a rupee every day.

418
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:57,004
But you can give Nisha a rose.
Can't you?

419
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,017
Didn't you tell me about a boy
whose mind is like a child's?

420
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,487
There was a nice article on the Net,
I've got a print-out.

421
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:12,998
It says, such people ought to be
given a lot of love and sympathy.

422
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:14,264
That is their only cure.

423
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:38,921
What are you up to?

424
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:41,719
Come on up here.

425
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:52,730
Why're you hiding the rose?
- I'm not.

426
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:55,331
It's a present for you.

427
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:06,176
Why're you blushing?

428
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:10,722
My friends say...

429
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,215
that when a girl and a boy
exchange kisses...

430
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:15,722
they become boyfriend
and girlfriend.

431
00:51:17,095 --> 00:51:20,360
Your friends are right.
lam indeed your girlfriend.

432
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:22,328
Really? - Yes.

433
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:27,036
Nisha...
- Yes, Papa?

434
00:51:27,606 --> 00:51:30,007
I must leave now.
- No, come on inside.

435
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,203
My Mummy and Papa will be
very happy to meet you.

436
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:36,107
Papa, Mama... this is Rohit.

437
00:51:40,085 --> 00:51:41,883
Will you have something to
drink, Rohit? Tea, coffee...?

438
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:46,254
Bournvita (a malt drink).
- Bournvita?

439
00:51:46,825 --> 00:51:49,726
Yes, Bournvita is a must
for strength and vigour.

440
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:52,953
Look at me. I'm in the seventh,
but I'm the tallest in my class.

441
00:51:53,164 --> 00:51:53,960
Thanks to Bournvita.

442
00:51:59,004 --> 00:52:00,904
Sorry, Rohit. We have no Bournvita.

443
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:02,669
No....

444
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,446
Oh yes. We'll have some bought today.
- And we'll drink it too.

445
00:52:09,624 --> 00:52:13,754
Call from District magistrate, sir.
- Tell him I'm coming.

446
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:30,812
You know computers?
- Yes.

447
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:34,457
I also know that you want
to learn to operate it.

448
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:37,726
Will you teach me?
- Of course.

449
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:40,564
So let's go to my house!
I have my Papa's computer.

450
00:52:54,612 --> 00:52:55,909
These stars...?
- Yes!

451
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,183
My Papa was a big scientist.
He spoke to people living on the stars.

452
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:01,815
Really! - Yes indeed.

453
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:10,057
What's this?

454
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:13,499
I don't know.

455
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:16,429
Looks like one of
your Papa's projects.

456
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,632
Look, it says "press B"

457
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:31,112
Nothing's happening.
- That says "B" too. See?

458
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,849
Let's connect them and see.

459
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:23,962
How did you play that?
- I know the tune. Ma taught me.

460
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:24,570
Want to hear it?

461
00:54:35,883 --> 00:54:39,114
Rohit, teach me to play it.
- It's very easy. Give me your finger.

462
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:32,129
"My dreams, my imagination..."

463
00:55:32,373 --> 00:55:34,671
"and my desires now have a face"

464
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:50,157
My existence has
a reason..."

465
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:57,994
" now that I've found someone"

466
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,058
"Whom have you found?"

467
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:06,506
" I've found someone"

468
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:26,782
"You and I did always meet..."

469
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:42,006
"but why do I feel today..."

470
00:56:43,077 --> 00:56:49,540
"that I've found someone?"

471
00:56:50,451 --> 00:56:53,716
"Whom have you found?"

472
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:57,720
“ I've found someone“

473
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:40,506
"What does meeting me do to you?
Tell me, will you?"

474
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:44,271
"Tell me, will you?"

475
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:52,607
“I'll tell you in your ear...“

476
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:55,516
"come closer, will you?"

477
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:03,588
" I know what you're
going to tell me"

478
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:07,461
“I'm not going to heed
your request to come closer“

479
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,261
"Listen to me... do listen!"

480
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:17,939
"You and I did always talk..."

481
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:21,710
"but why do I feel today..."

482
00:58:22,882 --> 00:58:29,652
"that I've found someone?"

483
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,990
"Whom have you found?"

484
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:38,663
“ I've found someone“

485
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:25,992
"When you are with me,
you're close to me..."

486
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:30,063
"you're close to me,
even when you leave"

487
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:42,335
"There can't be a realisation
like this one"

488
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:49,240
"I can't figure out
why all this happening..."

489
00:59:49,484 --> 00:59:53,079
“I can't figure out
what's happening in my heart“

490
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:57,082
"You must, figure it out!"

491
00:59:57,292 --> 01:00:03,493
"My head did always beat..."

492
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:07,498
"but why do I feel today..."

493
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:15,776
"that I've found someone?"

494
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:19,412
"Whom have you found?"

495
01:00:19,914 --> 01:00:23,782
“ I've found someone“

496
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:27,852
"My dreams, my imagination..."

497
01:00:28,323 --> 01:00:30,382
"and my desires now have a face"

498
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:34,185
"but why do I feel today..."

499
01:00:37,298 --> 01:00:39,960
"that I've found someone?"

500
01:00:41,135 --> 01:00:44,799
"I've found someone"

501
01:00:55,516 --> 01:00:59,475
Rohit, come quickly.
Dinner is sewed.

502
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:11,539
But the Blue Bulls are no easy team,
score is even at 50:50.

503
01:01:20,248 --> 01:01:23,240
Gas has entered the final few minutes
with score at 60:58.

504
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:26,910
Blue Bulls passed the ball &
Kasauli Tigers have snatched it mid-way.

505
01:01:27,122 --> 01:01:28,988
Kasauli Tiger's Raj Saxena is
moving forward swiftly...

506
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,749
..Crosses the halftime with the ball.

507
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,666
You idiot!

508
01:01:40,802 --> 01:01:44,102
A beautiful girl walks
away with the boy.

509
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:47,276
Girl takes away the boy and players
take away the ball.

510
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:49,443
I'm confused over which game's
commentary should I give?

511
01:01:51,613 --> 01:01:54,605
Anyway, Raj moves forward and
passes the ball..

512
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:56,784
But Blue Bulls snatch
the ballonce again...

513
01:01:56,985 --> 01:01:59,454
The game has resumed again and the
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

514
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:01,950
And a basket from the Blue Bulls!

515
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:07,459
The scores are even, a few seconds to go
and the match is getting exciting...

516
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:09,892
The game has resumed again and
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

517
01:02:16,386 --> 01:02:21,347
The winners of the Hero Cup
are the Kasauli Tigers!

518
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:07,792
What's happening here, Rohit?

519
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:12,222
I want to play basketball too.
I too want to become a champion.

520
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,295
People will clap for me then.

521
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,361
Like Nisha was clapping for me?

522
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:27,134
But how will you learn on your own?
Let us teach you.

523
01:03:28,146 --> 01:03:31,172
Will you really teach me?
- Of course. We'll teach you.

524
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,163
You're not hurt, are you?
- No... it's okay. Go ahead.

525
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,675
I don't want to learn!
I don't want to!

526
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,522
How will you get any applause
unless you learn?

527
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,534
You dare take me on
over Nisha?

528
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,543
Watch your step in the future.
Understand?

529
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,224
Ma says those who sin
are always punished.

530
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:58,897
But I have committed no sin.
So why am I being punished?

531
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:01,735
Everybody pokes fun at me.

532
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,573
If You don't help me,
who will?

533
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,071
You have so much of strength.

534
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,912
Give me some of Your strength, Lord.

535
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:17,054
Please... give me some strength, Lord!

536
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,877
What are you up to...?!

537
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:28,679
What have you been doing!
- I did nothing.

538
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:33,723
It's happening on its own, Ma!
- You did nothing...? Nothing?

539
01:07:50,991 --> 01:07:51,685
What's happening, Ma?

540
01:07:52,393 --> 01:07:53,883
There's a power failure in the
whole of the city, sir.

541
01:07:54,428 --> 01:07:55,623
It's pitch dark everywhere.

542
01:07:57,731 --> 01:07:58,755
What's up with this torch, Sukhwani?

543
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:00,363
It doesn't work on electricity anyway.

544
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:07,235
Looks like there's going to be a storm.
A deadly storm.

545
01:08:36,804 --> 01:08:37,293
Sir! Look!

546
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:42,135
God!

547
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:37,750
There's news of a UFO being sighted
in Kasauli, in Northern India.

548
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:42,915
Several space organisations all over
the world refuse to believe this incident

549
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,853
Because no radar station in the world
nor satellites in space...

550
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,057
could detect any signals of the UFO.

551
01:09:49,566 --> 01:09:52,934
But UFO legends abound,
like ghost stories.

552
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:57,735
Those who see them, believe them.
Those who don't, refuse to believe it.

553
01:09:58,275 --> 01:10:04,647
A similar UFO sighting was reported
in Bangalore in May, 2001.

554
01:10:05,315 --> 01:10:07,579
There are claims of UFO sightings
not only in India...

555
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:10,116
but all over the world.

556
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,481
Although there is no strong evidence,
there are people who believe in them.

557
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:10,378
The burning grass and this crater
is evidence that the spacecraft...

558
01:11:11,248 --> 01:11:15,947
that flew over Kasauli last night
landed right here.

559
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:19,581
Looks like this is where
the spacecraft landed.

560
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:23,515
This is amazing!

561
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:29,860
The aliens from another planet chose
our town over the rest of the world!

562
01:11:30,467 --> 01:11:35,906
Imagine how popular and famous
our little hill station is going to be!

563
01:11:36,373 --> 01:11:40,276
I announce a two-day official holiday
to celebrate this event!

564
01:12:01,031 --> 01:12:01,657
What's all this?

565
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:05,858
There's a carnival at Mall Road.
People are dressed like aliens.

566
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:09,004
C'mon, Rohit. Wear something unusual.
- All right. I'll be back in a moment.

567
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:24,178
What are you doing? - I'm making
eyes and a mouth on this pitcher.

568
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:27,023
What for? - I'm going to dress up
like an alien...

569
01:12:27,223 --> 01:12:28,349
and go to the carnival
with my friends.

570
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:32,520
Like an alien...?

571
01:12:33,897 --> 01:12:34,864
You're not going anywhere.

572
01:12:35,732 --> 01:12:37,700
Why not? All my friends
are going, Ma.

573
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:39,232
There's a difference between
the rest ofthem and you....

574
01:12:39,436 --> 01:12:42,565
What difference?
- No arguments, I say!

575
01:12:42,772 --> 01:12:45,605
You're not going. That's it.
- God! Let's go!

576
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:06,628
Extra terrestrials... aliens?

577
01:13:07,603 --> 01:13:09,230
What are you saying, Mr Khan ?

578
01:13:09,672 --> 01:13:12,869
It's a fact that a spaceship
landed here, Harbans.

579
01:13:13,676 --> 01:13:16,338
It could also be a fact that someone
emerged from the spaceship.

580
01:13:16,546 --> 01:13:19,538
That's right, sir. That's exactly
what has happened.

581
01:13:19,849 --> 01:13:22,181
I have inspected the whole region.

582
01:13:22,685 --> 01:13:27,179
From the footprints, it appears as if
some aliens came out of the spaceship.

583
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:29,719
But... - But what?

584
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:36,722
One of them did not go back.
- What makes you say that?

585
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:41,404
There were footprints of some aliens
which led to the jungles...

586
01:13:42,405 --> 01:13:46,308
but the footprints of one of them
did not lead back to the spaceship.

587
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:50,068
What if they are indeed the
footprints of an alien?

588
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:51,908
We'll capture it.

589
01:13:52,114 --> 01:13:55,311
That will be a bigger achievement
that man landing on the Moon.

590
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,646
It'll unravel thousands of
secrets of the universe.

591
01:13:58,187 --> 01:14:01,020
But what if the alien is dangerous?
- We'll simply shoot it.

592
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:06,753
Whatever it is, till this is
fully proved...

593
01:14:07,063 --> 01:14:08,929
we must keep it to ourselves.

594
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:11,366
The whole of the hill station is
in a festive mood...

595
01:14:11,567 --> 01:14:13,160
it'll unnecessarily spread panic.

596
01:14:45,835 --> 01:14:49,237
It's no use calling me!
Ma won't let me go! Go away, Bittu!

597
01:14:58,481 --> 01:15:01,644
What are you whistling for?
Haven't I said, I can't come? Go away!

598
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:47,030
Know what, Rohit? There's an alien
in the forest.

599
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,220
What's an alien?

600
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:53,126
Those from other planets
are called aliens.

601
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:56,298
How are they to look at?
- I don't know.

602
01:15:57,306 --> 01:16:00,367
They could look like animals,
or even like us.

603
01:16:01,744 --> 01:16:04,475
Could they even look like Bittu?
- Bittu?

604
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,208
Yes, a kid came from the forest last night.
I thought it was Bittu.

605
01:16:09,418 --> 01:16:13,116
I smashed the pitcher and shouted at him.
He ran away into the forest.

606
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:16,850
And see...? The pitcher's been
put together.

607
01:16:17,059 --> 01:16:18,891
It must've been another pitcher.
- No, this is the one.

608
01:16:19,095 --> 01:16:20,893
I drew eyes and a mouth on it.
Take a look.

609
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:28,893
It wasn't that alien, was it?
- Let's go and check.

610
01:16:29,105 --> 01:16:34,805
If it can put together a pitcher,
it can do anything. I'm feeling soared.

611
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:38,641
What's there to be scared of?
I'm with you. Come on, come.

612
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:16,645
Rohit, looks like it was really a kid.
- Yes. Let's go back. - Let's go.

613
01:18:25,855 --> 01:18:27,016
Have you landed from up there?

614
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:36,553
That's where he seems
to have come from.

615
01:18:41,393 --> 01:18:43,088
We must do something for him.

616
01:18:44,696 --> 01:18:48,724
If the police catch him,
God knows what they will do.

617
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:53,404
And if he remains in the jungle,
the wild animals will eat him up.

618
01:18:55,746 --> 01:19:01,776
So what must we do?
- We'll have to hide him.

619
01:19:05,622 --> 01:19:06,783
Will you go with us?

620
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:10,854
Will you be my friend?

621
01:20:26,091 --> 01:20:27,786
Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind.

622
01:20:29,628 --> 01:20:30,390
Good morning, sir.

623
01:20:34,066 --> 01:20:36,034
Have this roll developed and printed.
- Okay.

624
01:20:36,235 --> 01:20:36,758
Make it fast.

625
01:20:39,037 --> 01:20:44,532
You've done an amazing job, sir!
This is a fantastic idea!

626
01:20:44,743 --> 01:20:48,008
A policeman's job can't be trusted.
Hired today, fired tomorrow.

627
01:20:48,213 --> 01:20:50,944
Especially with an honest man like you,
anything is possible.

628
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,846
What rubbish are you talking Sukhwani?
- I'm only praising you.

629
01:20:54,052 --> 01:20:59,115
This is a terrific side-business.
As long as weddings are held...

630
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:04,023
you're going to do roaring business!
- Sukhwani! Do as you are told

631
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,435
This is Khan here, sir.

632
01:21:14,106 --> 01:21:17,872
I've taken pictures of the footprints
as you asked me to.

633
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:16,848
What happened...? What's wrong?

634
01:22:17,421 --> 01:22:17,887
What?

635
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,791
What happened?

636
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:26,286
Rohit, open the door

637
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:33,964
I'm glad you're here.
- Why? Any problem?

638
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:36,265
Yes, he was screaming away!

639
01:22:39,176 --> 01:22:40,871
He must be hungry.

640
01:22:42,446 --> 01:22:44,915
There are so many things here.
He won't eat anything.

641
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:47,179
He must be eating something else.

642
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:50,178
What do you eat?

643
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:56,460
Glass?

644
01:23:01,573 --> 01:23:02,301
Wood?

645
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,675
The net? The ventilator?

646
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:10,146
- No, Rohit He's trying
to say something else.

647
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:15,609
The air...? The rays?

648
01:23:17,656 --> 01:23:20,648
Sunlight? - Sunlight!

649
01:23:21,226 --> 01:23:22,785
God! He speaks!

650
01:23:24,529 --> 01:23:26,122
He understands what we say!

651
01:23:26,998 --> 01:23:31,026
Which means, apaﬂ from having those
powers, he's also very intelligent.

652
01:23:31,403 --> 01:23:34,395
Oh yes. But how's he
going to eat the sunlight?

653
01:23:34,606 --> 01:23:35,937
Sunlight isn't something
you eat, is it?

654
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:39,577
What we eat gives
our body its energy.

655
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:42,475
Maybe they draw their energy
from sunlight.

656
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,429
Rohit, look...

657
01:23:58,363 --> 01:23:59,990
Hide quickly! Hurry!

658
01:24:06,772 --> 01:24:07,898
What are you doing here
so early in the day...?

659
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:10,666
Nothing at all, Ma.

660
01:24:10,876 --> 01:24:14,437
Nisha! When did you arrive?
- Right now, auntie.

661
01:24:14,646 --> 01:24:18,583
So join us for breakfast. Come on.
- Go ahead. We'll come in a while.

662
01:24:19,551 --> 01:24:22,248
I'm getting late for the office.
Come quickly.

663
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,024
Don't come out.
We'll be back in a moment, okay?

664
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:49,499
Bye, Nisha... Rohit, make sure
you finish your breakfast!

665
01:24:51,303 --> 01:24:51,792
WOW!

666
01:25:03,082 --> 01:25:05,676
Found the ball, Bittu? - No.

667
01:25:05,885 --> 01:25:07,546
What a sixer. The hall's disappeared
outside the stadium!

668
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:10,518
Not outside the stadium.
It's inside that outhouse. Look.

669
01:25:11,524 --> 01:25:12,992
Yes, come on. - Come on.

670
01:25:19,165 --> 01:25:20,326
Where's the ball?

671
01:25:28,808 --> 01:25:31,106
What are you guys doing here?
- There's someone in there!

672
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:34,940
A ghost! - A monkey!
- Our ball is in his hand.

673
01:25:38,117 --> 01:25:41,087
Why have you come out?
Didn't I tell you not to come out?

674
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:49,961
What ball? You've ruined everyihing!
Everybody's got to know!

675
01:25:51,831 --> 01:25:52,889
Who's that?

676
01:25:53,499 --> 01:25:58,061
First promise us that you will not
utter a word about this to anyone.

677
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:03,008
He's a friend of mine.
Like all of you are.

678
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:12,110
He came in that spaceship.

679
01:26:12,451 --> 01:26:15,443
The spaceship has left,
but this poor chap got left behind.

680
01:27:03,903 --> 01:27:05,632
Magic! - That's magic! Magic!

681
01:27:05,838 --> 01:27:07,636
"Magic..."

682
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:10,765
"Magic...."

683
01:27:35,067 --> 01:27:43,067
"Magic...."

684
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:12,671
"The earth and the skies..."
"the rose and the rosegardens..."

685
01:28:14,715 --> 01:28:19,653
"the hills and the winds
are meeting today"

686
01:28:19,853 --> 01:28:27,853
"This is magic..."

687
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:37,263
"sheer magic"

688
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:08,196
"What spell is this?"

689
01:29:08,402 --> 01:29:10,666
"It's a new language of
love altogether"

690
01:29:10,871 --> 01:29:15,775
" No one despairs anymore"

691
01:29:25,552 --> 01:29:30,217
"We're silent..."
"so are you"

692
01:29:30,457 --> 01:29:34,416
"And yet, we say so much"

693
01:29:34,628 --> 01:29:39,930
"How did this wonder happen?"

694
01:29:40,134 --> 01:29:48,134
"It's magic..."

695
01:29:48,742 --> 01:29:56,742
"sheer magic"

696
01:30:37,157 --> 01:30:39,455
"You are the one our eyes cherish..."

697
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:41,924
"you are the one
who lives in our head..."

698
01:30:42,129 --> 01:30:47,067
"we expect nothing from you in return"

699
01:31:01,682 --> 01:31:06,279
"That you have come to see us..."

700
01:31:06,553 --> 01:31:10,615
"we dream lovely dreams"

701
01:31:10,824 --> 01:31:15,921
"Promise to be a friend always"

702
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:24,129
"It's magic..."

703
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:33,739
"sheer magic"

704
01:31:44,091 --> 01:31:45,388
Why're you guys laughing so much?

705
01:31:45,726 --> 01:31:47,353
Some new spaceship joke on SMS ?

706
01:31:47,561 --> 01:31:51,361
The spaceship is old hat. We're laughing
at a new twist to the story!

707
01:31:52,232 --> 01:31:54,701
Will Nisha and Rohit's children
be normal or abnormal?

708
01:31:55,836 --> 01:31:56,997
Rohit and Nisha's children?

709
01:31:57,204 --> 01:32:00,640
As if you don't know. Nisha spends
all her time with Rohit.

710
01:32:02,309 --> 01:32:04,835
Raj, do something
while you have the time.

711
01:32:05,212 --> 01:32:07,738
Else, that madcap will make away
with your goodies.

712
01:32:15,789 --> 01:32:18,190
Harbans, any news on the alien?

713
01:32:19,226 --> 01:32:23,754
No. Looks like Inspector Khan
was mistaken.

714
01:32:24,698 --> 01:32:27,360
Else, we'd have had some
information on it by now.

715
01:32:31,438 --> 01:32:34,100
I have good news for you.
- Good news? What good news?

716
01:32:34,308 --> 01:32:36,367
Your son has decided to get married.

717
01:32:38,912 --> 01:32:39,845
It's Nisha, Uncle.

718
01:32:45,485 --> 01:32:48,716
Hear this? Nisha and Raj
have approved each other!

719
01:32:48,922 --> 01:32:52,756
Really...? This is wonderful news!

720
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:53,892
What say, lndu?

721
01:32:56,596 --> 01:32:57,290
What happened?

722
01:32:57,497 --> 01:33:00,660
Do you guys know?
Nisha's getting married to Raj.

723
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:05,065
How did you get to know?
- My parents were at the club last night.

724
01:33:05,272 --> 01:33:07,604
They're the ones who told me.
- But how's that possible?

725
01:33:07,808 --> 01:33:11,836
Nisha is Rohit's girlfriend.
Let's go and tell him. - C'mon.

726
01:33:50,317 --> 01:33:52,513
Why did you lie?
When did I agree?

727
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,711
You didn't disagree either. And that's
what our parents want too.

728
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,822
It isn't about our parents.
It's about telling lies.

729
01:33:58,024 --> 01:33:59,287
Where have I spoken a lie?

730
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:05,062
That we like each other doesn't mean
we get married, Raj.

731
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:08,200
In any case, it's necessary to get to
know each other before getting married.

732
01:34:10,137 --> 01:34:14,370
As things stand today, we won't get
to know each other all our lives.

733
01:34:14,608 --> 01:34:18,067
What do you mean?
- Do you think I'm blind?

734
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:19,803
Can't I see you and Rohit
are having an affair?

735
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:25,073
What did you say?
Rohit and I...? An affair?

736
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:30,346
Even if we are having an affair,
what is it to you?

737
01:34:30,557 --> 01:34:32,389
Whom I see is entirely my business.

738
01:34:32,592 --> 01:34:35,061
You have no right to interfere
in my personal life.

739
01:34:35,262 --> 01:34:38,698
Do you get that?
- You're insulting me for that fool?

740
01:34:38,765 --> 01:34:40,062
He is not a fool.

741
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:43,829
Looks like you've got to
know him very well!

742
01:34:44,037 --> 01:34:48,338
Yes. Very well.
Him... and you, too.

743
01:34:58,132 --> 01:34:59,531
What's going on over here...?

744
01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:03,528
What happened, Rohit?

745
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,708
Nisha's getting married, Ma.
With Raj.

746
01:35:11,646 --> 01:35:16,584
So why are you upset?
Every girl gets married some day.

747
01:35:16,784 --> 01:35:18,718
But Nisha's my girlfriend, Ma!

748
01:35:18,819 --> 01:35:24,656
What"? Nisham?
Your girlfriend? - Yes!

749
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:32,889
Because she spoke lovingly to you,
does that make her your girlfriend?

750
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,966
She herself told me that
she's my girlfriend!

751
01:35:35,169 --> 01:35:39,299
And that I'm her boyfriend.
- She mustn't have meant it.

752
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:43,339
Nisha is an educated
and sensible girl.

753
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:52,082
She can be your friend...
not a companion for life. - Why not?

754
01:35:54,355 --> 01:36:02,355
Rohit, although you have grown up...
you're still a child.

755
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,529
You're not like boys of your age.
- Why not?

756
01:36:09,737 --> 01:36:11,171
Why am I not like the other boys?

757
01:36:11,372 --> 01:36:14,808
I haven't done anything wrong...
so why's Nisha also leaving me?

758
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:23,617
Everything would have been fine...

759
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,048
had only we not seen that spaceship.

760
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:35,127
Your father would have been
alive today and you...

761
01:36:36,997 --> 01:36:38,624
you wouldn't have been like this.

762
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,131
A spaceship? Papa...?
What happened, Ma?

763
01:36:45,573 --> 01:36:46,870
We met with an accident.

764
01:37:32,202 --> 01:37:33,328
What are you doing here?!

765
01:37:33,536 --> 01:37:39,566
Get ready quickly.
I'll serve the breakfast.

766
01:37:43,413 --> 01:37:44,403
Stop smiling and go back
to the outhouse.

767
01:37:44,614 --> 01:37:48,107
Don't come out again,
you'll get caught. Go!

768
01:38:10,173 --> 01:38:13,609
Ma! I can't see anything!

769
01:38:14,044 --> 01:38:17,275
Wash your eyes...
you'll be able to see.

770
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,630
Ma! I can see everything!

771
01:38:39,836 --> 01:38:43,568
You say you can't see anything and
then you say you can see everything!

772
01:38:43,773 --> 01:38:46,037
Hurry up, son.
You'll be late for school.

773
01:38:49,179 --> 01:38:50,112
Time for computer classes.

774
01:38:50,313 --> 01:38:53,806
You mustn't come, Rohit.
The teacher will again scold you.

775
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:56,247
Why will he scold me now?
I'm already studying computers.

776
01:38:56,586 --> 01:38:59,419
Rohit, where are your glasses?
Have you forgotten them at home?

777
01:38:59,622 --> 01:39:03,024
No, I left it them home. This morning,
I could see everything clearly.

778
01:39:03,226 --> 01:39:06,093
Really? - Oh yes.

779
01:39:06,629 --> 01:39:09,599
In that case, read what Mr Chaturvedi
is writing on the blackboard.

780
01:39:21,978 --> 01:39:25,278
I want the answer to that, boys.

781
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,495
Who gave that answer?

782
01:39:48,838 --> 01:39:53,799
Rohit, you orally solved a problem
meant for the tenth standard?

783
01:39:55,566 --> 01:39:56,362
Come inside.

784
01:39:58,469 --> 01:40:03,839
Was that guess-work, or was it...?
- Was that the right answer, sir?

785
01:40:04,274 --> 01:40:07,471
Absolutely right.
But how did you solve it?

786
01:40:07,678 --> 01:40:09,942
I don't know, sir.
It just came to me.

787
01:40:10,647 --> 01:40:15,084
Rohit...? I can't believe it.
- Neither can I, sir.

788
01:40:15,285 --> 01:40:17,379
But this is a fact.
- Where is Rohit?

789
01:40:17,588 --> 01:40:21,024
How many times have I told you
that you can't learn computers.

790
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:22,984
You'd rather learn carpentry
or masonry!

791
01:40:23,694 --> 01:40:26,595
But you turn up every time and I have
to insult you and drive you out.

792
01:40:26,797 --> 01:40:31,359
Mr Mathur! ls that the way
you talk to your students?

793
01:40:31,602 --> 01:40:34,162
Father, this boy has zero I.Q.

794
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:37,065
He needs a doctor, not a teacher.

795
01:40:37,341 --> 01:40:39,036
See for yourself.

796
01:40:39,643 --> 01:40:43,443
Tell me: without opening
a particular file...

797
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:46,975
how will you copy data from Windows
drive "A" to any other drive ?

798
01:40:48,218 --> 01:40:51,654
You are deliberately asking him a
difficult question to belittle him.

799
01:40:51,855 --> 01:40:53,687
To begin with, go to programs...

800
01:40:53,891 --> 01:40:57,691
when the Windows Explorer has started,
right-click on the file.

801
01:40:57,895 --> 01:40:59,886
And without releasing the button,
take the file to another drive...

802
01:41:00,097 --> 01:41:02,725
and release the button.
The file will be copied, sir.

803
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:12,004
Didn't you tell me to learn it
from my father, sir?

804
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:14,536
I've learnt it from my Papa.

805
01:41:16,647 --> 01:41:20,015
You are a teacher, who's responsible
for thousands of students, sir.

806
01:41:20,217 --> 01:41:22,879
You ought to inspire them
to move ahead in life.

807
01:41:23,353 --> 01:41:26,687
Computer did not make man,
man made the computer.

808
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:30,087
So what the brains can accomplish,
your computers never can, sir.

809
01:41:30,794 --> 01:41:32,853
Do not ever consider anyone
to be small, sir.

810
01:41:33,197 --> 01:41:37,065
Because what is small
will become big some day, sir.

811
01:41:49,446 --> 01:41:52,040
Did you notice the look
on Mr Mathuﬁs face?

812
01:41:52,249 --> 01:41:55,014
But what makes you suddenly
so smart, Rohit?

813
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:58,919
There is a hitch. You will
forget about us now, won't you?

814
01:41:59,456 --> 01:42:02,255
You'll have grown up friends.
- Rubbish! That's not true.

815
01:42:02,793 --> 01:42:04,761
You are my friends and
will always remain my friends.

816
01:42:07,297 --> 01:42:09,425
Rohit, pass the ball.

817
01:42:11,468 --> 01:42:14,096
Whom are you asking? This idiot, who's
still feeding on his mother's milk?

818
01:42:17,975 --> 01:42:18,771
What are you staring at?

819
01:42:31,822 --> 01:42:35,952
Rohit! Look at the ball!

820
01:42:44,501 --> 01:42:48,631
You think you've become too tough?
Go check him out.

821
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:54,978
What a punch!

822
01:42:56,179 --> 01:42:57,476
You've even got the strength!

823
01:43:04,354 --> 01:43:05,150
Goodness!

824
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:11,992
Muscles! Take a look!

825
01:43:14,364 --> 01:43:19,825
Don't stare... c'mon!

826
01:43:26,209 --> 01:43:27,836
Looks like you guys haven't
had your mother's milk.

827
01:43:28,045 --> 01:43:30,343
Make sure you have it next time.
We'll have a nice bout.

828
01:43:37,054 --> 01:43:37,850
Why have you come here?

829
01:43:38,722 --> 01:43:41,191
Are you angry with me?
- Yes.

830
01:43:42,059 --> 01:43:44,027
Why?- Because you're
not my friend.

831
01:43:44,561 --> 01:43:45,357
You're going away with Raj.

832
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:50,359
I'm not going with Raj. - No?

833
01:43:51,068 --> 01:43:54,868
I've turned him down.
- Great! I don't like him.

834
01:43:55,739 --> 01:43:59,198
I don't like him either.
- We share our likes, don't we?

835
01:44:00,577 --> 01:44:03,877
We share our likes and
understand each other too.

836
01:44:04,748 --> 01:44:06,546
Which is why I have come
to make you see reason.

837
01:44:08,585 --> 01:44:13,887
Every girl has to get married some day.
She has to settle down.

838
01:44:14,424 --> 01:44:15,721
Oh yes, that is true.

839
01:44:16,259 --> 01:44:18,227
So tell me what kind of a boy
you would like.

840
01:44:18,428 --> 01:44:21,227
I'll find him for you.
- You will find him for me?

841
01:44:21,431 --> 01:44:22,899
Yes. We share our likes, after all.

842
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,898
You will like what I like.

843
01:44:25,268 --> 01:44:27,236
Okay then, which boys do you like?

844
01:44:29,106 --> 01:44:31,404
There's Bunty, Bittu, Aslam...
several others too.

845
01:44:32,275 --> 01:44:35,575
They're kids.- But I'm a grown up.

846
01:44:35,779 --> 01:44:37,406
It'll be great fun!
We'll always be together.

847
01:44:37,614 --> 01:44:40,242
We'll go out together and
drink Bournvita all the time!

848
01:44:41,284 --> 01:44:44,083
Marriage isn't just about
drinking Bournvita, Rohit.

849
01:44:44,955 --> 01:44:46,923
It's a huge responsibility.

850
01:44:47,958 --> 01:44:50,928
A responsibility of giving
his wife lots of love, isn't it?

851
01:44:51,795 --> 01:44:54,423
One can't live on love alone, Rohit.

852
01:44:55,465 --> 01:45:00,767
Every girl seeks a companion
who's mentally and physically strong.

853
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:21,287
Am I not physically strong?

854
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:30,359
Yes you are. - A bit raw mentally?
But I'll ripen.

855
01:45:36,173 --> 01:45:36,799
Just keep watching.

856
01:45:40,343 --> 01:45:42,471
I threw an amazing punch!

857
01:45:42,679 --> 01:45:44,977
And Nisha...! She was
stunned with my attitude!

858
01:45:45,182 --> 01:45:49,141
And that ball! One kick
and it kept flying and flying!

859
01:45:55,192 --> 01:45:58,651
You're the one who did
all this, isn't it?

860
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:14,343
No, Ma. Don't be afraid!
This is Jadoo, he's a friend.

861
01:46:14,878 --> 01:46:16,676
Get away from there!

862
01:46:17,881 --> 01:46:18,677
How did this thing land here!

863
01:46:19,382 --> 01:46:22,682
Don't scream, Ma! Someone might
come here... listen to me, Ma!

864
01:46:22,886 --> 01:46:26,845
Hear me out at least"!
- Keep away from it!

865
01:46:27,057 --> 01:46:27,683
What is it?

866
01:46:28,725 --> 01:46:31,023
He came in that spaceship
we saw recently.

867
01:46:31,228 --> 01:46:33,196
What? - I brought him
from the forest.

868
01:46:33,396 --> 01:46:35,364
He has been with me ever since.
He's very nice, Ma.

869
01:46:35,565 --> 01:46:37,693
Very nice?
Are you out of your mind?

870
01:46:38,068 --> 01:46:40,036
He's not staying here another moment!

871
01:46:40,237 --> 01:46:41,363
I'm calling the police right now!

872
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:46,031
Listen to me, Ma! - How dare you
hide that thing here!

873
01:46:46,243 --> 01:46:47,711
He has done us so many favours and

874
01:46:47,911 --> 01:46:48,707
You'll turn him over to the police?

875
01:46:48,912 --> 01:46:51,711
Favours! What favours?
- Take a look at me, Ma! Listen to me!

876
01:46:51,915 --> 01:46:54,043
I'm not looking or
listening to anything!

877
01:46:58,255 --> 01:47:00,553
Mrs Mehra? This is Father Rodericks.

878
01:47:01,091 --> 01:47:05,050
How have you managed this?
Rohit is a changed man.

879
01:47:05,595 --> 01:47:09,725
The whole school is astonished
at his knowledge and intelligence.

880
01:47:12,769 --> 01:47:17,400
And we have decided to
promote Rohit to Class 10.

881
01:47:18,942 --> 01:47:19,738
Are you listening?

882
01:47:22,946 --> 01:47:24,914
What's the matter, Ma?
Who called?

883
01:47:25,448 --> 01:47:26,244
The Principal.

884
01:47:28,118 --> 01:47:32,248
They've promoted you
to Class 10, Rohit.

885
01:47:33,623 --> 01:47:35,591
That's because they don't have a
higher class than the tenth, Ma!

886
01:47:37,961 --> 01:47:40,259
But how did all this...?

887
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:42,098
It's a miracle Jadoo has worked, Ma.

888
01:47:42,299 --> 01:47:44,097
Look, I'm not the same Rohit anymore.

889
01:47:45,468 --> 01:47:47,436
Your glasses"?

890
01:47:48,138 --> 01:47:50,266
I can see everything now, Ma.
And I can understand too.

891
01:47:50,473 --> 01:47:52,771
I have become worldly wise.

892
01:48:59,376 --> 01:49:03,677
From the photographs Inspector Khan
sent us, it is proved...

893
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,507
that they are the footprints
of an alien.

894
01:49:05,715 --> 01:49:07,513
We are here for further research.

895
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:12,010
Which means your hunch
was right, Khan.

896
01:49:14,724 --> 01:49:19,355
Tell me something, doctor.
This creature from another planet...

897
01:49:19,729 --> 01:49:20,696
is it dangerous?

898
01:49:23,066 --> 01:49:27,025
Had it been dangerous, it would
surely have done something by now.

899
01:49:27,404 --> 01:49:30,032
But we haven't received
any such reports.

900
01:49:30,907 --> 01:49:34,537
Couldn't the silence also mean
that it's dead?

901
01:49:34,744 --> 01:49:38,203
Perhaps. But even its dead body
will be very precious to us, sir.

902
01:49:38,581 --> 01:49:42,518
To capture the alien dead or alive,
I'll have to comb the entire area, sir.

903
01:49:43,253 --> 01:49:44,880
I'll need extra forces for that.

904
01:49:50,427 --> 01:49:54,057
Hey Jadoo, how do I look?

905
01:50:16,786 --> 01:50:20,245
Rohit! What's gotten into you?
- I don't talk to kids.

906
01:50:21,624 --> 01:50:23,092
It isn't my age to play
children's games anymore.

907
01:50:24,627 --> 01:50:26,425
It's time for me to sing and dance.
Tell that to everyone.

908
01:50:29,466 --> 01:50:32,766
What? Rohit's turned a hero?
- Yes, didi (sister)

909
01:50:32,969 --> 01:50:36,599
And he says, it's time for him
to sing and dance.

910
01:50:54,991 --> 01:50:57,460
Rohit! What are you doing?
- Practice!

911
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,287
Practice? - Yes, look at them.

912
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,798
I'm a bit raw.
Trying to ripen.

913
01:51:06,002 --> 01:51:09,302
Or else, people will laugh at you.
- Me? Why will they laugh at me?

914
01:51:09,839 --> 01:51:11,136
Because you're my girlfriend.

915
01:51:11,674 --> 01:51:13,642
If I'm raw, won't they laugh at you?

916
01:51:25,188 --> 01:51:27,657
You're participating in the contest?
- Yes.

917
01:51:29,526 --> 01:51:31,824
Listen carefully to what I say, Rohit...
- No.

918
01:51:32,028 --> 01:51:33,496
Instead, watch what
I'm going to show you.

919
01:52:04,394 --> 01:52:07,022
Everyone's laughing at you, Rohit.
Let's go.

920
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:09,858
No way! I'll give it another try.

921
01:52:11,568 --> 01:52:12,194
Move.

922
01:52:17,907 --> 01:52:21,036
Rohit, this is no child's play.
C'mon.

923
01:52:22,412 --> 01:52:23,880
All right. I'm leaving!

924
01:52:25,748 --> 01:52:26,374
One more try.

925
01:53:22,805 --> 01:53:26,264
" Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe..."

926
01:53:26,476 --> 01:53:29,605
“All that happens is part of the game“

927
01:53:44,327 --> 01:53:47,456
“Curtains drop, curtains rise...“

928
01:53:47,664 --> 01:53:50,793
"things which haven't changed,
do change"

929
01:53:51,334 --> 01:53:54,463
"For nothing's raw,
nothing's ripe..."

930
01:53:54,671 --> 01:53:57,971
"all that happens is
pan of the game"

931
01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:41,840
"Why is the grass..."
"always greener on the other side?"

932
01:54:41,951 --> 01:54:49,085
"Why does one not appreciate..."
"what one has?"

933
01:54:49,726 --> 01:54:53,219
"The head always
speaks the truth..."

934
01:54:53,429 --> 01:54:57,366
"but why does one
not hear what the head says?"

935
01:54:58,635 --> 01:55:02,538
"Does not hear, does not hear"

936
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:05,537
" Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe..."

937
01:55:05,742 --> 01:55:09,372
“All that happens
is part of the game“

938
01:55:47,617 --> 01:55:49,085
" Come..."

939
01:55:49,452 --> 01:55:50,749
“Take a look...“

940
01:55:51,287 --> 01:55:54,587
"and give it a thought"

941
01:55:54,791 --> 01:55:56,418
"Think about it..."

942
01:55:56,626 --> 01:56:01,427
"and consider what I say"

943
01:56:02,465 --> 01:56:04,763
"That which appears small,
isn't really small..."

944
01:56:05,968 --> 01:56:11,099
"there's something big about it"

945
01:56:11,274 --> 01:56:13,936
"There is something big about it"

946
01:56:14,777 --> 01:56:17,872
" Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe..."

947
01:56:18,481 --> 01:56:21,781
“All that happens is part of the game“

948
01:56:36,332 --> 01:56:39,461
“Curtains drop, curtains rise...“

949
01:56:39,669 --> 01:56:42,639
"things which haven't changed,
do change"

950
01:56:42,839 --> 01:56:46,639
"For nothing's raw,
nothing's ripe..."

951
01:56:46,843 --> 01:56:50,473
"all that happens is
pan of the game"

952
01:57:46,253 --> 01:57:51,555
Well? Ripened a bit, haven't I?
- You, I...

953
01:57:52,426 --> 01:57:53,052
all this...?

954
01:57:57,431 --> 01:58:00,230
This is only the beginning.
Just wait and watch.

955
01:58:24,146 --> 01:58:25,614
This isn't meant for kids.

956
01:58:26,315 --> 01:58:28,443
If it bursts,
you run out of gas.

957
01:58:29,652 --> 01:58:32,280
We'll see who runs out of gas.
How about a match?

958
01:58:33,656 --> 01:58:36,455
All pepped up? - You'll know
after the match, sonny.

959
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:38,957
Really? So let's have a match.
- What's the bet?

960
01:58:39,996 --> 01:58:40,462
The Hero Cup!

961
01:58:41,163 --> 01:58:44,292
Alongwith the Cup, whoever wins,
gets a kiss from Nisha.

962
01:58:58,514 --> 01:59:00,141
The two of us are playing
a basketball match.

963
01:59:00,349 --> 01:59:02,477
You will kiss the one who wins.

964
01:59:03,519 --> 01:59:04,987
I'm not kissing Raj ever!

965
01:59:06,022 --> 01:59:08,650
You will kiss me, won't you?
- That is, if you win!

966
01:59:09,367 --> 01:59:12,667
You've challenged him without a team
and invited trouble!

967
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:15,339
Now you're going to lose and Raj
is going to give you a thrashing!

968
01:59:16,708 --> 01:59:18,176
Why? You guys are my team.

969
01:59:18,543 --> 01:59:22,343
We? They're so tall,
and we're so shod!

970
01:59:22,547 --> 01:59:24,345
We can't even manage a proper jump.

971
01:59:24,549 --> 01:59:25,015
Look here.

972
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,019
WOW!

973
01:59:33,337 --> 01:59:36,307
Today's match is a
strange one indeed.

974
01:59:38,675 --> 01:59:41,474
have been challenged by
Rohit Mehra's team.

975
01:59:41,678 --> 01:59:43,646
His team is called the Pandavas.

976
01:59:48,352 --> 01:59:49,148
What do I see?

977
01:59:49,353 --> 01:59:51,822
ls this the team of the Pandavas
or is it their children?

978
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:00,186
Don't move, okay?

979
02:00:15,072 --> 02:00:16,699
There goes the referee's whistle
and the match begins.

980
02:00:16,907 --> 02:00:18,807
Ball has been tossed up.

981
02:00:19,009 --> 02:00:22,343
Raj Saxena, taking advantage of his
height, tosses the ball to a team mate.

982
02:00:22,746 --> 02:00:25,909
The Kasauli Tigers pass the ball
to each other, across halfline...

983
02:00:26,116 --> 02:00:29,780
here's another pass,
and another to Raj Saxena...

984
02:00:29,987 --> 02:00:34,288
Raj Saxena advances, but Rohit Mehra,
takes the ball away from Raj Saxena...

985
02:00:34,825 --> 02:00:35,792
maneouvres the ball
from between his legs...

986
02:00:35,993 --> 02:00:40,294
advances towards the D, jumps up and...
it's a basket!

987
02:00:46,770 --> 02:00:49,239
The match gets underway again
with the referee's whistle.

988
02:00:49,607 --> 02:00:53,407
Monty passes the ball to Raj Saxena
who moves forward and this pass...

989
02:00:53,611 --> 02:00:55,739
but Rohit Mehra snatches
the ball midway and...

990
02:00:55,946 --> 02:01:01,749
Moves forward, eavdes,
jumps and basket.

991
02:01:03,954 --> 02:01:06,321
The excitement is mounting,
the applause is getting louder...

992
02:01:06,957 --> 02:01:08,288
and the scoreboard ticks on.

993
02:01:11,795 --> 02:01:14,765
The match begins again. The ball
is with the Kasauli Tigers...

994
02:01:14,965 --> 02:01:17,434
Raj Saxena gets hold
of the ball and...

995
02:01:17,635 --> 02:01:21,367
Rohit Mehra knocks it out the danger area,
passes it to a team member...

996
02:01:21,572 --> 02:01:24,200
he once again takes charge of the ball,
advances towards the basket...

997
02:01:24,408 --> 02:01:28,106
he jumps up and this is
the third basket!

998
02:01:36,887 --> 02:01:38,013
Let's surround Rohit.

999
02:01:41,492 --> 02:01:43,586
The ball is with PCB and
the match begins.

1000
02:01:43,761 --> 02:01:45,229
The ball is with Kasuali Tigers.

1001
02:01:45,429 --> 02:01:48,126
And Rohit Mehra is surrounded by
members of the Kasauli Tigers.

1002
02:01:48,332 --> 02:01:51,734
Jumping over the little boy,
Raj Saxena moves forward...

1003
02:01:51,936 --> 02:01:53,461
and this is a basket!

1004
02:01:53,671 --> 02:01:55,366
This is the first scoring point
from the Kasauli Tigers...

1005
02:01:55,606 --> 02:01:57,870
much to the delight
of their supporters.

1006
02:01:58,442 --> 02:02:01,139
The little boys pass the ball
to one another...

1007
02:02:01,345 --> 02:02:03,473
but Rohit Mehra's still surrounded,
not being able to do much...

1008
02:02:03,681 --> 02:02:04,477
and the kids are utterly helpless.

1009
02:02:04,682 --> 02:02:08,141
The hall's now with Raj Saxena and...
that's a basket!

1010
02:02:09,186 --> 02:02:11,985
Raj Saxena and his team rejoice.
The children are disappointed.

1011
02:02:12,189 --> 02:02:18,151
Rohit Mehra is still surrounded and
the hall's with Raj Saxena...

1012
02:02:18,362 --> 02:02:20,660
and what do I see...?
Rohit Mehra falls to the ground!

1013
02:02:20,864 --> 02:02:23,834
Whether he fell or was made to fall,
Raj Saxena takes advantage and...

1014
02:02:24,034 --> 02:02:25,763
that's a basket!

1015
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:31,932
The children protest. They want a foul
called, but the referee's unmoved.

1016
02:02:32,309 --> 02:02:34,835
The scores are now even.

1017
02:02:35,713 --> 02:02:40,514
The ball is now with the little boys,
with Rohit Mehra...

1018
02:02:40,718 --> 02:02:44,279
he makes a pass which takes the ball
to another member of his team...

1019
02:02:44,488 --> 02:02:45,683
who's trying to jump high...

1020
02:02:45,889 --> 02:02:47,448
surrounded by the tall
Kasauli Tigers players...

1021
02:02:47,658 --> 02:02:50,389
there's little the boys can do.
The ball is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1022
02:02:50,594 --> 02:02:52,756
and here's another basket!

1023
02:02:55,165 --> 02:02:59,363
Why aren't you guys jumping?
- We're trying, but we can't jump.

1024
02:03:01,438 --> 02:03:05,705
The Kasauli Tigers are getting
more and more aggressive...

1025
02:03:05,909 --> 02:03:09,470
and Raj Saxena moves forward
to score another basket!

1026
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:11,778
The score is increasing.

1027
02:03:12,483 --> 02:03:15,475
One basket after another...
and here's another!

1028
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:20,817
Raj Saxena and his players now
seem to be toying with the kids.

1029
02:03:21,025 --> 02:03:23,551
The kids are all jumping around...

1030
02:03:23,761 --> 02:03:26,787
but Raj Saxena is scoring baskets
from where he stands!

1031
02:03:26,997 --> 02:03:30,399
It appears as if it isn't a match,
as if the Pandavas...

1032
02:03:30,601 --> 02:03:31,659
have been invited for
a practise session!

1033
02:03:31,869 --> 02:03:33,803
Here's another basket!

1034
02:03:38,108 --> 02:03:40,406
That whistle signals the half-time.

1035
02:03:44,048 --> 02:03:48,246
Jadoo... what's happening?
Why aren't we being able to jump?

1036
02:03:48,452 --> 02:03:49,419
Sunlight.

1037
02:03:50,454 --> 02:03:50,920
Sunlight?

1038
02:03:56,126 --> 02:03:57,594
Jadoo gets his energy from sunlight.

1039
02:03:58,462 --> 02:04:01,432
Unless he gets sunlight,
he can do nothing.

1040
02:04:04,301 --> 02:04:06,929
You mean, if there is no sunlight,
Jadoo can do nothing?

1041
02:04:07,471 --> 02:04:08,267
So what are we going to do?

1042
02:04:11,642 --> 02:04:14,942
Lord Krishna, please do something.

1043
02:04:18,315 --> 02:04:22,616
With the referee's whistle, play in
the second half has begun again.

1044
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:25,118
The ball's in the air, going once again
to a player of the Kasauli Tigers.

1045
02:04:25,322 --> 02:04:31,455
He moves forward, passes the ball
...once again comes into Raj Saxena.

1046
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:45,470
Kasauli Tigers continue the game
without bothering about Rohit.

1047
02:04:45,676 --> 02:04:46,973
Children's team are making a sincere
effort to give them a competition.

1048
02:04:47,177 --> 02:04:50,203
But they're unable to manage
the tall Players.

1049
02:04:50,414 --> 02:04:52,041
Kasauli Tigers are surging
ahead in the game...

1050
02:04:52,282 --> 02:04:56,150
But Rohit snatches the ball mid-way and
passes it to young team mate.

1051
02:04:56,353 --> 02:05:01,985
This child flies into the air,
passes the ball to another boy...

1052
02:05:02,192 --> 02:05:04,422
One child flies high into the air
and grabs the ball...

1053
02:05:05,395 --> 02:05:07,159
...Is this a twist in the match or
am I getting unwell?

1054
02:05:07,364 --> 02:05:09,492
Whatever happening here is amazing,
ladies & gentleman.

1055
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:11,896
Spectators are stunned.

1056
02:05:14,271 --> 02:05:15,830
Jadoo...Didi... Jadoo!

1057
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:19,600
Match resumes once again and
the ball us with Kasauli Tigers...

1058
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:21,107
Raj Sexena is moving forward
with the ball...

1059
02:05:22,045 --> 02:05:25,276
Three Kids fly high into the air
and pass the ball...

1060
02:05:25,482 --> 02:05:30,545
...to Rohit Mehra who flies high
into the air and baskets it.

1061
02:05:37,194 --> 02:05:39,526
Blessed is the one who sings
glories of the Lord.

1062
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:41,858
Praise the Lord!

1063
02:05:42,399 --> 02:05:46,859
The spectators are ecstatic.
The match moves on.

1064
02:05:47,237 --> 02:05:49,706
The Kasauli Tigers move forward,
passing the ball to each other...

1065
02:05:49,907 --> 02:05:51,375
they are surrounding the opponents...

1066
02:05:51,575 --> 02:05:58,481
but this boy flies ahead, picks up the
ball & passes it to Rohit Mehra...

1067
02:05:58,682 --> 02:05:59,877
and Rohit Mehra scores another basket!

1068
02:06:04,555 --> 02:06:09,391
I'm not having to look down much,
I can see it happening right up here

1069
02:06:09,593 --> 02:06:13,723
The Kasauli Tigers are falling apart
and the children refuse to come down.

1070
02:06:13,931 --> 02:06:17,731
They're scoring the baskets
right up there in the air...

1071
02:06:18,068 --> 02:06:20,901
teasing the grown ups
all the way.

1072
02:06:23,106 --> 02:06:25,734
Match is getting existing. I couldn't
imagine this match would take this cause.

1073
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:41,189
This match sure is
getting exciting.

1074
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:47,328
Looks like the little kids are going
to wear out the Kasauli Tigers.

1075
02:06:47,965 --> 02:06:51,765
Raj Saxena is exhausted and the kids
help themselves to another basket

1076
02:06:52,369 --> 02:06:54,804
They're no kids, they've turned
out to be everyone's fathers.

1077
02:06:55,005 --> 02:06:59,772
They're scoring at will and
the score is way ahead.

1078
02:07:00,978 --> 02:07:02,946
25 seconds to go and we must see
which team clinches the match.

1079
02:07:03,146 --> 02:07:06,116
The scores are 48 and 49 points.

1080
02:07:06,316 --> 02:07:10,048
Now we've to see which
teams wins the hero cup.

1081
02:07:11,788 --> 02:07:14,086
Match resumes and the ball is
once again with the Kasauli Tigers.

1082
02:07:14,291 --> 02:07:17,022
...They're holding the ball firmly &
pressing it cautiously to team-mates.

1083
02:07:17,227 --> 02:07:17,955
..And appear determined... not
let the ball reach the opponent.

1084
02:07:18,328 --> 02:07:22,287
...Ball reaches Raj Saxena an
experienced player.

1085
02:07:22,499 --> 02:07:25,127
...Moving forward he throws
the ball into the basket.

1086
02:07:25,335 --> 02:07:26,962
...But Rohit Mehra once again
gets hold of the ball...

1087
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:30,536
Spectators excitment is running high,
just 10 seconds move to the final whistle.

1088
02:07:40,117 --> 02:07:41,516
Final scores is 50:49.

1089
02:08:05,142 --> 02:08:08,840
I see the Kasauli Tigers,
dejected, heads hanging...

1090
02:08:09,212 --> 02:08:13,513
And the little are moving forward in
glory...to receive the Hero Cup.

1091
02:08:13,784 --> 02:08:17,186
Rohit is being presenting the with
Hero Cup. Give them a big hand.

1092
02:08:18,522 --> 02:08:20,149
Ladies & Gentleman little Pandavas
have won the Hero Cup...

1093
02:08:20,357 --> 02:08:23,554
There's another reward with the Cup.
The Hero Honda motorbike!

1094
02:08:27,831 --> 02:08:30,266
Not time for the kiss yet.
One more victory to achieve.

1095
02:08:32,202 --> 02:08:32,794
Get the Hero his Honda!

1096
02:08:37,641 --> 02:08:40,110
How did the kids start flying?

1097
02:08:41,044 --> 02:08:41,840
Something is surely fishy.

1098
02:08:42,713 --> 02:08:44,203
We must find out from the kids.

1099
02:08:44,881 --> 02:08:47,350
What are you talking about, Harbans?
- It's true.

1100
02:08:47,784 --> 02:08:50,253
My son is the butt of jokes
among his friends.

1101
02:08:53,991 --> 02:08:55,857
And it's all happening
because of your daughter.

1102
02:08:56,226 --> 02:08:59,685
I understand that, Harbans. I did my best
to make Nisha see reason. But...

1103
02:09:02,065 --> 02:09:05,194
Are you telling me that if Nisha
decides to marry Rohit...

1104
02:09:05,569 --> 02:09:10,530
you will give her hand in Rohit's,
despite knowing he's mad?

1105
02:09:11,742 --> 02:09:13,369
Just calling someone mad won't do!

1106
02:09:14,911 --> 02:09:17,710
The word "mad" doesn't make it clear
what kind of a madman someone is...

1107
02:09:17,914 --> 02:09:20,713
and what category of madnes
she belongs to

1108
02:09:20,951 --> 02:09:25,388
For example, schizophrenia is madness.
So are megalomania, obsession...

1109
02:09:25,589 --> 02:09:29,890
psychopathy and mental imbalance.
And there's also plain madness itself

1110
02:09:30,093 --> 02:09:31,561
And madness has no limits.

1111
02:09:31,762 --> 02:09:33,389
Mad, idiot, crazy...
are names for the mad.

1112
02:09:33,597 --> 02:09:34,894
So are crack, cuckoo and dimwit.

1113
02:09:35,098 --> 02:09:39,057
There are people who the world thinks
are mad, but they aren't really mad.

1114
02:09:39,269 --> 02:09:42,728
And there are those whose madness is
not obvious, although they are mad!

1115
02:09:42,939 --> 02:09:45,909
In shod, this is a small
summary on... madness!

1116
02:09:47,848 --> 02:09:51,148
Why have you stood up?
Please remain seated.

1117
02:09:57,023 --> 02:09:59,822
As I was saying, there are
several signs of madness.

1118
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:03,821
To shake your legs in a state of
nervousness is also a sign of madness.

1119
02:10:05,866 --> 02:10:07,994
And you folks think I'm mad!

1120
02:10:10,871 --> 02:10:12,999
That's because I'm madly in love
with your daughter.

1121
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:57,546
"It has indeed happened"

1122
02:10:58,418 --> 02:10:59,214
“Your touch has started it all“

1123
02:11:00,253 --> 02:11:02,722
“I'm slain“

1124
02:11:02,923 --> 02:11:06,223
"What have I done to myself
in a state of ecstasy?"

1125
02:11:29,282 --> 02:11:31,580
"Our pining..."

1126
02:11:31,952 --> 02:11:35,252
"brings about a cloudburst."

1127
02:12:11,848 --> 02:12:15,148
"The touch was but an excuse..."

1128
02:12:15,551 --> 02:12:18,646
" I feel you all over"

1129
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:26,830
"Our love was meant to be eternal..."

1130
02:12:27,363 --> 02:12:30,333
"and today, I've told you"

1131
02:12:35,438 --> 02:12:42,504
"I admire you. I know you
for what you are today"

1132
02:12:42,712 --> 02:12:45,511
You sure have turned out
to be a true lover"

1133
02:12:45,715 --> 02:12:47,513
"My secret...
- I had discovered".

1134
02:12:47,717 --> 02:12:49,344
"Your fair arms...
- Why're you grabbing?"

1135
02:12:49,719 --> 02:12:53,178
"It sends a tremour through my head"

1136
02:12:54,223 --> 02:12:55,019
"It's has indeed happened"

1137
02:12:55,224 --> 02:12:57,022
“Your touch has started it all“

1138
02:12:57,226 --> 02:13:00,355
“I'm slain“

1139
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:04,030
"What have I done to myself?"

1140
02:13:04,233 --> 02:13:11,037
“Our yearning...“.

1141
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:18,374
"makes the cloud shower again"

1142
02:13:51,447 --> 02:13:54,906
"I tried to prevent my head..."

1143
02:13:55,118 --> 02:13:58,577
"it could not be held back.
No, it couldn't"

1144
02:14:03,459 --> 02:14:10,764
"At what you did..."
"it went out to you"

1145
02:14:15,405 --> 02:14:22,277
"I wonder what I did and
what that did to you..."

1146
02:14:22,545 --> 02:14:25,446
"it brings a smile to our face"

1147
02:14:25,648 --> 02:14:27,275
"Through days... - And nights..."

1148
02:14:27,483 --> 02:14:29,451
“Together... - We shall talk of love“

1149
02:14:29,652 --> 02:14:32,952
“We have reined in our love“

1150
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,957
"It has indeed happened"

1151
02:14:35,158 --> 02:14:36,626
“Your touch has started it all“

1152
02:14:37,994 --> 02:14:40,122
"Our pining..."

1153
02:14:40,329 --> 02:14:43,788
"brings about a cloudburst"

1154
02:14:44,834 --> 02:14:45,960
"It has indeed happened"

1155
02:14:46,669 --> 02:14:47,636
“Your touch has started it all“

1156
02:14:47,837 --> 02:14:50,966
“I'm slain“

1157
02:14:51,507 --> 02:14:54,807
"What have I done to myself
in a state of esctacy?"

1158
02:14:55,011 --> 02:14:58,470
"The cloud showers love again"

1159
02:15:16,274 --> 02:15:19,574
Why've you stopped? You were jumping
around so much the other day.

1160
02:15:20,111 --> 02:15:22,079
Jump over us again.

1161
02:15:24,849 --> 02:15:27,580
What are you looking down at?
What's in that bag?

1162
02:15:28,453 --> 02:15:32,083
Run! There's no sunlight!
Jadoo needs to be saved!

1163
02:16:57,208 --> 02:16:59,506
Sir, I've seen it with my own eyes.

1164
02:18:17,288 --> 02:18:18,414
Check what's in the bag.

1165
02:18:37,642 --> 02:18:38,108
Come and take a look.

1166
02:20:30,588 --> 02:20:33,216
Go... go home.

1167
02:20:37,428 --> 02:20:39,055
But how did you escape, Jadoo?

1168
02:20:50,775 --> 02:20:53,904
It was a narrow escape!
- You were amazing, I say.

1169
02:20:59,617 --> 02:21:00,743
What happened?

1170
02:21:01,452 --> 02:21:03,079
ls Jadoo here, Ma ?
- Yes, he's inside.

1171
02:21:08,793 --> 02:21:11,262
Rohit... what happened?

1172
02:21:12,196 --> 02:21:14,096
The way Inspector Khan
was looking at me...

1173
02:21:15,299 --> 02:21:16,767
I'm sure he suspects me.

1174
02:21:18,469 --> 02:21:20,096
We'll have to hide Jadoo
somewhere else.

1175
02:21:20,304 --> 02:21:22,932
Let's hide him in my house.
My parents are away.

1176
02:21:24,308 --> 02:21:27,608
No, my house should be right.
No one will ever imagine...

1177
02:21:27,812 --> 02:21:29,940
that Jadoo could be in District
magistrate's friend's house.

1178
02:21:30,214 --> 02:21:32,444
For how long will you keep
hiding him like this?

1179
02:21:32,683 --> 02:21:34,947
He's bound to be discovered some day.
- No.

1180
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:39,451
I'll take Jadoo away
to some other town.

1181
02:21:40,324 --> 02:21:42,452
Once the police start
looking for him...

1182
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:46,460
you won't be able to hide Jadoo
anywhere in the world.

1183
02:21:46,831 --> 02:21:47,957
So what are we to do, Ma?

1184
02:21:50,034 --> 02:21:53,629
There's only one way of
saving his life, Rohit.

1185
02:21:55,706 --> 02:22:01,475
Send him back to where
he has come from.

1186
02:22:01,679 --> 02:22:04,808
No, Ma! No one can
separate Jadoo from me.

1187
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:08,820
As long as I live, no one can
even touch him.

1188
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:13,321
Rohit, auntie is right.

1189
02:22:14,525 --> 02:22:17,153
You can't take on the world
on your own.

1190
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:24,328
Jadoo will not go.

1191
02:22:33,277 --> 02:22:36,838
Everyone's going to feel sad
at the paﬂing, Jadoo.

1192
02:22:37,048 --> 02:22:41,349
But it's in your interests to return.

1193
02:22:42,553 --> 02:22:48,356
If Jadoo goes...
all powers will also go away.

1194
02:22:54,565 --> 02:22:55,361
What does that mean?

1195
02:23:00,304 --> 02:23:01,362
It means...

1196
02:23:01,572 --> 02:23:08,035
all the powers that he has given me
will go away with him.

1197
02:23:29,934 --> 02:23:31,060
Don't worry about me, Jadoo.

1198
02:23:32,336 --> 02:23:36,239
I'll live the way I used to.

1199
02:23:43,447 --> 02:23:50,911
Go, Rohit. Before it's too late.

1200
02:23:58,696 --> 02:24:00,095
We're going to miss you, Jadoo.

1201
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,377
What's the matter, Rohit?

1202
02:24:15,583 --> 02:24:16,550
There's no response, Ma.

1203
02:24:29,441 --> 02:24:31,409
Hand it over to us.

1204
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:40,749
We have surrounded your house
from all sides.

1205
02:24:44,623 --> 02:24:49,083
Till the count often, if you do not
turn it over to us...

1206
02:24:49,628 --> 02:24:52,097
we'll launch an attack on your house.

1207
02:24:56,301 --> 02:24:57,268
One.

1208
02:24:59,972 --> 02:25:01,098
Two .

1209
02:25:01,974 --> 02:25:03,601
Jadoo, do something!

1210
02:25:05,144 --> 02:25:06,270
Sunlight.

1211
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:07,775
Three.

1212
02:25:11,216 --> 02:25:12,445
Four.

1213
02:25:16,155 --> 02:25:17,122
They're responding, Ma!

1214
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:21,956
Five.

1215
02:25:25,664 --> 02:25:26,460
Six.

1216
02:26:33,523 --> 02:26:37,482
<i>Rah“!</i>

1217
02:26:38,094 --> 02:26:41,997
Rohit, hand it over to us.
- Never!

1218
02:26:42,198 --> 02:26:45,828
Do not compel us! Else, we'll have
to use force against you.

1219
02:26:47,370 --> 02:26:51,000
Do anything you want to!
I'm not handing him over to you!

1220
02:26:51,207 --> 02:26:52,003
Snatch it from him!

1221
02:27:04,976 --> 02:27:06,102
Leave my son alone!

1222
02:27:13,818 --> 02:27:14,614
Leave him.

1223
02:28:58,489 --> 02:29:00,958
Khan speaking.
We shall be there very soon.

1224
02:29:05,730 --> 02:29:10,327
I will not let Jadoo go.
I will not, let Jadoo go.

1225
02:29:13,271 --> 02:29:15,239
Ma, where's Jadoo?

1226
02:29:15,773 --> 02:29:17,571
They've taken him away.

1227
02:29:17,775 --> 02:29:19,402
Where to? - I'll tell you.

1228
02:29:20,278 --> 02:29:21,575
Yes, me.

1229
02:29:22,614 --> 02:29:25,242
I have never seen so much
love for a friend.

1230
02:29:26,117 --> 02:29:28,586
They're taking your friend to Delhi,
and from there to America.

1231
02:29:29,787 --> 02:29:36,420
Rohit, this is the time
to repay Jadods favours.

1232
02:29:36,628 --> 02:29:43,933
Go, save him and prove it that humanity
still exists in the world.

1233
02:29:44,702 --> 02:29:46,170
Go Rohit.

1234
02:32:08,865 --> 02:32:10,162
Hurry up! Follow him!

1235
02:32:26,383 --> 02:32:27,179
YOU people?

1236
02:32:29,386 --> 02:32:30,182
Jadoo?

1237
02:32:36,393 --> 02:32:37,189
Go fast, man.

1238
02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:44,026
C'mon!

1239
02:33:10,927 --> 02:33:13,555
You? Where's Rohit?

1240
02:33:13,763 --> 02:33:17,063
You won't find him.

1241
02:35:26,629 --> 02:35:30,691
Go, Jadoo.
They're waiting for you.

1242
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:00,730
Thank you.

1243
02:37:33,022 --> 02:37:35,821
"Rohit Mehra in police custody"

1244
02:37:38,194 --> 02:37:40,322
“Special Court to deliver verdict
on Rohit Mehra's fate today“

1245
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:51,500
This is Zee news correspondent
reporting from Kasauli...

1246
02:37:51,708 --> 02:37:54,837
where the special court yesterday
acquitted Rohit Mehra...

1247
02:37:55,044 --> 02:37:58,014
on the grounds that
he is mentally abnormal...

1248
02:37:58,214 --> 02:38:02,515
and today, the citizens of Kasauli
are felicitating Rohit Mehra...

1249
02:38:02,885 --> 02:38:06,344
for setting a rare example
of humanity and friendship...

1250
02:38:06,556 --> 02:38:12,154
in helping an alien, whom he considered
his friend, go back to his own world.

1251
02:38:12,395 --> 02:38:15,524
Let's all felicitate Rohit Mehra.

1252
02:38:34,417 --> 02:38:37,546
See, auntie? Rohit said
he'd make it big some day.

1253
02:38:37,754 --> 02:38:39,222
And he's become such a big man today.

1254
02:39:08,467 --> 02:39:10,435
I know what you're thinking about.

1255
02:39:12,471 --> 02:39:14,940
Jadoo has taken away the powers
he had given you.

1256
02:39:17,142 --> 02:39:18,940
Not my love.

1257
02:39:24,883 --> 02:39:26,112
You had become one hell of a hero.

1258
02:39:28,654 --> 02:39:29,780
What are you looking at?

1259
02:39:30,155 --> 02:39:33,614
He's gone, because of whom
you had changed.

1260
02:39:33,826 --> 02:39:35,624
Now kick the ball and show.

1261
02:39:39,498 --> 02:39:40,624
Let's go.

1262
02:39:43,001 --> 02:39:46,130
Yes, yes, take him and make him
wear your bangles.

1263
02:40:02,054 --> 02:40:03,818
Rohit, look! The ball is
flying in the air!

1264
02:40:06,859 --> 02:40:07,826
I can't see.

1265
02:40:18,203 --> 02:40:23,334
Now I can see clearly!

1266
02:40:23,542 --> 02:40:25,510
Looks like Jadoo has given
your powers back to you.

1267
02:40:28,046 --> 02:40:28,672
Look there...

1268
02:40:36,622 --> 02:40:38,317
Thank you, Jadoo.
