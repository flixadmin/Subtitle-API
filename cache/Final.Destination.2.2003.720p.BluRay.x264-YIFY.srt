the one year anniversary</i>

2
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:20,969
since Velez Sir Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,305
shortly after takeoff
from JFK airport.

4
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:25,473
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5

None more so than
Mt. Abraham High School,

6
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:32,480
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,316
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,151
<i>that has turned
this tragic story</i>

9

stranger.</i>

10

<i>The survivors who managed to get
off the plane before it crashed</i>

11

<i>of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.</i>

13
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:50,098
<i>Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,</i>

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,167
<i>but to others,
they're an indication</i>

15

<i>that there are more
sinister events taking place.</i>

Great. Okay.</i>

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,458
<i>I believe that there's
a sort of force,</i>

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,462
<i>an unseen malevolent
presence...</i>

26
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,464
<i>That's all around us
every day.</i>

27

<i>And it determines
when we live and die.</i>

28
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:31,472
<i>And some people call
this force the devil,</i>

29
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:34,142
<i>but I think that
whole religious thing is--</i>

30
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:37,478
<i>so I prefer to call it
death itself.</i>

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,148
<i><font color="#808080">REPORTER :</font>

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,317
<i><font color="#808080">MAN :</font>
Absolutely. Absolutely.</i>

33
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,820
<i>Every day, everywhere,
all the time.</i>

34
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,489
<i>And that's what I want people
to understand--</i>

35
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,491
<i>that death
has this grand design</i>

36
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,660
<i>that we all fit into.</i>

37
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:55,496
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

38
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,665
and took the other
survivors with him,

39
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,268
he basically screwed up
death's plan.

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,104
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

41
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,274
<i><font color="#808080">REPORTER :</font> And the fact that all
of the survivors have died</i>

42
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,410

43
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:13,114
<i><font color="#808080">MAN :</font> Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,</i>

44
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,216

that they died.</i>

45
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,786
<i>I mean, there were
so many weird,</i>

You have a responsibility.

But one night I'm in Paris

884

And then all of a sudden

887

this dude out of nowhere

this news report

902
01:05:08,421 --> 01:05:10,287
about some kid
that committed suicide.

903
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:13,590

904
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,926
"how can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

905

906

And yet...

908
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:30,674
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

909
01:05:32,777 --> 01:05:35,446
Some kids were trying
to steal my mom's car.

910
01:05:35,448 --> 01:05:38,115
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

911
01:05:38,117 --> 01:05:40,184
and they killed her.

gotten off the plane...
