2
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,916
Let go of me!

3
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,625
Let go of me!

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,541
Release me!

5
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,833
Let go of me!

6
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,291
It's confirmed, boss. He's our target.

7
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,083
No…

8
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,833
Ask him to text me
after transferring the money.

9
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,583
Where the hell is that guy?
Why isn't he here yet?

10
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,083
He will get us into trouble.

11
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,625
What happened, boss?

12
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,250
-Boss, my foot!
-Okay, boss.

00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,583
Breaking news for our viewers!

15
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,708
What I'm about to share now
has never happened before in this area.

16
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,666
It's a rampage all around.

17
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,291
A hyena has been spotted here.

18
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,041
Saffron TV will give you
live updates by the minute.

19
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,875
People from the nearby villages
have gathered here.

20
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,875
We have no idea
what the hyena is going to do.

21
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,500
-Tell me, Joshy.
-Sathya, I'm trying to reach Parthiban.

22
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,250
His phone is not reachable. Where is he?

23
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,750
He must have gone
to drop Siddhu off at school.

24
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,541
Try calling Siddhu.
They both must be together.

25
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,958
If you talk to him,
please ask him to call me.

26
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,625
Handle this properly!

27
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,875
Place a barricade there! Hurry up!

28
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,791
-Kumar.
-Sir?

29
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,458
-What's the situation update?
-Sir, the hyena has caused havoc.

30
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,958
Sir, if this continues,

31
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,541
-many people will be injured.
-Is anyone coming?

32
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,916
They've sent two experts
from the Wild Life SOS team.

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,958
They've only handled cheetahs before,
not hyenas.

34
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,833
Nobody knows how to handle it.

35
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,500
Parthiban, we have a situation.
It's an emergency.

36
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,708
Can you come here?

37
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,208
I've sent you the photo
of the footprints. Check that.

38
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,333
The footprints are big.

39
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,583
It could be a spotted hyena.
They are extremely ferocious.

40
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,708
Okay. How soon can you get here?

41
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,375
Run!

42
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,083
Help!

43
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,791
Promise me, you won't tell your mom
that you were late for school today.

44
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,000
You promise me you won't tell mom

45
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,000
that I took my phone to school today.

46
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,750
Please, Dad!

47
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,333
The situation is totally
out of control, Parthiban.

48
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,458
Hyenas are social animals, Joshy.

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,166
They live in packs.

50
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,125
If a hyena is alone here,
either it has lost its way

51
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,833
or the rest of its clan is dead.
People will fear it and try to kill it.

52
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,375
But we have to capture it alive.

53
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,500
If we follow your advice,
we will become its prey.

54
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,083
Then how should we capture it?

55
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,291
The walkie-talkie, please.

56
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,708
Hey, Channel 3. We are on Channel 3.

57
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,875
Dad, I'll come along. I'll be helpful.

58
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,333
Stay in the car.

59
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,375
That'd be the most helpful
thing for me.

60
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,833
I am not in the mood
to get chided by your mom.

61
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,083
Okay?

62
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,000
Put up the barricades!

63
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,625
Push it here, quickly. Hurry up. Come on.

64
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,958
-Why did you place the barricades?
-The DFO's orders, sir.

65
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,500
What are you looking at? Do it now!

66
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,666
Sir, why did you place
the barricades here?

67
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,583
The animal could barge into the school.
It's very risky.

68
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,541
-Please--
-Ranger, do one thing.

69
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,166
I'll give you my uniform.
Do my job as well.

70
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,458
-Hey! What are you guys doing?
-Idiot!

71
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,375
-Place the barricade properly!
-Come in, Parthiban.

72
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,041
-Yeah, Joshy.
-They can't do a thing.

73
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,791
We'll have to handle the situation.

74
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,958
Get a tranquilizer from the sanctuary.

75
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,750
I'll tell you when to fire
and from where.

76
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,875
Yes, okay.

77
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,458
Catch it!

78
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,291
It's scared. It's looking
for a place to hide.

79
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,750
They don't understand it.
They are trying to kill it.

80
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,625
If this continues,
the hyena will enter the school.

81
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,375
Bring the tranquilizer
to the west end of the school.

82
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,875
Help!

83
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,333
Help…

84
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,750
Kids, get inside!

85
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,916
No one should be outside! Go!

86
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,791
I said get inside!

87
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,958
Students,
go to your classrooms immediately.

88
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,791
It's an emergency! Teachers and staff!

89
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,791
Please take all the kids
safely to the classroom.

90
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,291
There is no time! Hurry up!

91
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,000
-Get in!
-Hurry up!

92
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:18,958
Get in!

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,916
I got permission for a tranquilizer gun.
I'm taking it.

94
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,708
Run!

95
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,375
Move!

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,125
Come in, Parthiban.

97
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,375
I'm in position.

98
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,333
Joshy, wait!

99
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,166
Don't aim at its neck
like we usually do.

100
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,916
Its striking force will be as heavy
as its pitch of laughter.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,041
Aim for the lungs!

102
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,666
Shoot.

103
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,500
-Hang on.
-This is the perfect time. Shoot, Joshy.

104
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,916
The gun is jammed, Parthiban.

105
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,125
A gun can't adapt
to the situation and operate.

106
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,750
It's a machine.
You need to service it every month.

107
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,875
-Siddhu?
-Dad.

108
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,000
Get your spear.

109
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,666
-Give your shoelace to Joshy.
-Okay, Dad.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,916
-Don't go out!
-Run!

111
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,500
Watch out!

112
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,666
You heard your dad, right?

113
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,916
Give me your shoelaces.

114
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,666
-Uncle, give the javelin to me.
-Why?

115
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,666
-Get inside!
-Let's go!

116
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,708
Parthiban, the spear
you asked for is ready.

117
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,708
-Tell my dad that I'm throwing it.
-Parthiban, here it comes!

118
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,625
Hey, come on, move!

119
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,333
-Move.
-Move!

120
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,875
Who is that man?

121
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,250
His name is Parthiban.

122
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,791
He's from Chennai.

123
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,458
He's an animal rescuer.

124
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,583
He runs a coffee shop nearby.

125
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:02,916
-Hey!
-Move!

126
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,458
-Go inside.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,833
All right…

128
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,375
-Come on, move!
-Let's go.

129
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,708
-Move!
-Quiet!

130
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,291
Ask the questions in order.
The DFO will answer you.

131
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,333
Look, whatever happened
is not out of the ordinary.

132
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,791
It is our daily job.

133
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,708
Animals migrate
in search of food and water…

134
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,333
The DFO will give us some
exclusive news. Come on.

135
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:28,125
There's no point in asking them anything.
They didn't do anything.

136
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,541
A middle-aged man in a white shirt.

137
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
Find him. You'll get
the real information from him.

138
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,041
That'd be exclusive.

139
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,583
-White shirt, middle-aged man?
-Yes.

140
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,375
Where do I find him in this crowd?

141
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,083
Thalapathy

142
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,333
His entry spells power

143
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,000
Who is our brother? Thalapathy!

144
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,708
You wanted a shirt urgently.

145
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,375
-What happened, sir?
-Get it stitched.

146
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,833
-What's this? There is blood on it!
-Stitch it.

147
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,041
My life is in this town

148
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,458
And I ain't going down

149
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,208
You think that I'm crazy

150
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,333
But I don't want the crown

151
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,708
My life is in this town

152
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,375
And I ain't going down

153
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,791
You think that I'm crazy

154
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,750
But I don't want the crown

155
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,208
I'm just an ordinary person

156
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,375
Yeah!

157
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,458
I'm just a peace-loving soul

158
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,833
I'm just an ordinary person

159
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:56,958
Yeah!

160
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,958
I'm just a peace-loving soul

161
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,208
Hi, Chief.

162
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,041
-Morning.
-Morning, sir.

163
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,833
…is in this town

164
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,875
Hi, Thalapathy!

165
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,541
My life is in this town

166
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,375
And I ain't going down…

167
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,458
Why is this not heating up?

168
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,458
Some problem with the thermostat, sir.
I've called the service team.

169
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,250
They'll be here today.

170
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,000
-The cakes are ready for delivery.
-Okay.

171
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,208
Should I ship them?

172
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,958
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

173
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,791
Just an ordinary person

174
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,166
Yeah!

175
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,041
I'm just a peace-loving soul

176
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,083
I'm just an ordinary person

177
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,125
Yeah, I'm just a…

178
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,291
Sir, this shirt is ripped badly.
It can't be stitched.

179
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,916
Do you know which shop
my wife bought this from?

180
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
-I don't know.
-I'm in trouble.

181
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,166
Hey, what's going on?
How did the police get our photos?

182
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,333
They're looking for us
at every checkpoint.

183
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,583
The man who told us to kill
the collector betrayed us.

184
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,583
He's the one
who leaked our photos.

185
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,750
Don't go out for a week. Hide yourself.

186
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,000
Please don't get caught.
I'll do something. Stay hidden.

187
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,750
Hey, we have no money!
We have to get out of here!

188
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,458
We have no clue where we are
and what is happening.

189
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,791
We trusted you and came here,
and you're bossing us around?!

190
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,750
We can't go anywhere
without money.

191
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,750
Do something, and send us money!

192
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,416
Please understand the situation.

193
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,083
The police have become alert
because of the collector's death.

194
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,083
It'll take a week to get
the situation under control.

195
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,416
-Don't try to contact me until then.
-Hey!

196
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,500
You--

197
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,291
What are you looking at?
Eyes on the road!

198
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,125
-What happened, boss?
-What should I do with them?

199
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
In the early hours of yesterday morning,

200
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,708
some unknown men who broke
into the collector's guesthouse

201
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,375
-and throat-slit and brutally murdered…
-You didn't get ready yet?

202
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,916
Oh, you're mad about the shirt.

203
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,166
I-I spilled chocolate on it,
so I decided to wash it and changed…

204
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,333
I bought you that shirt,
especially, for our anniversary.

205
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,750
But you ruined that shirt
as well as my mood.

206
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,083
I have nothing to say to you now.

207
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,583
Now, my mood is not going to change

208
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,125
no matter what you do.

209
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,833
But the plan won't change.

210
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,166
I can also be mad.

211
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,458
Your breaths and my breaths

212
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:16,000
Are entangled now

213
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,583
I see you everywhere

214
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,750
This is your magic

215
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:33,166
Small moments of excitement

216
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,916
Shall we pick up the kids from school?

217
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,416
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

218
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,625
-Yes.
-Hi.

219
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,666
Yes, tell me.

220
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,583
Chintu-- No.

221
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,875
M-Mathi's mother is not well.

222
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,708
Siddharth's father is not well.

223
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,166
Her mom is missing her.

224
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,208
-Who are you?
-His mom.

225
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,416
Her dad.

226
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,958
My soul and your body

227
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,875
I see you everywhere…

228
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,583
-A small peg?
-No, I don't drink.

229
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,916
-Think of it as medicine.
-Really?

230
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,250
How do you drink this, sir?

231
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,083
Stay away from the cage.

232
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,333
We will be adopting this hyena.

233
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,208
What should we name it?

234
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,375
Elsa.

235
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,375
Ghost.

236
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,041
Hachiku.

237
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,083
I also have a name in mind,
but promise me you won't laugh.

238
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,291
How about "Chakadbangadu"?

239
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:06,000
You are my first wish

240
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,333
Look ahead!

241
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,166
DONATION BOX

242
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,541
You are with me at every step

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
You are unique

244
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,666
Don't be scared.

245
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,666
-Chintu, come here.
-No.

246
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,291
-Come on, it's okay.
-Okay, go.

247
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,333
Slowly.

248
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,666
Come from this side. Don't be scared.

249
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,500
Do you like him?

250
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:43,125
You are with me at every step
My heart is flying high like a kite

251
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,416
Open it quickly.

252
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,916
-Sir, you're not supposed to help.
-Please wait.

253
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,250
Go! Hurry!

254
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,750
Sir, no.

255
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,250
-Is the shop on the left or right?
-It's over there, boss.

256
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,833
How much is it?

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,250
Your shop is pretty empty.
When do customers usually come?

258
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,666
After 6:00 p.m.

259
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,541
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, sir.

260
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,666
I checked everything.

261
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,416
All of their chests are empty.
What do we do now?

262
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,250
We'll wait here until nightfall.

263
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,625
What? You want to cut my hair?

264
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,375
This idiot will be the death of me.

265
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,458
Everyone on the road was panic-stricken
and running around.

266
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,916
That's when the serial killer
stood in the middle of the road

267
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,708
and started shooting at everyone.

268
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,625
There was a pile of corpses
on the road.

269
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,833
He was notorious.
He was killing everyone.

270
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:41,083
At that time, a brave and bold
police officer got there

271
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,833
and fired at the serial killer.

272
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,583
The serial killer ran and hid somewhere.

273
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,958
When the police officer
was reloading his gun,

274
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,708
the serial killer fired at him.

275
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,708
Hey!

276
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:57,666
Then the wounded police officer
fell at your feet.

277
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:01,875
He fell at the place where
you were safely hiding behind the car.

278
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:06,708
Now, the police officer's gun
is in your hand

279
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,083
and you have a clean shot.

280
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,833
The serial killer doesn't know
that you are there,

281
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,625
but you can easily shoot him
from your position.

282
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,041
We only got Rs. 300.

283
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,625
And this phone.

284
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,875
Hey, go and find someone rich!

285
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,125
And you have an easy way out.

286
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,458
You can quietly escape from there.

287
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,750
What will you do then? Picture yourself.

288
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,750
I'll just sleep.

289
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,083
Oh! You'll sleep, I see!

290
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,833
-Siddhu, it's getting late. Go to bed.
-Wait, Mom. Just a few more minutes.

291
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,708
I'll take the easy way out
and bring in more police officers.

292
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,875
By then, the serial killer
will kill more innocent people.

293
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,916
I'll give the gun to the police officer

294
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,250
and say,
"Look, here's a clear shot. Fire."

295
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,333
The police officer is shit-scared.
How can he shoot?

296
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,416
Picture yourself.

297
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,750
Let go of me!

298
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,083
-Hey, what is the number?
-Help me!

299
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,250
She's a nuisance!

300
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,333
-Hello? Wait.
-Where are you, dear?

301
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,625
-Here.
-Hey.

302
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,125
Hey, tell us your ATM PIN,
or I'll kill you!

303
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,291
-Tell me.
-Why are the police here?

304
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,541
Hey, stop screaming!

305
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,458
No… please don't.

306
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:56,041
-I can't move. Help me.
-Tell us your ATM PIN.

307
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,750
-Your PIN.
-Let me go.

308
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,666
-The PIN.
-Please let me go! No!

309
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,583
Let me go! Don't do this!

310
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,500
Tell me the PIN.

311
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,875
Then I'll shoot him myself.

312
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:21,000
If you shoot him,
you'll also labeled a murderer.

313
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,541
It is against the law.

314
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,083
There is one more way.
Picture yourself.

315
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:29,958
Why did you shoot him?

316
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,333
Where did you get this gun?

317
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,916
-PIN!
-What?

318
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
PIN!

319
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,291
I don't know what else to do, Dad.

320
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,291
No matter what I do,
someone will be killed.

321
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,791
Either an innocent or a criminal.
So, it'd better be the criminal.

322
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Siddhu, go. Go and sleep.
It's getting late.

323
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,083
Chintu, come.

324
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:36,958
Dad!

325
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,333
Dad!

326
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,958
The only option is to shoot him.

327
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,666
Who are you talking about?

328
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,791
The killer in the Picture Yourself story.

329
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,541
He's still thinking about that.

330
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,375
As I told you, if you shoot,
you'll be labeled a murderer.

331
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,625
You'll end up in jail. You won't even
get sleep. Are you okay with that?

332
00:26:55,708 --> 00:27:00,000
I won't be sent to jail. After all,
I will have saved innocent people.

333
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,916
If I'm lucky, I'll get a medal.

334
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,125
Ain't I smart?

335
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,416
Get in the car.

336
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,791
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

337
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,166
What time is the wedding?

338
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,083
We'll go there
after dropping Chintu off at school.

339
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,000
He couldn't even think
of the right answer.

340
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,000
And he's thinking
of becoming a writer!

341
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,583
Both of you, please sign here.

342
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,083
Congrats.

343
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,125
Are you guys witnesses?
Please come and sign this.

344
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:29,708
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

345
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,708
See you later.

346
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,083
-Bye.
-Bye.

347
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,541
Hey, you can touch her
only after I say so. I'm kidding.

348
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,500
-Take good care of her.
-Yeah.

349
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,750
-Bye.
-Bye.

350
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,166
Where should I drop you off, ma'am?

351
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,125
I have some work in the record room.
So, I'll stay back.

352
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,250
Do you want to say anything?

353
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,333
Stop telling my kids
such rubbish stories!

354
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,500
-Why? What happened?
-Give me your phone.

355
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,083
Check the browser history.

356
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,166
Browser history? Mine or his?

357
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,500
-His, of course.
-Oh!

358
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,500
"How to hunt? How to kill a deer?

359
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,083
How to kill a hyena?

360
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,750
-How to get successful in life--"
-Is this a joke?

361
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,541
No, I'm just reading it.

362
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,708
Who taught him all this?
You, right?

363
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,083
Okay, I'll ensure
this doesn't happen again.

364
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,458
-You'd better!
-Okay.

365
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,083
Great horned owl, Joshy.

366
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:38,375
They're becoming extinct.

367
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,958
Where did you find this?

368
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,000
Sir, this owl is from Australia.
I know everything.

369
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,333
-He's lying, sir.
-I'll slap you!

370
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,708
Since when have you been doing this?
How many more of them do you have?

371
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:53,416
Just this one, sir.
I hit it with my slingshot.

372
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,458
It fell unconscious with a thud.

373
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,916
Joshy, inform Blue Cross.
It needs immediate treatment.

374
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,541
Ask our veterinary doctor
to come here right away.

375
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,541
He's no more.

376
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,583
-What?!
-Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

377
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,958
He died on the spot
in a car accident last night.

378
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,000
I think he lost control,
and his car fell into the valley.

379
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,208
Yeah?

380
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,708
What?

381
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,416
Okay, I'll be there. Yeah.

382
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,875
It was not a car accident.

383
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,958
It was a planned murder.

384
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,583
Murder? How come?

385
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,541
He was shot dead.
I just got the intel.

386
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,833
A murder in our town?!

387
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,416
Last week, when the collector died,

388
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,791
I thought it was a hit-and-run case.

389
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:48,250
But now, after the doctor's death,
I don't think it's a coincidence.

390
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,291
I don't get it, Joshy.

391
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,791
I've lived here
for the past 20 years.

392
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,833
I've never heard of anything like this.

393
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,375
Who could be openly
roaming around with a gun?

394
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,375
Parthiban, don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

395
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,666
I'll go and check.

396
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,208
Shall I come with you?

397
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:23,291
Last week, when the collector died,
I thought it was a hit-and-run case

398
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:26,958
But now, after the doctor's death,
I don't think it's a coincidence.

399
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,041
Dad, it's your turn.

400
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,791
Dad!

401
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,458
-Your turn.
-Okay.

402
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,041
Sir, I'm done for the day.
May I leave now?

403
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,750
Oh, stop teasing me!
I'm going to the hostel!

404
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,458
Go. He must be waiting for you.

405
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,000
My song is much better than yours.

406
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,041
I know a better song than this.

407
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,916
Do you want to listen to it?

408
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,708
First, look there.

409
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,208
The shop is closed, sir.

410
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,583
I want a chocolate coffee.

411
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,333
We're closed, sir.
Didn't you see the sign outside?

412
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,041
Make that two.

413
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,583
-The shop is closed, sir.
-Three.

414
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Sir!

415
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,333
I've cleaned up everything.

416
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:59,541
Can I come an hour late tomorrow?
I need to go to the temple.

417
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,625
The shop is closed, sir.

418
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:03,583
Shruthi, leave now. Hurry up.

419
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,083
I'm talking to you.
Can't you hear me?

420
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:09,125
-I just--
-Shruthi, go. I'll tell him.

421
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,000
Hey, what are you doing?

422
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,625
Sir!

423
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:16,875
Sir!

424
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,125
Sir, calm down.

425
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,458
I'll get it.

426
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,833
Hey, he took the gun again!
Go and stop him!

427
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,041
Let go of me!

428
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,333
Sir…

429
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,125
I've brought all the cash I've got here.

430
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,583
If you want more,
I'll withdraw it and give you.

431
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,000
Let her go, please.

432
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:52,500
This is wrong.

433
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,041
Let her go. Please. I'm begging you.

434
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,791
Chocolate coffee.

435
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,625
Let me go.

436
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,250
Stay right here.

437
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:12,291
-Don't come out until I tell you to, okay?
-Sir!

438
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,916
Let go of me! Sir!

439
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,375
Boss, he is inside.

440
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,333
Go and close the gate!

441
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,083
Sir!

442
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,166
Save me, sir!

443
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,708
-Sir!
-Hey!

444
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,041
Did you forget what I told you?

445
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Let go of me!

446
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,083
Sir!

447
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,208
Save me, sir!

448
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,000
Hey, our job is done. Let's go.

449
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,250
Hey!

450
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,791
-Come with me, or just die!
-Let go of me.

451
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,875
All three of them and the CCTVs here

452
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,541
have seen our faces.

453
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:10,208
If we don't want our faces
to be on the news tomorrow,

454
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,500
we have to finish them.

455
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,708
Let's have chocolate coffee. Sit.

456
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,583
Good boy!

457
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,250
Sir!

458
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,166
Hey, delete the CCTV footage.

459
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,250
Sir, save me!

460
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,125
Sir--

461
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,416
Sir!

462
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,708
Sir!

463
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,333
Help!

464
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,250
Help me!

465
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:14,666
Sir!

466
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,666
Save--

467
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:21,750
Hey!

468
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,958
Hey! Let go of him!

469
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,166
Sir!

470
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,541
Hey, hit him, not me!

471
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,583
Sir!

472
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,125
Hey!

473
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,041
Dad!

474
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,916
-Dad!
-Shruthi! Chintu!

475
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,750
Got your chocolate coffee?

476
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,208
-Dad!
-It's okay.

477
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,416
Sir!

478
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,500
Hey! Let go of him!

479
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,125
Or I'll stab her!

480
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:34,875
Sir!

481
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,875
Sir!

482
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,041
-Save me!
-Kill him.

483
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,666
Where are you going? Kill him!

484
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,208
Dad!

485
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,541
Dad!

486
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:24,833
Chintu!

487
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,708
Dad!

488
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,041
Dad!

489
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:48,375
Parthiban!

490
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,333
Parthiban.

491
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,583
Go to the hospital first.

492
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:14,666
It doesn't look like a clot.
No physical injuries.

493
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:18,041
But she is showing signs of PTSD.

494
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,375
This child is in shock.
She is bound to feel anxious.

495
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,958
But there's nothing to worry about.

496
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,500
I'll give her some medicine.

497
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,708
Take good care of her, okay?

498
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,041
Okay.

499
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,541
Parthiban.

500
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,875
Parthiban, whatever happened
was not your mistake.

501
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:39,125
Anyone in your place
would've done the same.

502
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,541
We will fight in the court.

503
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,375
I'll always be with you.

504
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,541
I'll take care of the children
until you get released.

505
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:53,333
-Don't worry. I'll handle--
-Sathya, I don't know what happened.

506
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,541
I saw him going…

507
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,250
toward Chintu.

508
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,666
And then…

509
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,125
all this happened.

510
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,333
-Sir, we can't wait any longer.
-May I go in?

511
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,625
Parthiban, the police officers
are waiting outside.

512
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,875
I've asked them to wait for some time.

513
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:22,500
-Joshy, is there no other way--
-Sathya, try to understand.

514
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,916
This is very serious.

515
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,291
Five people have been killed.

516
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,833
Even I can't do anything.

517
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,041
He'll remanded for 15 days.
We have to follow procedures.

518
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,083
We'll decide what to do
after he's produced in the court.

519
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,625
Don't panic, okay?

520
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:43,250
Parthiban, let's go.

521
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:57,875
Your honor, according
to the ballistic reports,

522
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,791
five bullets fired from the gun

523
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,458
penetrated the victims' foreheads
at point-blank range.

524
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:05,166
Not a single bullet was missed.

525
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,291
A person who has never handled
a gun before was able to fire

526
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,166
five bullets in a split second. How?

527
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,375
Sometimes, even trained police officers
struggle to shoot below the knee.

528
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,083
But this person's aim
was absolutely perfect.

529
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,333
Inspector Bhawar Jetha.

530
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,041
Compare Mr. Parthiban's shooting skills

531
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:28,083
with that of a few ordinary men.

532
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,708
And submit the court proper proof
backed with adequate explanation.

533
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,666
-Nazrat!
-Yes?

534
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:39,083
Go and stand over there.

535
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,500
-Hey, leave it!
-Shahid.

536
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:45,375
Sashikanth.

537
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,541
What are you doing?

538
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:50,791
Parthiban!

539
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,750
Parthiban!

540
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:56,875
Step forward.

541
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,541
-Kumar.
-Sir?

542
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,250
Give him the nine-mm rifle.

543
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:23,416
Only after I send

544
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:27,291
the man who killed my husband
and younger brother…

545
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,083
to his grave along with his family

546
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,625
will I allow the funeral rites
of my husband to be performed.

547
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,291
I take this vow!

548
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,166
This is my promise to both of them!

549
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:50,541
Don't cry. It's okay.

550
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,500
Parthiban, here!

551
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:59,333
Your action was just a general exception.
Don't worry.

552
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,750
Parthiban, the ones you killed
weren't good people.

553
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,958
They were all gangsters.
It will come under self-defense.

554
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,500
Okay? Don't worry!

555
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,625
We'll handle it. Okay?

556
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,541
Take care of Chintu.

557
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,375
Your Honor, a few days ago,
when a spotted hyena

558
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:18,833
strayed into our town,
everyone wanted to kill it,

559
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,333
but my client risked his life

560
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,916
and saved the hyena
from the people's attack.

561
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,333
I only have one question.

562
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,708
How can a man who even loves
wild animals so much

563
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,666
kill those five men?

564
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,625
He killed those ruthless men
in an act of self-defense

565
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,791
to save his employee,
his daughter, and himself.

566
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:38,500
Your Honor, I request the court
to release my client

567
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,750
under the IPC
Right of Private Defense Act.

568
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,250
Bearing in mind the interrogation,

569
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:51,541
arguments, and statements debated here,

570
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:55,375
the court pronounces
Mr. Parthiban innocent

571
00:47:55,916 --> 00:48:00,750
as per the IPC Section 103 and 106.

572
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:07,208
He has been acquitted
of all charges and honored.

573
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Also, I propose
the Indian government to award

574
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:15,083
Mr. Parthiban with
the National Bravery Award for this year.

575
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:19,291
Parthiban,
walk free with your head held high.

576
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:35,541
-Move!
-Move!

577
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:38,000
-Sir…
-Please move!

578
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,916
Get out of the way!
All of you, step back!

579
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,875
-Is the decision to acquit you right?
-Move.

580
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,958
-Why did you have to kill five people?
-Move!

581
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,500
-Make way!
-Move!

582
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:53,458
Step back! Move!

583
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,500
Give me that.

584
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:58,291
-Get in.
-What are you doing? Step back!

585
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,333
Move!

586
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,083
Get out of the way!

587
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:04,250
-Sir!
-Sir!

588
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,333
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

589
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,791
Dad.

590
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,875
-Yes?
-You were right, Dad.

591
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,666
Even if we have a gun in our hands,
we shouldn't shoot.

592
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,541
That isn't so easy.

593
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,791
Now, I understood everything.

594
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:36,333
Dad, I can't see you
disheartened like this.

595
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:46,000
Those dead men have
many cases filed against them.

596
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,791
They were dangerous.

597
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:50,958
They must have acquaintances.
Do you think they'll keep quiet?

598
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,958
Just to be safe,
be careful, Sathya.

599
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:03,416
MUMBAI

600
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,916
SALEM

601
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,291
PEOPLE'S HERO FREED
OF THE MURDER CHARGES

602
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,083
SHIMLA

603
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,916
D'Souza, here you go!

604
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,750
THE CITY HERO
KILLS THE THUGS IN HIS CAFE

605
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,041
TELANGANA

606
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,625
I can't forget everything

607
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:49,208
and start working
at the coffee shop like before, Sathya.

608
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:56,583
I'm unable to focus.

609
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm scared of the voices

610
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,916
Of the click, of the beat

611
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:03,333
Of the music I've been hearing all night

612
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:05,041
Pause, play, repeat!

613
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,041
I'm scared of the mountain

614
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,041
Of the river, of the fire

615
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:13,291
Of the sound of lightening in the sky
Those sounds make me wanna cry

616
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,500
-This light above me
-I'm shit-scared of that

617
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,625
-Those colors
-I'm shit-scared of that

618
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,500
-These speakers
-I'm shit-scared of that

619
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,541
-Those woofers
-I'm shit-scared of that

620
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,666
-Bad trip
-I'm shit-scared of that

621
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,958
-Those chills
-I'm shit-scared of that

622
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,041
Shit-scared of A, shit-scared of B

623
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,041
Okay, I'm gonna pee

624
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:48,291
I'm scared of the night
I'm scared of the day

625
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,333
I'm scared of my shadow
Get it out of my way

626
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,416
I'm scared of my past
I'm scared of my future

627
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,458
I'm scared of the present
Can't take this torture

628
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:56,791
-Dad!
-I'm feeling cold, I'm feeling hot

629
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,833
Just living in a fear of getting caught

630
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,916
I'm scared of the creepy
I'm scared of the crawly

631
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,916
And I swear, I'm not on molly

632
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
This light above me

633
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:05,916
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Those colors

634
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,958
-I'm shit-scared of that
-These speakers

635
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,041
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Those woofers

636
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,000
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Bad trip

637
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,041
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Those chills

638
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,583
I'm shit-scared of that

639
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,916
Shit-scared of A, shit-scared of B…

640
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,541
I had kept it somewhere here.

641
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,750
Where is it?

642
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:29,791
What are you looking for?
You won't find anything there.

643
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,791
There is nothing left in the house.

644
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,958
How long are you going to sit at home?

645
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,500
The cafe has been closed for ten days.

646
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,125
You aren't even dropping off
your daughter at school.

647
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:44,833
Just look at their faces.

648
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,708
The court has declared you innocent.

649
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,416
Then why are you living
the life of a criminal?

650
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:56,083
You've not only locked yourself
inside the house but also your family.

651
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:58,833
Go get some fresh air.

652
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,833
I'll take care of the house.
Take the kids with you.

653
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:05,916
Go!

654
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,416
I feel like drinking coffee.

655
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:27,083
I'm going out to buy some milk.

656
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,541
Do any of you want anything?

657
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,625
-Greetings, sir.
-Hello, sir.

658
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,916
-Hi, sir.
-Greetings.

659
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,208
He is the real man.

660
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,041
Parthiban, I need to go to that shop.

661
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,125
You two come with me. Let's go.

662
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:08,333
Buy whatever you want. Come, Siddhu.

663
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:09,625
-Take care.
-Okay, Dad.

664
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,458
Mom, I want a bread omelet.

665
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,583
Okay, let's go eat.

666
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,458
-One bread omelet, please.
-Okay, ma'am.

667
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,708
-Eat it. I'll be right back.
-Okay, Mom.

668
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,750
-Hello.
-Sir, this is Kumar.

669
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:27,708
-I've got an intel.
-Okay.

670
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,458
There's some
suspicious activity in town.

671
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:33,416
The undercover source has informed us
that Parthiban's family is in danger.

672
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,458
We got this intel two weeks back,
but the inspector hid it.

673
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:40,083
-We have to stop them from going out.
-Yeah, okay. I'll call you back.

674
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:45,375
Parthiban, where are you?

675
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:49,166
-I'm in the market.
-Do you see anything suspicious around?

676
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,083
Parthiban?

677
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,458
-What's wrong?
-Listen, I've got intel

678
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,000
that some goons are after you.

679
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:04,166
Do me a favor. Drop whatever
you're doing, and just go home.

680
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,333
Immediately!

681
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:24,458
Hey, only after I kill you and your family

682
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:26,500
will I bury my brother-in-law.

683
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:27,916
Finish him!

684
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:21,250
-Hey!
-Parthiban!

685
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,416
Hey!

686
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,000
Sathya, go!

687
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,583
How dare you lay
your dirty hands on my family!

688
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,083
Dad!

689
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,666
Parthiban, don't! Listen to me!

690
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:27,500
Parthiban!

691
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,708
Parthiban, what are you doing?

692
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:40,541
-Let go of me!
-No! Parthiban!

693
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:57,250
Parthiban, what are you doing?
Let him go!

694
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,166
If I let him go, he will kill us!

695
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:31,208
Parthi, I'm scared to see you
sitting here like this.

696
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,250
Let's come back
after the inspector summons us.

697
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,791
Let's go home now, please.

698
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:37,875
I'm not going anywhere.

699
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,375
-Kumar!
-Sir!

700
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:42,375
Why is it so crowded outside?
Is it a fish market?

701
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,583
-Parthi, let's go.
-Go and see.

702
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:46,875
What are our men doing outside?

703
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,125
What is it? I'd asked you to file
a complaint and leave, right?

704
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:51,791
Why do you insist on staying?

705
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,500
Don't we have any other damn work?

706
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,333
Go and tell him everything.
He'll note it down.

707
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,583
Just sign that and leave, got it?

708
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:00,958
I'll see what I can do.

709
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,666
Hey! Send my tea inside!

710
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,708
Where are you going?

711
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:12,041
What will you see? How we die?

712
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:16,833
When we step out of the house,
we're scared of who might attack us.

713
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,708
Why are you getting worked up?

714
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:24,541
Two weeks ago,
one of the corpses from the shoot-out

715
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,500
went missing from the mortuary.

716
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:30,000
The department asked you to alert us.

717
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,833
Why didn't you do that?

718
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:34,958
Who told you all this? The forest officer?

719
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:38,958
Do you expect us to think
about you 24-7 and serve only you?

720
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:41,083
-Don't we have other work?
-Just wait.

721
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:43,500
In all fairness,
I did what you should've done.

722
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:46,125
I killed those
who tried to kill my daughter.

723
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,333
What did I do wrong?

724
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:51,000
Let's go home, please.

725
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,666
I want an armed guard

726
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,916
posted at my house 24-7.

727
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,333
I won't leave until then.

728
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,000
Hey! Get up!

729
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,208
I said get up!

730
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,750
-Get up! Get lost!
-Please. Let's go.

731
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,000
Do you think
you are a big shot?

732
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:07,916
Get out!

733
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:09,541
Out!

734
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,166
He wants an armed policeman, it seems!

735
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:20,125
You can't just order us around
and get an armed cop at your disposal.

736
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:23,666
The government will decide
whether to give you security or not.

737
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,291
You are neither the law…

738
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:27,875
nor the government.

739
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,125
You are just a common man
who sells bread and butter!

740
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,416
Come in. We were waiting for you.

741
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:39,041
He is scared of sounds.

742
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:44,375
So, we should stand outside his house
holding a gun for his safety!

743
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,333
And he'll make out
with his wife inside--

744
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,666
Hey! You're a police officer!
Mind your words!

745
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,875
What did you say?

746
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,750
-Parthiban!
-Hey, hold him!

747
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,208
Parthiban, let go of him!

748
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,791
Parthiban, he's a police officer!
Let go of him!

749
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,625
Parthiban, let go of him!

750
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,541
Let go!

751
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:04,541
Hey, hold him!

752
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,833
-He'll die. Let go of him.
-Parthiban, let go of him, please!

753
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,791
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

754
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,541
Parthiban, what are you doing?

755
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,875
It will create problems! Parthiban!

756
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:16,166
-What are you doing?
-Parthiban!

757
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,208
Parthiban, control yourself!
Calm down!

758
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,500
Parthiban, stop it!

759
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,958
Parthiban, what are you doing?
Control yourself!

760
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:34,666
Sir, are you okay? Is your neck okay?

761
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,416
Parthiban.

762
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,916
Are you crazy?
What was wrong with you?

763
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,125
You want police protection,
but why should they give it?

764
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:52,208
There's no proof of assault against you.
You haven't been injured at all.

765
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:56,208
Who said that I'm not injured?

766
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,500
Parthiban, are you really sure?

767
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,708
Joshy, I may go overboard
if I do it myself.

768
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,833
So, you do it for me.

769
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,666
Okay. As you wish.

770
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:50,875
-SP.
-Yes, sir?

771
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,666
-Can you come to my residence?
-Right now?

772
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,666
-Now. Yes, it's urgent.
-Okay, sir.

773
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,500
Sir, I have a small request.

774
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:00,583
Please summon a police officer
from my village.

775
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,958
900 KILOS OF DRUGS SEIZED

776
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:14,875
Napoleon reporting to duty, sir!

777
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,916
Where should I stand? Tell me, sir!

778
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:49,125
Whom have you sent?

779
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:52,166
Parthiban, you asked for
a high-ranking officer from your village.

780
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,333
He is the highest-ranking police officer.

781
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:57,083
You must've heard
of a drug bust in Trichy.

782
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,458
I heard he was responsible
for catching 50-60 of those men.

783
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,083
-Move these tables here quickly.
-Yes, sir.

784
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,583
Hey!

785
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:04,125
Put your phone down.

786
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,708
Hey, listen!

787
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,041
What do you want?

788
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,500
Hey, come here!

789
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,458
I'm talking to you! Hey!

790
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,000
Hurry up! Load the stuff!

791
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,125
TELANGANA

792
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,083
What happened?

793
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:33,833
What?

794
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,041
Hey!

795
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,125
-Boss!
-Move!

796
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,291
-Boss!
-Get out of my way! Move!

797
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,291
Boss?

798
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:31,291
You'd better pray to God
that it's important news.

799
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,916
Or you'll die today.

800
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,666
Look at this picture.

801
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,666
Hey!

802
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,666
Hey!

803
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:08,791
He is a freaking badass, man

804
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:13,833
He's a badass, run for your life quickly

805
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:19,041
He's a badass, stay within your limits

806
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,708
He's a badass man

807
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,208
Leo Das, man

808
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:28,791
He's a badass, run for your life quickly

809
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:30,125
Got you, rascal!

810
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,291
Hey!

811
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:35,208
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

812
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,833
Hey!

813
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,208
He is a freaking badass, man

814
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,875
If the lion is on the prowl fearsome
Feast is for the forest wholesome

815
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,500
Fearing his hunt, scatter
Hither and thither, helter-skelter

816
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:50,666
Putting an end to gangsters countless
He'll punish them, he's ruthless

817
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,541
Until now, he was a good soul

818
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:55,875
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

819
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,750
In this story, he has a demon's face

820
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,916
He's a badass man

821
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,583
Not a matchstick, he's a volcano

822
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,750
Don't mess with him

823
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,666
Those who stay away from him are fine

824
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,916
Keep that in mind

825
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,125
Hey!

826
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,291
He is a badass!

827
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,000
Stay within your limits

828
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,541
He's a badass man

829
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,083
Leo Das, man

830
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:30,791
Badass bona fide, dude
Take to your heels

831
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,416
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

832
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:43,708
How many people should we send from here?

833
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:47,000
If he's really Parthiban,

834
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:48,625
four people will suffice.

835
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,250
But if he is Leo…

836
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,750
-We'll finish him!
-We'll finish him!

837
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:08,041
-We'll finish him!
-We'll finish him!

838
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,708
LEO DAS
BORN: 13-05-1977

839
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:11,833
…even all our men won't be enough.

840
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:17,708
Don't act too smart, man

841
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:23,250
He will give you grief and strife
Beat you to a pulp and end your life

842
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:28,708
Not a matchstick, he's a volcano

843
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:31,250
Don't mess with him

844
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,875
Those who stay away from him are fine

845
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,000
Keep that in mind

846
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:43,625
He is a badass

847
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,125
Run for your life

848
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:48,708
He is a badass

849
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:51,333
Stay within your limits

850
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:53,875
He is a badass man

851
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:56,333
Leo Das, man

852
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,666
He is a badass man

853
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,625
Run for your life

854
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:10,333
Thank you.

855
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:14,250
-Is it sweet?
-Bloody sweet.

856
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,750
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

857
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,166
Leo

858
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,000
He's a freaking badass, man

859
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,500
Leo!

860
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,125
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

861
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,583
Leo

862
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:31,125
Rest in peace!

863
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,583
This one is…

864
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:38,625
It could be better.

865
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,750
-I'll make it better.
-Yeah.

866
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:45,625
The girl sitting here has been
staring at you for a while.

867
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,250
Don't turn around immediately.

868
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:56,916
Maybe she's a reporter.

869
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,291
-She left.
-Sir,

870
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:13,666
the man at the back
has been here for a while.

871
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,208
He isn't saying anything.
Could you please check?

872
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:17,958
-Where is he?
-In the backyard.

873
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,416
Okay. Go, I'll handle him.

874
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,750
"Pleasure is mine"?

875
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:45,791
Hi, sir. What would you like to have?

876
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:56,000
Coffee.

877
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,208
-Sugar?
-You know very well…

878
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:01,916
how many spoons of sugar I have.

879
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:07,875
How would I know whether
you prefer sugar or not?

880
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,958
-I do.
-Okay.

881
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,791
Just a moment, sir.

882
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,000
Sorry, sir.

883
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:28,375
-One sugar cube or two--
-You know that too.

884
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:33,333
Sir, I don't know that.
You're mistaking me for someone else.

885
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:37,291
I'm just being friendly to you
because you're my customer. That's it.

886
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,208
Here is your coffee
and your sugar.

887
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,583
Leo?

888
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:45,958
You are Leo!

889
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:47,916
Parthiban.

890
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,625
I don't know who Leo is.

891
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,208
There's already a lot
of confusion in my life.

892
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:56,541
Please don't add to it.
Please enjoy your coffee and leave.

893
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:57,875
Do you mind?

894
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,666
Can you make it a little stronger?

895
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,166
Sure, sir.

896
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,875
Do you know this brand?

897
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,541
No, sir. I don't smoke.

898
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:19,166
-I can't even stand its smell.
-D Slash.

899
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:23,083
You used to call it Honey Badger,
but it is Black Devil.

900
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:25,083
Twenty-five puffs.

901
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,625
You invented this brand.

902
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:32,666
You like nocturnal animals, right?

903
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:35,625
Once, a honey badger
entered our tobacco field.

904
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,125
Do you remember?

905
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,291
It didn't get caught in your trap.

906
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:42,000
It didn't get killed
by Harold's spear either.

907
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:45,916
In the end, it died
by the bullet that I fired.

908
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,000
You'll remember it now.

909
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:51,541
Do you want anything else,
or shall I get your bill?

910
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:54,375
So, you believe
your old identity doesn't exist, Leo?

911
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,416
Wait, what?

912
01:16:00,583 --> 01:16:01,625
Listen.

913
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,666
There are already
many problems in my life.

914
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,750
Let me tell you nicely one last time.

915
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:10,625
You're mistaking me for someone else.

916
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,708
Look, I don't have patience.

917
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,875
So, don't waste my time.

918
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,458
Mount View Lodge.

919
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,125
Come there and confess that you're Leo.

920
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,708
Sir, no alcohol, please.

921
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,291
Start the car.

922
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,250
No alcohol.

923
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,750
My colleague's friend stays in Kadapa.

924
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:42,875
I sent him a photo of the D Slash
cigarette box and got some details.

925
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,541
As per the details he gave me,
the chap who had come here

926
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:47,958
was Antony Das.

927
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,583
Once upon a time, he ran
a huge tobacco company in Andhra Pradesh.

928
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:56,125
-There was a fire at his factory and--
-Hold on.

929
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,041
Why should I know
the life story of a guy

930
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:03,041
who barged into my cafe
and blew cigarette smoke in my face?

931
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,416
Because this is important.

932
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,291
-No, I--
-At least hear him once.

933
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:08,125
Go on, Joshy.

934
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:12,000
Antony Das had a son named Leo.

935
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,083
Okay.

936
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:15,750
Leo Das.

937
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:19,041
I couldn't find any details
about him other than his name.

938
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:22,375
Some people believe
he did something before he died.

939
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:25,083
And some believe he is still alive.

940
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,250
He can fool everyone.

941
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,833
He can fool the world.

942
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,750
But he can never fool me.

943
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:39,458
In some odd way,
you have a striking resemblance to him.

944
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,750
I saw his eyes.

945
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:45,250
I know those eyes.

946
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,458
It is him.

947
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,958
Parthiban, you grew up
in an orphanage, right?

948
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:52,458
Do you remember anything
about your childhood?

949
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:55,458
What is this? This is bullshit!
We are the victims here!

950
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:58,041
But the police
are treating us like the accused.

951
01:18:58,125 --> 01:18:59,500
-Let's go, Parthi.
-Wait.

952
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,458
Sathya, wait.

953
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:03,333
Joshy.

954
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,791
I understand you're asking me
all this because you care about me.

955
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:10,416
But from my childhood, until I was 20,

956
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,750
I grew up in Sathyamangal Orphanage.

957
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,958
And I met her for the first time at--
What was that place?

958
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,208
At the Munnar trekking.

959
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:20,916
That's where we met.

960
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,791
I saw her. We became friends.

961
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:26,375
Within two days,
I asked her to marry me.

962
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:27,375
That's it.

963
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,875
After marrying her,
we settled here because of her job.

964
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,250
I have been here since then.
This is my story.

965
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:38,583
They've come here
from the south, Parthiban. It's quite far.

966
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:42,166
By road. If they came here
looking for you from so far,

967
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,041
it must be something important.

968
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:46,583
The factory was closed down
because of him.

969
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,791
Now, only he will start it again.

970
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,125
I'll make him do it.

971
01:19:54,083 --> 01:19:55,875
My world is very small, Joshy.

972
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,708
It's like a snow globe
that we get at a shop.

973
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,625
It has a small independent house,

974
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,625
surrounded by trees,
snow, and cool breeze.

975
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:06,125
Why is this happening to me?

976
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,291
At least you believe me.

977
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,000
Sorry.

978
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:13,750
It's alright. I understand.

979
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,541
If they come back
and cause you any trouble,

980
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,541
we'll inform the police.

981
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,208
Keep an eye on his family and friends.

982
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:23,291
Okay, boss.

983
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:33,958
I feel like someone
is keeping an eye on us, Sathya.

984
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:37,500
This eerie silence is making me restless.

985
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,500
I feel very disturbed.

986
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:47,500
Look at me. Understand this.

987
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,875
Even if the whole world suspects you,
I will always stand by you.

988
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:55,250
Have I ever questioned you?

989
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:58,708
Stop thinking about these things,
and sleep peacefully.

990
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,333
Let's go, Parthiban.

991
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:07,000
Are you planning
to sleep here standing up?

992
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,833
Don't touch the engine,
just fix the heater.

993
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:14,958
I want my jeep back ASAP.

994
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,458
Get it ready by tonight.

995
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:49,416
What do you want?

996
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:52,875
I got to see you.

997
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:54,958
That's enough for me.

998
01:21:56,916 --> 01:22:00,208
I'm so mad that if I slap you right now,

999
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:04,208
your face will be distorted for life.

1000
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:05,541
Sorry.

1001
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:07,041
Get out!

1002
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:11,708
Keep walking.

1003
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,958
-Yes, Sathya?
-I got you the tablet you wanted.

1004
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,416
Do you want anything else?

1005
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,458
I've given the jeep for servicing.

1006
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:24,208
I had told you we'd go
to the pharmacy later.

1007
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:28,000
-Why did you leave the kids alone at home?
-Mathi is with me.

1008
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,416
Priya is also with me.

1009
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,375
You could've waited for a day.
What was the hurry?

1010
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:33,083
Some things can't be delayed.

1011
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:35,000
Don't worry.
I'll take an auto home.

1012
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,166
-Take care.
-Okay. Call me once you reach home.

1013
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:10,125
No!

1014
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,541
Don't be scared.

1015
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,166
We're the same blood.

1016
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,791
Do you know who she is?

1017
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:15,333
My granddaughter.

1018
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:17,833
My blood.

1019
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:20,958
You were
at the cafe yesterday, right?

1020
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:25,291
You'd better leave,
or I will call the police.

1021
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:27,875
Police?

1022
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:31,666
I am not here to trouble you.

1023
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:35,250
The person you've been
living with for 20 years

1024
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:39,166
is not Parthiban but someone else.
When you realize he is a ruthless murderer

1025
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,166
who committed

1026
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:45,208
many murders,

1027
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:46,875
come and meet me.

1028
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,416
I'll show you the true colors
of your husband.

1029
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,208
-Hello--
-Why didn't you answer the call?

1030
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:01,958
-He was here.
-What happened, Sathya?

1031
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:03,458
Who are you talking about?

1032
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:05,833
The guy who came
to your cafe yesterday!

1033
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,666
He came to the medical shop
looking for me.

1034
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,083
-Okay. Where are you now?
-I am at home.

1035
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:12,875
They followed me in their car.
It is parked outside our home.

1036
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:15,666
Sathya, close the doors.
Give the phone to the police officer.

1037
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,458
He is missing. I am alone here.

1038
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:18,583
I'm scared.

1039
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:21,375
Go to our bedroom and lock the door.

1040
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,166
Siddhu and I are on our way.

1041
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:36,291
Answer the call!

1042
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:40,166
-Dad, what is it?
-Siddharth, go home immediately,

1043
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,916
-and keep your spear handy.
-What are you saying--

1044
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,166
If anyone tries to enter the house,
attack them with your spear.

1045
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,666
-I'm coming too.
-Okay, Dad.

1046
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,625
Is this how our life is going to be now?

1047
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:15,041
Always on the lookout. Always hiding.

1048
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:19,666
We'll have to keep worrying
if the kids are fine at school. Right?

1049
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:22,125
Tell me. Who is he?

1050
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:24,500
He claims that our daughter
is his granddaughter.

1051
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,333
I feel terrified when I look at him.

1052
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:30,625
Today, he cut someone's throat
in front of us.

1053
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,666
And he did that just to save us.

1054
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,000
Chintu, come here.

1055
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,833
Let her be. She's already terrified.

1056
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,333
-Sir…
-I pleaded with a lot of people,

1057
01:27:57,083 --> 01:28:00,291
I fought with a policeman,
and I pleaded with the judge,

1058
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,625
just to get you here…

1059
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,833
so that you could protect my family.

1060
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:08,250
Do you not have any honesty
towards your job?

1061
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:11,833
Don't say that.

1062
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:13,625
I am expecting honesty from those

1063
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,833
-who work only for money!
-It's not like that.

1064
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,583
Instead of doing your duty,

1065
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,541
you're always just sleeping!
It'd be better if you just left!

1066
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:24,208
-You're getting me wrong.
-I don't think so.

1067
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:26,291
Now, don't give me that crap

1068
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:28,041
and make me cuss you out!

1069
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:31,458
-I just went to recharge--
-Stop talking.

1070
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:32,583
I said stop talking.

1071
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,875
I'm controlling myself
considering your age.

1072
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:37,291
You're getting me wrong.

1073
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:40,041
-Sir…
-Go. Just go.

1074
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,708
Such a pain in the neck!

1075
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:44,750
I'm sorry, Dad.

1076
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:48,125
-I-I didn't know it was you…
-It's okay, son.

1077
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,875
That was a good throw.

1078
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:52,291
You proved today that you're my son.

1079
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:03,916
The person you've been living with
is not Parthiban but someone else.

1080
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,375
He is a ruthless murderer

1081
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:10,500
who committed many murders.

1082
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:23,458
A bad dream?

1083
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,208
Yes. A nightmare.

1084
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:45,166
I think some major conflicts
happened in that family.

1085
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:50,791
Maybe that's why
their tobacco empire got destroyed.

1086
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,958
I have sent you
the photos and certificates.

1087
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:55,750
Check if they are forged and tell me.
Okay? Bye.

1088
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:57,708
There were many rumors about this.

1089
01:29:57,791 --> 01:30:00,916
But there is a man in the Shimla
jail who knows the truth.

1090
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:03,875
His name is Hridayaraj D'Souza
in the records.

1091
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:06,541
As per the intel we got,
he was Leo Das' friend.

1092
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,541
If you want to meet him,
you only have two days.

1093
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:11,875
I don't think you'll be
able to get here by then.

1094
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:14,000
-Would you like to talk over the phone--
-No.

1095
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:16,250
I-I'm leaving now.
Make the arrangements.

1096
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,875
-I'll be there by tonight.
-Okay, Joshy.

1097
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:20,375
-Thank you.
-Who is the villain?

1098
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,833
It's late. Your mom isn't home yet.

1099
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:31,250
She has been coming home late
every day lately.

1100
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,500
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1101
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:36,625
That's her.

1102
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,250
-Tell me.
-Parthi, I'm not coming home tonight.

1103
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,291
Don't wait for me for dinner.

1104
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:48,250
-Why? What happened?
-I took many days off this month.

1105
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,208
So, there's a lot of pending work.

1106
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,583
I thought I'd finish it all tonight.

1107
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:54,666
I yelled at Siddhu this morning,

1108
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,458
so he isn't answering my call

1109
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:58,916
Is he home? I was too harsh on him.

1110
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,333
Ladies and gentlemen!
May I have your kind attention, please?

1111
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,916
Where are you going by plane?

1112
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:07,083
-To the head office.
-Oh, the head office!

1113
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:13,750
-Chintu.
-Yes?

1114
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,750
You don't suspect your dad, right?

1115
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:20,083
-No.
-Why?

1116
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:21,791
Because you are my dearest dad.

1117
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:25,000
My dearest kid.

1118
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,916
Hey, it's your dad.

1119
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,041
Siddharth, get in the car!

1120
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:44,833
-I said get in--
-Let go of my hand!

1121
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:51,875
Uncle, don't force him
if he doesn't want to come.

1122
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:54,458
What? Are you going to kill him too?

1123
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:03,375
Okay, don't come.

1124
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,500
Who is the villain?

1125
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,750
Who is the hero?

1126
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:20,000
Who is the villain?

1127
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:22,166
Who is the hero?

1128
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:25,583
You'd better not be anywhere
near my family from now on!

1129
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:29,291
Who is the villain here?

1130
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,125
-Sir--
-What are you doing out here in the cold?

1131
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:38,583
No one will barge in now.

1132
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:41,541
I don't care who shoots
and who dies anymore. Go to sleep.

1133
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:43,083
It's okay, sir. I'm good.

1134
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:45,958
This courier came in today.
It's for your wife.

1135
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:50,208
Sir, one moment.
I wanted to say something to you.

1136
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,416
I understand all your worries and fears.

1137
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:58,458
I see how much you love your family.

1138
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:00,625
You can't see them in pain.

1139
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:03,000
I will be retiring in 60 days.

1140
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:08,000
If anyone troubles you or your family
in these 60 days,

1141
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,708
I'll take them down with me!

1142
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:13,375
Even if my family
is in an emergency back home,

1143
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:15,500
I won't leave this place.

1144
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:20,208
I swear this Napoleon doesn't work
just for money, sir.

1145
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:24,208
I consider my work my God, sir. Trust me.

1146
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,041
Tell me, did you really kill
all those men with such a heavy gun

1147
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:35,541
at the commissioner's office?

1148
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:40,291
I just read the manual and told them
how to operate the gun.

1149
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,708
Dilli took care of the rest.

1150
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:44,083
-Dad!
-Please don't tell anyone about this.

1151
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,083
Okay.

1152
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:47,458
Chintu!

1153
01:33:57,791 --> 01:33:59,000
Have a seat.

1154
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,958
-How is he doing now?
-He is fine.

1155
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:04,041
It's been three weeks
since he last called me.

1156
01:34:04,166 --> 01:34:05,166
All okay, right?

1157
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:08,625
Why did you come here at this hour?

1158
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:11,000
If you had told me,
I would've couriered it.

1159
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:15,083
The government registration is pending
because they don't have certificates.

1160
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:18,166
So, we thought we would
come here and collect them.

1161
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,083
They're in the attic. Let me get them.

1162
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,791
Sir, this is Hridayaraj D'Souza.
You only have 20 minutes to talk to him.

1163
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:29,458
I'll wait outside until then.

1164
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:37,250
You asked for this brand, right?

1165
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:42,958
Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1166
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:46,083
We don't have much time,
so I'll come straight to the point.

1167
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:48,583
Das Company Tobacco Factory.

1168
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:52,208
Its owners, Antony and Harold.

1169
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:56,541
We have some information about them,
but we have no details about Leo.

1170
01:34:56,666 --> 01:34:59,666
Leo's associates died with him.

1171
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:02,833
Only one of his associates is alive,
and that's you.

1172
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:05,083
Just tell me one thing.

1173
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:11,708
Is this Leo? Remember,
it's a matter of four lives.

1174
01:35:15,208 --> 01:35:18,000
I can see the fear of death in your eyes.

1175
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,333
I know you will be hanged in three days.

1176
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:23,958
If you tell me the truth,
I will send a petition now

1177
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,458
and appeal for a review
of your death sentence. So, tell me.

1178
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,166
Tell me everything from the beginning.

1179
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,250
Hridayaraj, this is your last chance.

1180
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:54,041
If you're here for a fair and just cause,

1181
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:58,333
why did you come in from the back door
and sit near the toilet?

1182
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:01,125
Whatever I had to say,
I said in the court.

1183
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:04,708
No one can stop my hanging now.

1184
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:05,750
Anything else?

1185
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,750
What happened in that tobacco factory?

1186
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,875
Is Leo alive or dead? If he's dead,
how did he die?

1187
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I'm not giving you this information
'cause you gave me booze.

1188
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:16,000
I'll die in three days anyway.

1189
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:20,125
No one is going to come
and question me then. So, I'll tell you.

1190
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:26,500
In 1999, Das Company
was the most flourishing tobacco factory

1191
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:29,125
in Andhra Pradesh.

1192
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:32,541
The one who built
and ruled that empire was Antony.

1193
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:34,416
Antony Das.

1194
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:39,333
It was pictured to be
a tobacco business,

1195
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:44,916
but Das Company used to run
many illegal businesses in their factory.

1196
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,708
First, it was a local business.

1197
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:50,541
But soon, they started
doing business internationally.

1198
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:53,958
Antony used to never forgive
those who betrayed him.

1199
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,666
He would kill them mercilessly.

1200
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:01,291
He was someone who could
even scare the death angel.

1201
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:09,916
Before starting any business,
he'd always sacrifice an animal.

1202
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:12,791
He believed his empire would grow

1203
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:15,458
if he sacrificed an animal.

1204
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:18,375
Initially, he used to sacrifice animals…

1205
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:21,125
but soon, he started
sacrificing humans too.

1206
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,291
He was very superstitious.

1207
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,041
Harold Das was his younger brother.

1208
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:37,208
Harold was the only one
whom Antony trusted completely.

1209
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:38,458
Harold.

1210
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,958
Harold!

1211
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:45,375
He went to Canada to study

1212
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:48,083
but got acquainted with international
drug cartels over there.

1213
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:50,833
He expanded their business
on foreign soil.

1214
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:55,708
His dream was to make Das Company
the number one drug cartel in the world.

1215
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:58,583
So, he created a drug called datura.

1216
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:04,333
It was a new drug on the market.
Nobody had heard about it.

1217
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,833
They grew datura
amid their tobacco plants.

1218
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:08,875
They began to manufacture it
in their factory.

1219
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:11,708
Datura was more lethal than cocaine.

1220
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,291
Gradually, its demand
increased in the market.

1221
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:16,500
That's when some
of his men gave this news

1222
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,208
to the Narcotics Control Bureau.

1223
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:22,000
He threw datura on the faces
of those whom he suspected

1224
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:25,833
He killed them all so ruthlessly
that even today,

1225
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:28,875
people in the mafia world
have not forgotten about it.

1226
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:32,083
None of his men betrayed him after that.

1227
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:36,083
Even if Antony and Harold were
managing the business at the top level…

1228
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:41,958
they still needed someone trustworthy
working at the grass-root level.

1229
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,291
Antony had a son.

1230
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:47,750
I have seen him grow up
in front of my eyes.

1231
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:52,458
Das. Leo Das.

1232
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:57,791
All this hassle is because one of your men
leaked the information to NCB.

1233
01:38:58,208 --> 01:39:00,500
Have you ever faced a problem
because of me to date?

1234
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:03,250
I'm helpless, sir.
It's almost 200 kgs of drugs.

1235
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,791
I can't show a wrong count
and dismiss the case.

1236
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,333
It's not possible.

1237
01:39:07,416 --> 01:39:09,500
One of you has to surrender.

1238
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:12,500
Ask Leo to surrender.
Then you'll get your stash.

1239
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:15,000
I can't do anything
if my seniors find out about this.

1240
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:17,250
Don't worry.
I'll release him in a week.

1241
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:20,208
What's the guarantee
that you'll release him in a week?

1242
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:22,875
If you want your stash,
you have to trust me.

1243
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:28,375
-Yes, Antony?
-Is Leo there?

1244
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,541
He isn't here.

1245
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:32,208
He said he'd cross the border
with the drugs.

1246
01:39:32,291 --> 01:39:35,291
He must be at the checkpoint.
I think he's outwitting them.

1247
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,041
Hey, who is smoking over there?

1248
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:40,250
Hit him and get him here!

1249
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,250
Tell me, sir.

1250
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:43,916
Yes. I'm here.

1251
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,625
Hey, move!

1252
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,666
-Move!
-Rest in peace!

1253
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:16,166
Get him!

1254
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:24,458
-Gabby! Start the vehicle!
-Hey! Go!

1255
01:40:25,166 --> 01:40:27,208
Load the stash! Hurry up!

1256
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:29,208
Take this!

1257
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,291
POLICE

1258
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:14,791
Hey! I worked for you risking my job,

1259
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,625
and you're outwitting me
and getting me into trouble?!

1260
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:19,166
Let me see
how you take your stash…

1261
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:22,791
Leo!

1262
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:27,208
Don't!

1263
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:31,666
Leo!

1264
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:36,791
Rest in peace!

1265
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,666
Leo found out

1266
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:46,416
who ratted us out to the NCB
from within our camp.

1267
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:50,958
-Gabby!
-Yes, boss.

1268
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:54,041
I had told you not to stop the truck
anywhere, come what may!

1269
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:57,958
Then why the hell did you stop there
with all our stash loaded in the truck?

1270
01:41:58,291 --> 01:42:00,375
Why are you asking me this? Ask Daniel!

1271
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:02,291
Every time I instructed him,
he said, "Call Leo.

1272
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:05,583
This load won't move an inch
until he comes here and settles my share."

1273
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:07,125
That smart-ass threatened me.

1274
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:09,291
You call him a friend,
so he takes advantage of you.

1275
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:10,250
Summon him.

1276
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:11,750
Hey!

1277
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:17,708
You think you're a smart-ass!

1278
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:20,291
What is your problem?
Why can't you work with him?

1279
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:21,833
He is my problem!

1280
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:30,166
Until yesterday, he used to work under me.

1281
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:32,333
Today, I am working under him.

1282
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,791
If you don't stop all this,

1283
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:36,833
I'll put a halt to your business!

1284
01:42:39,291 --> 01:42:42,416
-What now?
-I don't want him butting in, that's all.

1285
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,291
If he does, we can't work together.

1286
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:58,250
He was being a pain in the neck.

1287
01:42:58,875 --> 01:42:59,791
Right?

1288
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:23,416
I don't about anything else but the stash!

1289
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,833
I'll do as you say.

1290
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:28,416
Hey, let go of him!

1291
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:30,000
-Hey!
-Hey!

1292
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,416
Remove the damn knife!

1293
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,541
I know who your next target is.

1294
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:36,375
Put the gun down and leave!

1295
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:48,791
Have you watched the movie Judwaa?

1296
01:43:48,875 --> 01:43:51,208
The one in which Salman plays
the role of twin brothers, right?

1297
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,833
There is a tiny change here.

1298
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:56,291
Both the twins in the film were men.
Here, it's a man and a woman.

1299
01:43:57,125 --> 01:43:59,750
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1300
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:04,166
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1301
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:05,916
Rest in peace

1302
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:07,791
Leo.

1303
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,958
It isn't easy to cross all the checkpoints
with 2000 kgs of datura overnight.

1304
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:14,333
The police target our men
as if they're shooting mongrels.

1305
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:17,541
It's too risky to transfer it overnight.
Tell me what to do.

1306
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,708
Even though it was
an impossible task,

1307
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:22,041
Leo decided to transfer
the stash overnight.

1308
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:26,083
Leo took it as a challenge
to transfer 2000 kgs of datura

1309
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:29,125
by crossing two inter-state borders.

1310
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,708
Imagine! Two thousand kilos of datura!

1311
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:34,250
It was worth millions at that time.

1312
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,875
He kept his word
and completed the task.

1313
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:41,125
Later, he took matters into his own hands
for his dad's sake.

1314
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:45,458
Amid all this, Antony's quest
for human sacrifices didn't stop.

1315
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:49,958
For two years, he was searching
for a unique horoscope.

1316
01:44:50,166 --> 01:44:54,083
He believed that if such a person
was found and sacrificed,

1317
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:57,291
his tobacco factory
and business would flourish.

1318
01:45:01,166 --> 01:45:03,458
We couldn't care less about it.

1319
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:07,375
We were just happy that the drugs reached
the godown safely. We partied hard.

1320
01:45:11,708 --> 01:45:13,416
Bro, listen!

1321
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,125
Bro, come here!

1322
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:19,458
Please come here, brother! For our sake!

1323
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:22,375
Yes! Come on!

1324
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:30,000
I'm ready, come on!

1325
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:32,708
I'm ready and fresh

1326
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,666
My grasp is like that of a lion's

1327
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:38,375
No matter who tries to come in my way
I won't budge

1328
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:40,791
I'm ready, come on!

1329
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:43,583
-Bro!
-Come on, dear! Try me!

1330
01:45:43,916 --> 01:45:48,875
Beat the drum
I'll make everyone dance to my tunes

1331
01:45:54,666 --> 01:45:59,416
A little bit of everything
Gets me going

1332
01:46:28,375 --> 01:46:31,125
If God promises you to shower you

1333
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:32,583
with everything you want,

1334
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:36,000
he snatches something
from you in return.

1335
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:40,916
I have good news and bad news for you.

1336
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:43,791
Out of all the horoscopes
I have checked to date,

1337
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:47,333
only these two horoscopes are of our use.

1338
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:49,708
Please take a look and decide.

1339
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:54,125
I'm ready to harvest
And weed out my opponent

1340
01:46:54,208 --> 01:46:56,250
It is our fate at stake
To get rid of this headache

1341
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:58,875
If he acts like Smart Alec
We will tie him in a sack

1342
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,708
Dump him in a lorry
To get dissected in the factory

1343
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:04,791
Hey, we know all the blueprints
Our mission will be a success

1344
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:07,333
If you interfere, you'll also be akin
To a lamb offered to our family deity

1345
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:10,458
Lamb for offering booze, cigarette, bidi
Everybody in our gang is trustworthy

1346
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:13,208
As a team we work and think
Sharing a worldwide link

1347
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:15,916
Our rules hold well in every city
Don't flick our tools to play dirty

1348
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,500
We move and groove in unity
Our sync is our identity

1349
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:21,458
I fight world wars not just a battle
Tired of winning every match I wrestle

1350
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:24,333
Just one drum beat quick
Sure-shot power kick

1351
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,708
I shouldn't have shown Elisa
and Leo's horoscopes to you,

1352
01:47:48,791 --> 01:47:50,125
but I had no other option.

1353
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:53,041
I'm not sure
if we can find a similar horoscope

1354
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:55,875
with the same star and date of birth, Das.

1355
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:10,875
Hey! This cannot happen!

1356
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,750
This cannot happen!

1357
01:48:28,458 --> 01:48:30,958
Both Leo and Elisa are like my own kids.

1358
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,416
But if you ask for my opinion,

1359
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:36,333
I'll choose Leo.

1360
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:39,916
No.

1361
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:43,416
The decision… the decision is all yours.

1362
01:48:43,833 --> 01:48:46,916
Even a lion is nothing in front of me

1363
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:49,208
I am great at hunting

1364
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:52,291
If I really want

1365
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:54,375
Even my eyes can start firing

1366
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:57,750
My sword is more dangerous than a bullet

1367
01:48:58,291 --> 01:48:59,958
I know, I am great

1368
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:03,166
But I can also be the reason
For someone's death

1369
01:49:03,416 --> 01:49:05,625
-Do you get it, mister?
-Yes, master!

1370
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:18,666
I'm known by another name too

1371
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:21,416
You'll tremble in fear
Upon hearing it, dude

1372
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:24,333
Print out the poster
All ready is your brother

1373
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:26,750
Celebrate and how
Set it ablaze now

1374
01:49:28,458 --> 01:49:30,000
Hey, make way for our bro!

1375
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:39,416
I'm ready and fresh

1376
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,958
My grasp is like that of a lion's

1377
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:44,750
No matter who tries to come in my way
I won't budge

1378
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:47,250
I'm ready, come on!

1379
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:49,791
-Bro!
-Come on, dear! Try me!

1380
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:55,333
Beat the drum
I will make everyone dance to my tunes

1381
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:05,958
A little bit of everything
Gets me going

1382
01:50:58,333 --> 01:51:00,375
Forgive me.

1383
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:03,666
Between you and your sister,

1384
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:07,500
all of them chose you to be sacrificed.

1385
01:51:07,583 --> 01:51:10,083
Even your uncle chose you.

1386
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:14,083
I was the one who saved you!

1387
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:17,791
You need not thank me for that.

1388
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:21,458
Just forgive me.

1389
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:25,125
Since I started managing our business,

1390
01:51:25,208 --> 01:51:28,875
I've killed countless people
for your sake.

1391
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:32,416
I took your word as gospel

1392
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:36,666
and killed my friend too.

1393
01:51:37,916 --> 01:51:41,291
But not anymore!
Enough with these superstitions!

1394
01:51:41,666 --> 01:51:43,416
Let go of Elisa!

1395
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:45,208
Leo!

1396
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:48,166
This is not just about our business!

1397
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:51,708
-Why don't you understand?
-Hey!

1398
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:57,208
She isn't just my sister.

1399
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:02,041
She is my twin. She is a part of me.

1400
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:04,875
If you do anything to her,

1401
01:52:05,458 --> 01:52:07,625
no matter how many births you take,

1402
01:52:08,041 --> 01:52:12,458
the day I see you, I will kill you!

1403
01:52:12,916 --> 01:52:14,958
The day I see you

1404
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:17,541
will be your last day on Earth!

1405
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:20,833
You're begging him?!

1406
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:25,125
The day our mother died,

1407
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:27,833
he didn't shed a single tear.

1408
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:31,041
If he has decided
to sacrifice his children,

1409
01:52:31,708 --> 01:52:35,375
I don't consider him my dad anymore!
None of them are my kith and kin!

1410
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:38,375
Will you do me a favor, Leo?

1411
01:52:40,375 --> 01:52:42,875
Don't spare any of them!

1412
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:58,666
Hey!

1413
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:01,458
Don't even think about it.

1414
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:05,708
Hey!

1415
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:09,791
Hey! Don't you dare!

1416
01:53:10,708 --> 01:53:11,791
Let her go!

1417
01:53:12,541 --> 01:53:13,541
Dad!

1418
01:53:14,375 --> 01:53:15,375
Dad!

1419
01:53:16,916 --> 01:53:17,875
Hey!

1420
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:20,958
Let her go! Hey!

1421
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:40,916
Elisa, try to understand!

1422
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:42,916
You will be fine!

1423
01:53:57,666 --> 01:54:00,583
-Leo, burn down the entire factory!
-Elisa, stop!

1424
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:06,916
Harold! Kill both of them!

1425
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:17,791
Leo!

1426
01:54:22,916 --> 01:54:24,541
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

1427
01:54:28,291 --> 01:54:32,083
-Come on!
-Run!

1428
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:38,458
-Come on!
-Catch them!

1429
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:44,958
Hey! Don't spare anyone!

1430
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:11,708
Don't leave anything out!
Burn everything down!

1431
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:13,041
Everything!

1432
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:51,416
Hey!

1433
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:52,875
Hey!

1434
01:55:54,291 --> 01:55:57,291
You wanted to sacrifice
your children for this, right?

1435
01:55:58,833 --> 01:55:59,708
Hey, Leo!

1436
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:01,416
This shouldn't exist anymore!

1437
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:02,833
I will…

1438
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:07,750
-burn all of this down!
-Leo, stop it!

1439
01:56:11,333 --> 01:56:12,916
Hey! Give me the knife!

1440
01:56:19,125 --> 01:56:22,000
Elisa!

1441
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:34,000
Elisa…

1442
01:56:35,541 --> 01:56:37,916
-Elisa…
-Leo.

1443
01:56:38,833 --> 01:56:41,541
Don't be with them, Leo.

1444
01:56:42,041 --> 01:56:42,958
Elisa!

1445
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:45,791
-Elisa--
-Go somewhere far away.

1446
01:57:48,125 --> 01:57:49,125
Elisa!

1447
01:57:50,333 --> 01:57:51,500
Elisa!

1448
01:58:18,416 --> 01:58:20,000
That day, I saw the dead body

1449
01:58:20,291 --> 01:58:23,208
of the person whom I raised
with my own hands.

1450
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:33,416
Tell me if this is Leo.

1451
01:58:36,375 --> 01:58:39,416
If you identify him,
all the problems will be solved.

1452
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:46,166
Even if Leo stands among 1000 people,

1453
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:48,750
I can identify him from his eyes.

1454
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:50,375
This isn't him.

1455
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:53,500
Don't play unnecessarily
with an innocent man's life.

1456
01:58:53,583 --> 01:58:56,000
Warden! Take me back!

1457
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:59,958
I am feeling sleepy. Let me go.

1458
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:02,083
Come on, get going!

1459
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:12,625
We clicked this
when we were in third grade

1460
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:14,500
and this in fourth grade.

1461
01:59:14,583 --> 01:59:16,291
And this in fifth grade.

1462
01:59:16,666 --> 01:59:19,333
This is the letter he sent me
when he was in college.

1463
01:59:19,416 --> 01:59:21,000
A NEW AND SCARY EXPERIENCE
TO STEP OUT

1464
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:22,708
OF OUR SHELTERED EXISTENCE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

1465
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:27,458
Can you do me a favor?

1466
01:59:27,666 --> 01:59:29,875
I'm asking you this as my brother.

1467
01:59:30,458 --> 01:59:34,125
I know what's on your mind.
I won't tell him you were here.

1468
01:59:34,583 --> 01:59:36,250
Make sure he doesn't find out.

1469
01:59:36,458 --> 01:59:37,875
Or he'll be devastated.

1470
01:59:43,166 --> 01:59:45,041
-Hello?
-Sir, is this Parthiban?

1471
01:59:45,333 --> 01:59:47,625
-Yes.
-Sir, come to the coffee shop at once.

1472
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:48,750
It's an emergency.

1473
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:53,375
He was drinking with us, sir.

1474
01:59:54,208 --> 01:59:57,541
He kept saying he saw his friend.
He was very happy.

1475
01:59:58,375 --> 02:00:00,166
He even paid for everyone's booze.

1476
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:02,791
Then he left in an inebriated state.

1477
02:00:02,875 --> 02:00:05,416
He was talking to someone over
the phone in the middle of the road.

1478
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,833
Then some people arrived in a car
and took him away.

1479
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:09,625
-Was it a black car?
-Yes, sir.

1480
02:00:17,166 --> 02:00:18,125
Hey!

1481
02:00:21,458 --> 02:00:25,291
He claimed to be your friend
and came to your cafe.

1482
02:00:25,375 --> 02:00:26,875
He even took your picture.

1483
02:00:26,958 --> 02:00:29,708
How do you know him? Tell me!

1484
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:37,291
Sir, if I see my customer in this state,

1485
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:39,708
I will be upset, right?

1486
02:00:40,791 --> 02:00:43,125
Look into my eyes. Do I seem upset?

1487
02:00:44,791 --> 02:00:46,333
I don't know him, sir.

1488
02:00:46,708 --> 02:00:50,208
Even though he died here at my cafe,
I have nothing to do with him.

1489
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:53,958
I'll come to the station when you call me.
You can interrogate me there.

1490
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:57,708
I've left my daughter alone at home.
I'm worried about her. I'm leaving.

1491
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:59,583
-Okay, go.
-All right.

1492
02:01:29,083 --> 02:01:32,708
I don't know whether to feel sorry
for Parthiban or be suspicious of him.

1493
02:01:32,791 --> 02:01:33,833
Listen.

1494
02:01:34,125 --> 02:01:38,041
Every human being
can lie only up to a limit.

1495
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:40,458
He won't be able to lie
after a certain point.

1496
02:01:40,541 --> 02:01:44,708
He can't continue to put on an act
beyond that point.

1497
02:01:45,333 --> 02:01:47,791
Because no one is that mentally strong.

1498
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:51,083
I think he is not lying.

1499
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:52,708
He really is Parthiban.

1500
02:01:53,791 --> 02:01:55,916
Only Leo can tell us

1501
02:01:56,458 --> 02:01:58,916
what the truth is.

1502
02:02:01,208 --> 02:02:02,375
Parthi, when did you come back?

1503
02:02:02,458 --> 02:02:05,875
Chintu said you had gone out
somewhere in a hurry. Where did you go?

1504
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,833
I had so much work today.

1505
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:10,291
Why didn't you have dinner yet?

1506
02:02:10,916 --> 02:02:14,625
Parthi, what happened?
Why do you seem so down?

1507
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:34,666
From now onward, I have nothing to lose.

1508
02:02:35,958 --> 02:02:39,083
I'm a loser.

1509
02:02:43,125 --> 02:02:45,166
You can tell what the truth is

1510
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:47,708
-Please…
-just by looking into my eyes, Sathya.

1511
02:02:47,791 --> 02:02:49,541
-Parthi--
-Don't touch me!

1512
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:51,166
Don't touch me.

1513
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:57,625
I don't care even if
the whole world suspects me,

1514
02:02:57,708 --> 02:03:01,916
but how could you suspect me?
How could you think I am someone else?

1515
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:03,166
Sathya!

1516
02:03:09,416 --> 02:03:13,041
Everything's over. No matter what
justification you give me now,

1517
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:16,333
the fact that you suspected me

1518
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:18,625
will haunt me forever.

1519
02:03:20,375 --> 02:03:21,750
What did you do?

1520
02:03:22,375 --> 02:03:25,875
You broke the trust we had built
over the years in a minute!

1521
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:32,875
I am not Leo!

1522
02:03:33,333 --> 02:03:35,458
I'm tired of telling everyone

1523
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:38,541
that I am Parthiban! I am Parthiban!

1524
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:41,541
What can I do if somebody looks like me?

1525
02:03:44,166 --> 02:03:45,750
-Sweetie…
-What happened?

1526
02:03:45,833 --> 02:03:49,708
I was not feeling well. That's it.
Go to sleep.

1527
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:52,791
Dance for me…

1528
02:03:53,041 --> 02:03:56,625
I've never seen anybody
Do the things you do before

1529
02:03:56,875 --> 02:04:00,208
They say, move for me

1530
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:04,750
And when you're done
I'll make you do it all again

1531
02:04:07,541 --> 02:04:08,708
Tell me something.

1532
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:11,208
Just because

1533
02:04:12,583 --> 02:04:15,125
some random fellow,
some goon looks like me,

1534
02:04:15,208 --> 02:04:17,916
you'll blindly believe it's me?!

1535
02:04:18,583 --> 02:04:21,500
You've broken my trust!

1536
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:23,750
Just because that man
said he was my father,

1537
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:27,291
you started suspecting if I am
really your husband?! Why?

1538
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:31,833
All right.

1539
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:35,958
I don't know who my parents are
or what my place of birth is.

1540
02:04:36,291 --> 02:04:37,291
I'm an orphan.

1541
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,125
Maybe if my parents were alive,
no one would've suspected me.

1542
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:43,875
-I'm an orphan, after all.
-Don't say that.

1543
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:46,833
Parthi, you're not an orphan. Look at me.

1544
02:04:47,833 --> 02:04:49,208
Look into my eyes.

1545
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,875
I didn't do this
because I didn't trust you,

1546
02:04:53,208 --> 02:04:56,916
I did this so that I could give people
answers when they questioned me.

1547
02:04:57,583 --> 02:04:58,958
"No. He is not that man."

1548
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:01,875
I want to say confidently
that this is Parthiban!

1549
02:05:02,208 --> 02:05:03,708
Why don't you understand?

1550
02:05:05,833 --> 02:05:06,708
Sathya!

1551
02:05:08,166 --> 02:05:11,083
I want to ask you just one question.

1552
02:05:11,708 --> 02:05:15,083
How would you stay with me now

1553
02:05:15,791 --> 02:05:18,875
despite having a doubt
that I could be someone else?

1554
02:05:19,291 --> 02:05:20,666
Won't you feel disgusted?

1555
02:05:20,958 --> 02:05:24,250
Won't you feel like you're
staying with a stranger--

1556
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:34,333
Trust me.

1557
02:05:35,875 --> 02:05:37,041
Sathya.

1558
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,291
Please trust me.

1559
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,666
I'm your Parthi. Trust me.

1560
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,958
Leo, the time I gave you is over.

1561
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:05,125
You didn't come to me.
So, I am here to see you.

1562
02:06:05,333 --> 02:06:06,250
Look outside.

1563
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:12,791
Hey, who the hell are you guys?

1564
02:06:12,875 --> 02:06:14,458
What are you doing here?

1565
02:06:15,916 --> 02:06:19,333
Get lost from here,
or I'll kill all of you!

1566
02:06:19,416 --> 02:06:21,083
You won't leave this place alive!

1567
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:25,333
You took it too far.

1568
02:06:26,083 --> 02:06:30,041
If you had come to me of your own accord
and admitted that you are Leo,

1569
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:33,166
I wouldn't have come here.

1570
02:06:33,458 --> 02:06:37,000
Sir, don't come down at any cost!
I'll deal with them!

1571
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,541
I just came to see you…

1572
02:06:39,916 --> 02:06:42,791
I don't know why
this mongrel is barking over here!

1573
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:45,708
Okay.

1574
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:49,416
Just tell me, where is your son?

1575
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:53,166
Sathya, where is Siddharth?

1576
02:06:53,875 --> 02:06:55,250
-What happened?
-Where is Siddhu?

1577
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:56,833
-Where is he?
-Do you see all these cars?

1578
02:06:56,916 --> 02:07:00,125
-Your son is in one of them.
-He isn't here!

1579
02:07:00,208 --> 02:07:01,166
Siddharth!

1580
02:07:01,875 --> 02:07:03,416
Get our daughter!

1581
02:07:03,875 --> 02:07:07,500
But your son is damn cute.

1582
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:10,208
He came out to smoke
and got stuck in our trap.

1583
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:12,625
You won't find him.

1584
02:07:13,291 --> 02:07:15,875
Parthiban, what is happening here?
Where is Siddhu?

1585
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:18,458
Who are you talking to?

1586
02:07:18,791 --> 02:07:21,916
If anyone other than me
comes here, kill them. Just kill them.

1587
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,291
-I can't do it--
-Don't let them go. Here.

1588
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,625
Go.

1589
02:07:28,166 --> 02:07:29,916
Lock the door from inside, Sathya.

1590
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:35,166
Okay, let's say you are not Leo.
But just think about it.

1591
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,500
Why would I kidnap your son?

1592
02:07:38,125 --> 02:07:42,208
Today, 22 years ago,
your sister died.

1593
02:07:43,166 --> 02:07:44,583
On this day.

1594
02:07:44,916 --> 02:07:47,791
And now, I kidnapped your son.

1595
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:50,333
Just imagine what I would do to him.

1596
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:55,125
Don't you understand?
I do not have a sister!

1597
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:57,208
Let go of my son! Tell me where he is!

1598
02:07:57,625 --> 02:08:00,500
Hey, step back! Get lost from here!

1599
02:08:00,625 --> 02:08:04,375
-Get lost!
-You'll definitely come, Leo!

1600
02:08:05,208 --> 02:08:07,791
Napoleon, open the door!

1601
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,458
Hey!

1602
02:08:18,166 --> 02:08:21,875
-Napoleon, they've kidnapped Siddhu.
-I don't know when they took him.

1603
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:24,833
Hey!

1604
02:08:26,791 --> 02:08:27,750
I'm also coming.

1605
02:08:36,666 --> 02:08:38,416
Here, sir! Shoot at them!

1606
02:08:45,833 --> 02:08:46,958
Load your gun.

1607
02:09:23,208 --> 02:09:24,583
Napoleon, handle the bike!

1608
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:26,916
Watch out!

1609
02:11:07,458 --> 02:11:09,041
Where is my son?

1610
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:11,166
Answer me, or I'll kill you!

1611
02:11:28,625 --> 02:11:29,916
Hey!

1612
02:11:37,208 --> 02:11:39,000
Siddhu?

1613
02:11:41,208 --> 02:11:42,291
Siddhu!

1614
02:12:20,041 --> 02:12:21,208
Where is my son?

1615
02:12:32,333 --> 02:12:33,625
I failed to kill you, Leo.

1616
02:12:35,041 --> 02:12:37,083
But I won't fail to kill your son.

1617
02:12:50,833 --> 02:12:52,916
I'm not the man you're looking for!

1618
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,333
I told you so many times!

1619
02:12:58,666 --> 02:13:00,833
Where is my son? Come on, tell me.

1620
02:13:01,166 --> 02:13:03,833
Speak up! Where is my son? Tell me!

1621
02:13:06,166 --> 02:13:08,333
Accept that you're my son.

1622
02:13:10,958 --> 02:13:12,833
And I'll let your son go.

1623
02:13:13,125 --> 02:13:15,791
Oh, God! I'm not your son!

1624
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:18,250
I'm not!

1625
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:05,750
Tell me.

1626
02:14:06,125 --> 02:14:07,208
Who are you?

1627
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:17,791
Harold, Leo killed Antony.

1628
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,208
I'm coming there with his son.

1629
02:14:23,166 --> 02:14:26,000
The doctor said Napoleon needed bed rest.

1630
02:14:26,833 --> 02:14:30,250
They won't stop here.
They will come looking for you.

1631
02:14:30,416 --> 02:14:31,750
Your son will be safe.

1632
02:14:32,416 --> 02:14:34,708
The entire police force
is looking for him.

1633
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:38,916
But you shouldn't stay here.
Your life is in grave danger.

1634
02:14:40,291 --> 02:14:41,583
Please listen to me.

1635
02:14:42,333 --> 02:14:45,041
I've arranged a car.
It's parked outside your house.

1636
02:14:45,375 --> 02:14:47,875
Collect your essentials and leave. Now!

1637
02:14:52,833 --> 02:14:53,750
Who is this?

1638
02:15:00,291 --> 02:15:03,291
Leo, no matter where you hide,

1639
02:15:03,375 --> 02:15:05,916
I'll come and find you.

1640
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:10,000
Don't play with my ego
just to fan your ego.

1641
02:15:10,458 --> 02:15:12,000
If you want your son back,

1642
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,750
hand over my brother to me.

1643
02:15:15,625 --> 02:15:18,375
Bring him here and take your son.

1644
02:15:29,958 --> 02:15:33,041
Here, Parthiban.
Go and save your son.

1645
02:15:44,833 --> 02:15:45,708
Hands up.

1646
02:15:49,166 --> 02:15:50,041
Keep walking.

1647
02:15:55,958 --> 02:15:58,041
Das, I've sent the boss' body.

1648
02:15:58,375 --> 02:16:01,500
We have boarded the train.
We'll be there in an hour.

1649
02:16:59,666 --> 02:17:03,041
Sir, as per your request,
I've given you your brother's body.

1650
02:17:03,875 --> 02:17:06,250
Please give me my son back.

1651
02:17:09,333 --> 02:17:12,583
I know, you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

1652
02:17:13,083 --> 02:17:14,583
-That's why I--
-Hey!

1653
02:17:18,583 --> 02:17:21,541
Don't be scared.
This is just my son's school bag.

1654
02:17:21,708 --> 02:17:24,291
Sir, this is my birth certificate,
and these are my educational certificates.

1655
02:17:24,375 --> 02:17:26,166
This is my ration card, Aadhar card,
and wedding photos.

1656
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:28,000
This was clicked
when my daughter was born.

1657
02:17:28,083 --> 02:17:29,666
This was clicked
on my son's first birthday.

1658
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:30,666
Look at this.

1659
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:34,833
This was clicked when I first sang
a patriotic song on the stage.

1660
02:17:35,041 --> 02:17:38,125
You don't believe me? See,
my name is here on the certificate.

1661
02:17:44,875 --> 02:17:49,916
Look. This is you
and your sister on your birthday.

1662
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,291
This is the honey badger
that had entered our tobacco field.

1663
02:17:53,583 --> 02:17:55,541
This photo was clicked
after it was killed.

1664
02:17:55,625 --> 02:17:57,708
Look how smart you look
with that blood-stained face!

1665
02:17:57,791 --> 02:17:58,791
I understand, sir.

1666
02:17:59,875 --> 02:18:03,333
It's not your fault
that you mistook me for Leo, sir.

1667
02:18:03,416 --> 02:18:05,375
He looks just like me.

1668
02:18:09,625 --> 02:18:11,875
Do you think I'm a fool?

1669
02:18:13,208 --> 02:18:15,833
-Sir…
-Do you think you're too smart?

1670
02:18:18,333 --> 02:18:19,416
Leo.

1671
02:18:19,833 --> 02:18:22,833
You know what I did to your twin sister.

1672
02:18:23,166 --> 02:18:25,041
I'm sure you haven't forgotten that.

1673
02:18:26,208 --> 02:18:28,166
You'd better accept that you are Leo.

1674
02:18:31,333 --> 02:18:35,208
Sir, I don't have a sister.
How do I make you understand?

1675
02:18:35,291 --> 02:18:36,208
Siddhu?

1676
02:18:44,916 --> 02:18:45,750
Sir.

1677
02:18:48,458 --> 02:18:51,125
In all these years,
he is scrutinizing someone

1678
02:18:51,583 --> 02:18:53,250
for the first time.

1679
02:18:53,708 --> 02:18:57,458
Human beings can lie.
Certificates can be fake.

1680
02:18:58,041 --> 02:19:00,583
But birds and animals never lie.

1681
02:19:00,666 --> 02:19:04,375
I've never seen an eagle
so closely in my life, sir.

1682
02:19:04,875 --> 02:19:07,041
Get it away from me. I'm scared.

1683
02:19:14,125 --> 02:19:18,250
Hey. You're putting up this act
just to protect your family, right?

1684
02:19:18,458 --> 02:19:20,583
But you committed a blunder there.

1685
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,166
You came here to save your son

1686
02:19:23,291 --> 02:19:27,875
but left your wife and your daughter
all alone at home. You're not that smart.

1687
02:19:28,666 --> 02:19:29,958
How would you feel

1688
02:19:30,041 --> 02:19:34,875
if I asked my men
to kill your wife and daughter?

1689
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:36,708
Hey!

1690
02:19:36,958 --> 02:19:38,708
-Get started.
-Okay, boss.

1691
02:19:49,125 --> 02:19:51,250
Sir, don't harm them.

1692
02:19:51,708 --> 02:19:52,750
Please, sir.

1693
02:19:57,291 --> 02:19:59,833
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1694
02:20:01,666 --> 02:20:03,833
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1695
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:05,375
Hey!

1696
02:20:05,458 --> 02:20:08,666
-What happened?
-Ask them not to harm my family, sir.

1697
02:20:32,916 --> 02:20:35,458
-What is it, Mom?
-Nothing, dear. Go back to sleep.

1698
02:20:35,708 --> 02:20:38,500
Sir, ask them not to go in.

1699
02:20:38,583 --> 02:20:40,500
-What's happening there?
-Sir, please.

1700
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:41,666
Keep moving.

1701
02:20:57,875 --> 02:20:58,875
Come with me.

1702
02:21:01,666 --> 02:21:03,291
Hey, you, climb up.

1703
02:21:06,166 --> 02:21:07,833
-Hey!
-Sir…

1704
02:21:07,916 --> 02:21:10,333
-Hey!
-Someone, please tell him.

1705
02:21:10,583 --> 02:21:12,666
Tell them not to go in, sir. Please.

1706
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:14,625
I am Parthiban, sir. I told you.

1707
02:21:22,750 --> 02:21:25,166
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1708
02:21:27,083 --> 02:21:29,666
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1709
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:39,333
-You climb up.
-I'm scared of heights.

1710
02:21:39,416 --> 02:21:40,333
Hey! Just go!

1711
02:21:51,375 --> 02:21:52,458
My side is all clear.

1712
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,416
Some of them are entering
through the main door.

1713
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:30,166
Hey!

1714
02:23:08,125 --> 02:23:09,000
Hey--

1715
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,458
Sir.

1716
02:23:13,541 --> 02:23:17,791
I killed all those who barged in
except for one guy.

1717
02:23:17,916 --> 02:23:19,791
He came in from a window.

1718
02:23:19,875 --> 02:23:21,916
Okay, Napoleon. I'll handle them.

1719
02:23:35,458 --> 02:23:36,458
Hey!

1720
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:39,750
Are you playing the fool with me?
I won't spare you!

1721
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:44,791
-Sir, please…
-Hey!

1722
02:23:44,875 --> 02:23:47,083
-Sir.
-Why are you hanging up on me?

1723
02:23:47,166 --> 02:23:48,916
-Sir.
-What is going on there?

1724
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,875
He's very smart.
He's set up traps all around the house.

1725
02:23:51,958 --> 02:23:53,333
All our men are dead.

1726
02:23:53,875 --> 02:23:57,250
Believe me. He is definitely Leo.

1727
02:23:57,625 --> 02:23:58,833
Who is in front of you?

1728
02:23:58,916 --> 02:24:01,000
His wife and daughter.
Shall I kill them?

1729
02:24:01,833 --> 02:24:04,125
No need. Put the phone on speakerphone.

1730
02:24:04,375 --> 02:24:06,083
Point the phone towards his wife.

1731
02:24:09,041 --> 02:24:11,916
You still have time.
Accept that you are Leo.

1732
02:24:12,208 --> 02:24:13,500
Then I'll let them go.

1733
02:24:15,083 --> 02:24:16,125
Parthi!

1734
02:24:19,541 --> 02:24:21,125
Sathya, don't panic.

1735
02:24:24,666 --> 02:24:25,708
Accept it.

1736
02:24:31,583 --> 02:24:32,750
Chakadbangadu.

1737
02:24:57,458 --> 02:24:58,375
Hey!

1738
02:24:58,458 --> 02:25:00,416
Did I make a joke?
Why are you laughing?

1739
02:25:00,583 --> 02:25:01,583
Me?

1740
02:25:02,583 --> 02:25:04,000
I think it's some rabid dog.

1741
02:25:20,625 --> 02:25:21,500
Hello?

1742
02:25:26,375 --> 02:25:29,625
I'd told you to instruct your men
not to go in, sir.

1743
02:25:29,708 --> 02:25:31,208
The poor fellows are all dead.

1744
02:26:00,625 --> 02:26:02,416
Now, the Leo we know will emerge.

1745
02:26:34,416 --> 02:26:37,833
Chittu, he has to accept that he's Leo.

1746
02:27:07,958 --> 02:27:09,541
Don't let go of him!

1747
02:28:13,625 --> 02:28:14,958
Chop him into pieces!

1748
02:29:16,250 --> 02:29:18,083
Hey, keep an eye on his son.

1749
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:21,875
Hey, Leo!

1750
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,708
Remember? I used this to kill your sister.

1751
02:32:07,458 --> 02:32:08,625
Now, I am sure…

1752
02:32:10,041 --> 02:32:11,083
that you are not Leo.

1753
02:32:11,750 --> 02:32:12,916
You are Parthiban.

1754
02:32:14,333 --> 02:32:17,666
You are not the person…

1755
02:32:20,208 --> 02:32:21,208
I was looking for.

1756
02:32:22,125 --> 02:32:23,375
Let's call it quits.

1757
02:32:23,916 --> 02:32:24,958
What do you say?

1758
02:32:26,125 --> 02:32:27,291
Drop your gun.

1759
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:29,375
Hey!

1760
02:32:30,125 --> 02:32:32,666
Lower your gun.
Didn't you hear it? Lower it.

1761
02:32:33,833 --> 02:32:36,041
Hey, either shoot at me or drop it!

1762
02:32:36,416 --> 02:32:37,416
Come on!

1763
02:33:01,416 --> 02:33:05,666
Leo!

1764
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:10,625
Leo!

1765
02:33:15,333 --> 02:33:19,375
-If I'm sweet, you're bloody sweet, Uncle.
-Hey!

1766
02:33:21,166 --> 02:33:24,791
I should've killed you
that day itself!

1767
02:33:25,791 --> 02:33:27,041
I made a mistake.

1768
02:33:29,291 --> 02:33:34,875
-Go to hell!
-Leo!

1769
02:33:35,583 --> 02:33:37,458
You dug your own grave!

1770
02:33:37,791 --> 02:33:40,166
"I want to see Leo. I want to find Leo."

1771
02:33:41,708 --> 02:33:43,083
You called me here!

1772
02:33:44,041 --> 02:33:45,041
Happy now?

1773
02:33:45,125 --> 02:33:50,083
Leo!

1774
02:34:01,541 --> 02:34:02,791
Drop your gun.

1775
02:34:14,958 --> 02:34:17,291
Go outside and check
if there are any vehicles.

1776
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,541
When we talk about one's past,

1777
02:34:24,625 --> 02:34:26,833
we get to hear some good things.

1778
02:34:27,708 --> 02:34:29,750
But that's not the case with me.

1779
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:34,458
Knowingly or unknowingly,
I have made many mistakes in the past.

1780
02:34:34,833 --> 02:34:39,041
The last chance I got to rectify
those mistakes was my family.

1781
02:34:39,458 --> 02:34:43,958
I will go to any extent
to protect this family.

1782
02:34:44,750 --> 02:34:47,250
The man called Leo is dead.

1783
02:34:48,333 --> 02:34:51,666
Now, if I have to convince
everyone that he is dead,

1784
02:34:52,083 --> 02:34:55,041
then first, I have to believe it myself.

1785
02:34:55,958 --> 02:34:58,500
I've accepted that Leo is dead.

1786
02:35:09,083 --> 02:35:10,375
How are you?

1787
02:35:12,416 --> 02:35:14,500
No matter how many people

1788
02:35:15,541 --> 02:35:19,375
come and ask me if I'm Leo,
I'll convince them all.

1789
02:35:20,833 --> 02:35:24,208
Even after all this, if someone
insists on knowing my story,

1790
02:35:24,583 --> 02:35:30,166
I'll tell them, but then
I'll kill them the next minute.

1791
02:35:38,125 --> 02:35:40,041
Of course, I'm Leo.

1792
02:35:41,083 --> 02:35:42,708
Leo Das!

1793
02:35:43,833 --> 02:35:46,208
My life is in this town

1794
02:35:46,291 --> 02:35:48,291
And I ain't going down

1795
02:35:48,375 --> 02:35:53,125
You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown

1796
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:55,541
My life is in this town

1797
02:35:55,916 --> 02:35:57,958
And I ain't going down

1798
02:35:58,291 --> 02:36:02,583
You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown

1799
02:36:02,708 --> 02:36:06,000
Just an ordinary person

1800
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:10,250
Yeah, I'm just a peace-loving soul

1801
02:36:11,791 --> 02:36:16,833
I'm just an ordinary person, yeah!

1802
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,875
I'm just a peace-loving soul

1803
02:36:20,791 --> 02:36:22,166
Peace-loving soul

1804
02:36:22,250 --> 02:36:24,625
My life is in this town

1805
02:36:58,416 --> 02:37:01,458
I tried to tell everyone
that I am not Leo.

1806
02:37:01,666 --> 02:37:03,750
But no one believed me. They hit me.

1807
02:37:04,208 --> 02:37:08,708
Finally, they accepted that I'm not Leo.
Other than this, nothing happened.

1808
02:37:08,791 --> 02:37:10,791
Promise me this is
what you'll tell your mom.

1809
02:37:10,875 --> 02:37:13,708
You promise me
you won't tell mom that I smoke.

1810
02:37:13,833 --> 02:37:17,416
I'm just an ordinary person!

1811
02:37:17,666 --> 02:37:21,666
Yeah, I'm just a peace-loving soul

1812
02:37:23,583 --> 02:37:27,166
I'm just an ordinary person!

1813
02:37:27,666 --> 02:37:31,250
Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul

1814
02:37:32,041 --> 02:37:33,750
Peace-loving soul

1815
02:37:35,291 --> 02:37:38,333
-What happened to your face, Dad?
-Keep quiet.

1816
02:37:38,791 --> 02:37:40,500
Siddhu, switch on the TV.

1817
02:37:49,625 --> 02:37:53,583
All you crazy people, try to recognize me

1818
02:37:53,666 --> 02:37:57,250
From where I came and who I am

1819
02:37:57,333 --> 02:38:00,958
All you crazy people, try to recognize me

1820
02:38:01,041 --> 02:38:04,458
From where I came and who I am

1821
02:38:05,666 --> 02:38:08,083
I think I forgot to lock the main door.

1822
02:38:08,791 --> 02:38:10,041
Shall I go and lock it?

1823
02:38:30,916 --> 02:38:31,875
Hello.

1824
02:38:32,166 --> 02:38:35,125
Just because you burned down
one datura factory,

1825
02:38:35,208 --> 02:38:39,458
do you think all your problems
will be solved, Parthiban--

1826
02:38:39,708 --> 02:38:41,291
Oh. I'm sorry.

1827
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,041
Leo.

1828
02:38:45,958 --> 02:38:48,708
If you want to make
this society drug-free,

1829
02:38:49,333 --> 02:38:52,541
you will have to burn down
many other factories in India.

1830
02:38:53,416 --> 02:38:56,291
Do you want to know who I am?

1831
02:38:59,583 --> 02:39:01,666
