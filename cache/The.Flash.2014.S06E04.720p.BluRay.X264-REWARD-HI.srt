00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,022
[Caitlin] <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,965
Dr. Harrison "Nash" Wells.

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,903
[Nash] <i>I'm searching for an artifact
that just happens to contain Eternium.</i>

00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,637
[Dibny] <i>The disappearance
of Sue Dearbon.</i>

5
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,056
I don't think I've ever seen you
this devoted to a case.

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,433
HLH isn't just my mother's disease.

7
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,517
Now, it's killing me.

8
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:17,560
You're a dead man, too.

9
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:18,560
Aren't you, Barry?

10
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,314
[Barry] <i>The only timeline
where everyone survives...</i>

11
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,691
was the one where I died.

12
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:24,275
And none of you can try and save me.

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,654
Analysis of Mitch Romero's blood
reveals that this substance

14
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>appears to heal any and all weaknesses
in the human body, including HLH.</i>

15
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,910
I need more.

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:47,881
Dr. Rosso.

17
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,634
Didn't mean to
sneak up on you like that.

18
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,344
It's almost Halloween,

19
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:53,722
I guess we're all due
for a good scare, right?

20
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,890
What brings you here so late?

21
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,935
I'm, uh, meeting up with a colleague.

22
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,730
[coughs] Yeah. I told him
I'd be here half an hour ago,

23
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,023
so if you'll excuse me.

24
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,568
Of course. It's good to see you.

25
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,242
[grunts]

26
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,580
[groaning]

27
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:25,712
[panting]

28
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,425
[grunts]

29
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:54,782
[screams]

30
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:57,327
[Barry] <i>I wish it didn't have to be
this way.</i>

31
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,080
And you're okay with all of this?

32
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,582
No, but...

33
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:08,213
I have to accept that there are still
others out there that we can save.

34
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,216
Yeah, guys, look. Six weeks from now,

35
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,510
all of our lives
are gonna be on the line,

36
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,887
so we have to be prepared.

37
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,597
Yes. But what about him?

38
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:21,810
I'm not just going to wait around
for him to get vaporized by antimatter.

39
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,020
We should be doing something
to try to save his life.

40
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,023
You can't. You can't, Cisco.

41
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,986
That's why I need you
to stop worrying about me.

42
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:36,074
If Barry had any other option,
we'd be doing it.

43
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,143
I think you gotta get behind this.

44
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,873
Yeah. I am.

45
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,424
How do you convince your best friend
not to save your life?

46
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,885
- [cell phone chimes and vibrates]
- You're the teacher. You'll find a way.

47
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,224
All right, well, he's gonna have
to wait. It's CCPD.

48
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,695
There he is.
[sighs] So much for my day off.

49
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,822
- What do we got?
- It's a creepy one.

50
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,075
Somebody broke into this facility last
night and stole ten liters of blood.

51
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,910
There's no security footage?

52
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,162
There's no cameras
in this part of the hospital.

53
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,707
- You think this is meta related?
- I'm asking you.

54
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,667
I mean...

55
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,920
Meta thieves usually
make a way bigger mess.

56
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,922
Ah, you see this lock?

57
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,675
I mean, the way this is sheared,
a power saw could've done this.

58
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:40,805
I don't know, I mean, maybe it was just
some kids pulling a Halloween prank.

59
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,559
Good. I thought we were dealing with
some kind of meta-vampire.

60
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,103
Just a normal criminal
with a diseased mind.

61
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,523
Well, since I am captain, I'm gonna go
watch the second half of the game.

62
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,276
- I'm gonna leave this to you. All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

63
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:54,902
You okay?

64
00:03:57,322 --> 00:04:01,159
Yeah, you know.
Just this Crisis that's coming.

65
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,453
Cisco's not taking it so great.

66
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:06,873
Let me guess which part.
Cisco's a whole lot like you.

67
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,042
It is in his nature to wanna save lives.

68
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,463
Especially under these circumstances.

69
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:16,007
- I'll see you later.
- Right.

70
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:21,554
- Thanks, Joe.
- Thanks for what?

71
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,349
I think I know how
to get through to Cisco.

72
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,688
[Ramsey] Tests are conclusive.
The peculiar black blood

73
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:35,360
I absorbed from Mitch Romero
temporarily cured

74
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:39,489
the HLH cancer in my blood,
but it wasn't enough.

75
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:44,911
I need more blood in order
to create a permanent cure

76
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,621
and save my life.

77
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,625
Adding Romero's cells to this new blood

78
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,003
should be the key
to rebuilding my cellular structure.

79
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:58,424
[breathing heavily]

80
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,850
I only hope I have enough time.

81
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,687
[Ramsey] <i>Why didn't you tell me?
It's brilliant.</i>

82
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,189
You're my son.
You're supposed to be impressed.

83
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,442
You're going to do beautiful things
for this world.

84
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,778
- [coughing]
- Are you okay?

85
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,322
- [coughing]
- Mum?

86
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,036
[Rachel] <i>My condition is terminal.</i>

87
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,416
[Cisco] I got your text. What is it now?

88
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,670
Look, I know you're upset about
this Crisis.

89
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,816
And I've been thinking about it,
and you're right.

90
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,467
We can do more than prepare for a fight.

91
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,886
You can save a life.

92
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,765
I knew you'd come around.

93
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,728
No, Cisco, not... It's not me.

94
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,731
We're gonna save Ramsey Rosso.

95
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:05,324
Here's the thing.
We've done some insane things

96
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,618
at S.T.A.R. Labs over
the last few years,

97
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:12,540
but curing a rare blood cancer,
that is beyond our resources.

98
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,125
So we just shouldn't try?

99
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:19,172
So we try and somehow succeed,

100
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,592
are we supposed to spend
the rest of your time here

101
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,428
trying to save everyone
who's been diagnosed with cancer?

102
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,911
- I mean...
- We start with one man.

103
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,517
Look, you heard what Caitlin said
about Ramsey.

104
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,520
He's one of the most
brilliant doctors on the planet.

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,691
I need you to back me on this.

106
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,527
You'll understand soon enough.

107
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:42,611
Look...

108
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,032
What would it take to cure HLH?

109
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,245
Honestly? An act of God.

110
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,829
[Nash] Or...

111
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:00,630
An act of science.
And I know just where to find one.

112
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,816
I'm assuming this is the Wells
that you were telling me about?

113
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,344
Yep. Nash Wells. Multiversal explorer

114
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:10,431
and provider of scientific miracles.
And you, I'm guessing,

115
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,976
are Barry Allen, the Flash.

116
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,311
How did he... How did you...

117
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,413
Hidden surveillance device.

118
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,647
You bugged S.T.A.R. Labs?

119
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,567
No, no. Not exactly.
I, um... I bugged you.

120
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,778
- No, you didn't.
- Mmm, yeah, I did.

121
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,323
Fellas, I've been listening
to your conversations,

122
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,075
and I have a proposition.

123
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,637
Now, I need an anti-vibrational
crypto-circuit to complete my work

124
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,597
on this Earth, and you need help
with your mission, right?

125
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,808
Well, you build me my circuit,
'cause I know you have the capacity,

126
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,667
and I will lead you
to something priceless

127
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,210
that will surely help your mission.

128
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,921
Your work? What's your work?

129
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,756
Thermic excavation.

130
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:49,428
You're a cosmic myth-buster
who also happens to be a geologist?

131
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,804
Sure.

132
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,099
- Sure.
- Sidebar.

133
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,104
- Red-flag city.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,608
Then again, Wells usually
shows up for a reason.

135
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,527
- Fellas?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,612
You're aware, um,
he's still bugged, right?

137
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,632
- Where's the bug? I don't see any...
- Okay, look. All right...

138
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,614
Not in your shoe.

139
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,176
- I can tell you that much.
- Let's just say that we trust you...

140
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,910
- We don't.
- ...which we obviously don't.

141
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,245
Understood.

142
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,538
What are you offering?

143
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,041
I'm offering you something that
will help save Ramsey Rosso's life.

144
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,572
- [knocking at door]
- [door opens]

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,009
Have I got something for you.

146
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:30,469
- [Dibny] My Amazon packages?
- No.

147
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,115
You know that case you've been working
on for the last couple of months,

148
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,640
the Dearbon woman?

149
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,726
Well, I know it's been cold lately,

150
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,103
so I have a little
Halloween treat for you.

151
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,980
- A lead.
- Yeah?

152
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,108
Yeah, I interviewed this accountant
in Midway City

153
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,044
that works at this security firm,
and one of their guards

154
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,446
was working a charity event
and claims to have seen

155
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,865
someone that sounds like Sue Dearbon.

156
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,452
So, Cecile pulled a favor
and got an eyewitness report.

157
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,413
Cool. Thanks, Iris.

158
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,250
[clears throat]

159
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,588
Need something else?

160
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,008
No.

161
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,802
No. That was... That was it.

162
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:14,805
Cool.

163
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,227
All right. Yeah. Cool.
I will see you later.

164
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,778
[Ramsey] Production of blood serum
is complete.

165
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,950
It appears identical to the substance
I absorbed from Mitch Romero.

166
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,453
If this works,

167
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:40,957
I could hold the cure
not just for myself,

168
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,043
but for all those suffering
from HLH cancer.

169
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,380
[groans]

170
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,089
[gasps in pain]

171
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,766
[groaning]

172
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,230
[yelling]

173
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,108
[grunts in pain] It's not working.

174
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,904
I failed. I failed.

175
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,959
[Nash] It's in there.
McCulloch Technologies.

176
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:17,994
[Barry] What is?

177
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:19,996
Well, it is extremely rare.

178
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,789
A bio-regenerative serum capable of

179
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,500
healing organic tissue
no matter what the harm.

180
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,335
So, for your purposes, what do you do?

181
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,272
You simply inject it
into your friend's healthy cells,

182
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:31,465
his healthy cells replicate,
they replace the unhealthy cells.

183
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,467
Presto, instant miracle.

184
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,594
Although, don't wait till
your buddy's too far gone

185
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,305
because then it might not work.

186
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,766
This sounds way too good to be true.

187
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,018
No, he's right.

188
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,454
I mean, how did McCulloch Technologies
develop something this advanced?

189
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,773
[chuckles] They didn't develop it.
They stole it. It's from Swan Moon-

190
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,318
- The Dominator home planet?
- Yeah, that's the one.

191
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,161
Recovered from some invasion
three years ago.

192
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,322
Anyway, blah-blah-blah.
You guys in, or what?

193
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,675
Well, how dangerous a weapon
could this be in the wrong hands?

194
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,869
On a scale of one to ten... 12.

195
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,225
We gotta get our hands on this thing.

196
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,375
All right, I'm gonna disable
the exterior security cameras.

197
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,754
[Cisco sighs]

198
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,132
Oh, he goes right through
the door. [chuckles]

199
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,302
- That's cool.
- How did you know this stuff was here?

200
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,347
Kid, multiversal explorer,
we need to know things.

201
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:25,186
And this serum, could it protect
someone from antimatter?

202
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,480
I expect that goes without saying.

203
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,025
[Nash] Whoo!

204
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,235
Cameras are down.

205
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,446
All right, boys.

206
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,243
Here's where the fun begins.

207
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,207
All right.

208
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,752
Speedster, come on.
Speed us to the storage room.

209
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,035
- No, duh, I can't.
- Wait, what do you mean, you can't?

210
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,840
There are localized meta dampeners
all over this building, all right?

211
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,550
My powers are useless in here.

212
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,968
That means you're useless here.

213
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,888
Hey, we don't have to make your circuit.

214
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,282
Oh, is that right, tough guy?
Have you thought about

215
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,076
what you're gonna do
if you don't make my circuit...

216
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,851
Hey, numbskulls, knock it off.

217
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,437
- [guard] Freeze! Both of you.
- [guns cocking]

218
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,979
Both of us?

219
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,494
So, we can explain.

220
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,788
I don't think they're gonna
ask questions first.

221
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,749
[device whirs]

222
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,919
[emitting high-pitched wail]

223
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,590
[all grunting]

224
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,178
- [Cisco] Nash?
- Hey, fellas.

225
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,764
- So your auditory nerves...
- What?

226
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,475
Your ears will be fine
in a couple of minutes.

227
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:51,105
Unlike these two. Now, where were we?

228
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,942
All right, let's hurry up.

229
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,944
There's another life at stake
besides our own.

230
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:12,751
Hey, Ralph. Any progress
on that Dearbon lead?

231
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,463
You know, I really think that
there might be something...

232
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,342
- to it.
- No. I decided to give it up.

233
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,511
What? Why?

234
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,221
There's no point, Iris.

235
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,390
The whole Sue thing is a lost cause,

236
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,726
so I might as well quit
before I waste any more time.

237
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,912
Ralph, you can't quit.
You're obsessed with finding her.

238
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,688
You have to keep going.

239
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,857
Iris, despite Team Flash's mantra,

240
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,610
sometimes you do have
to give up on things.

241
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,070
You know, if I were you,
I'd be spending a lot more time

242
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,281
with my husband while he's still here.

243
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,796
All right. Let the search begin.

244
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,801
Oh, man. Without super speed,
this is gonna take a minute.

245
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,387
We don't have to search every location,
just the cold ones.

246
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,681
Okay? Because the serum
we're looking for,

247
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,309
it requires an environment
of minus 15 degrees.

248
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,353
This says minus 15 degrees.

249
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,523
Well, there you go.

250
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:16,606
[Barry chuckles]

251
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,649
- Okay.
- Convenient.

252
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,444
Time to steal our golden idol.

253
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,907
[alarm chimes twice]

254
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,991
Do you guys hear that?

255
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,619
- What? No.
- I didn't hear anything.

256
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,914
[alarm chimes]

257
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,683
Wait. Yeah, I did hear that.
Is that an alarm?

258
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,085
It better not be.
I need more time to hack this.

259
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,545
I'm on it.

260
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:38,939
- No. Hey.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

261
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:39,963
I'm gonna follow him.

262
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,424
[whispers] Nash. Nash.

263
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,758
Nash.

264
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,511
[sighs] Okay.

265
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:02,111
I don't know where he went.

266
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,530
- I got it.
- Yeah?

267
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,656
Yeah.

268
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:07,824
No.

269
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,337
- We're too late.
- This can't be happening.

270
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,329
McCulloch must've already sold it.

271
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,832
We needed this to save Ramsey.

272
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,252
Boys! We got company.

273
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:22,006
Always wanted to say that. Here, catch.

274
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:27,219
- What is this?
- This? This is our way out of here.

275
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,281
What are you talking about?
What are we supposed to do with this?

276
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,723
It's easy. You just throw it.

277
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,307
Like now.

278
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,036
- [Nash] Whoo!
- [Barry and Cisco groan]

279
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,354
Well, that was exciting,
wasn't it, fellas?

280
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,147
[Cisco] The lounge?

281
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,398
How did we...

282
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,318
Oh, worry less about how
we got to the lounge

283
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,612
and more about
building my crypto-circuit.

284
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,114
That's not happening anymore.

285
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,784
Let me correct you, Barry Allen,
yes, it is. We had a deal.

286
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,096
Right? I would lead you
to something priceless, which I did,

287
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,122
not my fault the serum was gone.

288
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,834
So, now you two are
gonna build me a device.

289
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,798
I don't understand.
Why won't this blood work again?

290
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,343
[breathing heavily]

291
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,473
What am I missing?

292
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,185
[Ramsey] I found it, a cure for you.

293
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,271
[Rachel] The bonding agent in this cure
is dark matter.

294
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:22,858
So that's it? You're just deciding
to give up and... and die.

295
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,777
No one lives forever.

296
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,615
No. I won't give up. That's your choice.

297
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,284
Ramsey,

298
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,703
I'm not your enemy.

299
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,998
I know. The real enemy

300
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
is death.

301
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,259
You know, Nash isn't going anywhere
until he gets this crypto-circuit.

302
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,594
How's it coming?

303
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:51,929
Almost finished.

304
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,931
All right. [sighs]

305
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't know if you should.

306
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,686
Okay. What do you mean?

307
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,107
I mean, doesn't something
feel off about all this?

308
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,902
Yeah, I know. The guy shows up
needing our tech,

309
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,654
makes a bargain to help us,

310
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,532
and, conveniently,
the thing we need isn't there.

311
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:12,615
Right.

312
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:14,826
So, I mean...

313
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,246
You think he's lying to us?

314
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,125
It wouldn't be the first time
a Wells had a secret agenda.

315
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,710
[sighs] Yeah.

316
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,133
Yo, what's in here?

317
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,178
That's storage for Frost's stuff.

318
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,098
You know how she gets.

319
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,440
You haven't looked me in the eye
since I came in here.

320
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,032
Wait.

321
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,001
What the hell am I looking at?

322
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,339
Cisco.

323
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,600
You know exactly what this is.

324
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,810
I don't care what powers you have.

325
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,520
You want it,

326
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,190
you're gonna have to go through me.

327
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,115
What are you talking about?

328
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,867
And what the hell are you doing?

329
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,371
I'm saving your life
'cause someone has to do it.

330
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,539
Saving Ramsey...

331
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,126
- Saving Ramsey is my call.
- And it's a bad call.

332
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,878
But it's the one I made.

333
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,297
Sometimes as a leader,
you have to make tough calls

334
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,608
in order to serve the greater good.

335
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,635
You know, I made a tough call.
And I made it for you.

336
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,345
But I told you, you can't save me.

337
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,889
- I'm not buying that.
- Well, you have to.

338
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,601
Sacrificing myself saves everything
and everyone. I've seen it.

339
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,853
And what does that
give me to look forward to?

340
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,815
Waking up to a world without the Flash,

341
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,348
a life without my best friend?

342
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,526
You get to live.

343
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,529
You all get to live.

344
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,612
Don't.

345
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,996
Look, man, I've...

346
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,625
I've been dealing with this for weeks.

347
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,294
Wondering what's gonna happen

348
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,547
when I'm gone, how everybody
is going to move on.

349
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,551
That's why I wanted us, you and me,
together, to save Ramsey today.

350
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:43,141
You wanted us to save a random person
so I'd be okay with you dying?

351
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:47,354
No, I wanted us
to save one person's life

352
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,148
so you could understand the tough calls.

353
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,653
The sacrifices that
a leader has to make.

354
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,907
Because you're my pick.

355
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,912
You're the person that
I want to run S.T.A.R. Labs

356
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,539
and this team when I'm gone.

357
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:10,252
All day I've been trying to teach you
how hard those responsibilities can be.

358
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,466
And then you stole something that
was meant to save another person's life.

359
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,261
You justified it even.

360
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,682
And I'd do it again.

361
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,025
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

362
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,679
The serum is yours.

363
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,816
[knocking at door]

364
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,028
- Barry.
- Can we talk?

365
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,405
Um, now's really not a good time.

366
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,407
It's important.

367
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,705
I have something that
I need to give you.

368
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:33,585
S.T.A.R. Labs has been doing some
research into regenerative formulas,

369
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:37,089
and we've developed a serum.
We think that this could

370
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,757
save your life.

371
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,803
If you inject it
into your healthy cells,

372
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,596
they'll duplicate
and eventually overtake

373
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,848
your cells that are affected by HLH.

374
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,558
But you have to use it quickly.

375
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,311
Is it, um... Is it dark matter-based?

376
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,689
No, it's experimental,

377
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,483
but we believe it'll cure you.

378
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:58,734
Oh.

379
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,864
I'd given up hope.

380
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,160
Why... Why do this for me?

381
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,165
A week ago, you told me you felt like
you were falling off a cliff.

382
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,376
I want you to have a lifeline.

383
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:18,013
You're dying as well. Don't...
Don't you want a lifeline for yourself?

384
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,757
There's only enough of this
for one person.

385
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,343
And I've read about you, Ramsey.

386
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,388
And I've talked to Caitlin.
You're a brilliant doctor.

387
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,765
From what she said,
if you had enough time,

388
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,142
you could cure HLH.

389
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,061
I'm giving you that time.

390
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,522
The world needs people like you

391
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,775
to save those who can't save themselves.

392
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:44,614
Test it. Verify what we believe
it will do,

393
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,408
and then use it quickly.

394
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,493
We're not sure how long
the serum will be viable.

395
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,954
Barry.

396
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,083
Thank you.

with the Dearbon case.

402

Joe, I've been working on
this Dearbon thing since last summer.

403
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,655
Then it dawned on me.

404
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,410
Digging into this right now,
it... it doesn't matter.

405
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,246
Why the hell should I try to find her

406
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,915
and try to help her,

407
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,627
if I can't even save...

408
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,756
- Barry. You can say it.
- Barry.

409
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:49,513
Ralph, do you remember
my old partner, Chyre?

410
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,766
He taught me an important lesson.

411
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:57,437
He said you can't always save everyone,

412
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,193
but you can always save someone.

413
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,447
For you, that's Sue Dearbon.

414
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:09,866
Not Barry.

415
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,543
I'm gonna miss him, Joe.

416
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:35,808
That's it?

417
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,523
Fully functioning crypto-circuit?
You sure? 'Cause it kinda seems like...

418
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,149
It seems kind of shoddy...
shoddy workmanship.

419
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,442
I feel like I've seen better workmanship

on pretty much
all the other Earths out there.

421
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,030
This is subpar.

422
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,615
Subpar's being generous. It...

423
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,699
Never touch me.

424
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,704

433
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,449
Because it is impossible to save him.

And yet, I still don't think
I should stop trying.

Sure.

437

You can't save someone
who doesn't wanna be saved,

and he's already made up his mind.

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,224
S.T.A.R. Labs gave you a cure,
why didn't you take it?

477
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,559
I did, but it didn't work.

478
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,813
Turns out the disease in my human blood
was too far gone.

479
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,774
But if I was to become
something more than human...

480
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,026
That's when I realized
I could live forever.

481
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,694
As long as I feed.

482
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,405
Ramsey, you're a doctor.

483
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,657
You're supposed to save lives,
not take them.

484
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,034
I am saving lives, Flash. Mine.

485
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,830
And right now, you are in my way.

486
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:14,421
[snarls]

487
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,090
[gasping]

488
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:40,196
[snarling]

489
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,246
[grunts]

490
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:54,878
[all snarling]

491
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,237
Ramsey, come on. Let him go, please.

492
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:26,034
I can't. My blood brothers and sisters
are much more than just the help.

493
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,369
- They're making me stronger.
- You're using them.

494
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,454
To survive.

495
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,247
[creature snarls and groans]

496
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,546
Hello, Cait.
Playing the hero now, are you?

497
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,924
The bad guy was taken, so, yeah.

498
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,011
[snarls]

499
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,649
Please, help me.

500
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,150
I know what you're thinking.

501
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,069
You're fast, Flash.

502
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,073
But as a doctor, I know exactly
where this man's carotid artery is.

503
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,535
Even if I can't feed,
you will never save him in time.

504
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,162
Ramsey, don't do this. Let us help you.

505
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,666
What you're doing, it's inhuman.

506
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,752
It was my humanity
that was holding me back,

507
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:22,340
preventing me from becoming the man
Mum always knew I was destined to be.

508
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:27,554
She always said I'd do beautiful things
for this world.

509
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,056
And she was right.

510
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:34,978
Because the man I was,
that was the disease.

511
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:39,065
A frail, human body
with a shelf life. Rot.

512
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,443
But I found a way to transcend all that.

513
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,113
To defeat death itself.

514
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,573
Everyone dies, Ramsey.

515
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:50,118
Maybe the only thing that makes it
bearable is to find some meaning in it.

516
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,414
Well, that means I'm making
the greatest sacrifice of all.

517
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:58,835
Don't you see? What I'm becoming,
this is the cure.

518
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:02,589
I am the answer, Flash,
to the greatest mystery of all.

519
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,091
Life eternal.

520
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:06,527
- [inaudible]
- [doctor] Please, Dr. Rosso.

521
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:10,179
I saved you for last,
so you would be the most afraid.

522
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,848
Ramsey, please don't do this.

523
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,434
You could've saved Mum, but you didn't.

524
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,978
- And that's why I came here for you.
- Ramsey!

525
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:18,938
- [doctor gasping]
- [yells]

526
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,824
Stay with me, all right? I got you.

527
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:41,995
What the hell are they doing?

528
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,088
I think they're trying to follow Ramsey.

529
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,216
[growling]

530
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,430
Wait.

531
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,108
- We have to help him.
- I don't think we can.

532
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,793
We lost.

533
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:26,214
Five people aren't going home
to their families tonight.

534
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,342
And a sixth, Ramsey.

535
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,177
We lost him, too.

536
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,681
He's out there somewhere.
We have to stop him. I...

537
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:36,724
I have to stop him.

538
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,060
- Barry...
- You tried to save him.

539
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:42,271
But he turned himself into a monster.

540
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:44,941
That's not on us.
That was Ramsey's choice.

541
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:50,154
I swear, if it's the last thing
I do on this Earth,

542
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:51,989
I'm gonna stop him.

543
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,784
How did Ramsey do this, anyway?

544
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,786
He's using people as incubators.

545
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,874
Using their bodies to create
what he needs to keep himself alive.

546
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,752
So he's turning people
into human blood banks.

547
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,439
And as soon as he gets hungry again...

548
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,172
He's gonna make a withdrawal.

549
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,176
Well, happy Halloween, everyone.

550
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,054
Yeah.

551
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,067
Hey, Ralph.

552
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:31,612
Look. [sighs]

553
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,074
I know this Crisis news
hasn't been easy on anyone.

554
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,869
Yeah. [chuckles] I'll say.

555
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,748
But, look, Iris.

556
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,668
That's no excuse for me being a jerk.

557
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,128
I'm sorry.

558
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,632
I know that you were just trying
to help me.

559
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,470
So I did wanna say that tomorrow
I'm gonna call Midway City,

560
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,554
see what I can find.

561
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,514
That's great, Ralph.

562
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,018
Sue is very lucky to have
a master detective like you

563
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,352
searching for her.

564
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,772
Give me a break.
It's just a missing persons case.

565
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,373
It's not like
I'm looking to get married.

566
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,029
He gonna be okay?

567
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,032
Yeah, he is.

568
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,888
Of all of the nights for this madness
to be happening, it had to be Halloween.

569
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:21,912
[sighs]

570
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,332
Babe, we should probably head home.

571
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,960
Would you mind if I catch up
with you in a couple of minutes?

572
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:33,216
No. It's fine.

573
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:39,722
Barry.

574
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,190
Hey.

575
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,236
[sighs]

576
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,617
I'm sorry about what happened
at McCulloch...

577
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,869
No, man, no. No, look, this...

578
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,205
This is not your fault.

579
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,124
I should've been focused
on saving the right person.

580
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:11,254
Well, I mean, even though
things didn't work out with Ramsey,

581
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:14,215
at least we tried to do the right thing.

582
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,136
I still don't know how you do that, man.

583
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,140
Picking yourself up,
just pushing forward...

584
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,560
I don't know, I'm just trying to...

585
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,105
teach you what it's taken me
years to learn.

586
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,253
I know you're doing it for all of us.

587
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,781
That's what it means to be a hero.

588
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,327
I knew I picked the right guy.

589
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,041
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

590
00:36:58,634 --> 00:36:59,677
Hey, Joe.

591
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,139
- You all right?
- Mmm.

592
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,935
I was just...
just wondering where Ramsey was

593
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,232
and just hoping to God
that we find him before...

594
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,150
this gets worse.

595
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:18,404
His description has been circulated
to every precinct from here to Gotham,

596
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,781
so we should find him.

597
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,783
Then what?

598
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,704
More people are gonna get hurt.
Or worse.

599
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:29,456
I know.

600
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,084
I tried to save him.

601
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,755
Tried to do some good before I...

602
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,718
Don't you dare start talking like that.

603
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,012
You've done plenty of good.

604
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:48,184
Ever since you became the Flash,
you've saved more people

605
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,728
than CCPD altogether.

606
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,065
Without you, I would've...

607
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,860
I would have lost our family
a long time ago.

608
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,866
And this is what you get for saving
the world over and over again?

609
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,662
How is that right?

610
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,166
- You know it doesn't work like that.
- Doesn't it?

611
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,252
I mean, I'm a cop. If I risk my life

612
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,630
every day for 30 years,
I get to retire, Barr.

613
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,548
I get to go home to the woman I love.

614
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:24,095
I get to proudly watch my baby girl
grow up each and every day.

615
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,346
I get a life, Barr.

616
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,473
You're a hero. What do you get?

617
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:29,975
Nothing?

618
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,524
It's just...

619
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,734
Damn it. It's not right.

620
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,738
We... The world...

621
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,157
The world owes you.

622
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,326
You deserve better than this.

623
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,204
No, I don't.

624
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:57,378
I'm grateful for everything that I have.

625
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,048
All the blessings in my life.

626
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,593
For Iris, the team...

627
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:09,765
I mean, hell, I'm the Flash.

628
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm grateful for that.

629
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,317
But you...

630
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,282
You're what I'm most grateful for.

631
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,828
If it weren't for you,

632
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,873
your patience, your courage,

633
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,169
the will just to keep going,

634
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,048
I learned all that from you.

635
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,761
More than anyone else,
before the team, before Iris.

636
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,806
You're the one that showed me

637
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,519
what it takes just to be a good person.

638
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:01,817
You're one of the biggest reasons
I was even able to become the Flash.

639
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,779
For that, I'll always be grateful.

640
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:05,862
[sniffles]

641
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,244
Barr, I'm not ready.

642
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:15,414
I'm not ready for this.

643
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:16,831
[sniffles]

644
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,042
I'm just not.

645
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,586
- It's okay, man. It's all right.
- No. No.

646
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,964
[sniffs] I know you... I know you...

647
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,634
you say it has to happen, but...

648
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,470
It's all right.

649
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,430
It's okay.

650
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,520
I'm never gonna leave you.

651
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:40,064
Even when I'm gone.

652
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:55,329
[gauntlet beeping]

653
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,503
Let's try this.

654
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:05,338
[beeping]

655
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,199
So this is where you've been hiding.

656
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:51,927
[chuckles]

657
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:53,929
Time to pay a house call.
