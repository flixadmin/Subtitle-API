1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,868
<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,086
<i>Will it be for saving the world twice?</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,753
<i>Nope. We're the team who broke time.</i>

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,132
<i>That's right.
History has been torn to shreds.</i>

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,674
<i>Which means it's up to us to put it
back together again, piece by piece,</i>

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,850
<i>fixing these so-called anachronisms</i>

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,932
<i>before we get torn to shreds.</i>

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,939
<i>So, please, don't call us heroes.</i>

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,146
<i>We're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,631
<i>Previously
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,614
I would kill you...
But I'd just be killing myself.

12
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,240
I wanna break up Firestorm.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,490
<i>So that you can go home.</i>

14
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,577
When do we start?

15
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,154
Please allow me to introduce
Madam Eleanor.

16
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,559
<i>We have to stop Damien Darhk
from coming back to life.</i>

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,824
Stop this abomination.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,830
<i>You're too late.</i>

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,628
I remember everything.

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,802
Let's go.

21
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,364
You, you there!

22
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,945
Yeah, you don't belong here...

23
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,738
You're supposed to be on Stage 12!

24
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,269
We're about to roll, and
Mr. Coleson's already in a real mood.

25
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,853
We already have one actress
gumming the works,

26
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,960
we can't have extras wandering off, too.

27
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,090
We should've been rolling
half an hour ago.

28
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,467
Where the hell is my star?

29
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,712
Ms. Lamarr is still in make-up.

30
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,129
You gotta be kiddin' me!

31
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,577
How long does it take for a tomato
like that to put her face on?

32
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,435
She's playing Helen of Troy,
not Marie-Antoinette.

33
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,646
Holy cannoli, who is that?

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,412
That's it.

35
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,032
That look right there.

36
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,585
Can you do that on cue?

37
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,961
Forget Hedy. This is our star.

38
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,795
What's your name, sweetheart?

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,970
I'm Helen.

40
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,597
Helen of Troy.

41
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,135
You are now, toots.

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,386
"The face that sold a million tickets!"

43
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,597
All right people, let's roll.

44
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,408
Oh, hey, Sara, Sara.

45
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,972
I've been searching for more outliers

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,036
in the hopes of finding Darhk
and his witchy friend.

47
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,581
You think having a supercomputer
would be helpful.

48
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,242
<i>Watch yourself, Mr. Heywood.</i>

49
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,540
Anyway, there's no sign of them
in the timeline.

50
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,633
What is that smell?

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,322
Okay, full disclosure. I haven't left
the library in seven days.

52
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,087
I think. Is it Tuesday?

53
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,264
I'm not really sure.

54
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,630
It's hard for me to keep track of
time in a temporal zone.

55
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,058
Shower. Now.

56
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,265
Okay. I'll shower after I find Darhk.

57
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,874
I know how much it means to you
to find him.

58
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,168
We're going to put Darhk
back in the ground where he belongs,

59
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,192
but not like this.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,896
- Not like what?
- Not like Rip.

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,152
He lost perspective
and got his team killed.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,816
I'm not gonna be that kind of captain.

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,909
But I am the kind of captain that
tells you to clean yourself up. Okay?

64
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,787
Aye, aye.

65
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,071
Thanks to your research, Marty,

66
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,494
the nanites I injected
into your blood streams

67
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,496
should be locking onto
your respective halves

68
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,586
of the Firestorm Matrix.

69
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,125
I'm only hoping that the polymer
I constructed

70
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,541
is strong enough to transfer your half

71
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,463
from you, to him.

72
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,763
A little too much "should" and
"hoping" for my comfort. But then,

73
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,014
what is science if not
the exploration of the unknown?

74
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,552
Ray, I'm telling you right now.

75
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,603
If you kill me,
I'm gonna haunt you forever.

76
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,269
Well, just remember. This was your idea.

77
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,838
If you guys are getting cold feet,
we can call the whole thing off.

78
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,320
Absolutely not. We proceed
with courage and confidence.

79
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,574
It's time for Jefferson to claim
the power of Firestorm for himself.

80
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,196
I appreciate that, man.

81
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,745
But come on, admit it,
you're gonna miss this a little.

82
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,035
I mean, being a superhero, saving time?

83
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,125
Not at all.

84
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,704
Were it not for this affliction,

85
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,457
my adventuring days
would be long behind me by now.

86
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,964
<i>Time travel is a young man's game.</i>

87
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,542
I'm eager to close this chapter
and embrace the next.

88
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,796
Well, let's set this old man free.

89
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,469
Uh, Ray, let's do it.

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,973
All right. Here goes.

91
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,444
Whoa. What's going on?

92
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,568
The system seems to be overheating.
There's too much power.

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,191
Shut it down, quickly!

94
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,284
Marty! Marty! Are you okay?

95
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,169
A little bruised,
Dr. Palmer, but I'll live.

96
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,166
- Wait, what?
- Everything hurts.

97
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,634
Whoa! Ooh.

98
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,462
Look at my hands!

99
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,470
They're white.

100
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,346
And mine appear to be African American.

101
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,971
You can just say "black," Grey.

102
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,225
- You're me, and I'm you?
- You're me, and I'm you?

103
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,231
Oh, pancakes.

104
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,943
<i>Attention, Legends.</i>

105
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,855
<i>Captain Lance requests
that all personnel</i>

106
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,316
<i>report to the bridge immediately.</i>

107
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,328
I guess we know where the explosion
came from.

108
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,992
- What happened?
- Yes,

109
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,534
pray tell, Dr. Palmer,
what exactly happened to us?

110
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,587
Because, it seems, we are in
a particularly precarious situation

111
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,960
that I for one have no idea
how to remedy.

112
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,294
Why don't we just merge?

113
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,881
Out of the question! Absolutely not.

114
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,759
<i>We have switched bodies. Who knows
what else may have shifted.</i>

115
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,175
Merging now could cause a meltdown of
insurmountable proportions.

116
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,226
We just can't afford the risk.

117
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,395
You're the Professor.

118
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,027
And you're Jax.

119
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,611
Switched.

120
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,444
Must be Tuesday.

121
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,067
What's going on?

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,994
Well, we seem to have
a bit of a <i>Freaky Friday</i> situation.

123
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,912
- I'm Jax.
- And I am Martin.

124
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,082
Cool.

125
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,749
So, this is why we've been summoned?

126
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,209
No, actually.

127
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,707
Tell them.

128
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,872
1937, Hollywood, California.

129
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,166
A beautiful woman mysteriously appeared

130
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,923
and threw the entire film industry
into chaos.

131
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,671
<i>She, apparently, was so beautiful,</i>

132
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,804
that both, Warner Brothers

133
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,178
and K&G Pictures went to war over her.

134
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,058
<i>And it got ugly fast.</i>

135
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,978
Literal backs were stabbed. People died.

136
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,864
Those Hollywood idiots
probably had it coming.

137
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,187
Maybe. But this
wasn't supposed to happen.

138
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,893
So, we are going to fix it.

139
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,401
It will be a nice, easy mission.
It will get our mojo back.

140
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,528
Awesome. Maybe now, I might actually
get to meet some celebrities.

141
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,362
And how would you even know?
The oldest movie you've ever watched

142
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,538
is some ridiculous farce
called <i>Police Academy.</i>

143
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,206
Don't knock the Academy, Grey!

144
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,913
Doesn't matter. Because you two
are a liability like this.

145
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,369
And you're staying on the ship.

146
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,623
- Oh, fantastic.
- Wait, what?

147
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,043
Gideon, plot a course for Tinseltown.

148
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,718
<i>You're sad.</i>

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,513
<i>Paris has gone off to fight Menelaus.</i>

150
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,053
<i>He may die.</i>

151
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,849
<i>How could you live with yourself
if you lost him?</i>

152
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,986
<i>Cut!</i>

153
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,778
<i>That was aces!</i>

154
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,650
Check the gate. Moving on.

155
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,552
All right, everybody.
You heard the man.

156
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,568
We got a movie to make.
Let's go, people!

157
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,870
I got eyes on her.

158
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,824
All right. Remember, we're doing
recon only. Nobody moves on her.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,366
Let's see what we're dealing with.

160
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,750
<i>What can you tell us?</i>

161
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,251
She's really, really pretty.

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,548
She looks familiar,
like I've seen her somewhere.

163
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,967
I'm sure she's never heard
that one before.

164
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,658
The gossip I'm hearing is that
this woman is seriously method.

165
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,522
<i>She hasn't broken character
since she got here.</i>

166
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,558
I'm going in.

167
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,179
Maybe I can talk to her.

168
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,927
Negative. Recon only.

169
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,861
I don't wanna spook her.
She's out of her time.

170
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,979
I'm so sorry, miss.

171
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,523
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

172
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,008
Hey, watch what you're doing.
You almost took her head off.

173
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,864
- Are you okay?
- Yes, it's really nothing.

174
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,535
Get lost, you twit!

175
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,056
- I asked the lady a question.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

176
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,571
Oh, try stopping me, tough guy.

177
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,949
That escalated quickly.

178
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,751
What's going on?

179
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,331
There's only one woman in history
who had this effect on men.

180
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,002
She really is Helen of Troy.

181
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,889
She's on the move.

182
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,266
<i>Follow her.</i>

183
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,110
What's she doing now?

184
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,730
She's alone now. She looks upset.

185
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,509
What are we waiting for? Let's grab her!

186
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,901
Kidnapping in broad daylight?
Even we shouldn't be so careless.

187
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,990
Jax... I mean, Martin is right.

188
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,205
We have to wait.

189
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,748
What the hell is going on here?

190
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,084
Where's Helen?

191
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,711
Well, find her. Now.

192
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,879
Z, you've got incoming.

193
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,788
The studio boss is looking
for his new face.

194
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,543
Yeah, so is someone else.

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,092
My, oh, my.

196
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,547
Now, the rumors I've been hearing
could not do you justice.

197
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,931
You really are something special.

198
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,393
The name's Eddie.

199
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,929
Eddie Rothberg. K&G Pictures.

200
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,565
I'm Helen.

201
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,148
That's right, honey. Don't do it.

202
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,143
Someone taught you not to get
into cars with strangers, right?

203
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,857
Hop in.

204
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,356
Or not.

205
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,405
Rothberg. Helen!

206
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,074
Wait, stop!

207
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,285
Rothberg, you son of a bitch!

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,412
I'll kill you myself, you rat bastard!

209
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,960
Did that just happen?

210
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,629
Paris stole Helen from Menelaus.

211
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,968
And the war began.

212
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,145
I thought the Helen of Troy story
was just a myth.

213
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,047
Well, we've found that myths
tend to have some truth about them.

214
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,312
This one more than most.

215
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,318
Helen and her lover, Paris,

216
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,525
set off a ten-year war that launched
thousands of ships

217
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,612
and sent tens of thousands of men
off to their deaths.

218
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,905
All in the name of her beauty.

219
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,040
You make it sound like it's her fault.

220
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,743
Men always find a reason to fight.
That's not on her.

221
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,087
Depends.

222
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,796
- How hot is she?
- I mean, she's all right.

223
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,002
She's really hot.

224
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,445
Seems kind of little league, right?
I mean, what's the big deal

225
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,506
if this chick gets to make
a bunch of movies?

226
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

227
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,591
Helen is taking over the classics
like an infestation.

228
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,265
What's <i>Casablanca</i>
without Ingrid Bergman?

229
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,767
<i>Philadelphia Story</i>
without Katharine Hepburn?

230
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,268
It's inconceivable.

231
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,772
And now, this upstart steals
the career-making role

232
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,195
of Hedy Lamarr, my boyhood crush!

233
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,780
Sorry, I'm still adjusting.

234
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,986
Look, I've seen the chaos
that she causes with my own eyes.

235
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,036
We need to get Helen
out of the movie business

236
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,455
before anybody else gets hurt.

237
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,699
Gideon, where's Helen now?

238
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,103
<i>I checked the tabloid archives</i>

239
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,710
<i>and it so happens Edward Rothberg
of K&G Pictures</i>

240
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,584
<i>is throwing a gala this afternoon
to show off his latest star.</i>

241
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,500
Which would be
the one and only Helen of Troy.

242
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,554
Everybody, go put your best gigs on
because we're gonna save Hollywood.

243
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,674
Yeah, until the Kardashians destroy it.

244
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,645
Finally, a positive side effect
to our predicament.

245
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,567
I'm absolutely giddy at the notion
of attending a 1930s Hollywood gala.

246
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,568
Maybe I'll rub elbows with Clark Gable.

247
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,437
Or dance with Ginger Rogers.

248
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,384
Well, you have a little extra fun
for me, Grey,

249
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,408
I'm sitting this one out.

250
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,494
- Why? What's wrong?
- I'm wasted, man.

251
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,530
My joints ache. I feel like

252
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,285
I'm walking under water.

253
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,956
And I have to use the bathroom,
like, all the time.

254
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,753
I assure you,

255
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,290
the moment we get Helen back
to her proper time,

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,757
we will fix this.

257
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,877
Damn, I look good.

258
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,937
What's wrong? Are you all right?

259
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,935
Can we please go back in time and murder

260
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,861
whoever invented stockings?

261
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,825
<i>Any sign of Helen?</i>

262
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,036
No, but Ray's becoming friends
with Cecil B. DeMille.

263
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,538
That is one remarkable mug, young man.

264
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,035
And you've never been in a picture?

265
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,492
No, not that I recall.

266
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,438
Well, I'm shooting one next month.

267
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,670
Cary Grant backed out,
but this profile of yours

268
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,338
might just have him outdone.

269
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,878
Stick with me, and they'll be saying,
"Cary who?"

270
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,381
Ray is ready for his close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,327
<i>There she is!</i>

272
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,387
<i>You found Helen?</i>

273
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,644
No,

274
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,895
it's Hedy Lamarr.

275
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,846
<i>The most beautiful woman in the world.</i>

276
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,148
Not only is she a talented actress,

277
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,939
but she's a genius.
Brilliant and beautiful.

278
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,902
- I'd do her.
- Trust you, Mr. Rory,

279
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,157
to take something precious
and debase it.

280
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,943
<i>She's also an inventor.</i>

281
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,240
Her patent on frequency hopping alone
revolutionized the world.

282
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,825
Tuck in your shirt.

283
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,834
Ms. Lamarr,

284
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,592
I just wanted to say that
I'm one of your biggest admirers.

285
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,795
You are a remarkable actress.

286
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,761
How would you know? I haven't acted
in any American films,

287
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,096
and now, I probably never will.

288
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,645
I came here today

289
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,188
to take one last shot
at making my dreams come true

290
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,515
and meet Mr. DeMille.

291
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,812
But the closest I'll get to Mr. DeMille

292
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,645
is transferring his calls
at Warner Brothers.

293
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,897
Operator, how may I direct your call?

294
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,493
Surely someone with your talent
will find work as an actress.

295
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,528
Tough luck finding work
when she's in the room.

296
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,873
Who?

297
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,503
Any girl can look glamorous.

298
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,335
She just has to stand still
and look stupid.

299
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,840
Is everyone in position?

300
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,556
Yes.

301
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,174
Thank you.

302
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,484
- Sandwich.
- No.

303
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,649
<i>Ray? Nate?</i>

304
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,823
Rory?

305
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,156
Holy! Helen of Troy.

306
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,528
Yeah, that spells hot.

307
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,119
<i>Guys, snap out of it.
We've got a job to do.</i>

308
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,994
Check out her security detail.
The woman's a prisoner.

309
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,797
Not for long.
We just need to get her alone.

310
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,050
Z?

311
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,716
Oh.

312
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,343
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh.

313
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,678
Please excuse me.

314
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,102
Nice.

315
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,308
Ray, suit up and meet us
at the balcony for extraction.

316
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,308
Helen, you have to come with us.

317
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,018
You don't belong here, and you know it.

318
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,229
You must be from Warner Brothers.

319
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,066
Tell Arnold that I'm sorry, but
I left him for a better opportunity.

320
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,117
Oh. You actually are a good actress.

321
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,446
Yeah, I hear they have
a decent theater scene in Troy.

322
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,997
<i>We should go check it out.</i>

323
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,584
No.

324
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,708
No, the gods have answered my prayers
by bringing me here.

325
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,464
<i>This place is strange,</i>

326
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,544
but I'm learning its rules.

327
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,543
<i>And the first rule of Hollywood is,</i>

328
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,505
"Never discuss business
without your agent present."

329
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,475
Guess she's not just a pretty face.

330
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,056
Everybody, get ready to move.
We're gonna go fast.

331
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,021
...the other day. We're out of...

332
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,027
Helen, darling, why don't you
run along and find Mr. Rothberg.

333
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,447
Gladly.

334
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,146
What the hell are you doing here?

335
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,114
Aside from collecting my 15%?

336
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,116
You're her agent?

337
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,290
You know I have the killer instinct
that this job requires.

338
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,957
I didn't come here to fight.

339
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,916
I came to talk.

340
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,592
And I didn't come alone.

341
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,722
If you don't take me up on my offer
for parley,

342
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,723
things could get ugly for you,
your team, and Hollywood's elite.

343
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,316
All right.

344
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,481
Everybody, stand down. Darhk and I
have some catching up to do.

345
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,399
Thank you.

346
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,661
Don't worry.

347
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,654
Poison is a coward's weapon,

348
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,082
and our conflict
is at a brief stand still.

349
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,169
You're from Zambesi?

350
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,841
And your powers.

351
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,292
Where do they come from?

352
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,654
I would have thought
you would have been able

353
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,169
to sense one of your own.

354
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,297
You're a totem bearer.

355
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,842
You wanted to talk, so talk.

356
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,768
Oh, you know, for someone who died,

357
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,811
you don't appreciate
the simple things in life.

358
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,890
Me? I'm a changed man,

359
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,942
which is why I'm trying to do this
the civilized way.

360
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,186
- Do what?
- Convince you and your friends

361
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,737
to pack up and ship out.

362
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,610
You want Helen to stay?

363
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,697
What can I say?
Anachronisms are good for business.

364
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,738
- You wield the Water Totem.
- In a manner of speaking.

365
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,869
The totem is now a part of me.

366
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,246
And you've perverted it.

367
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,248
Totem bearers must protect the innocent,

368
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,045
not use it for selfish gain.

369
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,627
You dare lecture me on selfishness?

370
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,092
You're the one who has turned
her back on her own people

371
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,215
in favor of these bungling idiots.

372
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,921
You know nothing about me.

373
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,593
You really do look lovely.

374
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,222
That color always suited you.

375
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,730
<i>So, are you an actor?</i>

376
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,692
Yes, um, well, maybe. My name's Ray.

377
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,448
Haircut. Time to leave.

378
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,154
Didn't you hear us on the comms?

379
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,323
No, my comms aren't working.

380
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,829
<i>Just ignore them. They're being rude.</i>

381
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,599
Let's get back
to our private conversation.

382
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,878
<i>What are you doing?</i>

383
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,135
Get your mitts off of me!

384
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,300
Unhand the lady!

385
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,019
Are you all right?

386
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,723
I am now.

387
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,187
How convenient.

388
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,025
And here, I was thinking
I was gonna have to convince you

389
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,401
what a mess your team makes of things,

390
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,651
and that you'd all be better off if you
just went back to your old lives.

391
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,657
Which brings me to my offer.

392
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,364
I'll let you all walk, unharmed,

393
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,538
if you all leave now,
and go back to 2017.

394
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,328
Or what?

395
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:56,713
Or... I'll kill your merry band
of idiots, one by one,

396
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,168
saving you for last.

397
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,532
And then you'll die knowing
you could have saved them all,

398
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,924
if you'd only made the right choice.

399
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,524
What were you guys thinking?

400
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,215
They weren't.
Like every man in the room,

401
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,990
they were just captivated by Helen.

402
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:26,197
Okay, in our defense,
she was very, very, very attractive.

403
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,287
I was just admiring her personality.

404
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,915
So, you jackasses decided to impress her

405
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,337
- by having a fight?
- Mick started it.

406
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,734
All right. Enough finger-pointing.

407
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,795
We need to focus on the real issue here.

408
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,046
Damien Darhk.

409
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,378
Wait, Darhk was there
and you're still alive?

410
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,213
He didn't want to fight,
he wanted to talk.

411
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,593
And he made us an "offer."

412
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,762
We stop doing what we're doing,

413
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,519
no more <i>Waverider,</i>
no more fixing anachronisms.

414
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,188
Why does Darhk care
if we fix Anachronisms or not?

415
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,753
I don't know. We didn't have time
to get into his evil-agenda.

416
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,394
Well, we've seen what Darhk can do.
Can we even fight him?

417
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,564
Especially now, if he's walking
with the time caddy and water witch?

418
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,275
She's not a witch. Her name is Kuasa.

419
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,278
And she possesses
one of the lost totems of Zambesi.

420
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,118
- Kuasa...
- Darhk massacred

421
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,450
those Time Bureau agents
in Victorian London

422
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,501
without even batting an eyelid.

423
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,249
What if we can't take them?

424
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,415
This might be our best offer.

425
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,709
You don't offer a deal
unless you want something in return.

426
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,798
<i>Besides, if he lets us walk,</i>

427
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,880
he's just gonna take us out one by one.

428
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,638
He's right. We're stronger together.
We know that.

429
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,395
Darhk knows that.

430
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,812
All right. Let's get Helen on the ship.

431
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,107
<i>Nope!</i>

432
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,187
After that party,
you three are grounded.

433
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,838
And I need you and the Professor
to figure out

434
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:38,922
why our comms aren't working.

435
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,733
You mean me and the professor?

436
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,115
Whatever.

437
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Amaya.

438
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,786
What's up?

439
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,743
Uh, I just wanted to wish you guys
good luck out there.

440
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,042
Thank you.

441
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,131
Not too shabby.

442
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,382
As far as prisons go.

443
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,056
It's the same security detail
from the party.

444
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,599
Guess Helen's still inside.

445
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,779
You really think
they'll fall for this stunt?

446
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,517
Have men gotten smarter
in the past few thousand years?

447
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,649
Nope.

448
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,697
Dude, this is impossible.

449
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,450
I can barely get my hands
inside this console,

450
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,950
let alone handle the wiring.

451
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,625
How am I supposed to fix something
if my fingers don't work?

452
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,621
It's called arthritis.

453
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,795
And just so you know,
I don't enjoy being inside you

454
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,377
any more than you enjoy being inside me.

455
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,722
What did I...

456
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,430
Don't be so puerile.

457
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,224
Come on, Grey! Don't pretend

458
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,848
like you weren't having
the time of your life at that party.

459
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,227
I don't catch your meaning.

460
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,186
Telepathic link.

461
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,520
Let's just say, I can tell

462
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,852
if you weren't married,

463
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,774
you and Ms. Lamarr

464
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,816
would be doing the nasty in the past-y.

465
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,487
Nasty in the...

466
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,447
I'll have you know that Ms. Lamarr
is my "hall pass."

467
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,453
Clarissa gave you a freebie?

468
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,825
It was her idea.

469
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,668
Something to spice up our marriage.

470
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,416
She picked Jean-Claude Van Damme

471
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,748
and thinking
the whole exercise ridiculous,

472
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,255
I chose Hedy Lamarr,

473
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,840
never thinking
I'd actually get the chance.

474
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,171
Why, 'cause she's dead?

475
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,928
She's not dead here, you dog.

476
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,809
No deliveries tonight.

477
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,111
Really?

478
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,522
'Cause I got Mr. Rothberg's
prized horse back there.

479
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,573
Nothin' here about no horse.

480
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,526
Well, I don't know what to tell ya.

481
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,410
Fine. Just gonna need to check the back.

482
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,883
Oh, you mean his prized whores.

483
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,051
- Did he just call us...
- Yeah.

484
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,641
Please don't scream.

485
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,064
She said "please." You'll behave?

486
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,893
Please don't take me away.

487
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,062
Sorry, but this isn't your home, Helen.

488
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,606
Do you have any idea what it's like
on the plains of Troy?

489
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,359
This land of Hollywood

490
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,777
<i>it's far from perfect,</i>

491
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,243
but, at least, men aren't killing
one another in my name.

492
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,795
Not yet anyway. We got incoming.

493
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,548
Rothberg!

494
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,593
You think you can poach my talent,
you no-good son of a bitch!

495
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,468
I dare you to come at me,
you dumb bastard!

496
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,928
Why does this always happen?

497
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,805
I truly am cursed.

498
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,650
Hey, this isn't your fault.
But you can make it stop.

499
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,986
Come with us.

500
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,447
We can't let those idiots
kill each other.

501
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,588
You protect them.
I'll get Helen out of here.

502
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,316
What do you think you're doing
with Rothberg's girl?

503
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,332
Just renegotiating her deal.

504
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,757
Great Zeus.

505
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,051
They're warriors.

506
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,228
Sorry, fellas.

507
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,523
Your new starlet decided
she's better off a free agent.

508
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,537
This vessel, it's remarkable.

509
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,668
Wait till you see her fly.
Gideon, show her what you can do.

510
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,552
Gideon?

511
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,844
What's going on?

512
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,842
Gideon!

513
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,035
Have you figured it out yet?

514
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,721
Socket wrench, Grey!

515
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,973
Does this look like a socket wrench
to you?

516
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,555
I specialize in sub-atomic particles,

517
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,483
not hand tools!

518
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,569
That's obvious.

519
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,811
<i>Anyway, it doesn't matter.</i>

520
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,653
Comms weren't the only thing affected,

521
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,073
half the ship's systems are down.

522
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,400
Oh, crap.

523
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,111
Please tell me we're not stuck in 1937.

524
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,615
Gideon and other vital systems
are offline.

525
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,663
How is that even possible?

526
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,004
Could be Damien Darhk.

527
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,089
What better way to catch us
than to shut down the <i>Waverider?</i>

528
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,758
It's like parts of the ship
are straight-up vanishing.

529
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,301
Of course they are, Jefferson!

530
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,635
Because in this version of history,
those technologies no longer exist.

531
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,385
Wait, what are you talking about, Jax?

532
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,762
I mean, Marty.

533
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,312
Can't you see?
This is all because of Hedy Lamarr.

534
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,930
As you know, Dr. Palmer,

535
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,890
technological advances are cumulative.

536
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,642
They build over time.

537
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,569
- And it seems, her patent...
- Is the backbone

538
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,146
for half the <i>Waverider's</i> systems.

539
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,277
And without it,
we're essentially, well...

540
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,694
Screwed. Where's Hedy now?

541
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,664
She said she was starting a new job
as an operator for Warner Brothers.

542
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,895
It shouldn't be hard to get her
resigned with Mr. Coleson

543
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,285
now that his "It girl" is gone.

544
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,378
Where are you going?

545
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,126
To get Ms. Lamarr's career
back on track.

546
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,084
You better not just be calling in
your "hall pass," Grey.

547
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,842
I don't want to overstep,
but may I ask...

548
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,308
What gods gave you
such incredible powers?

549
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,557
Uh, gods didn't give us powers.

550
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,647
Well, maybe they kind of did
for Amaya and me.

551
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,895
But the captain is a self-made woman.

552
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,644
Sara trains every day.
She's a total bad-ass.

553
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,154
She's a captain, too?

554
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,481
- Yeah.
- It gives me hope,

555
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,011
knowing that you come from a time

556
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,448
where women have
the same opportunities as men.

557
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,654
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

558
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,248
Anywhere must be better
than where I came from.

559
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,744
I spent the last five years alone,
locked up in a tower.

560
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,085
My only view was the distant battle
waging below.

561
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,421
Men killing each other.

562
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,170
For what? Me?

563
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,391
And now you want to send me back
to that hellish place.

564
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,142
<i>Warner Brothers.
How may I direct your call?</i>

565
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,526
<i>Warner Brothers.
Please hold.</i>

566
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,657
Ms. Lamarr.

567
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,863
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Coleson is in the commissary.

568
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,286
You have to talk to him
and get your contract back.

569
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,576
Why do you care so much?

570
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,083
Warner Brothers,
how may I direct your call?

571
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,753
There must be a better way
of switching signals!

572
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,753
There is.
You're meant for better things.

573
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,335
You have no idea the adventures
you'll miss out on

574
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,011
if you don't follow me out that door.

575
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,387
You're crazy.

576
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,553
Sometimes you have to be
if you want to burn bright.

577
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,363
Oh, no.

578
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,655
This is our lucky day.

579
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,251
Wait. You're that talent agent
from the party.

580
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,328
Ms. Lamarr...

581
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,080
Oh, I assure you,

582
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,247
I'm something far more ruthless
than a Hollywood agent.

583
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,496
If that's possible.

584
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,966
Okay, I didn't actually think
you'd take me up on my offer

585
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,056
but after my warning,

586
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,383
I thought you people
would at least use the buddy system.

587
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,477
But here you are,

588
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,848
all alone, without your better half

589
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,431
to give you at least a fighting chance.

590
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,191
You and your
insufferable pontificating...

591
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,607
Wait, excuse me? Either someone
got themselves a thesaurus,

592
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,822
or...

593
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,114
He isn't who he appears to be.

594
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,242
He's the old one.

595
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,623
No!

596
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,121
You guys switched bodies?

597
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,957
That is rich.

598
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,253
You need a minute?

599
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,335
No, I'm good. I'm good.

600
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,138
Let's kill them.

601
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,928
Grey's scared to death. I can feel it.

602
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,342
Darhk must have found him.

603
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,454
- We're going in.
- I'm coming with you.

604
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,970
Sure you're up for this, Jax?

605
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,479
To save Grey? Damn right I am.

606
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,626
You might want to pee first.

607
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,812
We're not going to stop
to help you find a bathroom.

608
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:39,986
Good point.

609
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,061
Me, too.

610
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,902
Just don't make it a deuce, Mick.

611
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,858
Yeah, and if you do, flush.

612
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,137
What did he mean about your other half?

613
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,204
Are you married?

614
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,158
Oh, you mean Jefferson. Yes, I suppose,
in a way, we are married, too.

615
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,412
It's hard to explain.

616
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,913
You're homosexual?

617
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,463
No, I'm one half of a
nuclear-powered superhero.

618
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,082
Except, the two of us
accidentally switched bodies.

619
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,293
<i>They're here. I can feel them.</i>

620
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,548
Hide, hide.

621
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,050
What is going on?

622
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,757
The captain asked us to keep you safe
until the ship's fixed.

623
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,343
And the only way to do that
is by saving Hedy Lamarr.

624
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,641
I don't understand any of this.

625
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,189
That's okay.

626
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,438
Time travel is very, very confusing.

627
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,687
With the power out, we're gonna have
to lock the outside doors manually.

628
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,648
You're leaving me on my own?

629
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,282
Defenseless?

630
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,990
Here.

631
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,658
Now, you're not defenseless.

632
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,086
It appears they have us boxed in.

633
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,091
On my signal, run.

634
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,431
But what about you?

635
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,100
Look, just focus on getting yourself
to safety.

636
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,053
And don't give up on your dream.

637
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,027
Oh, goody.

638
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,320
The cavalry has arrived.

639
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,707
Oh, how I've missed
those whimsical outfits of yours.

640
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,285
Your beef is with me, Damien.

641
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,078
So, let's fight,

642
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,964
you and me, league style.

643
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,759
Two swords.

644
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,345
Zero magic.

645
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,802
A duel. How quaint.

646
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,103
Grey!

647
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,268
But you do realize,

648
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,556
I don't need magic to kill you.

649
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,733
Funny.

650
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,402
That's what Oliver Queen said
right before he killed you.

651
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,340
Foolish girl.

652
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,636
I extended my hand to you in kindness.

653
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,754
Now, you've left me no choice.

654
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,140
Let her go.

655
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,472
If it isn't the great protectress.

656
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,487
Whatever you're doing, don't.

657
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,162
Bring it.

658
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,715
What the...

659
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,099
Grey, you all right?

660
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,981
I'll live. It seems
your body's youthful resilience

661
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,070
has its advantages.

662
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,983
Hedy, I told you to run.

663
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,815
And I didn't listen.

664
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,070
You must be his other half.

665
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,571
You two need to use your powers.

666
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,779
We can't. It could cause
a catastrophic nuclear reaction.

667
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,239
Everybody could die.

668
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,121
I got this.

669
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,195
You have to become the Nuclear Man.

670
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,952
It's Firestorm, not Nuclear Man.

671
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,581
And we'd have to be crazy to attempt
a <i>Freaky Friday</i> merge.

672
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,038
Yes, but yours could be the case
of quantum entanglement,

673
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,526
which means, the particles in your body

674
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,712
are mirrored by those
of your atomic companion,

675
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,340
- which also means...
- That if we merge,

676
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,092
we could still maintain
a stable nuclear-reaction.

677
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,600
Sometimes you have to be crazy,
if you wish to burn bright.

678
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,054
What do you say, Jefferson?

679
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,869
Not bad.

680
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,071
You want those to be your last words?

681
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,375
We agreed, no magic.

682
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,957
I agreed that I wouldn't use my magic.

683
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,255
I couldn't make that same promise
for her.

684
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,677
That's the thing about daughters.

685
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,890
When they see you die at the hands
of one self-righteous hero,

686
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,888
they really don't want to see it
happen again.

687
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,895
Your daughter?

688
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,350
The apple of my eye.

689
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,403
This is the famous White Canary?

690
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,817
Bye bye, Birdie.

691
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,751
<i>That's what
I'm talking about, Grey!</i>

692
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,799
<i>Go on! Travel back, Grey!</i>

693
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,938
Jefferson, I don't think I can do this.

694
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,816
In case you haven't noticed,

695
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,742
I'm an old man!

696
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,990
<i>Yeah, true, but you got this, Grey.</i>

697
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,079
<i>Come on, Grey! Let's get 'em, baby!</i>

698
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,256
Nora, darling, I think it's time
we take our leave.

699
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,918
Please tell me "Firestein" is a thing.

700
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,475
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

701
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,934
I have to pee!

702
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,735
And I do not.

703
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,029
You did it.

704
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,898
You're a genius.

705
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,323
Forming Firestorm

706
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,610
has restored us to our rightful bodies.

707
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,454
<i>Guys!</i>

708
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,124
Guys, we've gotta get her
back to the ship.

709
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,622
You're a disgrace to every
totem bearer who's come before you.

710
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,211
You have no right to wield its power.

711
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,587
I have every right.

712
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,631
To this totem, and yours.

713
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,509
This totem is my family's.

714
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,593
Only my blood may bear it.

715
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,220
And they do.

716
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,470
You gave it to your daughter.

717
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,261
And she was supposed to give it to me.

718
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,690
But instead, it rests
on my little sister's throat.

719
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,689
- That's impossible.
- That I am your granddaughter?

720
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,611
What do you know of the future?

721
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,115
I told you I couldn't kill you
without killing myself.

722
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,869
But how?

723
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,120
Kuasa, wait.

724
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,638
I see great things for you,
Ms. Lamarr, and Warner Brothers.

725
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,143
It appears that went well.

726
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,563
Arnold wants me to star
in his next film.

727
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,187
The man was so desperate
after the Greek disaster,

728
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,693
I was able to negotiate a pay bump
out of the whole thing.

729
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,698
Brilliant and beautiful.

730
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,362
Thank you.

731
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,949
I couldn't have done that,
or survived, without you.

732
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,116
Oh, it was nothing, really.
Just doing our job,

733
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,248
setting history back on course.

734
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,555
- Can you guys hear me?
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>

735
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,832
<i>And the ship's purring like a kitten.</i>

736
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,169
Okay, time to go.

737
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,005
Yes. We must be off.

738
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,057
Well, goodbye.

739
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,023
I actually prefer older men.

740
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,573
Well, I'll be...

741
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,034
You, old fox.

742
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,572
Come on, man.

743
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:56,834
Hey.

744
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,250
How's Sara?

745
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,503
Gideon has placed her in a coma,

746
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,206
so that she can heal fully.

747
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,940
We'll be without a captain
for a few days,

748
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,798
but, thankfully, she'll make it.

749
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,588
Um...

750
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,507
There's something I need to tell you.

751
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:19,306
It's something I shouldn't tell you,
but it's something you should know.

752
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,891
That Kuasa is Mari's sister

753
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,312
and my granddaughter.

754
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,654
How did you know?

755
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,114
She told me.

756
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,906
I never knew that she even existed.

757
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,654
I don't blame you
for not saying anything.

758
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,868
You were just protecting the timeline.

759
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,199
I would've done the same thing.

760
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,621
Thank you for understanding.

761
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,087
I can tell you everything I know.

762
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,005
But it is more complicated
than you think.

763
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,177
No.

764
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,047
We are the protectors of history,

765
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,677
not its editors.

766
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,056
So, the less I know, the better.

767
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,324
Whoa there, killer.

768
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,653
Oh my gods! I am terribly sorry.

769
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,079
I got a bit carried away.

770
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,492
You're pretty good with that thing.
You should keep it.

771
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,333
But this belongs to your comrade.

772
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,002
Yeah, I think she'll be cool
with you having it.

773
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,502
Any of those Trojans
get handsy with you back home,

774
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,211
you show 'em what's what.

775
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,626
Troy is hardly a home.

776
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,512
I don't want to return there.

777
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,391
How can you claim to be heroes,
claim to do good in the world,

778
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,433
and yet force somebody back
into a horrible existence?

779
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:54,952
Okay.

780
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,244
According to the historical record,

781
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,682
you disappeared half way
through the war,

782
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,059
but that didn't affect the war itself.

783
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,245
So, I found you a loophole.

784
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,499
Same time that you're from,
just a different place.

785
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,710
Ah. I hacked history.

786
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,838
This isn't Troy.

787
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,755
<i>Nope. It's an island
full of warrior women.</i>

788
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,221
It's cool, right?

789
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,184
Won't your comrades be mad at you?

790
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,653
Yeah, they would be.

791
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,236
But they knew what they were getting
when they brought me on.

792
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,028
Oh, thank you.

793
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,451
You've changed my destiny.

794
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,497
Best thing about this place?

795
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:50,880
No boys allowed.

796
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,817
You'll finally have
some peace and quiet.
