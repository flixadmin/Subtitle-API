I was going through the papers
you recovered from the Owl leader's house.

They suggest that while Strange
was working to weaponize the Tetch virus,

106
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,693
he was also working on a parallel project,

to his own ends.

That makes sense.

They would've wanted a safeguard.

I told Alfred to question Strange.

117
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,427
In exchange for him telling us
where the bombing was gonna go down,

118
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,302
Alfred let Strange walk.
Yes, I'm blaming it on the butler!

119
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,355
All right. Strange is a weasel.

120
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,392
He'd try to get as far away
from this as possible.

127
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,874
Strange's virus is an
accelerated version of the Tetch virus.

128

people are reacting so quickly?

able to fight this for long.

listen, all I ask

166
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,812
is that you use

this beautiful big brain of yours

168
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,357
to help me finally

169
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,608
get this city under my thumb,

170
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,195
and afterwards, I will help you

171
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,034
pry Penguin away from Fish.

172
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,908
Deal?

173
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,253
I will give you a day.

one does not refuse.

Still, I'm not upset.

178
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:58,523
I knew when your old masters summoned you
it was to cook up some horror.

179
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,185
And here's the thing. I need horror.

180
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,817
They're responsible for all of this,
aren't they?

At the behest of The Court,

182
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,486
I weaponized a virus
that releases a person's darkest urges.

183
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,870
Thousands have been infected.

184
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,287
So where is this virus?

185
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,081
I know there's more.

186
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,713
It has all been used. Please, I must go!

187

Don't. You will give me the virus.

You will make me the army you promised.

You will do everything I say

until this city is in the palm of my hand.

DR. THOMPKINS: Hi, Jim.
I was just checking in.

201
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,942
Seeing how you're feeling.

202
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,436
Crazy day, huh?

203

- Lee, where are you?
- Somewhere very familiar to you.

I know how you're feeling.

205

All that blood rushing through your veins,
your heart beating faster and faster.

206
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,118
Listen to me.

207
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,083
You need to turn yourself in.
It's not safe.

208

The infected are being killed
all over the city.

Wow, you're really fighting this, huh?

210
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,718
You know, you don't have to.

211
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,555
The cage is finally open, Jim.
You're free.

212
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
- No.
- I thought you loved me.

213
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,986
I thought you wanted us to be together.

Not like this.

00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,102
Well, this is the only way, Jim.

216
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,402
Just listen to the whispers.

DR. THOMPKINS:
I wonder what they're saying.

222
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,330
That you like hurting people?
Killing people?

Enough talking. Hand him over.

00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,581
Like it's taking all my will power
not to kill you.

250

My! Harvey, when you say Hugo here
can save the city,

251
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,094
does that mean
there's a cure for this virus?

Fish, I swear to God
if you don't step back,

253

I will shoot you and these
two nimrods right here, right now!

I would come without backup?

JIM: You're a killer.

263
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,797
Jim, dial it down, buddy.

264
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,964
Victor, looks like our
little Detective Gordon is overheating.

265
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,183
Perhaps, you should cool him off.
Both of them.

266
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,653
Marvelous.

267
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,859
Just marvelous.

268
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,159
There he is, the real James Gordon.

Nice to meet you at last.

There we go, Master Bruce.
Two lumps just how you like it.

You hungry, mate?

00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,686
Can I whip you up a sandwich?

273
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,652
Anyway, if all goes well,

274
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,526
we should be able
to head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,239
Although I was thinking
that we could go abroad.

276
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,203
We could go to Switzerland.

277
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,077
I mean, we used to go with your mum
and dad this time of year...

Your attempts
to elicit an emotional response

280
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,634
by reminding me of shared memories
is clumsy and pathetic.

Oh.

282
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,220
The last memory I have
is of you killing the best friend

283
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,759
and teacher I ever had.

284
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,184
You mean that old geezer
that kidnapped you,

285
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,060
poisoned your mind, and tried
to turn you into a mass murderer?

286
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:22,070
Let me tell you something, Master Bruce,
that man lied to you.

Him and his bloody Court of Owls,

they tried to use you,
they tried to manipulate you.

You say he was a liar.

00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,829
How?

291
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,912
By taking away
the pain I've carried for years?

292
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,961
By giving me revenge against the people
who killed my mother and father?

293
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,761
That's more than you ever did.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

295
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,143
Anyway, the Court of Owls does not matter.

296
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,690
They merely paved the way
for the one who is to come.

You'll see.

- I should cook him.
- They want him alive.

302
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,084
(CHUCKLES) No, my dear, let's be calm.

303
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,880
You don't have that kind of control.

304
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,961
And you do? In my hands,
this flamethrower is a scalpel.

305
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,299
Fine. We'll each take a foot.

306
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,216
- Whoever goes above the ankle loses.
- You're on.

307
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,980
Let me... No, no, no!
Stop! Miss Mooney! Miss Mooney!

308
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,605
COBBLEPOT: Mooney's busy!

309
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,643
I'm here now.

310
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,691
Also, I think
your children are angry with you.

311
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,452
- Mr. Cobblepot.
- It's understandable.

312
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,699
You made them what they are,

313
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,034
then abandoned them.

314
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,124
You are working with Miss Mooney?

315
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,088
We're partners.

316
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,340
But you tried to kill her.

317
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,176
And she forgave me.

318
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,470
I know, surprised me, too.

319
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,725
But Mooney, is not the old Mooney.
She has evolved.

320
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,436
And she has a vision for Gotham.

321
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,766
She sees a city where people like myself,

322

323
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,693

324
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,618

486
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,454
Professor, if this is a trap,

487
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,943
you will soon find yourself
hanging with the rest of the meat.

488
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,216
It's no trap.

489
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,682
I tested earlier versions of the virus
and the antidote on livestock.

490
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,643
I made sure to set aside
a successful batch.

491
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,150
This place gives me the creeps.

492

I like it.

493
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,706
It's concentrated.

494
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,376
Once you dilute it,

495
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:13,009
there is enough here
to cure every infected person in Gotham.

you and I will rule this city together.

is setting up a lab in the GCPD.

one very, very important element.

Why have you come to me, Bruce?

The Sensei told me to seek you out.
That you would complete my training.

576
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,672
And did the Sensei tell you who I am,
what I seek?

I know you're
not a part of the Court of Owls.

That you only use them.
But I don't know why.

Then know that I have been alive
more years than you can imagine.

That I have seen and done things

that would shake the core
of everything you believe.

there is one thing

I'm not like you.

1130

You've always been so sure of who you are.

1131
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,888
Oh, I don't know about that.

1132
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,142
I've been through some very dark places.

1133
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:23,722
As have you.

1134
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,899
You need to find your true north

1135
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,740
and let that guide you.

1136
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,153
What's yours?

1137
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,493
You.

1138
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,669
It's always been you.

1139
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,587
You gotta find something
that you really care about,

1140
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,841
and you protect it at all costs.

1141
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,424
And when you find it...

1142

REPORTER: And though the arrival
of the antidote is certainly welcome news,

1144
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,784
the death and the destruction
the virus left in its wake

1145
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:21,664
will no doubt reverberate through the city
for years to come.

There's that.

1168
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,340
And then,

1169
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:03,883
there's the club's centerpiece attraction.

DR. THOMPKINS: Jim, I knew if I saw you
I might not have the courage to leave.

1173
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,096
And I need to.

1174
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:48,519
I finally understand Gotham in a way
I suspect you always have.

1175
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:53,103
It's a place where the strongest
and most cunning rule.

1176
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:58,813
Where the cost of survival
is paid for by others.

1177
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,776
And everyone feels alone.

1178
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,955
Having the virus showed me the city
as it truly was.

1179
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,575
As I truly was.

1180
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,415
In so many ways,

1181
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,293
the virus made me feel reborn.

He's a gangster.
Probably got what he deserved.

- He is?
- Sure. That's Butch Gilzean.

1184
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,885
Really? His chart lists
his birth name as Cyrus Gold.

NURSE 2: Must have changed it
at some point.

1187
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,474
DR. THOMPKINS: But if having the virus

1188
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,806
allowed Gotham
to embrace its worst self...

1189
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,692
The cure should remind us
there is always hope,

1190
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:43,317
a chance to remember who we can be,
rather than who we are.

1191
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:49,701
I don't know if Gotham deserves saving,
but I do know one thing.

1192
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:51,953
If anyone can save it,

1193
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,626
it's you.

1194
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:59,669
And in return, I believe
it can save you as well.

1195
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:06,214
And then maybe one day,
it will send you back to me.

1196
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:09,550
Until then,
