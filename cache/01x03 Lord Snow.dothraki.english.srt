1
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,900
It's a blessing from the Great Stallion

2
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,430
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

3
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,190
My father taught me how to fight.

4
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,700
He taught me that speed defeats size.

5
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,580
I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

6
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,040
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

7
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,500
And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?

8
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,720
The Khaleesi wants
to eat something different tonight.

9
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,850
Kill some rabbits.

10
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,020
There are no rabbits.

11
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,860
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.

12
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,440
Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.

13
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,900
Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?

14
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,110
Dog then.
I have seen many dogs.

15
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,130
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

16
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,600
It's a boy.

17
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,360
How do you know?

18
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,740
I know.
