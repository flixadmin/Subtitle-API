1
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:11,055
- I didn't think she was his type.
- Neither did I.

2
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:13,900
- When did they get together?
- Last weekend.

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,983
Where was that?

4
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,400
Jonas said that she gave
him a blowjob on the toilet.

5
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,845
Since when are you
together after a blowjob?

6
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,380
You're not together after that.

7
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,997
They were already together in
the 10th grade or something.

8
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:33,589
- Yeah.
- Who is this about?

9
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,240
- Eva, why?
- TEXT FROM WILLHELM

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,644
It's so sick that they got together.

11
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:48,972
<i>You look freaking hot in that shirt.</i>

12
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:52,520
One of the prettiest girls
in Pepsi Max has a boyfriend.

13
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:56,121
They fall in the same category
as the Penetrator-boys.

14
00:01:57,154 --> 00:02:01,843
You guys! I have fantastic news.

15
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:04,264
Are you ready?

16
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,649
- Say it.
- Are you excited?

17
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:17,240
I have acquired "Brun
og Blid" as a sponsor.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,380
What did you say?

19
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,960
It's Norway's largest
tanning salon chain.

20
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:29,600
I know what "Brun og Blid" is.

21
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,040
We will not be sponsored by them, no.

22
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:36,540
Why's that?

23
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,464
Because they contribute
to the most speculative

24
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,839
and sexist marketing in Norway.

25
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,991
Have you even seen their commercials?

26
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,700
It's a tanning salon...

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,265
It's difficult to promote it

28
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:52,673
without showing tanned bodies.

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,223
Noora, I worked really hard
to get them to sponsor us.

30
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,780
You're just being really ungrateful.

31
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,060
Can't you see how difficult
it was to persuade them?

32
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,500
So you think we should
promote "Brun og Blid"?

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,820
And contribute to a completely
inhumane body pressure?

34
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:14,749
I don't feel too much
of that body pressure.

35
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:25,560
I say we milk those sexist
motherfuckers for every penny they have!

36
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:32,000
OK... Oh my god,
fucking cool. Go for it.

37
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,780
But then I'm not
joining the bus anymore.

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Huh? Are you kidding right now?

39
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,240
Noora, oh my god. Just because
things don't go your way?

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,406
Now you're being really childish.

41
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,029
It's just because I refuse

42
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,144
to contribute to that
inhumane body pressure.

43
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,295
The logo is this small. Here.

44
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,720
I don't understand how that
will contribute to body pressure.

45
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:03,220
Yeah well, whatever. I give up.

46
00:04:06,242 --> 00:04:08,816
Should we go as a gÃ¥-russ then?

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,048
Vilde, it might come
as a shock to you...

48
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:15,148
But Russebuss is not important to me.

49
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:19,196
I just wanted to get
to know Eva and Sana.

50
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:23,923
- Wow, thanks for that!
- No!

51
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:26,382
You too, Chris.

52
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,974
You know I love you.

53
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,780
This discussion isn't over!

54
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,816
MONDAY, 4:35 PM

55
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:22,996
Yeah?

56
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,923
- Did you eat my pasta?
- No.

57
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,020
Can you ask Eskild to
turn down the music?

58
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,696
Eskild!

59
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,971
Eskild!

60
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,847
Sorry!

61
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,660
Noora?

62
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,361
Can you lend me 200 Kroner until Monday?

63
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:04,803
Yeah, OK.

64
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:01,371
- Hi!
- Hey.

65
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:07,631
- Do you need help?
- No, never.

66
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:08,834
Never.

67
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,906
Hey.

68
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,182
- Hello.
- Hello. What's up?

69
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:18,105
Netflix. Just Netflix...

70
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,660
- Do you have some food?
- Yeah, of course.

71
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,056
I didn't have a chance to eat at home.

72
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,307
Too much guy-on-guy BJ action.

73
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,279
No, what the fuck?
Your parents, or what?

74
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,648
I live in a shared
apartment with roommates.

75
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,252
Ah, OK.

76
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:40,160
But I have actually seen
my parents in BJ action.

77
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,499
No way! Seriously?

78
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
I would have been scarred
for the rest of my life.

79
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,836
What did she reply?

80
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,951
"Come to my house and show me."

81
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:58,140
Are you kidding? She is stalling.

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
What should I answer, then?

83
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,001
Who is this?

84
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,370
A 00'er Jonas is involved with.

85
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,540
I haven't even kissed her.

86
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:10,773
But it's going to happen.

87
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:15,180
I never want to hook up with a 00'er!

88
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:16,879
Then why are you chatting with her?

89
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:20,376
Because she has a good body.

90
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:22,029
***

91
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,762
OK so...

92
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:29,112
Jonas is flirting with a girl

93
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:31,758
and you're helping him?

94
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,460
Eh... yeah.

95
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:38,920
Wow!

96
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,499
How is that working out for you?

97
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,261
We're friends,

98
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:45,064
so it works out just fine.

99
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,620
OK...

100
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,392
What the fuck?

101
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,705
- She sent boobs!
- Are you kidding?

102
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:56,408
No, look!

103
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,812
- Hey, you can't show that to us!
- Why not?

104
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,003
Let me see! Screenshot it!

105
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:05,240
Fucking hell, they are really nice.

106
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:08,240
And she's a 00'er?

107
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:12,046
I bet she took a screenshot
from a magazine or something.

108
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,347
No, I don't think so.

109
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:16,654
She got it to look like this with
a good black and white filter.

110
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:20,447
***

111
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,352
I know the tricks. Shit!

112
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:25,672
Fuck. They are really big!

113
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,480
One is a little higher
up than the other.

114
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:31,620
Now it's your turn. I'm sorry.

115
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,839
Should I go and send stuff to people?

116
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,615
You should send loads
of dick pics, of course.

117
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,920
I keep it real.

118
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,543
It's not hard to do this.

119
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:48,354
But it's hard to take screenshots?

120
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,186
Set it as your background!

121
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,147
What school does she go to?

122
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,315
- TUESDAY, 11:40 AM
- We should talk about our sponsors.

123
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:03,127
Because everyone should feel like
they have a say in the Russebuss.

124
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,076
We are very different girls.

125
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,815
At the same time it's also important
that we are strong and independent.

126
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:12,542
But we have to have money.

127
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:17,150
I suggest a Russebuss meeting on Friday.

128
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,475
Then everyone can talk properly

129
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:22,316
about the image and the concept.

130
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:26,439
We'll drink wine and
just enjoy ourselves.

131
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:30,303
It's been so long that it was just us.

132
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,778
For me, we don't really need to do this.

133
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:37,025
It's not important to me.

134
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,230
I have a party in
Elvebakken on Friday, so...

135
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,110
- With who?
- With Jonas.

136
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,639
I promised I would go with him.

137
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:56,513
Come on! We're friends, OK?

138
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,862
Why is it so hard to understand

139
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,230
that you can be friends with
your ex? When you're a couple,

140
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,745
it's the same thing as being best
friends. You just also have sex.

141
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,633
We ended the sex part.

142
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,879
That doesn't mean we can't
still be best friends.

143
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:15,763
Did you hear William beat up
someone from Hansen this weekend?

144
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:31,159
- Who was it?
- A 98'er. He was properly destroyed.

145
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,219
He ended up in the emergency room.

146
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,619
Oh my god, so cool!

147
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:40,218
I think William is very sensitive.

148
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:45,621
He knows what it's like to lose someone.

149
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,600
- I think he's a fuckboy.
- What do you mean by losing someone?

150
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,036
His little sister.

151
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:53,168
He lost his little sister?

152
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah, didn't you know? She's dead.

153
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,336
A dead little sister. It's so tragic.

154
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:03,959
- When did this happen?
- A long time ago.

155
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,765
Something like that
really stays with someone.

156
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:11,879
<i>I like that you're sitting
there looking at me.</i>

157
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,915
It's' so sad for him. I think
that's why he's a fuckboy.

158
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:19,065
- Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
- I'm not looking at you.

159
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,384
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

160
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,420
***

161
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:29,204
He's really a good guy. I
noticed that during Christmas.

162
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,065
- Right, Eva?
- What?

163
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:36,720
That he's a really good guy.

164
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:41,059
Yeah. It seemed like he was really keen.

165
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,354
Why else would he say you were hot?

166
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,360
<i>You still owe me a date. Friday?</i>

167
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,625
I actually don't remember
what he said to me.

168
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,685
Do you?

169
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:56,515
Didn't he say something like...

170
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:59,145
- <i>Unfortunately, can't on Friday. Got something important.</i>
- "Vilde,

171
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,705
- I didn't mean what I said back then."
- <i>What's that?</i>

172
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,862
Then he said:

173
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,085
"Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

174
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,898
<i>Buss meeting. Russetiden preparation.
Most important thing in the world.</i>

175
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,849
"Every guy that gets
you is so fucking lucky."

176
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,601
"Remember when I said
you weren't good enough? "

177
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:21,751
That was bullshit. And every guy
that gets you is fucking lucky."

178
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,378
He's totally random though.

179
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:27,130
He came up to Noora and...

180
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:32,180
Came up to Noora and then?

181
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,546
Nothing.

182
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,177
Vilde,

183
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:42,550
it's never going to happen
between me and William.

184
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,580
He's the most unsympathetic,

185
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:49,480
selfish person I've ever met.

186
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,761
I would never touch him.

187
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,026
And you shouldn't either.

188
00:13:56,983 --> 00:14:00,121
You don't know him like I do.

189
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:03,863
If you had just heard him at Chrismtas.

190
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:07,520
How long can we talk about
Christmas? It's March!

191
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,097
Just because he came
over and apologised,

192
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:12,615
because he behaved like an asshole...

193
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:15,819
it doesn't mean he's a good person.

194
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,741
And it doesn't mean he's keen on you.

195
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:22,535
I'm not the one who
said he was keen on me.

196
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,722
It was Eva who said that.

197
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:29,820
I just don't want you to
get your hopes up and...

198
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,674
It's from William!

199
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:36,100
"Penetrator party on Friday.
Bring your bus group and come."

200
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:50,641
Don't we have a bus meeting on Friday?

201
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,679
I thought that wasn't important to you.

202
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:58,880
I thought it was important to
you to be strong and independent?

203
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,870
Yeah, but I can be strong and
independent at the Penetrator party.

204
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,780
So we'll just drop all our
plans, because a guy calls.

205
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,778
Can't we have a bus meeting first,

206
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:15,080
and then go to the party afterwards?

207
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:17,422
That's exactly what we'll do.

208
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,965
"We're coming." Heart... heart?

209
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,446
So then we'll have the
bus meeting and the party,

210
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:27,741
and then you can go to that
party with your best friend.

211
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:37,034
_

212
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:49,491
Eskild!

213
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,805
THURSDAY, 5:21 PM

214
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,020
Eskild!

215
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,700
Do you still need money?

216
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,580
- I need help with something.
- 500 Kroner.

217
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,536
- 200 Kroner.
- 200 Kroner?

218
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,820
200 Kroner!

219
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,573
- 400 Kroner.
- 300!

220
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:12,826
***

221
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:15,760
- 350! Last offer.
- 350. Great.

222
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,660
You have to make a move
on one of my friends.

223
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,760
- Yeah?
- Eh, yeah. OK.

224
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,608
Don't you think

225
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,017
I'm gonna set off some gaydars?

226
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,040
No, oh my god. No stress. She
doesn't even know what gay is.

227
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,927
She's so naive.

228
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:36,011
Yeah great, OK. Whatever.

229
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,359
What do you want me to do?

230
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,106
I'm having a bus party here tomorrow,

231
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,215
and you just walk in randomly.

232
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,336
Is there alcohol for me?

233
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,781
Sure!

234
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,823
- Just be home around 7, OK?
- OK.

235
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,447
Do I have to make out with her?

236
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,561
No, no, no. Oh my god.

237
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,219
She just needs some attention.
Just some compliments and stuff.

238
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,367
Because she's crazy obsessed with a guy

239
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,620
who isn't interested in her.

240
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,259
So that's why I need you

241
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,078
to help her forget him.

242
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,518
OK.

243
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,099
- He'll be forgotten.
- Great!

244
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,079
- For 500 Kroner.
- No! I said 350!

245
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,317
If I make out with her,
we'll say 500 Kroner.

246
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,341
You don't need to make out with her!

247
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,461
For 390 I'll touch her boobs.

248
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,243
350! No making out and no boob touching.

249
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:32,918
- Just a little attention.
- 350 and boob stroking.

250
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,905
No. 350 and a little attention.

251
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:41,543
If it goes well, I can
touch her boobs a little.

252
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:47,280
Oh my god, what the fuck?

253
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,162
It's nothing. Just to know how it feels!

254
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,168
FRIDAY, 7:48 PM

255
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,779
With this here. I
thought something like...

256
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,884
Up here it's classy, but
here it's a little slutty.

257
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,468
- Didn't the bottles break?
- A white top is just stressful.

258
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,908
If you spill something,
it becomes transparent.

259
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,667
- Yes...
- Ah you'd like that, don't you?

260
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:15,455
No Vilde! Take this. That one was
super pretty. Now you have to stop.

261
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,274
I think I'm going to
sleep with William tonight.

262
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:21,759
Don't forget a condom.

263
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,768
Are you going to sleep
with Jonas tonight?

264
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,527
- No, we're just friends.
- <i>Where are you? Come home NOW!!</i>

265
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,750
So you guys haven't had
sex after you broke up?

266
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,394
No, I promise.

267
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:36,761
- Last time we had sex was when we broke up.
- That's when you broke up?

268
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,038
Yeah.

269
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,514
I'm serious, you have
to try that once. Fuck.

270
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:45,195
The best sex I ever had.
It was really amazing.

271
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,500
Shouldn't you be sad
after you've broken up?

272
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,941
Well yeah, we were.

273
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:55,519
But that was what made
it so hot. So intense.

274
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:05,319
- What?
- Are you sure it happened?

275
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:08,879
That it wasn't a dream or a flashback?

276
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,885
Hey guys, can I ask something?

277
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,409
- Has anyone ever gone down on you?
- No.

278
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:18,650
Yeah!

279
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,871
Someone went down on me in
Gran Canaria last summer.

280
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:24,376
- Are you kidding me? How was it?
- It was fucking nice.

281
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,701
I sat there and just...

282
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,917
Then it couldn't have been very...

283
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,179
I'm really scared William
will try to go down on me.

284
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,599
Vilde, there's no Norwegian
guy who will do it.

285
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,723
It's true, while we
suck dick for dear life.

286
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,668
Snapchat from William! He's
wondering when we're coming.

287
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,247
When are you gonna go to Jonas?

288
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,499
We were supposed to call.

289
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:55,017
I can call him.

290
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,348
<i>That snapchat to Vilde
was directed towards you.</i>

291
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,806
Can't we go in half an hour?

292
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,445
<i>You can't use Vilde this way.</i>

293
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,107
No, oh my god!

294
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:10,492
Now we're going to talk
about image, concept.

295
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,408
- That's why we're here. Right?
- Yes.

296
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:15,794
What kind of concept would you like?

297
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,166
Jonas' phone is turned off or something.

298
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,440
- Hi!
- There you are!

299
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:37,260
I'm having a bus party tonight.

300
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,559
It's nice that you're here.

301
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:46,276
These are my friends. This
is Eskild. He lives with me.

302
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,824
- Yeah, hi. Eskild.
- Hi.

303
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:50,691
- Hi. Vilde.
- Hi, Eskild.

304
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:56,238
Eva, if you could...
I have some tomatoes...

305
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:01,051
I'll sit here. Hi.

306
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:03,720
Here.

307
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,147
But eh...

308
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:11,688
- don't you have some wine?
- Yeah!

309
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,724
- Oh, Chablis! Hmm.
- From 19... eh 2010.

310
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:23,247
- OK. Cheers!
- Cheers!

311
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:27,760
- Noora, what should I do with the tomatoes?
- You have really pretty eyes.

312
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,960
You think so?

313
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:32,840
You have a lot of eye make-up.

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,240
It was Eva who did that.

315
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:39,136
You shouldn't let her do it.

316
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,500
She's not really good at it.

317
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,817
You're not a virgin, right?

318
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:46,580
No I'm not.

319
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,263
- Can you see it?
- I might be a little direct now...

320
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,689
I can see it from your breasts.

321
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:59,635
Once you've had sex...

322
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:03,122
Jonas, what's wrong with your
phone? Why is it turned off?

323
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,346
Call me when you get this.

324
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:08,453
***

325
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,188
***

326
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,718
***

327
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,500
- This wine is good.
- Hello? Music?

328
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,139
I want to put on some
music! Which phone is it?

329
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,915
- Let's dance!
- Yes!

330
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,993
It's Britney, bitch.

331
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,373
It's William!

332
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,746
Hi?

333
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,100
Yeah...

334
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,860
OK...

335
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,726
It's William. He wants to talk to you.

336
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,286
Eh... To me?

337
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,960
Yeah, hello.

338
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:52,120
I can't stop using Vilde when
you don't answer your phone.

339
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:54,417
What is it?

340
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:58,657
We wouldn't have been in this
situation if you had kept your promise.

341
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,706
No. I don't have his number.

342
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,840
Whose? Maybe I have it.

343
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:09,596
You go on a date with me,

344
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,253
and then I'll stop using Vilde.

345
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:13,900
OK?

346
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,400
- OK.
- Good!

347
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,480
Let me speak to Vilde.

348
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,680
He wants to talk to you.

349
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,100
Hi!

350
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,563
What a shame.

351
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:37,623
Yeah, I understand.

352
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,820
Ok. Bye!

353
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,013
There's no Penetrator party.

354
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:51,176
Chris' parents came home.

355
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,072
Can't we come along to
your Elvebakken party?

356
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,438
Jonas doesn't answer.
He turned off his phone.

357
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:01,306
Can we at least dance and have a party?

358
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,570
Whose number did he want?

359
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:19,950
<i>Next Friday. 7:PM. I'll pick you up.</i>

360
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,378
Aren't you gay?

361
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:33,457
