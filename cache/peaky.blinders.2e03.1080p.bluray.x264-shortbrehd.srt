1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,290
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,125
<i>The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.</i>

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,281
Tell us your plan.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,722
I can offer you 100 good men.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,565
Get him out of there, get him back!

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,481
Arthur killed a boy.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,444
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,806
Your daughter is dead.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,362
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,329
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,084
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,685
I think she might be my mother.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,644
<i>There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.</i>

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,451
He's head of some secret department,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,045
the Irish Desk.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,545
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,363
He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,683
He was Irish. Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,524
Do you read the papers?

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,284
Birmingham papers.

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,842
I recommend the <i>Daily Mail.</i>

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,809
It will broaden your mind.

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,570
Now, if you read the national press,
you would know

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,122
that the king has offered
the rebel Irish a treaty.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,441
Now, some of the Fenians
want to accept it.

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,363
The IRA do not.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,128
Now, the IRA have a long
and glorious relationship

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,281
with the garrotte.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,726
Oh, dear.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,691
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,610
- That will be all.
-Right, sir.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,650
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,041
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,645
Well, you wouldn't want
to stay in the lodgings

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,041
you had last time then, sir, eh?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,209
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,009
You should understand, Moss,

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,687
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,241
No, sir?

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,726
I imagine you boys
have quite a laugh at my expense.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,961
A laugh, sir?

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,089
You think it's funny
that I developed feelings?

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,130
No idea what you're talking about, sir.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,001
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,321
No "bad memories".

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,285
Right, sir.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,162
He's losing his bloody mind.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,481
Next.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,361
Next.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,926
All right, then.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,843
Name?

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,285
The Digbeth Kid.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,804
The Dig...

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,245
What are you? A boxer?

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,087
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,404
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,807
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,006
Yeah?

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,561
What are you...

60
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,564
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,681
- Let's have a look then, eh?
-It's made of wood.

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,123
Bang.Bang.

63
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
Very nice.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,647
Where did you get the gun belt?

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,004
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,210
My mum did most of the stitching.

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,921
She's not my real mum, but...

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,002
She does what mothers do.

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,005
So she made you a gun belt.

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,930
All right then, mother's boy.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,923
There's the door. On you go.
We're looking for...

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,927
Have you ever been arrested?

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,286
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,171
- No.
-Good.

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,001
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,367
Arthur, we can stand him up.

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,726
Do you know what that means?

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,449
The new Home Secretary wants something
done about illegal gambling.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,045
Damn right.

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,451
About bloody time.

81
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,445
So we help our coppers make their quota
of convictions by having men stood up

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,965
to be arrested.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
First offence, you'll get a week inside.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,771
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

85
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,888
How does that sound, cowboy?

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,086
Yeah.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,081
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,286
I can't write.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,681
That's all right, Finn can't read.

90
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,761
Don't worry.

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,446
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

92
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,566
If the sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,846
Good man.

94
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,767
- Oh, I don't know, Tom. Kids these days.
-Hmm.

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,650
They didn't fight.

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,529
So they're different.

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,645
They stay kids.

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,045
How was it?

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,404
I was starving,
so I would have eaten anything.

100
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,888
But really it was super.

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,846
Super.

102
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,687
So, uh, are you a cook?

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,763
Not a cook. No.

104
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,730
The man who came to the house,

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,565
he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.

106
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,764
What does he do?

107
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,001
- He works with horses.
-Really?

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,241
I love horses.

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,124
- I've got a bay mare.
-No!

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,123
I ride it all the time.

111
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,641
Then it's in the blood.

112
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,844
I've got about a million questions.

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,520
So do I.

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,562
I've had different pictures in my head.

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,563
Well, here I am.

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,411
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?

117
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,048
I don't have any choice.

118
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,605
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?

119
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,364
We don't choose.

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,290
And that's it.

121
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,529
Yeah, that's right.

122
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,769
God gave you to me.

123
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,209
People took you away.

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,210
And it is all right
that it's me, isn't it?

125
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,405
In a place like this.

126
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,801
I thought it would be worse.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,843
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!

128
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,163
Get out of town, kid,
or I will shoot your fucking head off!

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,049
Time's up!

130
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,929
- You're dead, go down.
- John!

131
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,211
All right then, Polly.

132
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,285
Who's this?

133
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,483
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.

134
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,284
Polly's son, Michael.

135
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,161
Pleased to meet you.

136
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,241
John.

137
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,170
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,323
I used to throw you out of the window,
so John could catch you.

139
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,200
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

140
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,447
I bet you're glad to be back.

141
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,363
I don't remember any of it.

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,363
All I remember is the day
they took me away.

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,122
Well, you're here now, son.

144
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,171
Welcome to the Shelby family.

145
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,844
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.

146
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,922
Hmm. Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

147
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,367
Let's leave him be for now, eh?

148
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,370
Come on, boys.

149
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,488
- Nice suit.

150
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,245
They seem nice.

151
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,045
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.

152
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,930
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

153
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,045
How are you feeling?

154
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,531
I've just come out of bandages myself.

155
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,682
Ready for active service.

156
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,330
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,481
It's all right, Bill.

158
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,686
You don't have to stand in line for us.

159
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,969
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

160
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,929
But you have to pass the medical first.

161
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,045
Sheffield mob showed up
at Wincanton trotting track.

162
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,724
I took a bullet.

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,929
When do the bandages come off?

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,764
When I take 'em off.

165
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,124
One week. Not before.

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,850
You'll smell no rot.

167
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,924
There's no gangrene.

168
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,048
It's been a long time. Eh, Billy?

169
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,890
What did you do with your medals?

170
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,603
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

171
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,045
It was never a hardship having you
Black Country boys on our left flank.

172
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,483
And you Brummies did all right
on our right.

173
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,925
Damn right.

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,323
I want you to be the head
of a brigade, Bill.

175
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,530
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,331
You'll have 100 men under your command.

177
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,809
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,043
maybe your cousins and brothers will let
our boats pass through the Black Country

179
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,849
without being held up and robbed.

180
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,364
I don't know what you're talking about.

181
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,326
Go home, Bill.

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,529
Round up any good men you can trust
and put the word out.

183
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,729
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

184
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,086
That'll be the bloody day.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,367
Well, this is the bloody day.

186
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,410
London, man. There for the taking.

187
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,562
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.

188
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,086
Polly said you had one in the pub.

189
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,886
All right, be quick. I have business.

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,401
Sir.

191
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,721
Polly said you own this place.

192
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,123
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

193
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,441
You call her Polly or Mum?

194
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,568
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.

195
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,561
Who are you calling?

196
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,927
My mother. I mean...

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,809
I know what you mean.

198
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,490
And what are you going to tell her?

199
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,210
I'm going to tell her where I am.

200
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,042
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

201
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,162
Polly said I could stay for a few days.

202
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,084
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,490
What age are you Michael?

204
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,641
Seventeen.

205
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,008
Seventeen. Which means
it's not up to you, right?

206
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,686
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

207
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,762
You smoke?

208
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,887
No.

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,001
Drink?

210
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,762
You're going to call your mother,

211
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,411
going to tell her you're getting
the next train home.

212
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,641
And when you get there,

213
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,609
you're going to write a letter to Polly
saying when you're 18,

214
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,170
you'll come back here
and sort things out.

215
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,844
I just told you.

216
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,123
I make up my own mind.

217
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,928
Do you know what we do, Michael?

218
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,851
We, Shelbys.

219
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,841
Yes. I think I know what you do.

220
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,441
Yeah.

221
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,283
You've got smart eyes.

222
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,890
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

223
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,403
It's not all right.

224
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,084
People get hurt.

225
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,681
Now, call your mother
and I will drive you to the station.

226
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,761
No.

227
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,570
In my village,

228
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,761
there's this little wishing well.

229
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,684
It's made of white bricks, right
in the middle of the village green.

230
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,881
Everybody says how pretty it is.

231
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,289
But I swear to God,

232
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,886
if I spend another day in that village,

233
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,930
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,005
Probably blow my hands off with it,
but it'd be worth it.

235
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,406
Just to see
all those pretty white bricks

236
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,086
spread over the pretty village green.

237
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,641
Hmm.

238
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,324
Yep. You're Polly's son, all right.

239
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,881
All right boys, let's go to work.

240
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,724
Let's be having it!

241
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,930
Don't wait!

242
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,330
Keep it moving.

243
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,166
Move!

244
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,485
Next lad!

245
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,721
Name?

246
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,926
Abbey Heath.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,161
Abbey Heath. Profession?

248
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,241
Baker.

249
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,727
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

250
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,806
Next lad!

251
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,241
Name?

252
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,927
Buddy Halls.

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
Buddy Halls. Right. Profession?

254
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,841
Baker.

255
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,488
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

256
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,406
Next lad!

257
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,050
- Name?
-Billy Kitchen.

258
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

259
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,045
Head baker.

260
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,407
Fill it out.

261
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,407
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.

262
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,290
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

263
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,407
Hmm?

264
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,165
Never give power to the big man.

265
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,841
Next lad!

266
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,161
Name?

267
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,645
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

268
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,451
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

269
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,761
If anyone asks, that's what you do.

270
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,330
You're bakers.

271
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,884
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side,

272
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,885
but north or south,
you show them that piece of paper.

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,249
Tell them you've come down from
north to find work, to break strikes.

274
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,570
Tell them you're fascists,
if you have to.

275
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,728
We're finding lodgings for you, but
for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.

276
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,728
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

277
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,525
Any questions?

278
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,241
Yes?

279
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,570
I haven't even seen any bread.

280
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,410
He'll wake up.

281
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,529
Granted, he won't have any teeth left,
but he will be a wiser man for it.

282
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,687
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

283
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,161
Right!

284
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,609
There are fucking rules here.

285
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

286
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,689
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?

287
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,364
Rule number one.

288
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,490
The distinction between bread and rum,
yeah, is not discussed.

289
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,084
Rule number two.

290
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,690
Anything, right,
that your superior officer

291
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,847
says to you or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

292
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,287
Not discussed!

293
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,090
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

294
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,165
For the rest of your fucking
miserable measly lives, yeah?

295
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,244
Because I, like you,

296
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,847
am also a complete fucking sodomite.

297
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,725
Jewish women.

298
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,889
You do not go anywhere near them

299
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,487
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

300
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,051
I think that's fair.

301
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,649
Hmm.

302
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,605
Hmm.

303
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,762
All right, that's it, yeah.

304
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,761
Forgive me, I interrupted you.

305
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,325
Pick him up.

306
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,529
Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.

307
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,763
Don't fucking wait!

308
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,605
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!

309
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,728
You're a fucking disgrace!

310
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,247
Go!

311
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,962
You've got a key?

312
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,926
I kept a spare.

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,001
Give it to me.

314
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,487
Could do with some paint, eh?

315
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,688
Yeah, when I decide.

316
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,851
What is it that you want, Tommy?

317
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,002
Just came by to say hello.

318
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,524
Tommy Shelby never goes
anywhere for no reason.

319
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,365
Fine.

320
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,889
I've got 800 pounds left
in the Shelby property fund,

321
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and I need someone down here
to look for suitable properties.

322
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,121
To rent?

323
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,601
Yes.

324
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,244
To poor people.

325
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,765
Ten to a room.

326
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,888
No repairs, no water.

327
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,806
And if they complain, you just send
Arthur and the boys round.

328
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,924
You know, I give advice
down at the library.

329
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,321
Families thrown on the street.

330
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,562
It's men like you we're fighting.

331
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,567
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.

332
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,681
Tommy.

333
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,446
There are always men outside
watching the house.

334
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,091
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

335
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,366
But they're there to keep you safe.

336
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,488
No there are others.
They look like coppers.

337
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,285
Well, they're on your side as well.

338
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,005
I don't have a fucking side.

339
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,128
Ada, yes, you do.

340
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,446
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

341
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,170
I couldn't sleep.

342
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,009
Cheerio then.

343
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,006
That was great. Well done.

344
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,684
Out we get then.

345
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,082
This house is mine.

346
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,088
I've taken on a maid.

347
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,049
She's made up the big room for you.

348
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,281
Come on, let's have a look.

349
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,245
I thought we could spend the week here.

350
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,771
You know, get to know each other again.

351
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,448
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

352
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,765
I like ham, yes.

353
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,724
- I've got a maid...
-Yes, you said.

354
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,085
She's upstairs.

355
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,365
She can give us some tea.

356
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,444
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

357
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,041
Yes, madam?

358
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,446
I think we'd like some tea.

359
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,206
You get used to it.

360
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,250
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

361
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,364
I'm not a cleaner.

362
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,965
But I have come to clean away some dirt.

363
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,247
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

364
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,483
You killed my son!

365
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,166
You Peaky bastard!

366
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,281
You beat him

367
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,081
and beat him and beat him.

368
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,690
Your son was a boxer.

369
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,250
No!

370
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,211
He was a boy

371
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,727
who got into a ring with an animal.

372
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

373
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,289
I've come to stop you

374
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,211
because the coppers
and nobody else will.

375
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,771
If you're going to use it,

376
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,002
point that thing at my head.

377
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,282
That's where the trouble is.

378
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,050
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

379
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,970
I've seen 'em.

380
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,531
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

381
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,688
Hold that gun up and do it!

382
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,524
Fucking do it!

383
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,521
Do it!

384
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,171
I'm going to finish my drink.

385
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,530
You can finish it with me, if you like.

386
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,001
Now, look. Look at me.

387
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,330
We've got a fund.

388
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,803
For you. You'll get paid weekly.

389
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,646
I know it won't bring back your son.

390
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,891
I know that.

391
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,484
You have other sons.

392
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,406
You do.

393
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,362
And we'll find them work.

394
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,082
And you won't have to work.

395
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,561
- You'll be...

396
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,928
Somebody has got
to stop you people.

397
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,724
Who broke the fucking mirror?

398
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,441
Seven years' bad luck, that is.

399
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,127
There'll be another
four boatloads tomorrow.

400
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,610
What's up, Charlie? Business is good.

401
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,445
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

402
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,522
Cigarettes and booze is all right,
but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.

403
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,485
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

404
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,720
Some of it is legally purchased.

405
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,529
One day, all of it will be.

406
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,407
It's like having a fucking job.

407
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,050
Hey! Easy with them fan belts.

408
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,089
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

409
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,921
Done.

410
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,324
You don't even fight me any more.

411
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,767
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

412
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,889
They just fucking wave
at you from the bank.

413
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,201
Well, just wave back, eh?

414
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,926
And all these fucking cars.

415
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,526
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

416
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,721
--Uh.

417
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,720
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

418
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,245
Major Campbell.

419
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,005
Beg pardon?

420
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,364
It doesn't matter.

421
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,885
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

422
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,010
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

423
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,766
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

424
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,247
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

425
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,888
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

426
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,607
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

427
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,809
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

428
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,611
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

429
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,930
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

430
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,205
There is a chophouse two streets away.

431
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,011
But I myself serve sandwiches.

432
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,242
Egg and cress, or ham.

433
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,884
Or anything that pleases you.

434
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,162
No. No. No.

435
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,562
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.

436
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,008
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

437
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,567
I decided to bring it forward.

438
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,844
You just wanted to show me that
you know where I live, isn't that it?

439
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,161
Am I supposed to be impressed?

440
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,522
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.

441
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,891
Yes, he was.

442
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,407
All my demands have been met.

443
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,206
Did he tell you?

444
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,841
Yes.

445
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,485
Yes. We had a meeting
and your letter was read aloud.

446
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,764
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

447
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,889
- The gentlemen all found it quite funny.

448
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,486
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.

449
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,605
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

450
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,242
We will discuss our business on Sunday,

451
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,210
on the agreed day, at the allotted time,

452
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,489
and at the place that has
already been determined.

453
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,923
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

454
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,200
There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

455
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,602
I just didn't want you
to be made a fool of, is all.

456
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,922
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

457
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,729
how shall I put this?

458
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,646
Well, your landlady used to run the most
famous whorehouse in Stechford.

459
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,528
She's only semi-retired.

460
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,644
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny, eh?

461
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,727
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

462
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,125
See you Sunday!

463
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,767
- Name?
-Digbeth Kid.

464
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,921
Your real name.

465
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,610
Harold Hancox.

466
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Profession?

467
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,321
Illegal bookmaker.

468
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,168
You don't admit that.

469
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,641
You say something like,
"Umbrella mender".

470
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,849
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

471
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,767
Umbrella mender.

472
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,003
You were found
in possession of betting slips,

473
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,765
race cards and ticker tape.

474
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,080
Any explanation?

475
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,681
No.

476
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,121
No.

477
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,170
"No.

478
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,811
"I have no explanation

479
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,680
"for my possession
of those items, officer."

480
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,804
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

481
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,245
Come on, son.

482
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,603
Bloody hellfire.

483
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,723
You've killed him, huh?

484
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,285
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

485
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,442
He's got an army round him.

486
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,531
But when the time is right...

487
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,849
The time is right. It's right now.

488
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,686
When he's away from
his familiar territory, I will take him.

489
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,726
- So what do you want?
-We heard from a guard

490
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,724
at Winson Green prison that one of
their bookies has just been put inside.

491
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,049
Kid called Harold Hancox.

492
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,884
We could make a point.

493
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,009
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

494
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,010
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

495
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,721
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

496
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,768
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

497
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,285
Ragman.

498
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,203
- Where's my dry cleaning?
-It's been collected.

499
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,089
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

500
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,249
- What? You don't know?
-I can find out.

501
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,968
No need. I know already.

502
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,928
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

503
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,765
And the second favourites
are being done.

504
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,406
He's bewitching them.

505
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,527
Bewitching?

506
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,126
Gypsy stuff. Herbs, potions.

507
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,129
And he's tipping off our big punters,
so they know who's going to win.

508
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,011
Regular customers
betraying us for profit.

509
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,970
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,

510
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,611
comes before race, creed, family.

511
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,045
Results look normal to me.

512
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,770
You see shit!

513
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,006
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

514
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,367
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

515
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,047
- I gave you a job already.
-And the job will be done.

516
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,441
- But meantime...
-Meantime, fuck!

517
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,088
Meantime, what do you want us
to do about the kid

518
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,491
in the cage in Birmingham?

519
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,924
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

520
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,602
Is there somebody listening?

521
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,611
All right, I'll say it.

522
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,570
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

523
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,769
Good, and then you deal
with Tommy fucking Shelby.

524
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,765
You wanted to see me?

525
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,607
Aye.

526
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,286
Take off your clothes.

527
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,204
I know what you are.

528
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,891
So, take off your clothes.

529
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

530
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,765
Indeed not.

531
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,885
So it's true. Stop.

532
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,246
I only wanted proof. Not satisfaction.

533
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,044
Or indeed infection.

534
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,083
Are you in on the joke?

535
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,291
What joke?

536
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,120
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

537
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,285
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

538
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,160
And then my wrath will
come down on all of youse.

539
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,490
--But now,

540
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,531
tell your friends in the police station

541
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,807
that I know.

542
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,041
And when my judgement comes,

543
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,641
I'll be the one that's laughing.

544
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,401
Get out.

545
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,201
On the right. On the right.

546
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,006
We haven't got all night. Come on!

547
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,571
Let's be having you, Watkins,
in there on the right.

548
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,769
On the right! Come on, boys!

549
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,971
Harold Hancox?

550
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,521
Tell everybody,

551
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,810
this is what happens to Blinders
who come into the Green from now on.

552
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,245
Orders of Sabini.

553
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,162
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder. I've been stood up.

554
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,447
I'm not real! I'm not real!

555
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,885
I'm not real!

556
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,970
This had better be good
to interrupt my holiday.

557
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,201
Where's the boy?

558
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,281
In the back room.

559
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,567
I only brought him because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

560
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,207
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
-Shut up, John.

561
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,886
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

562
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,003
Tommy, get on with it.

563
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,491
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

564
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,124
This morning, I had a telegram
saying it was Sabini who ordered it.

565
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,044
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

566
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,088
If our men think we can't
look after them in prison,

567
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,241
they'll not work for us.

568
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,006
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.

569
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,401
Scudboat, you and one of the boys

570
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,006
break a couple of windows,
get yourselves arrested.

571
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,969
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

572
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,849
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

573
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,010
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

574
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,329
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.

575
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,004
- I'm still on a donkey.

576
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,084
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.

577
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,650
And before you all laugh,

578
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,610
a boy is dead.

579
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,924
He was just a kid.

580
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,522
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.

581
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,806
Agreed.

582
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,450
So is that it? Can I go now?

583
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,761
Well, as company treasurer,

584
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,844
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

585
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,121
On what?

586
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,565
On a horse.

587
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,768
A thousand guineas on a horse?

588
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,841
That's right.

589
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,291
When was this decided?

590
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,448
You've been busy with Michael.

591
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,931
Oh, my God.

592
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,003
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

593
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,484
Polly, there's a thoroughbred,
quarter-Arab filly

594
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,483
up for auction
at the Doncaster Bloodstock.

595
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,449
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

596
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,565
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

597
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,404
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

598
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,448
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

599
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,205
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

600
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,886
We'll be in there with all the toffs.

601
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,327
- Coppers won't know where to look.
-Hmm.

602
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,084
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

603
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,810
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.

604
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,881
The Derby?

605
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,769
Did he say the Derby?

606
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,764
That's right.

607
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,650
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

608
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,769
If we're going to take him down, might
as well make it there, as a symbol.

609
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,922
Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance?

610
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,081
Pol.

611
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,722
A good racehorse is an investment,
like property.

612
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,280
We need to diversify the portfolio.

613
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,286
So when is this sale?

614
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,486
Tomorrow.

615
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,803
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll
have to go with him for protection.

616
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,646
So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

617
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,451
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

618
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,171
Quarter-Arab is better!

619
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,208
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
-Curly, shut up.

620
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,762
I thought I told you to lock that door.

621
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,206
He did. I used the key on the nail.

622
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,601
Look, I've been listening.

623
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,842
- I want to go with them.
-You see?

624
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,731
I love horses. I could even help.

625
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,885
Over my dead body!

626
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,804
It'll be all right, Mum.

627
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,610
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

628
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,810
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

629
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,008
Yeah, and their posh wives!

630
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,366
And their mistresses.

631
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,444
Let him come, Polly.

632
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,324
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.

633
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,882
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

634
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,921
No.

635
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,686
Fucking no!

636
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,771
All right, that's it. Back to work.

637
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,080
Come on!

638
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,368
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,

639
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,091
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.

640
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,127
If you want to scare
that kid away forever,

641
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,441
carry on how you're going.

642
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,522
If you want him to stay,

643
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,045
let him come.

644
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,486
I can't believe it.

645
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,327
All John's old things fit me.

646
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,046
Christ, you look like your father.

647
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,687
Shrimp, ham.

648
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,722
What was he like? My dad?

649
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,445
How did he die?

650
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,289
Well, I won't lie to you.

651
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,689
He died drunk,
squeezed between a boat and a lock.

652
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,122
A real river gypsy's death.

653
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,606
But he could sing,

654
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,330
play the piano...

655
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,681
His smile would break your heart.

656
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,040
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

657
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,370
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

658
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,285
His trouble was,

659
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,442
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

660
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,686
I have told them not to blow that horn.

661
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,121
This is a respectable
fucking neighbourhood!

662
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,731
- She's heating up, Curly. Take a look.
-Yeah.

663
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,803
Let me out for a piss.

664
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,445
She made loads. Do you want one?

665
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,681
What the bloody hell's that?

666
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,363
Sandwiches. Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

667
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,884
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns 'cause there's only one cup.

668
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,641
What?

669
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,281
Sandwiches?

670
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,245
- Yeah.
-Polly made bloody sandwiches?

671
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,924
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?

672
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,402
All right. We will drink
the tea and we will eat the sandwiches

673
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,482
and then we will drive on. All right?

674
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,130
No crumbs, Charlie.

675
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,007
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.

676
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,082
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!

677
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,968
All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

678
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,451
and we will all behave accordingly.

679
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,889
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

680
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,564
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

681
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,450
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer.

682
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,806
So he knows to expect my bids.

683
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,087
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?

684
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,766
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

685
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,127
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

686
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,090
It's all right, Curly. You're just
in an unfamiliar place, we all are.

687
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,640
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
-It's all right, Curly. It's all right.

688
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,564
- Shut up, Curly.
- Do I hear 1,450?

689
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,563
Do I hear 500, 500,

690
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,008
1,600, 1,700? Thank you.

691
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,321
1,900, 2,000,

692
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,131
2,100, 2,200..

693
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,362
Why do people come late to these things?

694
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,521
Hmm?

695
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,284
People come late
'cause they know what they want.

696
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,522
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

697
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,250
Am I bid?

698
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,322
2,600. I am bid!

699
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,450
Sold!

700
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,606
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrarch out of Lady Josephine.

701
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,081
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.

702
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,730
All right, Tommy, this is her.

703
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,849
Do I hear 800 guineas?

704
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,641
850?

705
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,284
850. Do I hear nine?

706
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,170
Do I hear nine? Nine, am I bid?

707
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,844
Bid for this one.

708
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,410
The grey? Why?

709
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,129
- He's beautiful.
-It's a filly.

710
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,441
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.

711
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,330
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

712
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,282
1,100?

713
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,689
1,200?

714
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,244
Do I hear 250?

715
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,880
250.

716
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,167
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

717
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,527
1,300?

718
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,682
1,400?

719
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,805
Do I hear five?

720
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,004
1,500.

721
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,650
1,600.

722
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,324
Do I hear seven?

723
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,729
1,700. Thank you.

724
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,165
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.

725
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,366
You don't have it in your belt.

726
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,761
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

727
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,081
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.

728
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,128
- I feel something bad!
-Shut up, Curly!

729
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,568
2,000. Do I hear 2,050?

730
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,004
2,050. Am I bid?

731
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,689
-2,050...
-Enough!

732
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,569
Billy could use one of my geldings.

733
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,564
2,000, I am bid. Do I hear 2,050?

734
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,005
Last time.

735
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,447
2,050?

736
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,366
Sold! To Mr...

737
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,329
Thomas Shelby.

738
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,365
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,

739
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,441
Small Heath.

740
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,126
- What kind of premises?
-Boat yard.

741
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,406
Yachts?

742
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,321
Canals.

743
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,086
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

744
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,685
Import, export.

745
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,244
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.

746
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,244
You beat us to it.

747
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,961
Did I?

748
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,967
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.

749
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,006
- Sorry.
-Thomas Shelby from where?

750
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,571
From Birmingham.

751
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,641
Goodness!

752
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,165
No, not much.

753
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,925
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

754
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,411
What is it you do?

755
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,401
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.

756
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,643
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!

757
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,482
Well, before you go, if you ever
decide to put that filly out,

758
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,211
- I'd be interested in having her.
-I plan to race her.

759
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,403
- Do you have a trainer?
-I know people.

760
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,561
- I know people, too.
-Tommy!

761
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,608
We've got to get
this kid back before dark

762
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,523
or Polly will have your balls!

763
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,090
She will have 'em!

764
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,049
We know different people, I would guess.

765
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,804
My father knows Mick Hancock.

766
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,246
- Trained three Ascot winners.
-Oh, so that was your father?

767
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,685
Yes.

768
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,081
We're joint-owners of the stud.

769
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,130
He took the majority share
when my husband was killed.

770
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,326
Ypres.

771
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,200
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!

772
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,964
The chickens are hungry!

773
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,048
So will you consider me?

774
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,450
I will consider you.

775
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,006
You still didn't tell me what you do.

776
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,204
Oh! I do bad things.

777
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,448
But you already know that.

778
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,802
Right, about bloody time!

779
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,689
It's the fucking truth, John boy.

780
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,481
Rich women these days,
all they want is working-class cock.

781
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,562
Tommy, maybe she was the
something bad I had the feeling about!

782
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,290
Ah! She looks all right to me, Curly!

783
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,603
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.

784
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,681
Yeah, by us.

785
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,127
All I'll say is she has good contacts
in the racing world.

786
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,281
Here, Michael, you drive.

787
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,646
Thomas Shelby?

788
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,370
- Tommy!

789
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,290
- Tommy! Down!

790
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,926
Tommy Shelby?

791
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,570
How about fucking Arthur?

792
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,449
Fucking good to meet you.

793
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,045
Get him off him!

794
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,451
Arthur! Arthur!

795
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,285
Get him off him!

796
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,089
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

797
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,290
Get him off.

798
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,203
Arthur, that's enough.

799
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,408
Arthur, come on!

800
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,281
Come on, Arthur, come on.

801
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,010
That's it. It's over.

802
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,886
Arthur!

803
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,601
Come on, shut up.

804
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,722
Come on, come on.

805
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,921
He's still breathing.

806
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,048
Don't get blood on the kid!

807
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,363
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?

808
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,363
Give me the keys.

809
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,010
Michael, give me the keys.

810
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,003
I'm all right to drive.

811
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,770
All right. Go on. Go on, go on!

812
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,808
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!

813
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,850
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
-Come on!

814
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,684
So?

815
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,091
How'd it go?

816
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,444
Well, it was cold in the van,

817
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,522
but it was super. Really.

818
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,929
Let me smell your breath.

819
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,884
Did they behave themselves?

820
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,043
They were amazing, Mum.

821
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,842
They were really amazing.

822
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:33,166
