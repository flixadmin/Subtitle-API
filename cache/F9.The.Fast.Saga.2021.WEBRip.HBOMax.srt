1
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
<i>That's the cleanup crew up on</i>
<i>the track, and that's a lot of racers</i>

2
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,640
involved there, folks.

3
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,319
Jack, you realize
you got this in the bag, right?

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,680
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,079
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

6
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,239
- Last two laps.
- On it! Get those plug wires!

7
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,319
Jakob! Now.

8
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,719
- Hey, Pop.
- Tell me what you see, Dom.

9
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,560
Got an oil spill going into turn two.
Bell's driving safe.

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Corbin's got a sponsor in the stands,
so he's pushing it.

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,840
Talking about me?

12
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
You got a real problem with car 23.

13
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
- Linder.
- About to whip your ass, Toretto!

14
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,640
- Settle down, pretty boy!
- That's right.

15
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,239
Yeah, you. You want to tell your driver
he's gonna get somebody hurt?

16
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,400
- What'd you say?
- Hey! Leave it!

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,080
He's just pissed I got that spot in
the Busch Series next season, not him.

18
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,599
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny Linder.

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
You're good!

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
It's about being the bigger one.

22
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,639
I swear to God, this guy.

23
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,439
Pop, turn two, turn two!

24
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,879
Got it. I'm walking him in.

25
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,800
Shit!

26
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
Tell me what you see, Dom.

27
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,120
He's gonna come at you for that.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,879
Get ready on your left.

29
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,000
Three-eighths ratchet.

30
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,959
Three-eighths driver.

31
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,839
Six-inch extension.

32
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,720
Are you sure?

33
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,240
Remember what your daddy told you.

34
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,439
Be precise in life.

35
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,079
It can make all the difference.

36
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Now, watch this.

37
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,879
See how it's working now?

38
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,759
And you see what's happening?

39
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,319
It's turning the screw.

40
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,600
You're right.

41
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,199
Water heater's out again.

42
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,160
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

43
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,639
Want to come and give us a hand?

44
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,519
Are you expecting someone?

45
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,120
Brian, remember what we practiced.

46
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,439
Yo, yo!

47
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,360
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

48
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,160
It's me!

49
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,279
Roman?
Maybe you don't recognize me

50
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

51
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,040
B, come out, son.

52
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,560
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

53
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
What, you out here trying
to kill elephants or something?

54
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
We would've called first.

55
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,240
Except you actually need phones
in order to get phone calls.

56
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,399
You know that, right?

57
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
- Little B!
- Wow, you're so big.

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Hi.

59
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,560
Now, I know you don't carpool.

60
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,079
So what's up?

61
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,639
Mayday! Mayday!

62
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,560
<i>My plane is under attack</i>
<i>by a rogue agent!</i>

63
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,759
<i>We're being boarded.</i>
<i>I've got dangerous cargo on board.</i>

64
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,319
I need you to assemble the team.

65
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,319
...still alive. I'll explain...

66
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,160
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

67
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,360
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

68
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,959
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

69
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,839
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

70
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,959
He sent it only to us.

71
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,839
Why just us?

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,399
He caught Cipher.

73
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,879
But there was a midair attack,
and she was extracted.

74
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,759
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

75
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,920
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,519
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

77
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,680
But the whole area's sealed off.
Isolationist, run by military.

78
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,639
We're not on call anymore.

79
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,560
Wait, wait.
Dom, this is Cipher.

80
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,639
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

81
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,959
Things change.

82
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,519
Listen, we're wheels up at 8:00 a.m.,
if you change your mind.

83
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,160
Thank you.

84
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,079
Daddy, do you know where God is?

85
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,839
- Where is God?
- In your heart.

86
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,680
He's in your heart, too.

87
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,160
And you know something?

88
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,839
I'll always be in your heart.

89
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,319
Hey, little guy.

90
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,399
I have a gift for you.

91
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
Your father gave this to me.

92
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,039
And now I'm gonna give it to you.

93
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,399
It's very special.

94
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,080
Take care of it.

95
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,799
Good night.

96
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,360
This isn't who we are.

97
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,720
Brian and Mia got out of the
game when they became parents.

98
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,200
We're not them.

99
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,960
...under attack by a rogue agent!

100
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,360
<i>We're being boarded. I've got</i>
<i>dangerous cargo on board.</i>

101
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,600
...assemble the team.

102
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,559
...still alive. I'll explain...

103
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,960
...alive. I'll explain...

104
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,440
Coming up on the signal, two miles.

105
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,159
It's deep in the militarized
zone of Montequinto.

106
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,320
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

107
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,720
Y'all want to make jokes about me
not making practical decisions?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,559
This is as prepared as it gets.

109
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,200
We all see you, man.

110
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,879
Nobody thinks you're compensating
for anything.

111
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,919
- I'll take point.
- Careful.

112
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
Careful's when you get hurt.

113
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,039
Right now, we have
a ten-minute window between patrols.

114
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,
but we've got to move quickly, guys.

115
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,919
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

116
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,240
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

117
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,799
The source of the SOS signal is
coming from inside this thing.

118
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,960
Somebody wanted in.

119
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,799
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

120
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,600
Or it was sent down
on purpose to stop 'em.

121
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,679
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

122
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,399
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

123
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,600
Dom.
There's not a soul in sight.

124
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,840
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

125
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,840
Got it.

126
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,759
What the hell is this?

127
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,720
Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody
wanted us to find it.

128
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,759
How's that work...

129
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,519
Go!

130
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,080
What?!
You don't know who I am?!

131
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,679
You think I'm scared?!

132
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,919
Roman, where the hell are you?!

133
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,919
Who's compensating now, Tej?!

134
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,960
<i>"Peligro minas."</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

135
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,600
Tej, how fast we got to go
to clear 'em?

136
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,960
Please don't tell me you're thinking
what I think you're thinking.

137
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,360
<i>Why?</i>
<i>What does peligro minas mean?</i>

138
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,960
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

139
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,279
Somebody answer me!

140
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,679
What does peligro minas mean?

141
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,960
<i>Peligro minas means</i>
<i>"danger, land mines"!</i>

142
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,200
What?!

143
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,200
How fast, Tej?

144
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,879
Assuming a 50-foot blast radius

145
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,840
and a-a half a second trigger delay,
I'd say about 80.

146
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,879
I can't!
My speedometer only goes up to 70.

147
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,120
- What do I do?!
- You put your foot to that floor...

148
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,120
And you pray!

149
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,680
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

150
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,640
Roman, you good?

151
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,000
My ass is en fuego!

152
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,599
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

153
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,680
How in the hell are you not dead?

154
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,920
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

155
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,359
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

156
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,599
Good. The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

157
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,839
Letty, on the right.

158
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,119
The device.

159
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,319
Get in.

160
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,480
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

161
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,000
Always check your mirrors, bitches!

162
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,759
Oh, hell no.

163
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,240
Are we supposed to drive
across that?

164
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,759
Well, I said it looked like a bridge.

165
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,880
Oh, my God!

166
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,039
The military's not giving up.

167
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,440
We got to get past the border.

168
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,720
Where's the bridge?

169
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,599
No. No, no.

170
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,799
Dom.

171
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,759
Well, that was new.

172
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Look, we're in the clear.

173
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,799
But this thing is a mess.

174
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,920
The headlines out there?

175
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,039
Secret spy plane crashes
in a hostile country?

176
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,680
Followed by some
kind of covert ops firefight?

177
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,359
I'll get you where you need...

178
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,000
and then I'm gonna need to back off.

179
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,200
I appreciate the favor.

180
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,759
I got to stop doing so many favors.

181
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
What we doing, Ramsey?

182
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,440
Like, where are we going?

183
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,359
I-I was able to decrypt the data

184
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,839
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

185
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,599
and I found GPS coordinates,
definitely included on purpose.

186
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,039
You knew about Jakob?

187
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
Question: Who is Jakob?

188
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,160
Jakob is...

189
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,960
or was Dom's brother.

190
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,960
Oh, my-my bad.

191
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,839
I'm sorry. I'm just processing.

192
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880
Brother?

193
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
You got a brother?

194
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,160
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

195
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,319
with his own private army,

196
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,920
who drives literally like
a bat out of hell,

197
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,160
who preplanned an aerial jump

198
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,559
and landed at the bottom
of an airplane?

199
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,519
Who does that?

200
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,799
Who does that? A Toretto.

201
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,279
That's my dad! That's my dad!

202
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,359
He's gone! He's gone!

203
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
We got to get him out of there.

204
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,400
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

205
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,400
That's my dad! That's my dad!

206
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,119
That's my dad!

207
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,440
Get him out of there!

208
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,960
That's my dad!

209
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,119
There's a couple of release forms
we've got to sign.

210
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,240
Few clearances.

211
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

212
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,680
Hey.

213
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,680
Nobody's supposed to be around here.

214
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,400
You Toretto's other son?

215
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,880
You're the useless one, right?

216
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,519
- What is that?
- Get out of here. Go.

217
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,880
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

218
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,319
That's what that is?

219
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,759
No.
No, not you.

220
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,799
- You're the one that killed him.
- No, racing killed him.

221
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,680
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall.

222
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,759
He knew that.

223
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,519
Now, I don't know if
he dropped gear. I don't know.

224
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,759
I swear... I swear to God,
if you don't get out of here...

225
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,200
Go find Buddy.

226
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
Now!

227
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,880
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

228
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,799
Leave.

229
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,319
You here to make threats, too?

230
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,200
"Leave" is a simple word.

231
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,359
Man, what is it with you Torettos

232
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

233
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,160
Look, I'm gonna tell you a secret.

234
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,359
You, your dad, me...
we're all stuck,

235
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,720
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

236
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,839
And we ain't never getting out.

237
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
You ain't half the man my dad was.

238
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,720
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

239
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,559
Get off me!

240
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,839
Dom! Dom!

241
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,079
Dom!

242
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,960
Dom, no! Dom!

243
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,440
No, man!

244
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,640
In here.

245
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,279
Jakob.

246
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,279
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

247
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:27,079
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

248
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,519
I got this off the cockpit feed.

249
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,480
Oh, I love being rich.

250
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,680
It was sloppy. He almost had me.

251
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,720
- She say anything?
- Nope. Nada.

252
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,480
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

253
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,000
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

254
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,920
Is that weird?

255
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,319
Nice operation.

256
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,079
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

257
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,200
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

258
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,759
Money well spent.

259
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,920
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

260
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,960
Do you?

261
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

262
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,359
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

263
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,359
Isn't it?

264
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,240
So your whole life, you pushed
yourself to be faster than Dom.

265
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,119
Smarter than Dom.

266
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,559
Stronger than Dom.

267
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,279
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

268
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,519
Still?

269
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,079
All these years later?

270
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,000
I should've just hired you

271
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,720
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back.

272
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,640
- I don't work for the competition.
- That's cute.

273
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,559
- You thinking you're the competition.
- Says the woman in the box.

274
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,799
Look familiar?

275
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,519
The other half's hidden in one
of the agency's thousands of vaults.

276
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,119
I need you to find out which one.

277
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,720
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

278
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,200
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

279
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,039
Pre-Internet.

280
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,640
To make sure you don't go hack
into anything we don't want you to.

281
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,200
Say you get what you're after.

282
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,240
A weapon so dangerous it shouldn't
exist for another half century.

283
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,519
What would you do with it?
Launch some global attack?

284
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,920
Sell it to the highest bidder?

285
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,039
Or maybe you see yourself

286
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:34,680
as a necessary shock to the system.

287
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,599
I bet all you ever wanted was a hug.

288
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,680
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

289
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,039
I read your second-grade
report card.

290
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,519
That's what I do.

291
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,640
Your chin... it's distinctive.

292
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,759
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

293
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,839
but I never detected
a Nordic strain.

294
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,839
Finding the two halves of
Project Aries is the easy part.

295
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,759
Add in your brother Dom to the mix?

296
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,079
You don't have a chance.

297
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,680
Plans are in motion.

298
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Qasar Khan.

299
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,440
What?

300
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,079
Genghis Khan's little brother.

301
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,119
Nobody's heard of him either.

302
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,400
Talk about off the grid.

303
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,640
I don't think they had grids
when this place was built.

304
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me,
tell you right now, I'm out.

305
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,279
No way this place was
sanctioned by the agency.

306
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,359
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

307
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,680
What now, Dom?

308
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,680
Whoever Jakob has become...

309
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,839
and whatever he's up to...

310
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,480
it's on me.

311
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,960
- And me alone.
- Nah.

312
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:53,039
Whatever's on you, it's on us.

313
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:54,880
Let's get to work.

314
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,440
Y'all ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on?

315
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,800
How we somehow...
always survive?

316
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
- So far, so good, I guess.
- It's just luck.

317
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,960
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

318
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,079
Think about this.

319
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,800
We've now been on insane missions

320
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,800
around the world,
doing what most would say is

321
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,320
damn near impossible.

322
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,119
And I ain't got one single scar
to show for it?

323
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,280
I mean, look at my jacket.

324
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,719
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

325
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,920
clean off its shoulders.

326
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,000
We've taken out cars, trains, tanks.

327
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,960
I'm not gonna even
mention the submarine.

328
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,840
And yet we're still here.

329
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,239
Exactly.

330
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,800
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

331
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,119
over and over again only
to come to the same result?

332
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,000
A hypothesis becomes fact.
But you're not actually suggesting that...

333
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,920
I don't know,
but when the improbable happens

334
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
again and again,
that's more than luck.

335
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,639
Maybe we're not so normal.

336
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,599
That's what I'm saying.

337
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,039
We are not normal.

338
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,639
Okay, um...

339
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,440
just to clarify,

340
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,159
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're what,

341
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,079
invincible?

342
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,199
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

343
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,159
Or maybe...

344
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,440
you're just a dumbass.

345
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,880
Take your dumbass jacket
with you, man.

346
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,159
Pretty impressive driving out there.

347
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,280
You miss the old life.

348
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,679
Do you?

349
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,039
Every day.

350
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,440
Guys.

351
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,840
We got a little company.

352
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,360
Think you know this person.

353
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,719
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

354
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,639
Thank you.

355
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
Of course.

356
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,760
You should've told me.

357
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,000
She deserved to know.

358
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,840
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

359
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,159
You get involved here, you put
everything you have at risk.

360
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,159
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

361
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,000
We're all risking something.

362
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,840
Dom, listen to me.

363
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
My kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible.

364
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,960
With Brian.

365
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,559
Our world's grown, Dom.

366
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,119
I got this one.

367
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,280
The firewall on this old thing
is actually pretty good.

368
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,159
But, you know, port scan,
UDP message peek,

369
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,000
pop to root shell, and...

370
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,039
...say hello to Project Aries.

371
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,559
What is it?

372
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,159
It's what we got
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

373
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,400
Or at least part of it.

374
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,320
Aries was designed
to override and assimilate

375
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,920
anything that runs on code.

376
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
Any computer anywhere.

377
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,400
If it operates on zeros
and ones, it's vulnerable.

378
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,519
If you take Aries
and upload it to a satellite,

379
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,840
it'll spread like a virus.

380
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,000
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

381
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,840
any weapon system...
traditional, nuclear,

382
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,679
stuff we haven't even seen yet...
and just point it wherever they want.

383
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,960
Jakob reboots the world order
within minutes.

384
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:46,679
Ares is the god of war, right?

385
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,599
If Jakob gets his hands on this,

386
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,639
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

387
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:54,960
Because of how dangerous it was,
the Aries prototype was recovered

388
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,920
and split into two halves
by Mr. Nobody.

389
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,480
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

390
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,639
Jakob now has one of the pieces.

391
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,719
He'll be going after
the other half next.

392
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,239
As for the key, it's...
it's vanished.

393
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
So we find it.

394
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,360
If we're gonna beat Jakob to it,
we're gonna have to split up.

395
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,920
Roman, Tej, I know a couple of guys

396
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,239
operating out of Germany that
could get us anything we need.

397
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,079
- I'm on it.
- Wait, there's one more thing.

398
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,639
Mr. Nobody's transmission
had one name connected to the key.

399
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:27,320
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

400
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,519
No way.

401
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,159
That's exactly what I said.

402
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,960
So you're saying Han's death
is connected to all of this?

403
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,000
He has to have
something to do with it.

404
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,280
I'll look into it.

405
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,519
Tej, can you send me
all the files you have on Han?

406
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,960
- Yeah.
- I'll go with you.

407
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,360
Letty.

408
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,159
I got this the day Han died.

409
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,519
Mexico.

410
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,760
Check the postmark.

411
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:03,159
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

412
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,320
Tokyo.

413
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,280
What are you gonna do about Jakob?

414
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm gonna find him.

415
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,519
How?

416
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,719
An old friend.

417
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,639
Yo, what do you think?

418
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,280
¿Es una ilusión o es real?

419
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,199
It doesn't matter.
It's all about how you choose to see it.

420
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,960
Shit. I told you I was right.

421
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,880
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

422
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,840
Dom. What are you guys in for?

423
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,679
Driving while brown.

424
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,159
You see that?

425
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,960
Hairline crack in the fuel line.

426
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,840
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

427
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,719
Lean condition?

428
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,360
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

429
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,840
That's what I'm talking about!

430
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,519
Who wants next?

431
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,119
I said, who wants next?!

432
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,639
I got next.

433
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,039
Dom.

434
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,320
Well, when'd you get out, man?

435
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,360
I said I got next.

436
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,119
Come on, Dom.

437
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,119
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old Charger.

438
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,119
Car don't make the driver.

439
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,880
Here's how this goes.

440
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,800
You win...

441
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,559
you can come back home.

442
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,519
You lose...

443
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,239
you keep driving, you don't stop,

444
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,960
you don't ever come back.

445
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,440
Ever.

446
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,599
What do you mean, Dom?

447
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,480
I know what you did.

448
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:05,920
The day we lost him,
Dad kept talking about a misfire.

449
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
Remember?

450
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,079
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

451
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,239
A minute later, he was gone.

452
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,760
Tell me why you killed Dad.

453
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,440
Now let's race.

454
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,719
Armed robbery in Echo Park.

455
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,440
- Fourth Street Bridge is open.
- Clear, clear, clear!

456
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,559
Ready?

457
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Set.

458
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,119
Go.

459
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Too soon.

460
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
No!

461
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,119
...and beating the shortstop.

462
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,159
Line drive over the head of Gonzalez

463
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,280
on the field for a base hit.

464
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,440
Up next...

465
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,159
Place still looks the same.

466
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:36,960
Just like your dad left it.

467
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:39,639
I'm looking for Jakob.

468
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:44,440
Can't help you, man.

469
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,599
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

470
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,239
The worst thing
you can do to a Toretto

471
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,199
is take away their family.

472
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,159
That's what you did to Jakob.

473
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,800
You've got people who love you,
count on you, care for you.

474
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,760
He ain't got no one.

475
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,559
You get in his way,
this ain't gonna end

476
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,280
until one of you guys
are in the ground.

477
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,079
I know you did
the best you could, Buddy.

478
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,480
But we both know he's about
to cause a lot of hurt.

479
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,320
I did my best to take care of Jakob.

480
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:34,119
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

481
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,880
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

482
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,400
...if you want hope for the future.

483
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,719
He's in London.

484
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
That's all I know.

485
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,599
Dom.

486
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,000
I hope you find your peace.

487
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,840
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

488
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:56,679
Arigato.

489
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,880
This place is a dead end.

490
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,280
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the Han connection?

491
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,320
If he has all the information
we do, probably.

492
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,400
I never told Dom...

493
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:18,079
I stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened.

494
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,760
He was over at Buddy's
for about a year, and then...

495
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,519
he was gone with
a message not to follow.

496
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,519
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

497
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,320
that I would've...
would've done anything.

498
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,679
I even broke into a police archive,
but I didn't find anything.

499
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,360
You what?

500
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,920
You were like 16.

501
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,880
I did what I had to do.

502
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:41,960
Yeah.

503
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:47,039
How about you?

504
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,679
How are you doing?

505
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,679
It's a change of pace, huh?

506
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,599
Just as I was remembering...

507
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,400
...who I was,

508
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,400
everything changed.

509
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,159
It slowed down.

510
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,119
There's peace for me in the chaos.

511
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,039
It's like I... I need to face
the world head-on or something

512
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,599
to feel alive.

513
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:14,840
Seeing Little Brian

514
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,320
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company...

515
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,400
...that got to me.

516
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,679
We never used to hide.

517
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,800
Hey, Dom's my brother, but you
will always be my sister.

518
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:34,000
Funny how we all have secrets.

519
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,639
What?

520
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,800
You got to be kidding me.

521
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,360
What is it?

522
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,039
Remember what Han used to say
about Tokyo?

523
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:52,320
You mean how
in all the old Westerns,

524
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,360
cowboys would make a run
for the border to get away

525
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,320
from the law, how Tokyo was his...

526
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,880
Mexico.

527
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,519
No way.

528
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,800
She's ready to roll.

529
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,840
No. No!

530
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,000
No, Sean!

531
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:27,039
Tell me you are not modding the quick
disconnect valve on the LOX line.

532
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,559
Hey, man, chill out.
It's all good.

533
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:31,800
- That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.
- "All good"?

534
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,360
This isn't Top Gun, Maverick.

535
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,119
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

536
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,880
Hey, come on.
That's a bit much.

537
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,559
When you know what too much
pressure in the LOX line can do,

538
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,360
come talk to me.
Till then, stay in your lane.

539
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,960
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my lane.

540
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,760
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

541
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,079
how to let us build rocket engines
and get paid.

542
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,880
This whole thing was my idea.

543
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,679
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

544
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,800
this glorified mechanic...

545
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,239
or a rocket scientist?

546
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,239
Without me,
you'd be working at Jiffy Lube.

547
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,320
Guys, guys.

548
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,519
Look, it's all good.
Who cares about who did what?

549
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,119
Kind of hard for you to do anything

550
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,840
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

551
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,639
Did I hear that right?

552
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,000
You a runner
and you afraid of flying?

553
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,159
"Twinkie"?

554
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,760
So you must be
Ding Dong and Snoball.

555
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,880
- Right?
- Yo, uh...

556
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,360
I don't go by that name anymore.

557
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,800
You went by that name ever?

558
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,119
Like, ever?

559
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:25,920
I... That's-that's-that's...

560
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,679
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

561
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,199
Hey, fellas.

562
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,039
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

563
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,679
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

564
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:50,039
Is that a Pontiac Fiero
strapped to a rocket engine?

565
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:52,119
Impressive, I know.

566
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:54,760
No.
No, that's not impressive.

567
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,840
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

568
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,920
Plane's taking off!
Go, go, go, go!

569
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,079
Yes!

570
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,400
We did it!

571
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,519
I'm confused.

572
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,000
Y'all didn't actually beat the jet.

573
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:50,960
It didn't explode.

574
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,719
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

575
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,519
She's still in one piece.

576
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
You mean "pieces"?

577
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,840
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

578
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,599
Look, we heard y'all could
get us some wheels.

579
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:11,840
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

580
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,519
Is that possible?

581
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,400
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

582
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,480
Dominic Toretto sent us.

583
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,920
Who's Dominic Toretto?

584
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,639
Nice necklace, Queenie.

585
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,840
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

586
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,800
Dominic Toretto.

587
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,239
The word on the street is
you got locked up.

588
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,199
Yeah, well, in and out, you know.

589
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,360
When are they gonna learn?

590
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,119
Some birds can't be caged.

591
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:41,280
Are you looking for one of me sons?

592
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,800
Not tonight.

593
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,519
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

594
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,639
My thieving days are over.

595
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,159
Mine ain't.

596
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,159
You coming?

597
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,679
I'm looking for someone.

598
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,280
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

599
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,039
A lot of guys, a lot of resources.

600
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, word did go round

601
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,480
on a crew that just turned up,
led by an American.

602
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

603
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,960
Rumor had it he was into
something big up in Edinburgh.

604
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,760
Local seller, huh?

605
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,840
She wouldn't happen to be
wearing a stolen necklace, would she?

606
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,440
He paid well.
What was I supposed to do?

607
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,039
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

608
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:13,119
Similar features.

609
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your
cousin or something, is he?

610
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,880
He's my brother.

611
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,800
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

612
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,559
Glad I'm not the only one with
a family full of eccentrics.

613
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,320
He offered payment
for something else.

614
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:43,159
You.

615
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,800
You know, nothing's more powerful
than the love of family.

616
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,400
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

617
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:19,239
nothing's more dangerous.

618
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,599
Dom?

619
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,239
Don't get yourself killed, okay?

620
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,840
You're my favorite American.

621
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,280
This is your kind of party, isn't it,
Dom?

622
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,239
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

623
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,159
You know, best security, too.

624
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:04,199
I'm Otto.
I'm your brother's partner.

625
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,159
Well, fi-financier.

626
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:11,960
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

627
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:14,920
so we're not talking regular people
rich here. No, no, no, no, no.

628
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,039
Everything you see here, I own.

629
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,119
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

630
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,320
maybe two, maybe three,

631
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,000
just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

632
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:23,800
I offer a bomb-ass dental plan, too.
Huh?

633
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,039
Where is Jakob?

634
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,840
He's inside.

635
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:08,000
The brother you're looking for...

636
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,119
he's from an old life.

637
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,079
He's long gone.

638
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,599
All I see is the same scared little kid
that killed our father.

639
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,519
That's your mistake.

640
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,559
The spy game...

641
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:25,280
this is my world.

642
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,719
So here's my offer.

643
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,559
It's the same one you gave me.

644
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:38,719
You leave.

645
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,400
Now.

646
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,400
You drive away,
and you never come back.

647
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,440
Ever.

648
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,280
A deal?

649
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,159
I showed you mercy!

650
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:55,119
And I won't show it to you again.

651
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,039
Toretto.

652
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,079
Since my dad is head of state,

653
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,159
it makes me a foreign dignitary

654
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:14,880
and this place an embassy.

655
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,960
Which means you just trespassed

656
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,800
into my country
and attempted murder.

657
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,800
So, naturally, I called in
a little favor

658
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,719
with all my good friends
from Interpol.

659
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,079
You keep digging around
in the past, Dom,

660
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,400
you're not gonna like what you find.

661
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:38,760
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

662
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,199
But your family is a train wreck.

663
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,639
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

664
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:47,559
it's time we go to Edinburgh.

665
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:51,719
Get the second piece,
maybe do a little sightseeing, huh?

666
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:54,280
Any news on the key?

667
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,440
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

668
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,079
One week from now, there won't
be a superpower in the world

669
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,760
can take a piss
without our permission.

670
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,880
One week from now, your dad
will be asking you for an allowance.

671
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,920
I'd like that.

672
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:11,920
I'd like that.

673
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,000
What's up?

674
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,079
- Well done, Leysa.
- Please.

675
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,119
If it wasn't for you, I'd still
be stealing gas in the D.R.

676
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:37,119
So Queenie treating you right?

677
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:38,360
Like a princesa.

678
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,440
I'm her number-one pick, you know.

679
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,440
- Cara's little sister done good.
- Good?

680
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,679
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

681
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,320
You see how I been rocking shit?

682
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,000
All this crew, this is mine. Huh?

683
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,440
I been around the world.

684
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,719
Oh, I almost forgot.
You might need this.

685
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,639
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

686
01:01:56,719 --> 01:01:59,519
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

687
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,039
Hey, Letty.

688
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,159
Yeah.

689
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:41,159
Come look at this.

690
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:42,639
What the hell?

691
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,519
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

692
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,039
Letty, Mia!

693
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,360
Down, now!

694
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:43,000
You okay?

695
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,239
Welcome to Saint Giles'
Cathedral of Edinburgh.

696
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,880
The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

697
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,039
Renowned for
its stained glass windows,

698
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:55,039
you can see
the intricate craftsmanship...

699
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,760
We're a go.

700
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,199
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

701
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,159
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

702
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:11,559
and the algorithm I've run says

703
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,559
Jakob's team is right on top of us.

704
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:15,920
Anywhere between 80 and 100 meters.

705
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,320
80 meters?
That's a lot around here.

706
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,079
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

707
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,639
So, we don't know

708
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:25,880
where the secret vault facility
Jakob is looking to hit is,

709
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
now, do we?

710
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,320
Wouldn't be a secret if we did.

711
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,559
You know what?

712
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:33,079
I'm starting to think
your little English accent

713
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:35,199
makes you sound smarter
than you are.

714
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:42,159
Man, can I point out
that a good old-fashioned

715
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:43,400
tracking chip would've put us

716
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,920
within like six feet of this dude?

717
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,159
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

718
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:49,039
and facial recognition imaging.

719
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,800
Feels like we looking
for Where's Waldo

720
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,559
in Harry Potter world.

721
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:56,360
Strong argument there, Tej,
but tracking chips follow the chip.

722
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,320
Before we know it,
we'd be chasing some expensive

723
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,519
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

724
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:03,559
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

725
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,920
Wait.

726
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,480
Guys, okay, we have a problem.

727
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,880
Cameras are going down all around us,
and my equipment is freaking out.

728
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,599
What the hell, Jimmy?

729
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:17,719
Security alert.
Cameras are down.

730
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,519
Damn.

731
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,039
You see anything suspicious?

732
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,639
Uh, where do I start?

733
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:28,000
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

734
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,079
I even seen these two ladies walking

735
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:33,119
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

736
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,159
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

737
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:50,320
Ramsey, we're looking everywhere.

738
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,440
I just grew a new bunion.

739
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,679
This is hopeless.

740
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,119
What?

741
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:58,199
- You see that?
- See what?

742
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,920
The ears.

743
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,760
They got cauliflower ears.

744
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,599
They fight for a living.

745
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,280
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

746
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,400
Hey, man, I ordered a pair of Crocs

747
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,039
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

748
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,640
Where are my shoes, man?!

749
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,119
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

750
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,439
Hey, Dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

751
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,279
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

752
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,079
'cause he didn't like their ears.

753
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,279
Wait, wait, wait.

754
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,279
H-How much did you say
you paid for that again?

755
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,800
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

756
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:42,159
You know what?
Sh... Just shut up.

757
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,279
Just shut up.

758
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:46,079
Ramsey, say we had
a big electromagnet

759
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:48,159
turned up right around here.

760
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,760
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

761
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,199
Including security systems.
That's it.

762
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,079
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

763
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:00,239
Guys?

764
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:02,159
Guys?

765
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,079
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

766
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:09,960
- The area's locking down.
- He ain't using roads.

767
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:25,520
I got eyes on Jakob.

768
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,000
I see Otto.

769
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,600
I'm gonna tail him.

770
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,159
He's heading towards a blue Jaguar.

771
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:52,319
- Okay, follow him.
- Me? I can't.

772
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,439
Why not?

773
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,000
<i>Okay, this is a bad time</i>
<i>to tell you this,</i>

774
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,760
but I don't drive.

775
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,720
Okay? I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

776
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,840
And, you know,
no one really drives in London.

777
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,600
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

778
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,600
It's you or no one.

779
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:18,439
Shit.

780
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,239
Guys, come on, man.

781
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:23,800
I feel like, between the six of us,
we can work this out, right?

782
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,479
Okay. I've got...

783
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,039
Ramsey, shut it off!

784
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,560
Shut it off!

785
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,720
- Go, go, go!
- Okay. Uh...

786
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,279
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

787
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:45,159
Shit.

788
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,119
Hey!

789
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,279
Oh! Sorry!

790
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,479
Oh, no!

791
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,359
Move!

792
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:53,319
Hey, that was not my fault!

793
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,720
Okay, that one was my fault.

794
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,760
See?
What'd I tell you?

795
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:41,399
Not even a scratch.

796
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:56,439
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

797
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:06,439
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

798
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:45,640
Otto, where are you?

799
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,479
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

800
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:51,239
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

801
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,840
That's my car, pal!

802
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,119
Dom!

803
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:32,800
Go!

804
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,640
Damn it.

805
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,680
You're a natural.

806
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,479
Of course I am.

807
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,680
Okay, listen up!

808
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,439
I want 50 of the best men!
I want guns!

809
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,560
I want wheels, freaking
X-wing fighters... I don't care!

810
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,279
<i>The Millennium Falcon and</i>
<i>Chewbacca if you can get ahold of him.</i>

811
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:36,520
Money's no object. Go.

812
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:38,119
Go!

813
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,479
What?

814
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,560
What's so funny?

815
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:54,800
I...

816
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,439
I was thinking, if this was a movie,

817
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,119
this would be the moment

818
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,159
where the villain has
an unexpected setback,

819
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,920
overcompensates without
thinking it through

820
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,079
and gets crushed by the good guys.

821
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,720
No offense, but you have
no idea what we're about to do.

822
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:16,840
And for the record,
we're the good guys.

823
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,319
Me?
I'm Luke freaking Skywalker.

824
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:20,640
Are you sure about that?

825
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,079
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

826
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,800
Look at what you've built.

827
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:30,640
Really? Luke?

828
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:33,159
You're right.

829
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,640
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

830
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,880
No.

831
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:43,039
- You're Yoda.
- Yoda?

832
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,039
No. The little green guy?
No.

833
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:49,600
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

834
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,399
Because he's a powerful Jedi, right?

835
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,640
No.

836
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:55,520
Yoda's a puppet.

837
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,119
With someone's hand up his ass.

838
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:24,319
So what now, Dom?

839
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,720
No one outruns their past.

840
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,359
And yours just caught up to you.

841
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,760
Man.

842
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,399
There is literally zero industrial

843
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:44,880
or weapons-grade electromagnets
I can find that are this powerful.

844
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,199
Look at the pull strength
level here.

845
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:48,399
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

846
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:50,520
Wait, watch this.

847
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,239
Every time. I can't believe it.

848
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:10,039
What are you doing, bruh?

849
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:11,479
I'm hungry.

850
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,359
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

851
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:14,760
Surprise.

852
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,399
Nice clubhouse.

853
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,920
'Sup, man?

854
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,560
Nice to meet you.

855
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:55,760
So you got my postcard, huh?

856
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,159
I'm just still trying to figure out...

857
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,159
How are you still alive?

858
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,560
Well, after Gisele died...

859
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,680
I didn't know what to do.

860
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,840
I was aimless.

861
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:29,880
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

862
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,279
But can you get to the part where

863
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:34,680
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

864
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,600
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

865
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,399
Can you just be quiet
for one minute?

866
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,800
We made plans.
We had dreams.

867
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,880
So what's our next adventure
after this?

868
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:51,439
How about...
we stay in one place?

869
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,720
- Where you thinking?
- Tokyo.

870
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,399
We always talk about Tokyo.

871
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,119
Tokyo it is.

872
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,840
<i>You know, it's funny,</i>
<i>Gisele led me there,</i>

873
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,560
and I wasn't even looking for it.

874
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,279
But it became home.

875
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,399
Then one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

876
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,399
I worked with Gisele.

877
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,319
Back when I was a CIA operative

878
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:20,399
running the drug trade
in Central America.

879
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,279
The good old days.

880
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:25,520
Gisele was my best.

881
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,800
You can lose an asset at any time.

882
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:32,760
Bullet, knife, wire.

883
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,800
But I never thought I'd lose her...

884
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,399
to love.

885
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,479
- What do you want?
- I'm offering you a job, Han.

886
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,520
Here, in Tokyo.

887
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,279
- Why me?
- 'Cause I saw your work with Gisele.

888
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:52,880
I saw that she trusted you.

889
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:56,079
And that means I can trust you.

890
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,680
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

891
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:09,560
<i>And all I knew</i>
<i>was that I had to steal some tech</i>

892
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,760
from the home of a scientist couple.

893
01:22:15,319 --> 01:22:17,680
But as usual...

894
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,920
<i>Mr. Nobody didn't</i>
<i>tell me everything.</i>

895
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:23,720
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

896
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,119
I was 11.

897
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:33,039
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

898
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:35,319
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

899
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,800
I was so excited to go

900
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,600
<i>I forgot my raincoat,</i>
<i>so I went back in.</i>

901
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,760
At first, I didn't see it.

902
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,079
By the time
I looked out the window...

903
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,640
Mom and Dad were gone.

904
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,319
Turns out I wasn't the only one

905
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,079
looking for this thing.

906
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,560
Get down!

907
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:40,600
Han saved me.

908
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,720
Wouldn't leave me behind.

909
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,439
He knew I'd always be a target,
so he taught me how to survive.

910
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,000
We became a family.

911
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,079
"Always be a target"?

912
01:23:58,039 --> 01:23:59,399
Why?

913
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:01,399
'Cause she is the key.

914
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,479
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

915
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:10,600
It was a person all along.

916
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,960
My parents didn't want Project Aries
to fall into the wrong hands,

917
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:18,600
so they locked it with their own DNA,
something we share.

918
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,720
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

919
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,079
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

920
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:28,560
<i>So when Deckard Shaw came calling,</i>
<i>we used it as cover.</i>

921
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,239
But you got killed
in a car crash, Han.

922
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,159
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

923
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,319
Pretty nifty magic trick.

924
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:53,479
Yeah, I've done better.

925
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,279
Now for the hard part.

926
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:00,600
Keeping you dead.

927
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:04,439
My death...

928
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,600
Became the best way to stay alive.

929
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,239
What's happening?

930
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:15,600
It's some kind of hidden subroutine
the system follows.

931
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:39,560
That's it, right there.

932
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,520
Yeah, nobody moves...

933
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:44,279
everybody lives.

934
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,479
Jakob.

935
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,600
I'm sorry, Mia.

936
01:25:57,079 --> 01:25:58,920
I was the rogue agent.

937
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,840
Me.

938
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:03,479
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

939
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,800
Think he just dropped
out of the sky and chose you?

940
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,279
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

941
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:15,680
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

942
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:18,720
And you just handed her over.

943
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,880
I told you.

944
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:23,600
This is my world.

945
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:26,680
Got it.

946
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,399
Got a lot of guys here.

947
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:30,399
You trust 'em?

948
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,159
Trust this.

949
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,840
You know the only good thing
to come from Dad dying?

950
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:45,560
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

951
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:52,359
And now you're gonna spend the
rest of yours living in mine.

952
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,560
Only good thing about Dad dying...

953
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:01,359
was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

954
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,800
You never deserved the Toretto name.

955
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,159
You think you knew Dad, huh?

956
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,479
What, 'cause you were his
favorite? You don't know shit!

957
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,920
Okay?

958
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,760
You want the truth?

959
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,359
Dad died 'cause he was trying
to throw that race.

960
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,199
We were in deep debt.

961
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:25,359
'Cause of how he felt about you,

962
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:27,840
he had to ask me for help.

963
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,079
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

964
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,600
A good son would've said no.

965
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,960
And a real brother
would've come to me.

966
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:38,680
Come to you?

967
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,960
He made me promise
you would never find out.

968
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,279
And through all of it...

969
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,840
...I kept that promise.

970
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:00,479
The girl comes with me.

971
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,880
Jakob!

972
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,760
I will stop you.

973
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:08,560
And that's my promise.

974
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,960
Sue. Sue. Ah.

975
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:22,479
Come on. Come on.

976
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,760
Down!

977
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:01,199
Go! Go!

978
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:02,800
Come on!

979
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,840
This way!

980
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:35,600
I'm always here.

981
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,640
Tell him.

982
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:41,399
No...!

983
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:43,439
No!

984
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,159
No!

985
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:15,880
Dom.

986
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,199
Tell me what you see, son.

987
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:27,880
See, cars like this are immortal.

988
01:31:33,079 --> 01:31:35,680
'70 Chargers are designed so well

989
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,159
that if you take care of 'em,
they'll run for 100 years.

990
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:41,560
Immortal?

991
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:45,600
Just like a family, Dom.

992
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:49,960
Build it right,
you take care of it...

993
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:52,399
...it'll live beyond you.

994
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:54,520
Daddy.

995
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:03,279
Little B.

996
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:05,479
When are you coming home?

997
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,439
Com...

998
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,600
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

999
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,159
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

1000
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:11,760
- Last two laps.
- On it!

1001
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,760
Get those plug wires!

1002
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,600
Jakob! Now.

1003
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,640
You're good!

1004
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,279
No!

1005
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:47,439
You came to me, Letty.

1006
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:52,279
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

1007
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:54,640
Do you hear me?

1008
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,479
Is this who we are?

1009
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,119
Yeah.

1010
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,800
From here, things move quickly.
Jakob has all the pieces he needs.

1011
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,319
Once he activates Aries,

1012
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:15,840
all he needs to do is
send the signal global.

1013
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,439
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

1014
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,079
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

1015
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,039
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

1016
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:24,800
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

1017
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,960
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

1018
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:28,680
Our odds are zero here, Han.

1019
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,600
Satellite equipment is
easy enough to track,

1020
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,760
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

1021
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,760
Which gives us a two-target problem:

1022
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,960
- Jakob on the ground...
- With his own private army.

1023
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:39,239
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

1024
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:41,640
Not remotely.
We'd have to do it physically.

1025
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:44,239
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit.

1026
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,000
Orbit?

1027
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:47,399
We need help.

1028
01:35:47,479 --> 01:35:49,199
Otherwise, we have no chance.

1029
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:51,880
We do it ourselves.

1030
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,239
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

1031
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:57,079
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1032
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,520
Do y'all not understand?

1033
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,840
Clearly, y'all don't.

1034
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:04,199
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

1035
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:05,359
like a normal person.

1036
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,279
Orbit.
That's outer space.

1037
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,399
That's another level.

1038
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:13,479
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

1039
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,000
Put rockets on our backs?

1040
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,000
- That's exactly what we're gonna do.
- What?

1041
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,000
There goes my father's diplomatic ties
with Eastern Europe.

1042
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:40,159
This place is going to be crawling
with every cop in the city.

1043
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,560
Time to get the hell out of here.

1044
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,520
Keep her close.

1045
01:37:14,199 --> 01:37:15,520
It's activated.

1046
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,039
As soon as the satellite reaches orbit,
we start the uplink.

1047
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,760
Ah, damn.

1048
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,279
What?

1049
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:30,840
You see that?

1050
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:33,640
We can't have an air leak, man.

1051
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,199
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

1052
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:40,279
Yes.

1053
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:41,640
I don't know if you noticed or not,

1054
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,479
but this whole operation is
Band-Aids and duct tape.

1055
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,039
Man, this is insane.
We are headed to outer space.

1056
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:50,760
You acting like
we on our way to Home Depot.

1057
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,920
This is ridiculous, man.

1058
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,720
I'm about to abort this whole mission
and take my Black ass home.

1059
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,079
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

1060
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,600
Freefall?
What does that even mean?

1061
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,399
Roman, it means numbers don't lie.

1062
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:05,199
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

1063
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,680
then we'll be fine, okay?

1064
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:09,600
It's just all math and science.

1065
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,399
I knew I should've listened
to my teachers.

1066
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:14,840
Four minutes to launch.
You fellas good to go?

1067
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,199
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

1068
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,119
You know, that's what Tej do.

1069
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,520
Man, please hurry up so I can
stop hearing his damn mouth.

1070
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,960
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

1071
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:30,079
This is the same car that we watched
do a test run and explode.

1072
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,840
- This is not smart, Tej.
- Don't worry, man.

1073
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,039
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

1074
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,439
You're 100% fireproof.

1075
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:39,239
Exactly.

1076
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,039
All eight thrusters

1077
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,600
fully functional.

1078
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,520
Hey, please don't tell me
you're still running launch simulations.

1079
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,479
Virgin Galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

1080
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,319
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

1081
01:38:53,399 --> 01:38:54,800
Our last test run
with this load means

1082
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,079
we'll have to go higher...
way higher!

1083
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,640
If we don't get them high enough,

1084
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,359
these guys are gonna be
pancakes at IHOP

1085
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:01,039
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

1086
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,119
Hey!

1087
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:03,319
We can still hear you!

1088
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:05,640
Don't worry, guys. We got this.

1089
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,600
We do got this, right?

1090
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:38,319
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

1091
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:39,840
And I've got a lock
on the Aries signal.

1092
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,279
It's coming from the beast up ahead.

1093
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:42,560
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

1094
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,039
by the time Roman and Tej
are in position.

1095
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,840
Ramsey, power us up.

1096
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,159
Satellite is in low orbit.

1097
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:55,199
Begin.

1098
01:40:10,479 --> 01:40:12,319
All right, we're passing 50,000 feet!

1099
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:14,000
Time to get ready, boys.

1100
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:18,079
What we supposed to be doing
with these old-ass suits

1101
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,000
that ain't been used
since World War I?

1102
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:21,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1103
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,399
Astronauts "R" Us was closed
for shopping today.

1104
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:26,960
Listen, these suits
are just like space suits.

1105
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:28,800
They both account
for pressure differential.

1106
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,319
Only thing is we may
blow up like balloons just a little bit.

1107
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:33,600
- That's the only difference.
- What?

1108
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,199
We just hit the launch altitude.

1109
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,239
- You guys ready for a five count?
- No, man!

1110
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:40,760
I'm barely ready to go scuba
diving in this old-ass thing.

1111
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,199
Don't listen to him. We ready!

1112
01:40:42,279 --> 01:40:43,600
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

1113
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,600
I thought you was invincible.

1114
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,520
Let's see how invincible
your Black ass is after this.

1115
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,520
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

1116
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:54,800
Oh, my God!
I don't want to die!

1117
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,920
Ignition!

1118
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,279
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1119
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,359
We're in outer space!

1120
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:50,960
Told you numbers don't lie.

1121
01:41:51,479 --> 01:41:53,399
This is crazy, bro!

1122
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,159
Man, how much candy did you eat?

1123
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,079
Well, I-I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

1124
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,039
I thought you said
you took care of this.

1125
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,439
Yeah. Hey.

1126
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,600
You take them back
to the freaking junkyard right now!

1127
01:43:58,039 --> 01:43:59,680
All right, Han, Mia, you're up!

1128
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,000
Now.

1129
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:21,000
Letty.

1130
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,600
Han!

1131
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:38,520
Not all of us.

1132
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,760
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

1133
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,520
There.

1134
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,960
- Right there. You see it?
- Got it.

1135
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,760
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

1136
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,680
Tej, numbers is what you do, right?

1137
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,640
Driving is what I do.

1138
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:17,600
Two dudes from the ghetto...
outer space.

1139
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,880
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

1140
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:23,520
You're right.

1141
01:46:31,239 --> 01:46:33,079
Something's wrong with
the satellite array.

1142
01:46:33,159 --> 01:46:35,760
It's, uh, interfering
with the uplink.

1143
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,840
I'll handle it.

1144
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,039
Han?

1145
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,000
Grab the wheel.

1146
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:02,359
Something's up.

1147
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:06,039
I think I can link into their feed.

1148
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:20,520
- Something you want to tell me, Otto?
- My bad.

1149
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,840
Satellite uplink is
actually going splendid.

1150
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,199
Oh, and by the way,
I have a new business partner.

1151
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:27,439
Maybe you know her.

1152
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,279
Guess who's out of the box, Jakob.

1153
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:32,840
But I did try to warn you.

1154
01:47:35,079 --> 01:47:36,800
You were never my competition.

1155
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,960
Otto, there's something
you should know.

1156
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:40,600
Yeah, go on. Lay it on me, dude.

1157
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,000
You're a spoiled rich prick,
and I'm gonna kill you.

1158
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:45,680
Oh, man, I am so sorry.
No one told you, huh?

1159
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:49,760
Spoiled rich pricks run the world.

1160
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:12,520
Come on!

1161
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,760
Go.

1162
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,239
- What's happening?
- Uh, well...

1163
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:14,760
We appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

1164
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:17,880
And, well, Dom is making things a
little bit difficult here, but it's fine.

1165
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,960
Really, it's peachy.
Don't worry, don't worry.

1166
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:21,640
I'll finish this myself.

1167
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:28,399
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

1168
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:29,520
You ready, Elle?

1169
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,800
Crank it.

1170
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,920
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

1171
01:51:16,119 --> 01:51:19,319
Guys, that thing is not slowing down
and the download's almost done.

1172
01:51:19,399 --> 01:51:22,439
Dom, we don't get
out of here now, we're dead.

1173
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,199
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

1174
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:35,279
What?

1175
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:37,600
If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,

1176
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,119
we flip it and we hit the underside.

1177
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,479
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

1178
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,000
Flatten these clowns!

1179
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,960
- Letty, the wires.
- You read my mind.

1180
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:04,279
Han, get in front of me.

1181
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,600
Dom, I can't get to you.

1182
01:52:09,079 --> 01:52:10,399
But I can.

1183
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,840
All right,
the satellite is in range.

1184
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,399
Let's power up these magnets
and fry it.

1185
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,079
All right, take our time.

1186
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:39,560
Okay. All right.

1187
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,600
- Tej!
- Hold on. Come on, baby.

1188
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:45,399
Power up. Power up.

1189
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:49,239
Shit.

1190
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:51,439
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What?

1191
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,119
Talk to me. What's going on?

1192
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:55,199
The pressure of the launch...
it must have jammed the cables

1193
01:53:55,279 --> 01:53:56,720
to the power source.

1194
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,840
Damn it, how did I
not think of that?

1195
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:01,760
Guys, where are you?

1196
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:05,039
The upload is almost complete.

1197
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,640
Why don't you just kill it?

1198
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:10,239
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

1199
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:13,119
No. If we crash into that satellite,
we'll probably die.

1200
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,760
And even if we don't,

1201
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:17,119
the fuel that it would take
to smash it...

1202
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:18,960
we'd be stuck out here forever.

1203
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,359
- You got to have faith, bro.
- Faith? Faith is not numbers.

1204
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,359
You know what, Tej?

1205
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,840
You're probably right.

1206
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,079
We're not invincible.

1207
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,680
<i>We probably just been lucky</i>
<i>this whole time.</i>

1208
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:44,920
This might be it.

1209
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,640
But you know what?

1210
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:51,680
If we're gonna go out...

1211
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,039
...let's go out on top of the world.

1212
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,640
Guys, what's happening up there?

1213
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,960
We've got seconds left.

1214
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:04,960
Let's do it.

1215
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:05,960
Let's go.

1216
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,880
Five, four, three,

1217
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,960
two, one.

1218
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:34,600
We did it.

1219
01:55:36,199 --> 01:55:37,319
We did it!

1220
01:55:37,399 --> 01:55:38,399
Let's go.

1221
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:39,399
Yes!

1222
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,039
Shit.

1223
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:42,239
Not bad, man.

1224
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,039
Not bad at all.

1225
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,600
Hold on!

1226
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:06,039
Dom!

1227
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,359
Yes!

1228
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,600
Got to be kidding me.

1229
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,439
Shit!

1230
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,880
Think these belong to you.

1231
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:44,680
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming after you, Jake.

1232
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:46,560
Yeah.

1233
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:48,560
This is the world I chose, Dom.

1234
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,119
You know, Dad wasn't perfect.

1235
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,920
And he loved us all the same.

1236
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:02,279
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car...

1237
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:04,640
as a second chance.

1238
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:08,439
I owe you that, little brother.

1239
01:59:21,319 --> 01:59:23,159
I lost you once.

1240
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,239
Don't let that happen again, okay?

1241
02:00:05,479 --> 02:00:07,000
We come in peace!

1242
02:00:36,199 --> 02:00:38,720
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

1243
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:41,920
This is where he raced.

1244
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:44,560
Did you race here, too, Daddy?

1245
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:47,600
No.
But I'll tell you something...

1246
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:52,800
Everything I needed to know about life,
I learned on this track.

1247
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:54,600
You did?

1248
02:00:55,399 --> 02:00:56,680
I did.

1249
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:40,479
It's all gonna be okay, Jakob.

1250
02:01:44,039 --> 02:01:46,079
We got some rough times ahead...

1251
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:50,159
...but it's gonna be okay.

1252
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,840
'Cause we're family.

1253
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:20,159
- Fellas.
- Hey.

1254
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:26,720
What?

1255
02:02:28,199 --> 02:02:29,399
No way.

1256
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,760
What's going on?

1257
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,279
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

1258
02:02:50,479 --> 02:02:51,920
It's a long story.

1259
02:02:53,239 --> 02:02:55,479
But for now, let's just
enjoy the moment, huh?

1260
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:59,039
- Guys, this is Elle.
- Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

1261
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:00,920
Just call me T.

1262
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:03,359
- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.

1263
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:05,560
Hey! Santos! You good?

1264
02:03:09,159 --> 02:03:10,920
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

1265
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:22,079
Hey, guys.

1266
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:23,960
How much longer on this food?

1267
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,680
Like, I'm-I'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

1268
02:03:27,239 --> 02:03:28,920
I've been eating space food
for weeks.

1269
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:33,439
So Tootsie Rolls are space food?
'Cause that's all you ate.

1270
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,479
- It was fat free, bruh.
- Snickers and Twix fat free, too?

1271
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,399
- My forehead hungry.
- Yeah, okay.

1272
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:40,520
- I'll see you later.
- Y-Your forehead is overweight.

1273
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:46,159
You drive just like your dad.

1274
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:48,279
I do?

1275
02:03:49,239 --> 02:03:50,920
Do you know, this is...

1276
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:55,000
this is where I met your mom
for the first time. Right there.

1277
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:57,399
She's watching over you from heaven.

1278
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,520
She is?

1279
02:04:02,359 --> 02:04:04,479
I think Daddy has
a question for you.

1280
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,479
You ready to say grace, kid?

1281
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:12,800
But I don't know what to say.

1282
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:15,159
Oh, it's easy.

1283
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Just say whatever's in your heart.

1284
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:20,479
You ready?
Come on.

1285
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:30,399
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1286
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:32,399
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

1287
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,960
Nice.

1288
02:04:35,039 --> 02:04:36,880
Now, hold on.

1289
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,760
There's still an empty chair.

1290
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:40,680
He's on the way.

1291
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,640
FAST & FURIOUS 9

1292
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:34,720
Thank you.

1293
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,319
Please.

1294
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:38,720
I tell you where the drive is,
the plans we stole.

1295
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,800
I tell you where it is.

1296
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:41,439
You mean this drive?

1297
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:43,640
These plans?

1298
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:46,920
But you already got it.

1299
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,159
Yes, mate.

1300
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:52,000
How else do you think
I stay in this good of shape?

1301
02:07:56,199 --> 02:07:57,880
Don't go anywhere.
