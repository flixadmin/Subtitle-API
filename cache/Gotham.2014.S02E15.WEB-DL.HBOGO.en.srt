1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,880
- Is it loaded?
- Ain't no point in unloaded gun.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,880
It's Kristen Kringle's
final pay cheques.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,480
She never picked them up.
I don't like it.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,680
Possible you are making progress.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,640
By the laws of Gotham City
is hereby declared sane.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,160
You are a free man.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,880
I was wondering if you'd heard
from Kristen Kringle lately.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,360
Do you think that something bad
has happened?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,720
We have no idea
when she might wake up.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,400
- Bitch.
- So that's the game,

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,520
is it, Jimbo?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,960
You're gonna try to outsmart me?

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,280
- I don't think so.
- We've met before?

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,320
Yes. You killed my parents.

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,520
- Who hired you?
- You'll never know their name.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm a monster. You need to kill me.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,560
You're just a man.

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,840
- Bruce.
- He's in there.

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>Alfred, I've left home for a while
to live on the street with Selina.</i>

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,520
<i>Trust me and honor my wishes,
don't try to bring me back.</i>

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,760
<i>Welcome to
the Gotham Museum of Art.</i>

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>The museum offers hundreds</i>

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,560
<i>of new events
and programmes each month,</i>

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,920
<i>including lectures,
performances, tours,</i>

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,720
<i>family activities and more.</i>

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,200
<i>The Gotham Museum Cafe
and Gift Shop is located on the...</i>

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,720
Keep moving.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,480
Solo robber hit the museum
about an hour ago.

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
Scared people away with a bomb
that never went off.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
- Anybody hurt?
- No.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
Why us, then?
Isn't it a Robbery Squad case?

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,680
{\an5}Bomb threats are you guys.
Whether the bomb goes off or not.

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
{\an5}So get on it.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
Gordon, you stay.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,920
{\an5}Internal Affairs is re-opening
the file on Galavan's murder.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,200
{\an5}Why?

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,360
{\an5}Anonymous tip.

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,840
{\an5}Someone called in,
claims they saw you,

40
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,000
{\an5}not Penguin, kill Galavan
that night on the docks.

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040
{\an5}I.A. gets a dozen crank calls a week.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,160
{\an5}They're probably just bored.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,760
{\an5}This tip came with a detail
we didn't put out to the public.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,600
The umbrella.

45
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
{\an5}So someone in the GCPD
is trying to make trouble for me,

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
{\an5}by spreading lies.

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
{\an5}- Been known to happen.
- Lies?

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
{\an5}Tell me the truth again.

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,800
{\an5}I didn't kill Galavan.
I wasn't there.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,800
{\an5}- What was that about?
- Later.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,840
{\an5}- Detective Gordon.
- Hey, Ed.

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,160
{\an5}- I'm ready for our sit down.
- Our what?

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
{\an5}You wanted to interview me
about Ms. Kringle leaving town

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,880
{\an5}- with Officer Dougherty?
- Right, yeah.

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,880
{\an5}Sorry, rain check.
We gotta get to Gotham Museum.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,480
{\an5}The art heist.
Yes, I heard about this. Very bold.

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
{\an5}Yes, rain check.

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
{\an5}Tally ho, chaps. Go get that bad guy.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,000
{\an5}We'll talk later this afternoon.
And, Ed, don't worry.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,480
{\an5}I'll find out what happened
to Ms. Kringle.

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,640
{\an5}I have the utmost faith in your
abilities, Detective Gordon.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,000
{\an5}Believe me.

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
Boss...

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
You'll never guess
who just knocked on the door.

65
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,560
If I'm never guessing,
why not just tell me, jackass?

66
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,800
If you say I have three guesses,
well, then that's a game.

67
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,760
It's an annoying and stupid game,
but at least it makes sense.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,880
Son of a...

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
Hi.

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,120
Well, well, well.

71
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,720
I heard they let you out of Arkham.

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Yes.

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,640
Happy day.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm sane.

75
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I have a certificate...

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,400
But, I hope I'm not intruding.

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,240
I just got back in town.

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
I thought it would be rude
not to say hello to an old friend.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,640
- An old friend?
- Well, yes.

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,840
I mean, we had our ups and downs,
but on the whole,

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,080
I thought we were friends.

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Weren't we?

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,320
That's what I recall anyhow.

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
You want cupcake?

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,440
You killed my brother.

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,920
You messed with his mind
and made him your slave.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Hello?

88
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,480
I guess I was pretty terrible?

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,320
I want to apologize sincerely.
I wasn't thinking straight.

90
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Apology accepted.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
- Let's kill him.
- Wait, what?

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,720
Butch, listen, I've changed.

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
You have no reason to fear me. I'm...

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm a good person now.

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160
I was thinking about visiting
your mother's grave.

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,160
Miss the old bird.

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Her sobs would often lull me
to sleep at night.

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,360
"Oswald, Oswald, save me."

99
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
That does sound like her.

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,680
You know, I think he's for real.

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,360
The loony bin doctors must have
really done a number on him.

102
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
I'm actually kind of sad.

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,000
Let him go.

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
What?

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,840
You heard me.

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,160
Look at him, he's a pathetic loser.

107
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,640
He doesn't pose a threat to anyone.

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,640
Are you serious?

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,600
No way. He has to die.

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,640
Who's the boss here?

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,080
I believe in an eye for an eye.

112
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,880
We've all lost something
including him.

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,120
We square. You and me.

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
- Understand?
- Completely.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Fine. You know, I didn't realize
you were so sentimental.

116
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,560
He's not leaving without some
kind of punishment.

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,400
- He's not.
- Okay.

118
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
What do you have in mind?

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,680
Your little private,
inside voice is screaming.

120
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,400
Wanna tell me what that pow wow
with Barnes is all about?

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,880
I.A. is re-opening the investigation
into the murder of Theo Galavan.

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,760
Anonymous person called
in saying they saw me kill him.

123
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,320
That old chestnut?

124
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,160
Is there something I can do?

125
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,000
You still friendly
with your gal over in I.A.?

126
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Ginny?

127
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
Our paths have been known to cross.

128
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Can they cross again soon?

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,680
I need to know what they have.

130
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,280
Sure.

131
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
Mr. Thatch.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,920
Detective Gordon.
This is Detective Bullock.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,960
What can you tell us about
the painting that was stolen?

134
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,560
The painting is entitled
Mad Grey Dawn.

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,560
Depicted a railway explosion
of the tunnel at the center.

136
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,480
A minor work compared
to much of the collection.

137
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Strangely, he simply deface
too much more valuable paintings

138
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
in another section of the gallery.

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,720
A <i>Marche</i> and a <i>LaRue.</i>

140
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Follow me.

141
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,840
Priceless.

142
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,600
What kind of art thief would take
time to defile such masterpieces?

143
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,760
- An ignorant one?
- No.

144
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,520
He has took a lot of time and effort.
He knows what he's doing.

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
He's not interested in profit.
He's trying to send a message.

146
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,000
Which is what?

147
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
No idea.

148
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
What about the painters themselves?

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,360
What about them?

150
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,040
The question marks are directly
over their signatures on the canvas.

151
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,560
There's entire books
written on each of them.

152
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,800
- I'm sorry...
- Hey, we wanna keep it simple.

153
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,080
What about their names?

154
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,120
<i>Marche</i> means Market
and <i>LaRue</i> is the road, yes?

155
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,960
- Yes?
- Or the street.

156
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,600
Market Street.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,160
Painting he stole...

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,520
Depicted a railway explosion?

159
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,640
- Yes?
- Yes.

160
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,800
A bombing actually.
It was known as Bloody Monday.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,000
Today is Monday.

162
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
And Union Railway Station
is on Market Street.

163
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,120
<i>Attention, please evacuate
the train station in an orderly...</i>

164
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,560
<i>Please find the nearest exit
and evacuate the train station...</i>

165
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,720
- What are we looking for?
- I have no idea.

166
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Get these people out of here. Go! Go!

167
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
- Get out of here! Go!
- Move!

168
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,840
Move!

169
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,040
- Move!
- Bullock.

170
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,560
That's enough!
The device is inside the lockers!

171
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,360
Hey, can you get these people
out of here.

172
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,680
- Get them out of here.
- Outside, now.

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
Get them out of here! Go! Go!

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,960
- Move it!
- Straight ahead here.

175
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Move!

176
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
How much time
until the bomb squad gets here?

177
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,280
Too long.

178
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,400
- Get back.
- Back, back, back.

179
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,080
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

180
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,200
- Get them out of here!
- Go! Go!

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,520
Get a medic!

182
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,920
- Hey, Ivy.
- Hey, Cat.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Hey, Billionaire Boy.
What is he doing here?

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,920
They're right upstairs.

185
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,160
- He's staying with me for a while.
- Don't touch anything.

186
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,800
What is this place?

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,600
Ivy works for a gang that runs
the magic mushroom trade.

188
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,640
- What's a magic mushroom?
- Some give you visions.

189
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,160
Some give you energy.
Some help you to sleep.

190
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,880
I've cultivated over a dozen kinds.

191
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,000
What are we doing here?

192
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,880
The gang is run
by Gilzean's nephew, Sonny,

193
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,080
and his merry band of losers.

194
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,640
- So, these mushrooms are illegal?
- Yes, very illegal.

195
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
Which means there's always
a ton of cash around.

196
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
You're going to rob them?

197
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,480
Yeah?

198
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Okay.

199
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
How do we do it?

200
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,720
We don't.
You have money, remember?

201
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,120
- A lot of it.
- Selina, I told you.

202
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,720
I wanna survive on my own.

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,520
Find out who I am without my money,
without being Bruce Wayne.

204
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,440
Besides...

205
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,280
I don't mind stealing
if it's from criminals.

206
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
What's the plan?

207
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Meet Psilocybe Arkrescens.
Also known as the blue devil.

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,840
She slipped a few of them
into the gang's lunch today,

209
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,360
so all we have to do now is wait.

210
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,160
- What will they do?
- Instant death.

211
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,240
Kidding.

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,200
They'll be in a state
of relaxed bliss.

213
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,640
Like a dream.

214
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,120
Trust me. It's great.

215
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,720
How long until they're out?

216
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Mad thief and mad bomber
in the same day.

217
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,920
- What the hell is next?
- I don't know.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
But he wanted us to find it.

219
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
I think that was the heist was about.

220
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,560
He's playing a game.

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
Great.

222
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,720
That's exactly what this city needs.

223
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,280
Did you find any other brain-teasers
that might indicate his next piece

224
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,280
- of performance art?
- No,

225
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,240
either he's decided to keep it
a surprise,

226
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,280
- or he's taking a break.
- I doubt we're that lucky.

227
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,640
I want every available resource
on this thing.

228
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,800
You got it.

229
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Excuse me.

230
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
Officer Pinkney,
can I get your signature

231
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,520
- on this chain of custody form?
- Sure.

232
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,200
- Thank you.
- Pinkney.

233
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,240
Detective Gordon.

234
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,200
We're working together
for over a year, Ed.

235
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,800
You can call me, Jim.

236
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,520
Jim. I heard you were able
to save the day.

237
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,240
- I got lucky.
- I don't believe in luck.

238
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,320
You saw a problem,
and you solved it. Bravo.

239
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,720
Hey, I want you to oversee
forensics on this one.

240
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,880
Maybe our luck will hold,
and we'll get something

241
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,080
on the bomb's signature
or trace elements.

242
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,240
- No other leads, yet?
- No.

243
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,240
I have no idea what this guy wants
or what he's after.

244
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,520
Which makes him dangerous.

245
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,440
Well, don't you worry.
I'm on the case.

246
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
All right.

247
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,120
Be quiet.

248
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,720
Someone might still be awake.

249
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,680
- Wait.
- Hey.

250
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,880
Hey. Hey.

251
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
We're no one.

252
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,240
You're dreaming.

253
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,800
- Pretty cool, right?
- Totally.

254
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,440
Yeah.

255
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,720
Listen, if you give us
the coffee can...

256
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,080
And close your eyes,
you'll be able to fly.

257
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,360
Sweet.

258
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Run.

259
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,960
Where are you going?

260
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,960
Hey, Cat.

261
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,840
Hey, Sonny.

262
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
You lose weight?

263
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,560
Keep cracking wise, Selina.

264
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,160
You ain't gonna be smiling
when my uncle gets to you.

265
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,840
See how many lives
you really have left.

266
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,440
- Hi.
- Penguin?

267
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,520
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

268
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,280
I am sorry to intrude.

269
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,320
I'm a bit of a mess.

270
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,360
I was just passing by and... and...

271
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,120
May I...

272
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,240
Can I come in for a moment?

273
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,480
These feathers aren't as warm
as they look.

274
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,480
Of course. Where are my manners?
It's so good to see you.

275
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,400
So, how have you been, old friend?
Well, I hope.

276
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,840
Yeah. Well.

277
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,840
I have been busy.
Have been really busy.

278
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,280
And what about you?
I hear that you've been released.

279
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
What... What? What happened?

280
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,640
Well, just good old Butch
and Tabitha having fun.

281
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,680
They talked about killing me, so...

282
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,360
This was actually pretty nice
of them, considering.

283
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,800
Pretty nice of them?

284
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,800
They did a pretty good job on you
in Arkham?

285
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm here to tell you, Ed,
as a friend,

286
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,600
violence and anger are not
the answer.

287
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm a changed man. Better.

288
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,680
You can change too.

289
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
Cool.

290
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,600
Tempting offer.

291
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
The thing is...

292
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,360
The me I am right now is just
kind of hating my stride.

293
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,800
And I'm really grateful
for all that you've taught me.

294
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
And that bad stuff you told me
about Jim Gordon

295
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,400
is really paying off.

296
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,360
- Is it?
- It is. It's helped me

297
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,960
to create the perfect puzzle
to get rid of my Jim Gordon dilemma.

298
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,640
Normally, I would love to share,
but to be honest,

299
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
this new you is kind of
freaking me out.

300
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,280
- I'm just really busy right now.
- Well, I'll be on my way.

301
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,960
Thank you for coming by.

302
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,360
So I spoke with my gal in I.A.

303
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,840
The snitch said Penguin
was beating Galavan to death

304
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,240
when you stepped in
and put a bullet in his chest.

305
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,360
Someone else was there that night.

306
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,160
Either that or Penguin talked.

307
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,640
He did just get out of Arkham.
How the hell he did?

308
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,800
I'll never know,
but let's not forget, he was in there

309
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
for a murder you committed.

310
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,560
A grudge is not beyond the realm
of possibility.

311
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,200
He could've talked
when he was arrested.

312
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,160
Used it to cut a deal but he didn't.

313
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
Did you I.A. contact
gave you anything else?

314
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,760
The witness has agreed
to swear out a statement.

315
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,600
I.A. has officially reopened
the investigation.

316
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,800
You're now the primary suspect
in the murder of Theo Galavan.

317
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Well, tell my uncle to call me.

318
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,560
Look, I know you think
he's got a soft spot for you,

319
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,080
but I'm pretty sure
that's gonna change

320
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,240
when he finds out
you tried to rob him.

321
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,360
My guess is he's not gonna be
too happy with you, either,

322
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,160
when I tell him I just waltzed
in here and grabbed the cash.

323
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,480
So...

324
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,600
Maybe you let us go,
and we call it even?

325
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,440
What kind of message
would that send?

326
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,040
No. The Gilzeans are all about
consequences.

327
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,840
More like all about pizza.

328
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
- You ever tried our product, Selina?
- Stop!

329
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,640
Aren't you being rather cowardly?
Assaulting a girl?

330
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,840
No, he's right.
You know, when you're right...

331
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,240
Knock it off, Sonny.
You made your point.

332
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Stay out of this, Selina.

333
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,080
Call me a coward again.

334
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,600
You're a coward.

335
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,440
An ignorant, brutal...

336
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Stop!

337
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,200
While you're down there kid,
lick my boot.

338
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,040
<i>Strength causes wind.</i>

339
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,880
<i>Now, if you're gonna be a big man,</i>

340
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,480
<i>all you have to do is outlast him.</i>

341
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Stop!

342
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,960
I actually think he wants a beating.
Is that your thing, kid?

343
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,200
You like pain?

344
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,760
An ignorant, brutish, cowardly clown.

345
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,160
Yes. He likes it, all right.

346
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Your mum and dad
must have been real freaks,

347
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,040
bringing up a weird kid like you.

348
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Enough!

349
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,920
Let's go! Let's go!

350
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Hello, mother.

351
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,240
What a lovely spot.

352
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,440
I'm so sorry
I couldn't be here for the funeral.

353
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,520
But I think you'd be proud of me.

354
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,520
I'm a changed man.

355
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Or...

356
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,080
At least, I'm trying to be.

357
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,160
To be honest...

358
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it without you.

359
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,560
Hello.

360
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,960
I'm terribly sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt.

361
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,160
Not at all.

362
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,560
- Lilies.
- Her favorite, if memory serves.

363
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
Yes, they were.

364
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,600
Did you know her?

365
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,920
A long time ago.

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,440
I found her again only in death,
I'm afraid.

367
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
I'm Elijah Van Dahl.

368
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,040
Oswald Cobblepot.

369
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,960
Cobblepot?

370
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,920
You're related to Gertrud?

371
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,120
My mother.

372
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Mother?

373
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,840
You're Gertrud's son?

374
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Yes.

375
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,160
I'm sorry, I... How did you know
my mother, exactly?

376
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,000
- How old are you?
- Excuse me?

377
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,800
How old are you?

378
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,120
- Gertrud left...
- I am 31.

379
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
31 years ago, yes. That's right.

380
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,640
Oh, my god, she...

381
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,160
She never told me.

382
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,440
Told you what?

383
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,720
That I had a son.

384
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
Any word at the bomber?

385
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,240
Bullock is waiting on forensics.

386
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,280
I just wish
I knew what his end game was.

387
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,880
Feels like I'm missing something.

388
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,880
Is that why you're not eating?

389
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,360
Yeah, I guess.

390
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
No.

391
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,800
I.A is re-opening the investigation
into Galavan's murder.

392
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,240
- Why?
- An eye-witness came forward.

393
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,280
You told me it was over, Jim,
you swore to me.

394
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm sorry.

395
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,240
I knew in my heart that it wasn't
but I let you lie to me.

396
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I didn't, I wasn't.

397
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,680
We should have left
when we had the chance.

398
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,080
Go to somewhere new,
somewhere better,

399
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,440
- somewhere fit to raise our child.
- You knew I couldn't do that.

400
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,960
I can fix this.

401
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
How?

402
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,960
You did it, you killed Galavan.

403
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,440
I'll find a way. I have to.

404
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,920
What if you can't?

405
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,960
Hello, Officer Pinkney.

406
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,480
I'm so sorry to bother you at home.
Can I come in?

407
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,880
Sure.

408
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,360
Make it quick, the ballgame is on.

409
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,920
What's this about?

410
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,360
Detective Gordon, he'll explain.
He's just behind me.

411
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,680
Oh, okay.

412
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,360
Hey, Pinkney.

413
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
What do you call
a tavern of blackbirds?

414
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,480
A crowbar.

415
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,360
You get it? A crowbar.

416
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,840
I know it's kind of lame.

417
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,520
I just came up with it on the spot.

418
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,800
Come on!

419
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,240
Gertrud came to work
as a cook for my parents.

420
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,120
She was so young and beautiful.

421
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,320
So full of life.

422
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,920
So beautiful.

423
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,440
I was young then too, a boy, really.

424
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,640
A foolish romantic boy.

425
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,440
When my parents found out...

426
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,240
They forbade us from being together.

427
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,720
I was the heir to a great fortune,
they said.

428
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,240
And she was just a cook.

429
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,640
I threatened to run away with her.

430
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,080
Turn my back on my family name
and my inheritance.

431
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,800
It was the first and only time
I ever stood up to them.

432
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,640
They must have known
my words were just that.

433
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,160
A spoiled child making idle threats.

434
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,800
The next day, Gertrud was gone.

435
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,040
My parents told me only that
they had come to an arrangement.

436
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,720
She would be taken care of,

437
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,280
and I must never make
an attempt to find her.

438
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,240
And to my shame, I didn't.

439
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,360
I let them separate us.

440
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
I had no idea.

441
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,760
She never told me she was pregnant.

442
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,440
She didn't told me about you.

443
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,920
- If she did...
- She...

444
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,960
Told me that my father had died
when I was still a baby.

445
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,600
Easier than the truth, I suppose.

446
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,480
That your father was a coward,

447
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,400
who wouldn't stand up to his parents.

448
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
She must have figured

449
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,920
that the two of you would be
better off making your own way,

450
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
which in fact,
was probably the truth.

451
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Look at you.

452
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,400
A strong young man.

453
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,440
She did a good job, didn't she?

454
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,680
She tried.

455
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,800
We both miss her terribly.

456
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,920
My poor boy.

457
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,560
You've been all alone in the world.

458
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,960
Yes, I have.

459
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,320
No longer.

460
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,160
You have a home...

461
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,960
And a father...

462
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
And a family.

463
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,480
- A family?
- A big, happy family.

464
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,080
They're going to be
so thrilled to meet you.

465
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,920
Sir, please...

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,320
Tell me truthfully, is this a dream?

467
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,920
It's not a dream, my boy.

468
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
You're home.

469
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,000
- Yeah.
- <i>Forensics just landed.</i>

470
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,120
The timer on the bomb

471
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,520
was activated remotely by phone,
which is smart.

472
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,360
Gave him time to plant it in advance
and set it off when he wanted.

473
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,080
<i>- We get a number?</i>
- Yeah.

474
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,640
The call came from a payphone
inside 17 West Dewy Avenue.

475
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,000
<i>Just a few blocks from Union Station.</i>

476
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
A payphone?

477
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,560
All right, I'll go over there
and check it out.

478
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,720
<i>- See you tomorrow.</i>
- It's probably long gone by now.

479
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,920
- I can't sleep anyhow.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

480
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Hello?

481
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,480
Hello?

482
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Pinkney.

483
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,680
Gordon?

484
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,120
What the hell are you doing here?

485
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,480
Put your gun down, now!

486
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,120
Place your gun on the floor.
I won't say it again.

487
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Okay.

488
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,520
Listen to me.

489
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,080
I was just following up a lead
on the bomber investigation.

490
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,560
You were following a lead
in Pinkney's apartment?

491
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,320
No.

492
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I didn't know that this was
Pinkney's apartment building.

493
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,120
Why are you here?

494
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,440
Pinkney send me a message.

495
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,000
He wanted to talk outside of work.

496
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,440
About what?

497
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,640
You.

498
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,200
I have to take you down
to the precinct.

499
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
There's been a mistake.

500
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,360
I hope so, son.

501
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,240
I hope so.

502
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,040
Almost done.

503
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,360
I've never seen someone
take a beating like that before.

504
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,760
I think Sonny is right,
you do like pain.

505
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,960
When it was happening...

506
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,160
It was like nothing else existed.

507
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,440
Everything...

508
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,360
I've been struggling with,

509
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,560
the emptiness...

510
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,400
And confusion...

511
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,880
It just vanished.

512
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,960
And for the first time...

513
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,040
In a long time...

514
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,400
I knew I was going to be okay.

515
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,640
I knew that whatever Sonny did to me.

516
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,840
I could take it.

517
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,640
That he couldn't break me.

518
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,600
That no one can.

519
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,480
Nobody is unbreakable, Bruce.

520
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,040
You want your rep here?

521
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,880
I didn't do this. Somebody set me up.

522
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,600
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head.

523
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Captain, listen to me...

524
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,080
Murder weapon was a crowbar.
We found it under the couch.

525
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,040
Your fingerprints were on it.

526
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,200
At Union Station, I used
a crowbar to open up the locker.

527
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,840
Somebody must have picked it up.

528
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,280
And that someone
just happened to know

529
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,240
that you'd be paying
Officer Pinkney a visit tonight?

530
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
I told you, I didn't know
that he lived there.

531
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,040
Forensics traced the bomber's call
to a payphone in the building.

532
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,840
- Bullock will back me up.
- He did.

533
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,200
But when I asked for the report,

534
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,920
it had nothing to do with a
remote timer or any traced call.

535
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,160
I know how this looks...

536
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,040
But Pinkney was one of us.
Why would I kill him?

537
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,440
Because he was the anonymous
witness that fingered you.

538
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,160
We found this.

539
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,040
Internal Affairs form
at Pinkney's place.

540
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,000
It's the exact same statement
that the anonymous witness made.

541
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,160
Only Pinkney has signed this
with his own name.

542
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,000
I guess he got cold feet about
putting himself on the line.

543
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,360
So he sent in
the anonymous tip instead.

544
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
He must have figured you'd get nasty.

545
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,400
I don't know how you figured it out.

546
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,640
But you found out he was the witness.

547
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,920
- No.
- Maybe,

548
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,560
you went over to his place
to talk him out of it?

549
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,280
I told you,
I didn't know it was his place!

550
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,160
Or maybe you had
no intention of talking

551
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,200
and you just killed him.

552
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,960
You know, me.

553
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,560
I know that something went down
between you and Galavan that night!

554
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,120
I saw it in your eyes
when I.A. was grilling you.

555
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,320
And now, the one person

556
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
who was about to shine light
on this whole thing,

557
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,560
is found beaten to death
with you standing over the body!

558
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,800
- What am I missing?
- I was set up!

559
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,000
Jim!

560
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,680
How many lying son-of-a-bitch,

561
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,520
low-life weasels have you heard
used that same line?

562
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,560
Somebody set you up?
That's what you're going with?

563
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,480
And the least you can do
is admit what you did.

564
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Be a man!

565
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,080
Pinkney was one of us.
He deserves that.

566
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,440
I deserve that!

567
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,560
The least you can do
is look me in the eye

568
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,280
and remind me that you were
a good cop once.

569
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,160
That you still know right from wrong.

570
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Jim!

571
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,600
I wanna talk to my rep.

572
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,280
You're a disgrace to the badge.

573
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,800
I trusted you!

574
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
And you broke my heart.

575
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,920
You, take him to County.

576
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
I don't want him here.

577
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,440
- Jim?
- Harvey.

578
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,440
The bomber, Harvey.
Everything that happened today

579
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,760
was set up to trap me!

580
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,520
The bomber, Harvey!

581
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,120

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
This isn't right.

591
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,520
This can't be right.

592
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,120
Tell me something that is.

Someone call Professor Strange!

602
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,800
We're gonna fight this.

603
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
- Okay.
- Did you hear me?

604
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,960
No matter what it takes,
we're gonna fight this.

605
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,240
The evidence isn't gonna change.

606
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,840
You're innocent.

607
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,840
I'm far from this, we both know that.

608
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,720
So, what, we just give up?

609
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,400
We move on.

610
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,880
Move on?

611
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,240
Move on to what?

612
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,320
You mean, me? You mean, I move on?

613
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,240
I've thought long and hard
about this.

614
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,120
- No.
- You have to listen to me.

615
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,760
I'm tired of listening,
this is unfair!

616
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,120
How can you not be with us?

617
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,000
Birthdays.

618
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,520
And first steps.

619
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,000
And skinned knees.

620
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,040
I never think...

621
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,480
What? Visits through bars and...

622
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,000
And not knowing
when the phone is gonna ring

623
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,720
in the middle of the night
and tell me when you're...

624
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,880
I don't want that for either of you.

625
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760
You still have a chance at happiness.

626
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,880
- No.
- You need to go somewhere.

627
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,040
Far away from here.
Somewhere fit to raise our child.

628
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,840
And start a new life.

629
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Forget I exist.

630
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,080
The only way
either one of us survive...

631
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,480
No, Jim.

632
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,920
Don't try to contact me again.

633
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,240
- I won't reply.
- No.

634
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,560
Don't do this.

635
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,880
I'm sorry, Lee.

636
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,880
- Jim, don't do this. I love you.
- I'm so, so sorry.

637
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,400
Jim!

638
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,680
A toast.

639
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,080
I wanna thank you all
for your generosity.

640
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,120
You have welcomed Oswald
into our family

641
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,880
with open arms and open hearts.

642
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,440
And for that,

643
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
I am truly blessed.

644
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,560
To the family...

645
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,400
You guys have made me
the happiest man on the planet.

646
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,840
I...

647
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm so grateful.

648
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
I love you all.

649
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,800
Family.

650
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,240
- To the family.
- To the family.

651
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,680
- Brother.
- Yes, yes.

652
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,080
Yes.

653
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,600
<i>Main door at the prison transfer,
open gate.</i>

654
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,200
I'm gonna find who set you up.

655
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,920
This ain't over.

656
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,600
Yeah.

657
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,680
You were a good partner, Harvey.

658
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,160
Still, I am.
