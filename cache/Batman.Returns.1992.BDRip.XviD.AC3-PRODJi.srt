1
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,840
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,880
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?

3
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,120
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.

4
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,760
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!

5
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,320
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!

6
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,360
May I have your attention, Gotham City?

7
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.

8
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,600
How about that?

9
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,040
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

10
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,360
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!

11
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!

12
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
Read about it!

13
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,000
Missing link between man and bird.

14
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,360
My dear boy...

15
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
...sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

16
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,600
Usually, it's a waste of time.

17
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,080
Whatever. Today's issue!
"The Penguin: Man or myth?"

18
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!

19
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,640
Well, here's hoping.

20
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,320
With luck, Gotham will have its first
merry Christmas in years.

21
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,960
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide...

22
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
...mentioning the new power plant.

23
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,240
But if we're to break ground
when we must, I'll need permits...

24
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,000
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

25
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
Power plant?

26
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,280
Studies show we've enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century.

27
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,760
Your analysts foresee growth at 1% per annum.
That's not growth... that's a mild swelling.

28
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
Imagine...

29
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,280
...a Gotham City...

30
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
...of the future, lit up like a blanket
of stars...

31
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,960
...but blinking on and off...

32
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,440
...embarrassingly low on juice.

33
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
Frankly...

34
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

35
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Sorry, any plans must go
to the usual committees...

36
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
...through the usual channels.

37
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,200
Um... I have a suggestion.

38
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,840
Well...

39
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
...actually, really, just more like a question.

40
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

41
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,640
In the plus column, though...

42
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,480
...she makes a hell of a cup of coffee.

43
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,640
Dad.

44
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,120
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

45
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
"Actually, more of a question."

46
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
You stupid corn dog.

47
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,760
Corn dog, corn dog.

48
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,640
I have enough signatures
from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.

49
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,240
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

50
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,280
Maybe. But you sure as hell
don't have an issue or a candidate.

51
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,560
From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...

53
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,040
...happy holidays.

54
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,120
We have with us a man who needs
no introduction, he's given us so much.

55
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,240
Please welcome Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

56
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,680
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...

57
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,520
...pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels...

58
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
Darn!

59
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
I forgot my speech.

60
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,040
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.

61
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,560
Santa Claus?

62
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,040
Afraid not.

63
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.

64
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400
Sue me...

65
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,880
...if I want to give some back.

66
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,560
I only wish I could hand out more than just...

67
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,320
...expensive baubles.

68
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,120
I wish I could hand out world peace...

69
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,000
...and unconditional love...

70
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,440
...wrapped in a big bow.

71
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,600
Oh, but you can.

72
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,760
Oh, but you will.

73
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,920
Merry Christmas.

74
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,200
Great idea.

75
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,840
Not mine.

76
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,600
What are you waiting for? The signal!

77
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,680
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

78
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
What do you want?

79
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Not you!

80
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,560
Shreck!

81
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
You'll have to go through me.

82
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
Dad, go! Save yourself!

83
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,760
Dad, go!

84
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,600
Shut up!

85
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll...

86
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
You missed.

87
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,760
The Batman.

88
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,440
Or is it just "Batman"?

89
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,160
Your choice, of course.

90
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,840
Well, that was...

91
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,440
...very brief.

92
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,000
Just like all the men in my life.

93
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,080
What men?

94
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,800
Well...

95
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,960
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.

96
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,480
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.

97
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,760
We'll see.

98
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,200
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck.

99
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

100
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,920
I believe the word you're looking for is...

101
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,280
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

102
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,120
You're at home in bed...

103
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,080
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

104
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,240
...dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

105
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,680
...in a lifetime of profiteering.

106
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,360
Tragic irony...

107
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,280
...or poetic justice?

108
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,840
You tell me.

109
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,680
My God, it's true.

110
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Penguin Man of the sewer.

111
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,200
Odd as it may seem, Max...

112
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,760
...you and I have something in common:

113
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,240
We're both perceived as monsters.

114
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
But somehow...

115
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
...you're a well-respected monster...

116
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,000
...and I am, to date...

117
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,160
...not!

118
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

119
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,400
Tough, yes.

120
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,840
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.

121
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,800
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!

122
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
I know all about you.

123
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
What you hide, I discover.

124
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
What you put in your toilet...

125
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,200
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?

126
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,040
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?

127
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,720
No, just give you a splitting headache.

128
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,920
It's not working.

129
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,640
Oh, you big baby!

130
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
Just blanks.

131
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Would I go through all this trouble
just to kill you?

132
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,120
No, Max.

133
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,880
I have an entirely other purpose.

134
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,520
I'm ready, Max.

135
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,280
I've been down here too long.

136
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,840
It's time for me to ascend...

137
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,160
...to re-emerge...

138
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,240
...with your help...

139
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,920
...your know-how...

140
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,560
...your savvy.

141
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,920
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

142
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
I come from...

143
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,400
...like you.

144
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,120
And, like you, I want some respect!

145
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,320
A recognition of my basic humanity.

146
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,480
But most of all...

147
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,760
...I want to find out who I am...

148
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,840
...by finding my parents...

149
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,040
...learning my human name.

150
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,640
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

151
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,240
And...

152
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,040
...exactly why am I going to help you?

153
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,880
Well...

154
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
Let's start.

155
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,880
Let's see what we have in here.

156
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
A batch of toxic waste...

157
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,400
...from your clean textile plant!

158
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,400
There's a whole lagoon of this crud in the back!

159
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,680
It could have come from anywhere.

160
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,400
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

161
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
If there were such documents...

162
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,600
...that's not an admission...

163
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,640
...they would've been shredded.

164
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,800
Good idea.

165
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,880
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

166
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
By the way...

167
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,840
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

168
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,200
Fred?

169
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,840
Fred's actually...

170
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.

171
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,920
Good.

172
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,600
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!

173
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,320
Want to greet any other body parts?

174
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,240
Remember, Max...

175
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,680
...you flush it, I flaunt it.

176
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,560
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

177
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,200
I think, perhaps...

178
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,640
...I could help orchestrate
a "Welcome Home" scenario for you.

179
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,040
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.

180
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,640
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

181
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Honey, I'm home!

182
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,160
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

183
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,640
Miss Kitty.

184
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,400
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

185
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,440
Not that I'd ever pry.

186
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Drink your dinner.

187
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,080
What?

188
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760
How can anyone be so pathetic?

189
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,160
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.

190
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,000
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out.

191
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,120
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.

192
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,560
Yeah, but...

193
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,920
But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.

194
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,360
I want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...

195
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,360
...as some lowly secretary.

196
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,120
Lowly assistant.

197
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned...

198
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,680
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.

199
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,440
Some appendage!

200
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,320
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

201
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,320
I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

202
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,560
Hello...

203
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,160
...Selina Kyle.

204
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.

205
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,120
It makes women feel like women...
and the men have no complaints either.

206
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,720
This is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office...

207
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,560
...if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!

208
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
Working late?

209
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.

210
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,040
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...

211
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files...

212
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,040
How industrious!

213
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,880
How did you open the protected files?

214
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,960
May I ask?

215
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,440
I figured your password was "Geraldo,"
your Chihuahua, and it was.

216
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,000
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...

217
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,640
...about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...

218
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,160
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big,
giant...

219
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,720
...big, giant... capacitor.

220
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,120
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...

221
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
...Gotham City...

222
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,960
...and storing it...

223
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,160
...stockpiling it...

224
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,360
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

225
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,680
Who'd you say this to?

226
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,160
Nobody.

227
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,640
What did curiosity do to the cat?

228
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,120
I'm no cat.

229
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,760
I'm just an assistant.

230
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,320
A secretary.

231
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
And a very good one.

232
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
Too good?

233
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,840
Listen...

234
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,000
...it's our secret. Honest.

235
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,000
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

236
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,600
This power plant...

237
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,680
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.

238
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,080
For Chip.

239
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,440
Nothing must prevent that.

240
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,640
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

241
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,960
It's not like you can kill me!

242
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,640
Actually, it's a lot like that.

243
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,440
For a second, you really frightened me.

244
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,800
Really?

245
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,680
Honey, I'm home!

246
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

247
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,960
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.

248
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,920
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?

249
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,240
Hello, Selina Kyle.

250
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,360
We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.

251
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,520
One whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work...

252
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,320
...for a candlelight staff meeting for two.

253
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,320
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.

254
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,120
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...

255
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,560
...so much yummier.

256
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen:

257
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,480
I stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.

258
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,040
It's got to stop.

259
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,120
It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...

260
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,520
...in a season when
it should be coming together.

261
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,040
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...

262
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,720
...and should be a healing time.

263
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,240
I say that not only as an official...

264
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,160
...but as a husband and a father.

265
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,960
Last night's violence won't happen again.

266
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,120
I'm not good at speeches,
so I'll just say, "Thanks."

267
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,720
It's the hideous Penguin Man.

268
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,760
Take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!

269
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,440
This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.

270
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,960
The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...

271
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,720
...and announcing his presence.
- All I want in return...

272
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,120
...is a chance...

273
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,480
...to find my mom and dad.

274
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,680
A chance to find out who they are...

275
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,240
...and thusly...

276
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
...who I am.

277
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,960
And then...

278
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,040
...with my parents...

279
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,400
...try to understand... why.

280
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,240
Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...

281
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
...to a child...

282
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,120
...who was born...

283
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,880
...a little different.

284
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,760
A child...

285
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,720
...who spent his first Christmas...

286
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,400
...and many since...

287
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
...in a sewer.

288
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,480
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

289
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,040
His parents.

290
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,440
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.

291
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,480
I hope he finds them.

292
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,240
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.

293
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,160
How about a statement?
People want to know.

294
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,600
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!

295
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,160
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!

296
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,720
Wait a minute.

297
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,000
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

298
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,400
...with dignity and privacy?

299
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,800
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

300
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,480
He's a personal friend of the whole city,
so have a heart.

301
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,400
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.

302
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,000
"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

303
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,320
"Circus returns for a two-week...

304
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,000
"Kids will love..."

305
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,520
Thanks.

306
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,600
It's cold!

307
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,080
It's vichyssoise.

308
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,880
It's supposed to be cold.

309
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,480
"Circus is back with a freak show,
may not be suitable for kids...

310
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,560
"...featuring a poodle lady...

311
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,720
"...the world's fattest man...

312
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,000
"...and Aquatic Bird Boy."

313
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,520
Why are you determined to prove...

314
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,520
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?

315
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,880
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast"
in town?

316
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...

317
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,280
"...after reports of missing children
in several towns.

318
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,360
"Police have closed down
the Red Triangle fairgrounds.

319
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,000
"However, at least one
freak-show performer vanished before...

320
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,520
"...he could be questioned."

321
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,120
I suppose you feel better now.

322
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,800
No.

323
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,960
Actually, I feel worse.

324
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,160
Why're you still out?

325
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,000
Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?

326
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,920
I think he knows who his parents are.

327
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,400
There's something else.

328
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,080
Mr. Penguin...

329
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,680
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

330
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,680
I am a man!

331
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,280
I have a name!

332
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,760
Oswald Cobblepot!

333
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,280
You'll never be able to settle with them?

334
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,720
True.

335
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,920
I was their "Number-One" son...

336
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,720
...and they treated me like number two.

337
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,920
But it's human nature to fear...

338
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,760
...the unusual.

339
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,040
Perhaps...

340
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,960
...when I held my...

341
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,000
...Tiffany baby rattle...

342
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
...with a shiny flipper...

343
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,800
...instead of five chubby digits...

344
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
...they freaked.

345
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,200
But I forgive them.

346
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,720
"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!

347
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,240
"'Don't need hands as long as you got heart.

348
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,480
"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall."'

349
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,320
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

350
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,000
Now, now, pretty little thing.

351
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,880
Nice and easy.

352
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,560
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.

353
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,160
Be gentle, it's my first time.

354
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,480
Tic-tac-toe.

355
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,880
You make it easy, don't you?

356
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,000
Always waiting for some Batman to save you.

357
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,360
I am Catwoman...

358
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,040
...hear me roar.

359
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,720
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

360
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,440
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll
be slacking off till after the New Year.

361
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,080
I'm not sure I like the inference.

362
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,000
I didn't realize I made one.

363
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,480
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

364
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,200
A million saved is a million earned.

365
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,640
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.

366
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,480
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.

367
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,560
My question is:

368
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,560
What's your angle?

369
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,160
"Power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!

370
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,160
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.

371
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,400
If my life has a meaning, that's the meaning.

372
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,120
I'll fight you. I've already spoken
to the mayor and we agree.

373
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,720
Mayors come and go.

374
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,720
Blue bloods tire easily.

375
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,400
Can you go 15 rounds with Muhammad Shreck?

376
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,520
I guess we'll find out.

377
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,720
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.

378
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,080
"Crime boss?" Shows what you know...

379
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,920
..."Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon."

380
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,200
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

381
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,960
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.

382
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,920
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...

383
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,640
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.

384
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,040
If my assistant was here,
she'd have already escorted you out...

385
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,600
Anywhere he wants.

386
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,320
Preferably some nightspot grotto...

387
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,560
...or...

388
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,760
...secluded hideaway.

389
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,000
Nice suit.

390
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,080
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

391
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,800
This is Bruce...

392
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
...Wayne.

393
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,040
We've met.

394
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,480
Have we?

395
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,680
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.

396
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,800
You mean, "mistook me."

397
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,400
Isn't that what I said?

398
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,600
I don't think so.

399
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,120
What happened?

400
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,160
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?

401
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,880
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

402
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,400
It's a blur.

403
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,240
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

404
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,480
...and Betsy saying
it was morning sickness.

405
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,600
And the time I forgot to wear
my underpants to school...

406
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,400
...and the name of the boy who noticed
was Ricky Friedburg.

407
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,840
He's dead now.

408
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,640
But last night...

409
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,480
...complete blur.

410
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,040
Couldn't you just die?

411
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,280
Please...

412
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,960
...show out Mr. Wayne.

413
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,600
With pleasure.

414
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,800
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

415
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,240
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Shreck.

416
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,960
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.

417
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,400
Well, that's a...

418
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,120
...long story.

419
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,920
I could free up some time.

420
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,560
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

421
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,960
I'm working.

422
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,400
I'm leaving.

423
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,800
You buy that blurry business?

424
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,000
Women.

425
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,200
Nothing surprises me...

426
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,480
...except your late mother.

427
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,760
Who'd have thought Selina had a brain to damage?

428
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,320
Bottom line?

429
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,520
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.

430
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,800
Meantime...

431
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,160
...I've got badder fish to fry.

432
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,520
Oswald...

433
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,360
...it's Max.

434
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,520
You're home?

435
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
How've you been?

436
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,320
Your extended family?

437
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,320
Good to have a family.

438
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,120
I'd rather not be disturbed now.

439
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,240
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

440
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,320
I don't like surprises.

441
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,600
Come on.

442
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,280
Don't peek.

443
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,720
You'll spoil it.

444
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,160
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

445
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,840
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress, Mayor.

446
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,320
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

447
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,840
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

448
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,080
Mayor?

449
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,320
Mayor.

450
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,360
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.

451
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,760
Don't worry.

452
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,360
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

453
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,000
Here.

454
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,080
Reclaim your birthright.

455
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,840
I'm Jen.

456
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,600
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is put these gloves on you.

457
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,760
Our research tells us that voters like fingers.

458
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,400
So if we were to just lose this...

459
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,800
We'll do it another time.

460
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,720
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer, huh?

461
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,560
Still, it could be worse.

462
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,560
My nose could be gushing blood.

463
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
What do you mean by that?

464
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,880
Everybody, back to work!

465
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,080
Let's make...

466
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,080
...a mayor!

467
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,320
You're right, we missed the regular election...

468
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,120
...but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

469
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,760
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

470
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,400
Then think of you...

471
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,160
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

472
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,600
I'd like to fill her void.

473
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,120
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.

474
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,440
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.

475
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,080
A platform?

476
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,720
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.

477
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,240
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst.

478
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,000
"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot."

479
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,280
"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."

480
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,600
"I need you, Oswald. I need you now!"

481
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,320
"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen."

482
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,840
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire...

483
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,400
You want my old friends up there...

484
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,120
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?

485
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,080
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

486
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,880
But...

487
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,200
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

488
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,720
I have my own things to tend to.

489
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,400
"Sidetracked?" This is your chance
to fulfill your destiny...

490
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,040
...that your parents carelessly discarded.

491
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

492
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,840
Imagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...

493
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,840
...access to the captains of industry...

494
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,200
...unlimited poontang.

495
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,960
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

496
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,000
All right, I'll be mayor.

497
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,480
Burn, baby, burn!

498
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,120
- Who is she?
- What is she?

499
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,360
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

500
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,480
You poor guys.

501
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,800
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

502
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,680
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's
less than $300.

503
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,720
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

504
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,080
Go ahead and hit me.

505
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,520
Admiring your handiwork?

506
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,600
Touring the riot scene.

507
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,480
Gravely assessing the devastation.

508
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,480
"Upstanding-Mayor" stuff.

509
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,040
You're not the mayor.

510
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,320
Things change.

511
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,600
What do you want?

512
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,200
The direct approach.

513
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,000
I admire that in a man with a mask.

514
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,440
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

515
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,640
Things change.

516
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,960
I saw her first. Got to fly.

517
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,640
How could you? I'm a woman!

518
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,560
I'm sorry.

519
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,760
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

520
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,520
Life's a bitch, now so am I.

521
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,960
Who are you?

522
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,480
Who's the man behind the bat?

523
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,440
Maybe you can help me find...

524
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,280
...the woman...

525
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,440
...behind the cat.

526
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,800
No, that's not you.

527
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,560
There you are.

528
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,760
Saved by Kitty Litter.

529
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,840
Bastard!

530
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,480
Alfred...

531
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,680
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.

532
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,920
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?

533
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,920
Not really.

534
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,880
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

535
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,840
...but I refuse to save a mayor...

536
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,640
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...

537
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,880
...while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...

538
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,080
...that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...

539
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,160
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.

540
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,360
Thank you.

541
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,560
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
made his bid to run Gotham.

542
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,760
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.

543
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,760
And you're the hottest young person...

544
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,000
...a role model could have.

545
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Here.

546
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,840
Wear a button.

547
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,320
Let me just get it on here.

548
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,040
Thank you.

549
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,000
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

550
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,160
...touching people, groping people.

551
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,080
- Penguin...
- My name is not Penguin!

552
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,000
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

553
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,360
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

554
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,920
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

555
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,280
It's chilly in here.

556
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,640
I'll warm you.

557
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,480
Down, Oswald.

558
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,080
We need to talk.

559
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,560
You see...

560
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,360
...you and I have something in common.

561
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,200
Sounds familiar.

562
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,680
Appetite for destruction?

563
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,120
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

564
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,200
Wait, don't tell me.

565
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,240
Naked sexual charisma?

566
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,960
Batman.

567
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,200
The thorn in both our sides.

568
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,840
The fly in our ointment.

569
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,720
Ointment?

570
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,480
I've got scented and unscented.

571
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,680
I'll come back later.

572
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,840
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.

573
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,320
I have but one pet cause today:

574
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,640
Ban the Bat.

575
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,040
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

576
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,960
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

577
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,680
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

578
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,240
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.

579
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,200
Namely, us.

580
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,320
Frame him?

581
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,520
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.

582
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,800
Those names are not for prying eyes.

583
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,280
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?

584
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,440
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...

585
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,000
...for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.

586
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,920
Nice birdie.

587
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,040
Nice kitty.

588
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,880
Nice kitty.

589
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,360
Batman napalmed my arm.

590
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,920
He knocked me off a building just
when I started to feel good about myself.

591
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,040
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

592
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,720
A plan is forming.

593
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,720
I want in.

594
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,040
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...

595
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,080
...dirty.

596
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,960
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath right here.

597
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,200
I challenge the mayor...

598
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,040
...to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.

599
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,680
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?

600
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,440
The Love Connection perhaps?

601
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,880
...not that I have any faith in the mayor.

602
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,760
But I hope and pray...

603
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,480
...that Batman...

604
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,360
...will be present to preserve the peace.

605
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,760
Subtle.

606
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,040
Why are you doing this?

607
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,280
Selina?

608
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,600
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

609
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,360
Scare me? I was just scaring myself.

610
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,040
I don't see how, but...

611
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,480
It's nice to see you in the real world,
away from Shreck.

612
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,600
It's nice to be here.

613
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,200
Are you all right?

614
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,120
You look like you have the holiday blues
or something.

615
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,880
Boy, the news these days.

616
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,760
Weird!

617
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,440
I heard on TV that Catwoman weighs 140 pounds.

618
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,560
How do these hacks sleep at night?

619
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,400
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?

620
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,640
He probably saved millions
in property damage alone.

621
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,440
You're not going to the re-lighting
of the tree, are you?

622
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,880
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

623
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,120
It's going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.

624
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,800
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

625
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,880
No darker than yours.

626
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,080
Why don't you come over
and we can watch it on TV?

627
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,480
The tree-lighting ceremony.

628
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,560
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.

629
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,720
How about coming for dinner at five?

630
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,160
Let's say six?

631
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,040
Five.

632
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,520
Five. You and me.

633
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,880
The tree lights up and then I push the button.

634
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,320
Wait, wait.

635
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,320
I push the button, then the tree lights up.

636
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,920
Who are you?

637
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,880
Talent scout.

638
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,760
Come in.

639
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,240
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.

640
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,360
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

641
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,280
Say, "Cheese!"

642
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,920
Cheese.

643
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,320
Thanks, Alfred.

644
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,320
I'm sure he's wonderful company...

645
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,080
...but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor" bit
get a little stale?

646
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,480
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.

647
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,800
Executive Assistant.

648
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,000
Sorry.

649
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,480
Secretary.

650
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,320
Any girlfriend?

651
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,160
Sure.

652
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,320
You mean, as in serious?

653
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,360
No. Had one, didn't work.

654
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,760
What went wrong? Hang on!

655
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,320
I think I know!

656
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,400
You kept things from her.

657
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,040
I told her everything.

658
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,800
The truth frightened her?

659
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,800
There are two truths...

660
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,840
...you know?

661
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,440
She had trouble reconciling them
because I had trouble...

662
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,240
...reconciling them.

663
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,280
Vicki thought...

664
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,320
Vicki?

665
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,200
Ice skater or stewardess?

666
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,520
No, she was a photojournalist.

667
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,640
Was Vicki right about your...

668
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,560
...difficulty with duality?

669
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,600
You see...

670
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,440
...if I say yes, then...

671
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,160
...you'll think of me as a...

672
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,000
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...

673
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,960
You might not let me kiss you.

674
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,880
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.

675
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,080
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.

676
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,880
I can't do that.

677
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,200
Neither can I.

678
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,800
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.

679
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,920
Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?

680
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,520
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

681
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,320
This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.

682
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,120
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.

683
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,920
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.

684
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,400
I've got to go to the plaza.

685
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,720
- He is begging me to show.
- I hoped you'd snub him.

686
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,320
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.

687
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,360
Shit!

688
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,080
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,
I had to go out of town.

689
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,680
Tell her that a big business deal came up...
You know what?

690
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,640
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
"be-my-girlfriend" way...

691
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,480
I'll relay the message.

692
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,800
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that...

693
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,520
Bruce, yes...

694
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,560
Would you tell him...

695
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,000
...I've been going through...
a lot of changes and...

696
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,320
Just that...

697
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,440
...this is not a rejection...

698
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,560
...my abruptly leaving.

699
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,000
In fact, he makes me feel the way...

700
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,320
...I hope I really am.

701
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,440
Could you just make up a sonnet or...
a dirty limerick?

702
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,160
One has just sprung to mind.

703
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,920
This way, ma'am.

704
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,160
Ladies and Gentlemen.

705
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,840
Please, may I have your attention?

706
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,320
I know that to many of you...

707
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,560
...Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.

708
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,680
But I want you to know your elected officials...

709
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,760
...and your police department...

710
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,320
...have the situation well in hand.

711
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,360
Got to hurry.

712
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,360
Thank you.

713
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,160
It was set up to look like I did it.

714
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,720
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath.

715
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,400
Did somebody say fish?

716
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,720
I haven't been fed all day.

717
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,840
Eat floor.

718
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,440
High fiber.

719
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,840
Hey, stud...

720
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,120
...I thought we had something together.
- We do.

721
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,320
Got to go. Girl talk.

722
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,080
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned
with her, girl-to-girl.

723
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,760
Be careful. Don't move.

724
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,320
Lawn dart!

725
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,360
Rats with wings, do your thing.

726
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,360
Batman pushed the Princess!

727
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,600
Hold your fire!

728
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,320
You're catnip to a girl like me.

729
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,200
Handsome, dazed...

730
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,240
...and to die for.

731
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,240
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

732
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,400
But a kiss...

733
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,200
...can be even deadlier if you mean it.

734
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:26,040
You're the second man who's killed me this week.

735
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,120
But I've got seven lives left.

736
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,680
I tried to save you...

737
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,800
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

738
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,920
Or deeply resentful.

739
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,720
Maybe you should retire.

740
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,880
Damn.

741
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,000
Outstanding!

742
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,920
You're Beauty and the Beast...

743
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,080
...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

744
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,560
You said you'd scare the Ice Princess.

745
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,720
She looked pretty scared to me.

746
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,720
A touch of the bubbly?

747
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,480
So what are we waiting for?

748
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,200
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

749
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,120
What?

750
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,000
Oh, come on.

751
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,080
Can't you picture?

752
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,280
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.

753
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,760
I'm bushed, so here you come into the bedroom...

754
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,960
...twitching your little tail...

755
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,280
...my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

756
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,560
Please.

757
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,080
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

758
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,320
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!

759
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,320
I don't think I like you anymore!

760
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,000
Good-bye, my unintended.

761
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,680
Go to heaven.

762
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,080
There he is!

763
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,320
Don't adjust your sets.

764
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,760
Welcome...

765
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,960
...to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.

766
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,600
Gentlemen, start your screaming.

767
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,280
This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!

768
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,720
Relax.

769
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:50,200
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!

770
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:39,160
You must admit I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

771
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,840
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high!

772
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,960
That's funny.

773
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,040
Now I'm a little worried.

774
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,680
So he survived. Why worry?

775
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,440
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!

776
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,560
Listen to them. They've lost faith
in old symbols.

777
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,040
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

778
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,960
If it works, don't fix it.

779
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,560
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball.

780
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,560
Shreck and Cobblepot...

781
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,200
...the visionary alliance.

782
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,880
When it came time...

783
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,040
...to ensure the safety of our fair city...

784
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,720
...did the mayor have a plan?

785
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,600
No!

786
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,760
He relied on a man.

787
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,920
A Batman.

788
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,680
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...

789
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,920
Our prime concern is this ghastly grotesque.

790
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,600
But let's not forget about
repairing the Batmobile.

791
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,720
There's security to consider.

792
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,840
We can't just take it to any old body shop.

793
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,960
Security?

794
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,360
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

795
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,600
I'm working, I turn around and there she is.
"Hi, Vick. Come on in."

796
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,840
- Ready?
- I'll take the stairs.

797
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,440
You ask... am I up here for personal glory?

798
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,920
No.

799
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,960
The glory that I yearn to recapture...

800
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,200
...is the glory of Gotham!

801
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,800
How can this be accomplished?

802
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,400
I know...

803
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,560
...you're all concerned.

804
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,080
Relax.

805
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,920
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.

806
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,600
I didn't say that.

807
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,840
You must admit I played this stinking city...

808
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,880
...like a harp from hell!

809
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:27,920
You must admit...

810
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,440
...I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

811
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,440
Why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

812
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,840
There he is!

813
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,440
My babies.

814
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,280
Did you miss me?

815
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,320
Did you miss me?

816
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,720
Great speech, Oswald.

817
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,760
My name is not Oswald!

818
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,800
It's Penguin!

819
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,000
I am not a human being!

820
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,600
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!

821
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,520
Crank the A.C.!

822
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,400
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!

823
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,720
It's time.

824
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,720
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.

825
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,920
Just like I was.

826
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,200
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.

827
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,560
Tonight, while their parents party...

828
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,400
...they'll be dreaming away...

829
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,800
...in their safe cribs...

830
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,840
...their soft beds...

831
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,280
...and we'll snatch them...

832
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,360
...carry them into the sewer...

833
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,680
...and toss them into a deep, dark,
watery grave.

834
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,760
Penguin?

835
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,640
Killing sleeping children...

836
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,640
...isn't that a little...

837
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,000
No, it's a lot.

838
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,840
A reminder.

839
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,840
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.

840
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,880
May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?

841
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,800
Not interested.

842
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,080
Although...

843
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,320
...Selina Kyle might be there.

844
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,320
Ingenious costume.

845
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,160
Let me guess.

846
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,240
Trust-fund goody-goody?

847
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,880
Feeling good?

848
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,160
You almost made a monster the mayor
of Gotham City.

849
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,760
I am the light of this city...

850
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,480
...and I am its mean, twisted soul.

851
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,560
Does it matter who's mayor?

852
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,800
It does to me.

853
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,280
Yawn.

854
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,360
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...

855
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,800
...a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.

856
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,720
It's okay. I had to go home
and feed my cat.

857
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,920
No hard feelings then?

858
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,680
Actually...

859
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,560
...semi-hard, I'd say.

860
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,880
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.

861
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,960
Why don't we...

862
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,840
Take off our costumes?

863
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,280
I'm tired of wearing masks.

864
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,280
Me too.

865
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,320
Let me ask you something.

866
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,160
Why'd you come tonight?

867
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,680
- You first.
- To see you.

868
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,000
Lovely.

869
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,720
I wish I could say the same, but I came for Max.

870
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,120
Do you mean you...

871
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,760
Not you and Max?

872
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,520
Me and Max?

873
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,520
No. This and Max.

874
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,600
Don't tell me killing Max
won't solve anything, because it will.

875
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,840
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...

876
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,800
...coming out on top when
he should be six feet under?

877
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:19,880
You may have problems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?

878
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,920
I don't know anymore, Bruce.

879
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,920
A kiss under the mistletoe.

880
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,120
"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it."

881
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,360
"But a kiss can be even deadlier...

882
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,240
"...if you mean it."

883
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,480
Oh, my God.

884
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,800
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

885
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,320
Let's go outside.

886
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,720
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

887
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,400
You didn't invite me...

888
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,240
...so I crashed!

889
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:01,680
What do you want?

890
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,520
Right now, my troops...

891
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,960
...are fanning out across town...

892
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,920
...for your children!

893
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,160
Yes!

894
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,360
For your first-born sons!

895
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,840
The ones you left defenseless at home...

896
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,320
...so you could dress up like jerks...

897
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,480
...get juiced and dance...

898
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,480
...badly!

899
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,800
I've personally come...

900
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,680
...for Gotham's favorite son...

901
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,600
...Mr. Chip Shreck.

902
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,360
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope...

903
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,480
...to die, way down in the sewer!

904
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:43,760
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling,
take me instead.

905
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,640
I don't. So, no!

906
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,280
I'm the one you want.

907
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,760
Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated
and betrayed you?

908
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,280
Isn't it Max, not Chip...

909
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,200
...you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

910
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,680
Okay, you got a point.

911
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,640
I'll let the little prince live, for now.

912
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,000
In the duck!

913
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,480
This is going to be good...

914
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,800
...to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...

915
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,440
...before their prime.

916
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,160
You ask me... how do I lure them in?

917
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,400
A little "Pied Penguin" action.

918
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,280
And you get to watch them sink...

919
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,840
...into a deep puddle...

920
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,440
...of your industrial by-products.

921
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,320
Then...

922
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,080
...you join them.

923
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,040
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.

924
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,160
Right this way, kiddies.

925
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,120
Come with me.

926
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,160
So where are all the children?

927
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,280
"Dear Penguin:

928
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,480
"The children regret they're unable to attend.

929
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,280
"Batman!"

930
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,960
My dear penguins...

931
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,680
...we stand on a great threshold!

932
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,000
It's okay to be scared!

933
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:51,040
Many of you won't be coming back.

934
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,120
Thanks to Batman...

935
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,520
...the time has come...

936
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,040
...to punish all God's children!

937
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,240
First-, second-, third- And fourth-born!

938
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,480
Why be biased?

939
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,360
Male and female!

940
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,280
Hell, the sexes are equal...

941
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,320
...with their erogenous zones...

942
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,160
...blown sky-high!

943
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,040
Forward...

944
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,480
...march!

945
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,920
The liberation of Gotham...

946
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,480
...has begun!

947
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,040
The penguins are moving above ground.

948
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,800
Penguin army...

949
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,160
...approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.

950
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,480
One minute until ignition.

951
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,200
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...

952
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,680
...so I'm laying them on a slab!

953
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,520
Penguins seem to be converging on Gotham Plaza.

954
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,840
Thirty seconds until ignition.

955
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,160
Estimated casualties after launch:

956
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,760
100,000 people.

957
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,720
The penguins have reached Gotham Square.

958
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,240
Fifteen seconds to ignition.

959
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,360
Ready when you are, sir.

960
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,720
I've got the coordinates.

961
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,880
Let's turn them around.

962
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,520
Something is wrong.

963
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,200
Something has jammed the signal.

964
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,320
They seem to be turning around.

965
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,880
There is also something coming this way.

966
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,720
Very large. Very fast.

967
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,640
Who's there?

968
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,800
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.

969
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,720
You're jealous because I'm a genuine freak...

970
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,200
...and you have to wear a mask!

971
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,040
You might be right.

972
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,320
But what it all comes down to is:
Who's holding the umbrella?

973
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,040
My babies!

974
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,920
I don't know what you want,
but I can get it with a minimum of fuss.

975
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,120
Money.

976
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,400
Jewels.

977
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,600
A very big ball of string.

978
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,480
Your blood, Max.

979
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,200
I gave at the office.

980
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,680
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

981
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,440
Let's make a deal!

982
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,640
Other than my blood, what can I do?

983
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,920
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

984
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,960
You're not just saving a life...

985
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,040
Shut up. You're going to jail.

986
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,840
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him... or us.

987
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,920
Wrong on both counts.

988
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,720
Why do this?

989
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,640
Let's just take him to the police.

990
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,800
Then we can go home...

991
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,080
...together.

992
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:18,920
Selina...

993
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,600
...don't you see?

994
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:25,880
We're the same.

995
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,600
We're the same.

996
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,280
Split...

997
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,120
...down the center.

998
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,000
Please.

999
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,320
Bruce...

1000
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:02,160
...I would love to live with you
in your castle...

1001
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,200
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.

1002
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:16,360
I just couldn't live with myself.
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.

1003
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,160
Selina Kyle.

1004
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,960
You're fired.

1005
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,880
And Bruce Wayne...

1006
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,120
...why are you dressed up like Batman?

1007
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,520
Because he is Batman, you moron!

1008
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,880
Was.

1009
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,280
Don't.

1010
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:38,920
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.

1011
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,360
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?

1012
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,920
One way to find out.

1013
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:48,320
Four.

1014
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,680
Five.

1015
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,160
Still alive!

1016
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,480
Six.

1017
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,680
Seven.

1018
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:08,040
All good girls go to heaven.

1019
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:15,760
Two lives left.

1020
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,320
I'll save one for next Christmas.

1021
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,480
But in the meantime...

1022
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,320
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

1023
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:56,880
Shit!

1024
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,960
I picked a cute one.

1025
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,320
The heat's getting to me.

1026
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:07,360
I'll murder you momentarily.

1027
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,000
But first...

1028
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,680
...I need a cool drink...

1029
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,000
...of ice water.

1030
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,120
Stop the car.

1031
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,400
Come what may...

1032
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,720
...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne!

1033
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,360
Merry Christmas, Alfred!

1034
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:22,640
Goodwill toward men.

1035
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,400
And women.
