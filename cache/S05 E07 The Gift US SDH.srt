First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.

6
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,019
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you

7
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,481
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

8
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,483
and an insult
to all the brothers

9
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,361
who have died
fighting the wildlings.

10
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,489
As always, thank you
for your honesty.

11
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,873
Safe travels,
Lord Commander.

12
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,208
Thank you, Sam.

It's dragonglass.

15
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,469
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.

16
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,768
I hope
you don't need them.

17
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,854
Me, too.

18
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,579

27

His little brother Aegon.
He became king.

28
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,291
And before that,
he was a jolly fellow,

29

Help me.

39

Theon.

<i>Do what he says.</i>

42
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,580
Do what he says
or he'll hurt you.

43
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,499
He already hurts me
every night.

44
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,751
All day I'm locked
in this room

45
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,919
and every night
he comes...

46
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,965
It can't be any worse.

47
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,927
It can.
It can always be worse.

48
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,688
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

49
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,649
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

50
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,777
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.

51
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,946
He'll see us.
You don't know him.

52
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,823
My family still has
friends in the North.

53
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,785
All I need to do
is give a signal
and they'll rescue me.

Climb to the top
of the broken tower.

55

Light this candle
and put it in the window.

56

- Promise me, Theon.
- Reek! My name is Reek.

57

Egg.

Egg.

71

Get some sleep, Sam.

72
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,746
You'll have to speak
for him tomorrow.

73
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,041
You don't know that.

74
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,668
Get some sleep.

75
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,171
I'll watch over him.

Sam:
<i>I'm staying, too.</i>

77

<i>He's always</i>
<i>been good to me.</i>

Egg!

( labored breathing )

81
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,571
Egg.

82
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,408
I dreamed...

83
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,702
that I was old.

84
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,175
Sam:<i> His name</i>
<i>was Aemon Targaryen.</i>

<i>He came to us</i>

86
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,474
<i>A maester of the Citadel,</i>
<i>chained and sworn,</i>

<i>and sworn brother</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch,</i>
<i>ever faithful.</i>

<i>or gentler or kinder.</i>

90
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,531
At the Wall,
a dozen lord commanders

91
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,700
came and went during
his years of service,

92
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,160
but he was always there
to counsel them.

93
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,165
He was the blood
of the dragon...

94
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,795
but now his fire
has gone out.

95
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,799
And now his watch
is ended.

96
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,802
All:
And now his watch
is ended.

97
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,809
( sniffles )

98
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,666
You're losing
all your friends, Tarly.

99
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,663
My beautiful wife.

100
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,380
When my father told me
we were marrying,

101
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,591
I half expected
a fat, bearded beast.

102
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,057
Do you know how pleased
I was when I saw you?

103
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,726
You've made me
very happy.

104
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,567
Our scouts report
that Stannis Baratheon
rides for Winterfell.

105
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,529
He's a respected
commander.

106
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,740
His troops are loyal
and battle-tested.

107
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,911
He's hired thousands
of foreign sellswords
to bolster his army.

108
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,206
But this storm
is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

109
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,002
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

110
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,007
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.

111
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,428
One day I'll be
Lord of Winterfell

112
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,596
and Warden of the North.

113
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,849
You'll be my lady
and Wardeness.

114
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,229
But isn't
your stepmother pregnant?

115
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,898
What of it?

116
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,984
What happens
if she has a boy?

117
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,404
Then I'll have
a baby brother.

118
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,780
But he'll be the heir.

119
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,241
I'm Lord Bolton's
eldest son.

120
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,742
But you're a bastard.

121
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,620
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

122
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,042
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from--

123
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,421
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.

124
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,222
Bastards can rise
high in the world.

125
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,310
Like your half-brother
Jon Snow.

126
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,313
Born the bastard
of Winterfell,

127
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,357
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

128
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,487
You didn't know?

129
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,656
Yes, he's done
very well for himself.

130
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,325
Oh.

131
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,286
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.

132
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,746
Come, my lady.

133
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
Ramsay:
<i>Your northern friend.</i>

134
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,973
Reek told me
you wanted to leave.

135
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,475
Why?

136
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,976
Winterfell is your home

137
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,687
and I am your husband.

138
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,523
<i>Tough old bird.</i>

139
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,108
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.

140
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,194
<i>But this one,</i>

141
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,155
her heart gave out
before I even got
to her face.

142
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,577
We do breed them tough
in the North.

143
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,211
Bring my wife
back to her chamber.

144
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,130
It's far too cold
out here for a lady.

145
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,800
You should hold on
to your candles.

146
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,970
<i>The nights</i>
<i>are so long now.</i>

147
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,405
( chuckles )

148
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,659
( chatter )

149
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,206
- ( chatter continues )
- ( man coughing )

150
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,105
Davos:
<i>40 horses died</i>
<i>in the night.</i>

151
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,899
We'll lose more
come sunset.

152
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,693
We're running
out of food.

153
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,279
We can't open
the supply line
until the snow clears.

154
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,660
What else?

155
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,580
The Stormcrows
rode off last night.

156
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,585
500 men.

157
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,007
Sellswords.

158
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,551
Loyal to nothing
but gold.

159
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,474
We still have
a hard march
to Winterfell

160
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,392
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

161
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,977
And?

162
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,729
This isn't our time.

163
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,066
We should head
back to Castle Black
when the snow clears.

164
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,360
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.

165
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,072
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

166
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,074
- Your Grace--
- Winter is coming.

167
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,202
Those aren't just
the Stark words.
It's a fact.

168
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,246
If we march
back to Castle Black,

169
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,499
we winter at Castle Black.

170
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,626
And who can say
how many years

171
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,294
this winter will last?

172
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,463
It's better to
wait for the right time
than risk everything.

173
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,715
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

174
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,010
Because if I don't,
we've lost.

175
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,179
We march to victory

176
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:57,058
or we march to defeat.

177
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,644
But we go forward.
Only forward.

178
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,531
Your Grace.

179
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,538
I've trusted
in your visions

180
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,666
and your prophecies
for years.

181
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,419
You saw it yourself,
my king,

182
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,337
when you stared
into the flames.

183
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,880
<i>A great battle</i>
<i>in the snow.</i>

184
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,966
- I don't know what I saw.
-<i> You do know.</i>

185
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,259
Trust yourself.

186
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,469
And you?
Do you trust yourself?

187
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,763
I trust in the Lord.

188
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,685
Are you sure?

189
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,444
I have seen myself
walk along the battlements
of Winterfell.

190
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:54,699
I have seen
the flayed man banners
lowered to the ground.

191
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,128
But sometimes
sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

192
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,508
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

193
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,801
The usurper Robb Stark.

194
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,220
The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

195
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,639
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

196
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,351
No, we have
someone better.

197
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,230
And your blood
runs through her veins.

198
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,734
Have you lost your mind?

199
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,402
Do you doubt me?

200
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,905
Still?

201
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,615
After all
that you've seen.

202
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,450
There must be
another way.

203
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,911
- Leeches or--
- There is only one way.

204
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,790
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

205
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,125
Only you can lead
the living against the dead.

206
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,587
All your life has led us
to this moment.

207
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,881
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

208
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,594
Get out.

209
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,533
<i>( door opens )</i>

210
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,284
There's always
some sort of grub on.

211
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,578
A bit of mutton
would be nice.

212
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,794
- A beauty from
beyond the Wall.
-<i> ( man chuckles )</i>

213
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,505
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking
than the fat man?

214
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,591
No, the question is
is she pretty down south
in the real world

215
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,385
or is she pretty
'cause she's the only
girl here?

216
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,387
Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.

217
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,181
Come on, love,
give us a kiss.

218
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,226
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

219
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,936
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

220
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,397
A man gets lonely
guarding the Wall.

221
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,194
There's no need
to be rude.

222
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,488
We just want
a little affection.

223
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,824
Ooh.
( laughs )

224
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,327
Get your hands off her.

225
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,038
Brother Derek,
Brother Brant,

226
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,207
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.

227
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,542
Sam the Slayer.

228
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,377
You gonna slay me
with that sword?

229
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,837
Brant:
<i>Look at his hand shake.</i>

230
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,881
Gilly, go on.

231
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,216
Get back to your room,
lock the door.

232
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,471
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

233
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,140
Come on.

234
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,602
( grunts )

235
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,270
Sam!

236
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,606
You lying
sack of shit.

237
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,441
Derek:
<i>Killed a white walker, eh?</i>

238
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,985
- You fat-ass fuck.
- ( groans )

239
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,612
Come on, get up.

240
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,615
- Gilly:<i> No!</i>
- This your hero?
This hog?

241
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,409
Leave him alone!

242
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,245
Stubborn little
wildling bitch,
aren't you?

243
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,164
- ( Gilly screams )
- ( grunts )

244
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,416
- Come on!
- No!

245
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,586
- Sam! Sam! Sam!
- Come on!

246

( grunting )

248
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,597
- Gilly: Sam! Sam!
- Derek: Come on.

249
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,390
- Brant:<i> Right.</i>
- ( Gilly crying )

250
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,393
- Derek:<i> I'll deal with this.</i>
-<i> ( fabric ripping )</i>

251
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,980
- Derek:<i> Turn her over.</i>
- Brant: All right.

252
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,277
I said get your hands
off her.

253
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,862
Brant:
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

254
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,490
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.

255
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,117
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.

256
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,912
I'll take
my chances with you.

257
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,667
<i>( snarling, growling )</i>

- Sam!

260
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,142
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

261
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,687
Just a bit woozy.

262
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,707
( wincing )

263
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,006
The next time you see
something like that,
you leave it alone.

264
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,925
<i>I will not.</i>
<i>They would have--</i>

265
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,014
I don't know what
they would have done.

266
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,516
I know they
would have killed you
if Ghost hadn't come.

267
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,936
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.

268
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,605
I had them
in the palm of my hand.

269
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,984
Don't be stupid, Sam.

270
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,778
You're not a fighter.

271
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,488
What kind of man
would I be

272
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,199
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?

273
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,577
Just promise me

274
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,455
whatever happens,
you'll take care
of Little Sam.

275
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,623
But of course I will.

276
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,001
And...

277
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,587
I'll take care
of you, too.

278
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,720
I need more water.

279
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,684
Stay.

Not your usual street tough

This one's
a Westerosi knight

from an ancient house

Betrayed by his woman,

00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,136
You might run into trouble
if you try to fight slaves
in the fighting pits.

322
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,513
Now, if you were
to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage--

323
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,810
There's your wages,
funny man.

324
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,772
Should last the rest
of your life.

325
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,234
Malko:
These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

326
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,028
5, going once...

327
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,071
( giggles )

328
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,535
How long before
the King of Meereen
comes to claim my pillow?

329
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,329
Don't be ridiculous.

330
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,124
My marriage to Hizdahr
is political.

331
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,668
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

332
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,505
I think the Sons
of the Harpy have
stopped killing

333
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,674
because their leader
was made king.

334
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,721
Are you jealous?

335
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,432
You think
I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man

336
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,018
just because
he represents
competition?

337
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,853
I do.

338
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,646
( laughs )

339
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,440
You're right.

340
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,360
My motivations
are entirely impure.

341
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,870
Doesn't make me wrong.

342
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:33,545
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies
within and without.

343
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,881
So when enemies without
come knocking,

344
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,217
I need the city
of Meereen behind me.

345
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,636
I have no choice.

346
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,388
Everyone has a choice.

347
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,139
Even slaves
have a choice--

348
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,682
death or slavery.

349
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,727
So what else
can I do, hmm?

350
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,732
Marry me instead.

351
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:58,695
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

352
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,155
I couldn't.

353
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,740
Why not?

354
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,867
You are queen.
You can do what you like.

355
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,415
No, I can't.

356
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,584
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.

357
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:28,058
And I know I'm here
to serve my queen and
not give advice,

358
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,561
but can I make
one more suggestion?

359
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,567
Of course.

360
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,572
On the day
of the great games,

361
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,450
gather all
the Great Masters
and Wise Masters

362
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,661
and Worthy Masters
you can find

363
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,580
and slaughter
them all.

364
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,628
I am a queen,
not a butcher.

365
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,595
All rulers are either
butchers or meat.

366
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,482
You there.
Where would I find
the High Septon

367
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:20,068
or High Sparrow
or whatever bloody
fool name he's got?

368
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:24,031
It's not as good a name
as Queen of Thorns,
I'll admit.

369
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,326
You should have
the decency

370
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,661
to stand when
you speak to a lady.

371
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,539
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

372
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,333
Don't spar with me,
little fellow.

373
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,127
( groans )

374
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,380
For me,
it's the knees.

375
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,382
- You?
- Hips.

376
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,468
Ah.

377
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,180
A man of the people.
Is that your game?

378
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,142
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.

379
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,186
A man of the people

380
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,023
who does Cersei's
dirty work for her.

381
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,942
The people always
do the dirty work.

382
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,195
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud
from a mile away.

383
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,446
Useful talent.

384
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,533
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.

385
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,952
Your grandson
and granddaughter

386
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,288
swore sacred vows
and lied.

387
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,749
The Father judges us all.

388
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,377
Sons of high lords,

389
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,254
sons of fishermen.

390
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,550
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

391
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,134
Don't you
walk away from me.

392
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,428
You don't give commands
here, Lady Olenna.

393
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,055
What is it you want?

394
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,099
Gold?

395
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,102
I'll make you
the richest septon
who ever lived.

396
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,520
( chuckles )

397
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,981
What, then?

398
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,900
I imagine this
is strange for you.

399
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,570
Everyone you meet
has a hidden motive

400
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,864
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.

401
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,242
<i>But I'm telling you</i>
<i>a simple truth.</i>

402
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,661
I serve the gods.

403
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,580
The gods demand justice.

404
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,082
How do they communicate
their demands?

405
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,834
By raven or horse?

406
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,878
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

407
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,423
If you don't have one
in your library,

408
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,841
<i>I'll give you my own.</i>

409
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,176
I've read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

410
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,556
<i>Then you'll remember</i>
<i>the passages concerning</i>
<i>buggery and perjury.</i>

411
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,725
Your grandchildren
will be punished

412
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:19,605
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks
the sacred laws.

413
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,231
Half the men,
women, and children

414
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,735
in this foul city
break the sacred laws.

415
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,946
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

416
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,990
and yet you
punish Loras

417
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,535
for shagging
some perfumed ponce

418
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,495
and Margaery for defending
her brother?

419
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,083
Yes. The gods' laws
must be applied
to all equally.

420
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,669
If it's equality
you want, so be it.

421
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,923
When House Tyrell
stops sending our crops
to the capital,

422
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,176
everyone here will starve.

423
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,346
And I'll make sure
the hungry know
who's to blame.

424
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,223
( chuckles )

425
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,352
Have you ever
sowed the field,
Lady Olenna?

426
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,607
Have you ever
reaped the grain?

427
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,525
Has anyone
in House Tyrell?

428
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,612
A lifetime of wealth
and power

429
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,530
has left you
blind in one eye.

430
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,536
You are the few,
we are the many.

431
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,750
And when the many
stop fearing the few...

432
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,847
<i>( dog barking )</i>

433
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,684
Lady Olenna.

434
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,363
Cersei:
<i>Starving yourself</i>
<i>won't make things</i>

435
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,573
<i>any better for her,</i>
<i>my love.</i>

436
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,245
She's in a prison cell

437
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,415
and there is nothing
I can do.

438
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,420
I am the king!

439
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,464
The queen is in prison
and there is nothing
I can do!

440
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,524
No matter who you are,

441
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,651
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,

442
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,987
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

443
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,031
Events you couldn't
possibly have anticipated

444
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,783
or prevented
even if you had.

445
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,911
You cannot blame
yourself for fate.

446
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,456
Your father,

447
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,249
your brother,
your grandfather--

448
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,419
I was Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms
and what could I do?

449
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,088
Hold them as they
left this world.

450
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,090
Kissed their heads
after they'd gone.

451
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,342
I'll call in the army.

452
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,511
I'll take back
the sept

453
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:00,098
and kill every
last one of them.

454
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,311
I'll start a war
if I have to.

455
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:08,148
You know as well as I do
who the first casualty
of that war would be.

456
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,821
I love her.

457
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,202
I love her...

458
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,122
and I can't help her.

459
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,515
We must be strong
for those we love.

460
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,850
We cannot give in
to despair.

461
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,895
I will speak
with the High Sparrow.

462
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,480
There must be
something he--

463
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,649
Let me talk to him
on your behalf.

464
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,653
The king cannot
sully himself negotiating
with an unwashed fanatic.

465
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,906
You will try
to help her?

466
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,368
I'll do everything
I can to win her freedom
and her brother's.

467
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,663
Your happiness is all
I want in this world.

468
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,667
- I know.
- No, you don't.

469
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,047
You can't possibly.

470
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,802
Not until you have
children of your own.

471
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,596
I would do anything
for you.

472
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,433
Anything to keep
you from harm.

473
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,855
I would burn cities
to the ground.

474
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,026
You are all that matters.

475
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,030
You and your sister.

476
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,158
From the moment you came
into this world.

477
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,703
My boy.

478
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,915
My only boy.

479
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,094
<i>( door opens )</i>

480
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,557
Prince Doran hopes
this satisfies

481
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,310
your concerns
about the princess's
well-being.

482
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,694
You looked different
when I left.

483
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,738
You had more hair.

484
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,574
And more hands.

485
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,410
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

486
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,578
I'm sorry for that.

487
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,121
It wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

488
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,165
Why is it
happening at all?

489
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,085
Your mother's
worried about you.

490
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,254
Threats have been made.

491
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,839
Dorne's too dangerous
for you.

492
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,383
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

493
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,968
This has been
my home for years.

494
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,929
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

495
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,305
I did what she said.

496
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,308
I did my duty and now
she's forcing me to go back?

497
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,353
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

498
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,605
<i>No, it's not</i>
<i>complicated at all.</i>
<i>It's simple.</i>

499
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,107
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,

500
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,567
and we're staying
right here.

501
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,569
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

502
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,696
You don't know me.

503
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,875
Bronn:

00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,106
( clapping )

510
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,650
He's got a good voice.

511
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,485
We're lucky
he's a singer.

512
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,904
If he were a fighter,
we might have been
in trouble.

513
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,865
It's against my code
to hurt a woman.

514
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:49,202
It's amazing
how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

515
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,954
I wouldn't say
you beat me.

516
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,789
How's your arm?

517
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,499
Wonderful.

518
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,460
Wouldn't feel right
to leave Dorne without
a new scar.

519
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,921
( scoffs )
You think you're
leaving Dorne?

520
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,673
No great hurry.

521
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,884
Dornish women
are the most beautiful
women in the world.

522
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,219
Thank you.

523
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,472
I said Dornish women.
I didn't say you.

524
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,602
I'm not the most
beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

525
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,480
Bronn:
<i>I've seen</i>
<i>quite a few women</i>

526
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,857
<i>in all</i>
<i>the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

527
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,610
Name one more beautiful
than I am.

528
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,490
Well, now,
in King's Landing,

529
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:31,202
<i>there was an absolutely</i>
<i>gorgeous...</i>

530
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,875
There was a what?

531
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,505
<i>In King's Landing,</i>
<i>you were saying?</i>

532
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,424
Was I?

533
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,594
There was a woman
more beautiful than I am.

534
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,387
Was there?

535
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,639
My memory's not
what it was earlier.

536
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,478
How's your arm now?

537
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,229
You seem
concerned with it.

538
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,398
<i>You must really like me.</i>

539
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,692
( laughs )

540
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,826
And how about
your head?

541
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,750
<i>My head?</i>

542
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,668
My head?

543
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,588
You don't even want
to know what's
going on in--

544
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,760
( breathing heavily )

545
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,975
Your nose is bleeding.

546
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,606
It's nothing.
It's the dry air.

547
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:49,447
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment
from Asshai.

548
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,075
<i>They call it</i>
<i>the Long Farewell.</i>

549
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,993
It takes time to work,

550
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,373
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

551
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,499
death.

552
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,009
The only antidote.

553
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,350
Who's the most
beautiful woman
in the world?

554
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,019
( quietly )
You.

555
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,773
Sorry? Who?

556
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,361
You.

557
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,280
Don't drop it.

558
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:44,127
( gasping )

559
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,921
I think you're
very handsome as well.

560
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,677
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

561
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,932
It felt like
the safest place.

562
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:42,227
Not for your
clientele, clearly.

563
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,730
It was an establishment
like no other.

564
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,774
The sheer range
of appetites catered to.

565
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,609
Desires that
didn't even exist

566
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,403
until we invented them.

567
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,865
You've always been
rather impressed with
yourself, haven't you?

568
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,911
The past is the past.

569
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,581
The future is all
that's worth discussing.

570
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,668
The future
of House Tyrell.

571
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,587
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,

572
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,089
my grandchildren or me.

573
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,883
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

574
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,177
as soon as things
started to go wrong.

575
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,554
- I promise you--
- I promise you,
Lord Baelish,

576
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,598
that our fates
are joined.

577
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,475
Together we murdered a king.

578
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:27,105
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

579
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,566
And if I should meet
with some accident

580
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,736
here at your broken
little flesh market,

581
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,448
they'll never even find
what's left of you.

582
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,784
So...

583
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,911
do you deny a part
in all this?

584
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,415
Cersei summoned me
to King's Landing.

585
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,791
I dared not refuse her.

586
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,501
And what did she want?

587
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,629
<i>A piece of information</i>
<i>she knew that I had.</i>

588
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:55,550
Neither silence
nor lies were an option.

589
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,927
But I have
other information

590
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,721
of which she is unaware.

591
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,100
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.

592
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,854
I have a gift for you.

593
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,480
What kind of gift?

594
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,734
The same kind
I gave Cersei.

595
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,736
A handsome young man.

596
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,252
Yezzan:
<i>Many worthy fighters</i>
<i>have died</i>

597
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,671
<i>trying to make it</i>
<i>to the great games.</i>

598
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,841
When most of you
worthless scum join them
in death this afternoon,

599
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,136
it will represent
a significant rise
in your station.

600
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,056
But if you do happen
to triumph here,

601
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,767
<i>you will fight</i>
<i>at the Great Pit</i>
<i>of Daznak itself</i>

602
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,560
<i>in front of the queen.</i>

603
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,856
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled
upon you today.

604
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,277
This is the day
your lives actually start
to mean something.

605
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,032
You and you.
You.

606
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,410
You two.

607
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,122
<i>You, you, and you.</i>

608
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,875
Up.

609
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,878
-<i> Valar morghulis.</i>
- Men:<i> Valar dohaeris.</i>

610
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,089
Prepare yourselves.

611
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,478
Sitting through
the great games
will be bad enough.

612
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,773
For generations
in the days leading up
to the great games,

613
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,441
it has been customary
for our ruler

614
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,151
to make the rounds
of the lower pits

615
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,779
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

616
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:46,786
-<i> ( applause, cheering )</i>
- Move yourselves.

617
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,585
Your Grace.

618
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,045
Your future Grace.

619
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,297
You honor us all.

620
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,885
Stand there.

621
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,596
Stand straight.
That's the fucking queen.

622
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,267
( softly )
We fight and die
for your glory,

623
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,185
O glorious queen.

624
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,982
All:
We fight and die
for your glory,

625
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,859
<i>O glorious queen.</i>

626
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,402
<i>( crowd shouting )</i>

627
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,946
- Man:<i> Fight!</i>
-<i> ( metal clanging )</i>

628
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,452
<i>( men shouting,</i>
<i>grunting )</i>

629
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,580
<i>( applause, cheering )</i>

630
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:48,347
( screams )

631
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,491
( shouting )

632
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,547
I think I've seen enough.

633
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,425
Your Grace,
it is a tradition

634
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,553
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

635
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,680
I've sacrificed
more than enough
for your traditions.

636
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,562
What are you doing?

637
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,864
Wait your turn,
you piece of fucking filth.

638
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,574
- ( grunts )
-<i> ( crowd cheering )</i>

639
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,505

00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,305

<i>( applause, cheering )</i>

644
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,664
Get him out
of my sight.

645
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,875
Khaleesi, please.

646
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,419
I just need
a moment of your time.

647
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,254
I brought you a gift.

648
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,007
Tyrion:
<i>It's true.</i>

649
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,802
He has.

650
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,638
Who are you?

651
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,016
I am the gift.

652
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,605
<i>It's a pleasure</i>
<i>to meet you, Your Grace.</i>

653
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,732
My name
is Tyrion Lannister.

654
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,667
( coughs )

655
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,807
<i>( door closes, locks )</i>

656
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,809
Cersei:
<i>This is horrible.</i>

657
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,769
Unacceptable.

658
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,773
Are they feeding you
enough at least?

659
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:30,194
I brought you this.
Venison.

660
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,446
It's quite good.

661
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,369
I had it myself for supper
only last night.

662
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:45,376
We did everything
we could from the moment
they took your brother.

663
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,545
<i>Tommen even went</i>
<i>to the sept himself</i>

664
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,880
<i>to confront</i>
<i>the High Sparrow.</i>

665
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,967
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.

666
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,011
I know you did this.

667
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:59,849
We are making every effort
on your behalf.

668
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,560
I swear to you
by all the seven gods.

669
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,645
Lies come
easily to you.

670
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,188
Everyone knows that.

671
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,233
<i>But innocence,</i>

672
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,610
<i>decency, concern,</i>

673
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,655
you're not very good
at those, I'm afraid.

674
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,367
Perhaps that's why
your son was so eager

675
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,369
to cast you aside
for me.

676
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,540
You're upset.

677
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,625
You're not
thinking clearly.

678
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,128
I'll visit again
when you've had a chance
to calm down.

679
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,172
I don't want
to see you again.

680
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,549
<i>I do hope you change</i>
<i>your mind about that.</i>

681
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,093
I've been told
men often go mad

682
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,471
in the Black Cells
beneath the Red Keep.

683
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,473
<i>Though I suppose</i>
<i>your isolation will end</i>

684
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,600
when your trial begins.

685
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,978
Leave.

686
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,772
Yes.

687
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,398
I'm afraid I must.

688
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,484
<i>My son needs me now</i>
<i>more than ever.</i>

689
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,278
Get out,
you hateful bitch!

690
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,498
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

691
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,749
<i>( door opens )</i>

692
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,377
Sleep well, sister.

693
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,717
- ( sighs )
-<i> ( lock clicks )</i>

694
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,532
Thank you, Boake.

695
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,123
- You saw her?
- Yes.

696
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,501
- And?
- Her accommodations
seem sufficient.

697
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,295
What happens
to her now?

698
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,631
Well, she and her brother
are both being held

699
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,466
under fair suspicion.

700
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,052
A trial will be held
for each of them

701
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,013
to determine if they're
guilty of any acts

702
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:06,851
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets
of the faith.

703
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,519
Who will stand judge?

704
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:13,023
Seven septons
as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

705
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,568
Will you be
one of them?

706
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:16,944
I will.

707
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,407
If one
or both of them

708
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,951
were to confess
before the trial...

709
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,079
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.

710
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,707
And what does
the Mother's mercy entail?

711
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,042
It depends upon
the situation.

712
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,212
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

713
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,882
Thank you,
High Septon,

714
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,843
for bringing them
whatever justice
they deserve

715
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,637
<i>in the eyes</i>
<i>of the Seven.</i>

716
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,393
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>this chapel</i>

717
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,104
is one of
the oldest structures
in King's Landing?

718
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,025
I think I may have
heard at one point.

719
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,777
Baelor built his sept
around it.

720
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,449
But men worshipped here
long before him.

721
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:06,410
Who carved this altar?

722
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,747
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

723
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,082
No one does.

724
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,711
There's no name on it
or anywhere else
in the chapel.

725
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,090
No, the people
who built this place

726
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:24,219
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them

727
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:28,307
the way Baelor did
with that great gilded
monstrosity up there.

728
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,934
Hmm.

729
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,102
Their faith was clean.

730
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,106
Strip away the gold
and the ornaments,

731
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,860
knock down the statues
and the pillars,

732
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,904
and this is what remains.

733
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,576
Something simple...

734
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:54,249
and solid and true.

735
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,715
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.

736
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,802
<i>Their lies knocked down.</i>

737
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,930
<i>Their true hearts</i>
<i>laid bare for all to see.</i>

738
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,142
And so it will be
for all of us.

739
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,561
High and low alike.

740
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,985
What will we find

741
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,862
when we strip away
your finery?

742
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,786
<i>A young man came to us</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

743
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,539
Broken in body
and spirit.

744
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,168
He had so much
to strip away.

745
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,424
<i>So much</i>
<i>weighing him down.</i>

746
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,760
<i>But piece by piece,</i>
<i>he unburdened himself.</i>

747
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,472
<i>Let go of vanity,</i>

748
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,808
pride, sin.

749
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,855
Now his soul is so light,

750
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:01,358
he will float through
the Seven Heavens
like a bird.

751
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:02,901
Hmm.

752
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,534
And he has much
to say about you.

753

Let me go
immediately.

757
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,234
You will order her
to let me go.

758
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,904
I am the queen!
I am the queen!

<i>I am the queen!</i>
<i>Let me go!</i>

764
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,424
Look at me.

765
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,428
Look at my face.

766
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:17,434
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.
