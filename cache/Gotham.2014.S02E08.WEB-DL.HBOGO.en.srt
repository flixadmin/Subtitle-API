1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,680
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,000
The cops aren't gonna let you
within a hundred feet of Galavan.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,920
- Let us whack him for you.
- No.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,240
- He's mine.
- Shoot him, Detective.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,000
He killed my mother, Jim.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,040
- You have the Wayne boy?
- Not yet.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,400
There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,440
See this finger?

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,080
I've got little Bruce wrapped tight
around it.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,240
I had to kill him because he hit you.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,640
I love you.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,800
Kristin?

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,280
Kristin? No!

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,800
Within a year,
Jim and I will be back together.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,960
Wanna know why?

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,680
Because we're both the same.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,320
We both have the dark side.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
Ready for the practice run?

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,440
I'm ready to skip this
and get married.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
Me, too.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,320
Let us rehearse the vows.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,360
Barbara Kean...

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,520
Do you take James Gordon
to be your unlawfully wedded husband,

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
- to have and to hold...
- I'm sorry.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,280
Father, you said,
"unlawfully" wedded.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,720
Barbara, just answer him,
for God's sake.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm waiting.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,800
Barbara, what's wrong?

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
How did you do that?

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Bad dream.

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,600
Doesn't being mayor mean
you can sleep in?

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Jim Gordon has forced us
to accelerate our plans.

33
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,440
About time.

34
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,760
I meet with Bruce Wayne this morning.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
If all goes well, I'll have his
company by the end of day.

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
I still don't see
how you can get Bruce Wayne

37
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
to turn over his family's legacy.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,560
You're not that charming.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm going to offer him the thing
he wants most in the world.

40
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Still...

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,360
it will be delicate.

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,840
Jim Gordon must not be allowed
to interfere.

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,080
But his sudden death
would upset Bruce.

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,040
So we need him distracted, occupied.

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,400
- And then...
- Have you told her?

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,640
Told me what?

47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
I love my present.

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Does it mean what I think it does?

49
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,680
Yes, my dear.

50
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,720
Today is the day
you get to kill Jim Gordon.

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,480
The breakout at Arkham.

52
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
The massacre at the GCPD.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,240
The Gala. The arsons.

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,400
It was Galavan.

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,440
He's behind everything.

56
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,200
- And you have proof of this?
- I have Penguin and I have Gilzean.

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
Both criminals.

58
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Both in the wind.

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Given the circumstances under
which I obtained the information,

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,680
I think it's safe to say
they were telling the truth.

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,160
Maybe they are.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
But you have no legal evidence,

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,320
no proof, not a single
hard lead to go on.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,040
You bring in Galavan with what you
have now and he'll just laugh at you.

65
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,360
He won't laugh long.

66
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,040
What, are you gonna rough him
up a little?

67
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,040
Lawless thuggery? Is that your plan?

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
You want to arrest Galavan?

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
You do the police work and you
bring me back some real proof.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Can you blame him?

71
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,960
You're going after a man
who was elected mayor yesterday.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,520
The most popular figure in Gotham.

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,640
Galavan is dirty.
I'd bet my life on it.

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,200
- Well, don't.
- Don't what?

75
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,120
- Don't bet your life on it.
- Oh...

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,320
I know that look in your eye, Jim.

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
Be cool. Do not make this personal.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Well, it is personal, isn't it?

79
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,560
Only if you make it that way.

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,800
Suspect! Put your hands up, lady!

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
Right there!

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
Hi, Jim.

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
Long time, no see.

84
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
{\an5}You said you'd only talk to me.

85
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
{\an5}I'm listening.

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,680
{\an5}Yes.

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
{\an5}Here it is.

88
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,920
{\an5}Is there any chance
I could get a latte or something?

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
This is not a game, Barbara.

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,080
{\an5}Of course it is.

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
{\an5}It's a game you've been losing.

92
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
{\an5}Big time.

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720
{\an5}It is not a game.

94
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
{\an5}It must be killing you.

95
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,200
{\an5}All that righteous indignation
with no place to go.

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
{\an5}Why are you here?

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,440
{\an5}Don't act all calm and business-like.

98
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
{\an5}Rough me up a little...

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
if you want.

100
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
{\an5}I don't want to do that.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,280
{\an5}I don't want to hurt you.

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
{\an5}I want to help you.

103
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,960
{\an5}I know you want to hurt me...

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
{\an5}just a little.

105
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,480
{\an5}I've been a very bad girl.

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
No.

107
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,760
You're a good woman.

108
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,240
{\an5}You're just sick, is all.

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I knew it.

110
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,680
I knew you still had feelings for me.

111
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,000
Of course I have feelings.

112
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Talk to me.

113
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
I will.

114
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,520
But first I want to show
you something.

115
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
It's not far away,
it won't take long.

116
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,520
What?

117
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
What do you want to show me?

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,960
It's a surprise.

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,520
Don't worry, it's a good one.

120
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,360
And then, after that,
I will tell you everything.

121
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,680
Everything about what?

122
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Is it about the break-out at Arkham?

123
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Was it Galavan?

124
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,440
Wouldn't you like to know?

125
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
Detective Gordon.

126
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,680
Okay, that's someone telling you
that my lawyer is here.

127
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,480
Why don't you take five minutes
to think about it?

128
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
Detective Gordon! Time's up!

129
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
What is she playing at?

130
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
Not sure, sir.

131
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,960
I suggest we play along and find out.

132
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I'll go see this thing
she wants to show me.

133
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,560
Jim, she's mentally ill.

134
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,480
Like hell! She's sharp as a nail.

135
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,960
This is a trap.

136
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Yeah. Either way, it's too risky.

137
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
What choice do we have, huh?

138
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,160
She won't talk.

139
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
And kissing her didn't work out,
did it?

140
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,680
That was a judgment call, sir.

141
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,840
Judgment? Really?

142
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Let's focus on the issue at hand.

143
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,480
It's my official opinion
as Chief Medical Examiner

144
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,320
that Miss Kean
is seriously mentally ill

145
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
and should be in a hospital,
getting treatment.

146
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Yes. Tomorrow.

147
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,800
Look, I suggest we play along,
let her think she's in control.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,480
I can still work on her
inside the car.

149
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,520
Maybe I can find out
something useful.

150
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,080
She's our only link to Galavan.

151
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
It's worth the risk.

152
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
All right. Do it.

153
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Sorry, Miss Kringle.

154
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,840
You have a visitor, Miss Saint Cloud.

155
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,680
- Hi.
- Hello.

156
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,640
My uncle will be just a moment.

157
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,880
He wanted me to apologize
for keeping you waiting.

158
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,280
It's fine.

159
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,840
Do you have any idea
why he wanted to see me?

160
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,440
He told me he had something for you.

161
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,240
He seemed excited.
It was totally goofy.

162
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,640
I can't picture him goofy.

163
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

164
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,240
I'll see you later.

165
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Bye.

166
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Please.

167
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,320
Meet the new crop
of Strike Force members.

168
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,880
We're throwing them in the deep end
but they're ready.

169
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,360
They'll be shadowing you
in a TAC SUV.

170
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,200
I'll be monitoring from here.

171
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,760
Now, the second I don't like
something, I'm pulling the plug.

172
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,880
- Agreed?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Gordon?

174
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Agreed.

175
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,800
He's too wrapped up
in this thing emotionally.

176
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,160
I need to know that one of you
isn't gonna get sucked

177
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,560
into all these mind games

178
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,200
that Ms. Kean is gonna be pulling
out there.

179
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,920
Not to worry. No one's ever accused
me of getting sucked into mind games.

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,320
Just follow my orders.

181
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,440
- Understood?
- Understood, Captain.

182
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm glad we had this chance to talk.

183
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,040
Lee, look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

184
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,400
But it is the only way.

185
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,640
No.

186
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
This is you, Jim. This is all you.

187
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
She sucked you right back in,
didn't she?

188
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,160
Because she still has a hold on you.

189
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
Her sickness and yours feed off
each other.

190
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
What do you mean, "my sickness"?
I'm not sick.

191
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,760
You see an abyss
and you run toward it.

192
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
That's not healthy.

193
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm just doing my job.

194
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
We're moving out.

195
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Hey, Lee.

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
You don't mind if I borrow him
for a little while, do you?

197
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,800
I want to ask you a question.

198
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,640
If you could have one dream
come true, what would that be?

199
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,880
I would find the man
who killed my parents.

200
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,880
What would you do if you found him?

201
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
I would kill him.

202
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,880
What a young tiger you are.

203
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,760
My dream?

204
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,720
I would save this city.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,960
I would rid Gotham of corruption,
crime and poverty.

206
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Sounds good.

207
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,400
How would you do that?

208
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,280
Oh, I have plans, schemes,
ideas aplenty.

209
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,920
But...

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I need help.

211
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
I need your help.

212
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Of course.

213
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,760
And perhaps, in return,
I could help you with your dream.

214
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,120
How so?

215
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Get those vehicles out of the way!

216
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
You good?

217
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Anything that makes Captain Barnes'
tight ass nervous, I'm all for.

218
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Watch your head.

219
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,400
So, you want to tell us
where we're going?

220
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,800
Head downtown.

221
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,240
Bruce, your family helped
build this city.

222
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,960
The Wayne name is synonymous
with growth, strength and prosperity.

223
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,480
It's also a lie.

224
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,680
Please explain what you mean.

225
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,080
I've been investigating Wayne
Enterprises for quite some time.

226
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,120
You know what I found?

227
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,640
Toxic waste dumps,
illegal weapons contracts,

228
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,800
use of banned chemicals,
nightmarish experiments.

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
It can't continue.

230
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,760
Please, understand,
this isn't about corruption.

231
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,360
It's about saving innocent lives.

232
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,120
You have my word,
I will look into all of it.

233
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,040
And I will stop
whoever's responsible.

234
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,360
No, Bruce. You won't.

235
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
You can't.

236
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,520
People often underestimate me.

237
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,480
Wayne Enterprises
is a multibillion-dollar conglomerate

238
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,440
with a board that will kill
to protect its secrets.

239
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Who's underestimating who?

240
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,240
Why are you telling me this?

241
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,160
You obviously have a solution
you want to propose.

242
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,600
You control 51 percent of the voting
shares of Wayne Enterprises.

243
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,920
If you sell me your shares,
I could take control.

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Do what needs to be done.

245
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,840
You would be a cash billionaire,
with freedom.

246
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,600
You want my company?

247
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,280
I want to clean up Gotham.

248
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,640
Protect its citizens.

249
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Return this city to what it was.

250
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
But I can't do it without your help.

251
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,520
Wayne Enterprises
is my responsibility.

252
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,880
It's all I have left of them.

253
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm not just offering you money,
Bruce.

254
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
The night your parents were killed...

255
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
you weren't supposed to be there,
were you?

256
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
No.

257
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,320
Your parents were headed
for the theater.

258
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,240
Your father changed his mind,
suggested a movie.

259
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,640
Invited you along.

260
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,120
You got there late.

261
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,880
I've never told anybody that.

262
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,200
He was following your father
that night.

263
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,560
Before the alleyway.

264
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm a man of considerable resources
and, even then, it took some doing.

265
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,800
That's why I didn't want to say
anything last night.

266
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,680
I couldn't confirm it until today.

267
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,400
If you sell me your company...

268
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,520
I will give you this
as a signing gift.

269
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,920
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

270
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,240
With documentary proof.

271
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Accomplices, motives, why,
how and who.

272
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,480
I will fix your company, protect
your legacy and give you closure.

273
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,400
It's what your father
would have wanted.

274
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,800
And what Gotham desperately needs.

275
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,480
I need your answer
by the end of the day.

276
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,600
Hey, Jim.

277
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,280
Cheer up.
Where's your spirit of adventure?

278
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,760
Next right.

279
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
I know it's a trap.

280
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,200
And Galavan's using you
like a puppet.

281
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,160
It is Galavan
who's behind all this, right?

282
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,000
He's a psychopath, Barbara.

283
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,160
He's using you.

284
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
He's laughing at you.

285
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,200
And when he's done with you,
you're just a loose end.

286
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,320
He'll kill you.

287
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,920
You really don't like this Galavan
guy, do you?

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,560
She's not talking, Jim.

289
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,160
We need to turn this car around.

290
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,280
Now.

291
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
Just give me a little more time.

292
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,720
Well, I'm afraid this is as proper
a burial as circumstances allow.

293
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
But I thought we could have
one last meal together.

294
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,720
I was a broken man, Ms. Kringle.

295
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,080
Two halves at war with each other.

296
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,600
But thanks to you, I am whole.

297
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,200
I will not forget you.

298
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,240
I take you by night,
by day take you back.

299
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,240
None suffer to have me
but do from my lack.

300
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,560
What am I?

301
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,200
That some sort of riddle?

302
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,920
You know, you really shouldn't
sneak up on people.

303
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's not polite.

304
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,440
Not usually any people out here.

305
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,160
Can I interest you in a tea sandwich?

306
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,360
A what?

307
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,600
What the heck is in there?

308
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Great.

309
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,120
Now I've got to improvise.

310
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,080
Don't go anywhere.

311
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,760
Barbara, listen to me.

312
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,200
Are you listening?

313
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,000
You have a lifetime ahead of you.
Don't throw it away on madness.

314
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
<i>Gordon. Bullock. Come in.</i>

315
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,880
- Go ahead, Captain.
<i>- I don't like this.</i>

316
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,600
<i>You're boxed in.
There's lots of cover.</i>

317
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
<i>High vantage points all around.</i>

318
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,800
Perfect spot for an ambush.

319
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,240
<i>Yeah, I gotta pull you out.</i>

320
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,640
You turn around, you get nothing.

321
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,520
Not yet.

322
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,200
<i>You hear me? I'm pulling you out.</i>

323
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,880
What was that, Captain?
You're breaking up.

324
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,360
<i>Bullock! I swear to God,
if you disobey...</i>

325
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,760
Barbara, think hard.

326
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,280
Don't throw away your life.

327
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
What life?

328
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,880
You and me, we had a life.

329
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,640
We had real love.

330
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,000
You asked me to marry you.

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,080
I booked a church.

332
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,440
I bought a damn wedding dress.

333
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,280
Jim, fool that I am,
I still love you, even now.

334
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,120
And I know you still have feelings
for me 'cause you said so.

335
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,840
We can talk about our feelings later.

336
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,840
There's more at stake here.

337
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,320
I love you, Jim.

338
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,080
And I think, deep down...

339
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,720
you still love me.

340
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Oh, for God's sakes, Barbara,
I don't give a...

341
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,440
Move! Move!

342
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
You gonna shoot me, Jim?

343
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
I want a twenty-block perimeter

344
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,160
with hard-target searches of every
building, business and bodega.

345
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
We kick down everything
with four walls and a roof.

346
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
Nobody sleeps
until our boy gets home.

347
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,440
Hey!

348
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,400
I told you to get out of here.

349
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
You did?

350
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,840
Still a lot of ringing in my head.
I must have missed it.

351
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,400
This is a direct order.

352
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,640
You don't belong here anymore.

353
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Go home.

354
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Okay.

355
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Well, let's see.

356
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,120
If I can't make the hole bigger,
then I'll make you smaller.

357
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,400
Who has eaten my sandwich?

358
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,320
For a secluded forest, this place
sure has a lot of foot traffic.

359
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,880
Looks like it's gonna
get a tad crowded in there.

360
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,320
I'll be back.

361
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

362
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,120
Been looking all over the gaff
for you.

363
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,080
Bit dreary down here, isn't it?

364
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
Fancy something to eat?

365
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
What's up?

366
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,040
I need to ask you a question.

367
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,480
And I need your word
that you're gonna be honest with me.

368
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Always am.

369
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,640
All right, you have my word.

370
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
My training.

371
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,280
The skills that I need to take down
the corruption at Wayne Enterprises.

372
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,320
How long will it take?

373
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,120
Well, there's no set timeline.

374
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
Doesn't really work like that,
does it?

375
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,480
Alfred, a year?

376
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,600
Two years?

377
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,720
Five?

378
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,760
Well, a lot longer than that, for you
to be the man that you need to be.

379
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,400
But you will get there.
I promise you that.

380
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah, well, how many will suffer
in the meantime?

381
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
How many will die

382
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,280
because of the crimes committed
by my family's company?

383
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,760
Where is all this coming from,
Master Bruce?

384
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,360
I spoke to...

385
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
Mayor Galavan this morning.

386
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
And?

387
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,840
He wants me to sell him my shares
of Wayne Enterprises so he can...

388
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,400
fix the company...

389
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
clean up Gotham.

390
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I see.

391
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,840
And what aren't you telling me?

392
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,040
He says...

393
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,560
that he knows the identity
of the man who killed my parents.

394
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,480
Which he's offering in return
for the company, right?

395
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,520
Yes.

396
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Yeah, well, that's,
not an offer, is it?

397
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,360
That's bloody extortion.

398
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,600
Yeah, well, I can't help
but consider it, Alfred.

399
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
Well, you shouldn't.

400
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,760
There's a fine line
between extortion and negotiation.

401
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,080
Yes, there is, Master Bruce.

402
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,600
But there's still a line.

403
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,880
My parents were killed

404
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,440
because of the corruption
that my father was trying to stop.

405
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,440
As of now, their, their deaths have
been in vain.

406
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,600
But if Mayor Galavan can truly...

407
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,760
If he can truly fix
Wayne Enterprises,

408
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,280
isn't it my moral duty
to allow him to do so?

409
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
For my father's legacy?

410
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,800
Wayne Enterprises isn't Thomas
and Martha Wayne's legacy.

411
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,520
That legacy is standing right here...

412
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
with me.

413
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,920
Alfred, am I wrong
if I just want it all to be over?

414
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
I just want,
I just want it to be over.

415
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,680
No, no. No, you're not wrong.

416
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Come here.

417
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
You're not wrong.

418
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,520
I know.

419
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
Can you believe it still fits?

420
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,520
Do you remember
when we first visited this place?

421
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,840
How excited
I was to get married here?

422
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,680
How long do you think
you have before the GCPD finds us?

423
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,040
So typical.

424
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm talking about us
and your head is in work.

425
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
There is no us.

426
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
What is all this?

427
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
Well, this is my wedding dress.

428
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,400
The tailor still had it in storage.

429
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,560
I mean, can you believe the luck?

430
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,560
Or fate.

431
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,840
That's Father Callahan,
you remember him, of course.

432
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,960
And these bozos...

433
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,960
Who knows? But you can't have
a wedding without witnesses.

434
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,320
That's the law.

435
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,600
Barbara...

436
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
Jim...

437
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,360
please don't act all surprised
and aggrieved.

438
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,680
You knew from the start
that this was a trap.

439
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,440
But you thought, "Hey, let the bad
guys take their best shot.

440
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,840
I'm Jim Gordon,
I'll find a way to win

441
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,960
or die."

442
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,320
It's option B, baby.

443
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,520
Your fondest wish come true.

444
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,200
I don't want to die.

445
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Hey.

446
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,960
Sure you do.

447
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,120
Aren't you tired
of hiding your true self?

448
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,160
Tired of lying to yourself?

449
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,080
To Lee?

450
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,760
I don't lie to Lee.

451
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Really?

452
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Let's ask her.

453
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,280
Lee!

454
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,440
Savor every moment.

455
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,720
Hey, girlfriend.

456
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,160
We really need to talk
about this bad boy.

457
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,280
<i>We had real love.</i>

458
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,160
<i>You asked me to marry you.</i>

459
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,720
<i>I booked a church.</i>

460
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,040
<i>I bought a damn wedding dress.</i>

461
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,680
<i>Jim, fool that I am,
I still love you, even now.</i>

462
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,320
<i>I booked a church.</i>

463
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,800
<i>I bought a damn wedding dress.</i>

464
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,600
I want updates every 15 minutes.

465
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,480
Hang on. Turn around
and get the hell out of here.

466
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,240
She's taking him to church.

467
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,600
Church? What church?

468
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,240
She talked about the wedding
they never had.

469
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,600
She wants a do-over.

470
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,120
Gotham Cathedral is nearest
to the snatch site.

471
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,280
That's where they are.

472
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,320
- That's thin.
- I know I am right.

473
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll call you back.

474
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Let's go.

475
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,800
So, Lee, how do you think your
relationship with Jim is going?

476
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,120
This doesn't concern Lee.

477
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,880
Let her go.
This is between you and me.

478
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,960
This is about all of us.

479
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,040
She deserves to know exactly
who you are.

480
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,240
I know who he is.

481
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,600
Oh, how could you,
when he doesn't even know?

482
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,080
He is incapable of being honest
with himself.

483
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,760
Let alone anyone else.

484
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,600
What about you?

485
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,080
This entire day has been a lie.

486
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,800
You were never gonna give up proof
on Galavan.

487
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Who?

488
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,160
You want some honesty?

489
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,360
Fine.

490
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,920
Mayor James is alive and well
at a stash house on China Docks.

491
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,320
See?

492
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,040
Honesty.

493
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Now, you.

494
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,360
Who put him there?

495
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,560
- Who put him there?
- Boring, Jim.

496
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,880
The Jim Gordon you know is an act.

497
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,600
He's like an addict who thinks
he can dabble in darkness

498
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,240
as long as nobody sees
the needle marks.

499
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Everyone has an act.

500
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,680
Did he tell you how he got reinstated
at the GCPD?

501
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,480
He killed a man for Penguin.

502
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,760
Wow! Very good, Jim.

503
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,280
You did tell her.

504
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,520
We don't have secrets between us.

505
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
He's done a lot of things
that he's not proud of.

506
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,760
Everyone has.

507
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,840
But you love him anyway?

508
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,440
Is that right?

509
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,880
Despite all his faults.

510
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,120
Yes, I do.

511
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,720
Cute little do-gooder Doctor Lee.

512
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,800
In love with a cruel, cold,
death-obsessed sadist.

513
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,240
That's not Jim.

514
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,640
Do you think you know him
better than I do?

515
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,720
I love him, too, you know.

516
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,240
I know him better than you do.

517
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,400
Okay, Barbara, I hear you.

518
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,920
You love him, we both love him.

519
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,160
- That's okay...
- But I love him more.

520
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,760
Okay, listen, Barbara.
I know that now. Please...

521
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,080
I'm gonna prove that I love him more.

522
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,200
I am going to carve your pretty face
off your skull.

523
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,800
And then you will both understand
what true love is.

524
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,680
Okay, there's just one more thing.

525
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,800
- What?
- Your dress!

526
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,160
I, I love your dress.

527
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,880
I just want to know where you got it.

528
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,320
Oh, um..

529
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,840
Drop the knife.

530
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,880
There he is.

531
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,040
My little monster.

532
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,480
Don't make me kill you.

533
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,160
Make you?

534
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,920
Jim, you long to kill me.

535
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Do it, Jim.

536
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Do me.

537
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Don't take another step!

538
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
Kill him!

539
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,640
Go get her!

540
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,320
Jim!

541
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Go!

542
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,000
It's over!

543
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Not yet.

544
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,120
Hold on.

545
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Hold on.

546
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,240
Sorry, baby.

547
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,840
I've been kind of a bad date, huh?

548
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,160
I love you, baby.

549
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
No!

550
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,520
Some hedges
and bushes broke her fall.

551
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,480
She's got half a dozen broken bones
and a concussion.

552
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,880
She's critical.

553
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
Are you okay?

554
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Yeah.

555
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,920
Not now but when this is over,
we need to talk.

556
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I know.

557
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
Tell me you got something from her.

558
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,400
She didn't give up Galavan
but she did say Mayor James is alive,

559
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
stashed in a safe house
on China Docks.

560
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,280
All mobile units, China Docks,
right now.

561
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,480
<i>Ten-four, Captain.</i>

562
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
GCPD!

563
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,760
What is wrong with these people?

564
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,000
Help me.

565
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,000
- Mayor James?
- Help me, please.

566
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,280
Oh, thank God.

567
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,440
Who did this to you?

568
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,760
Who do you think?

569
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
All the papers seem to be in order.

570
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,800
You're making the right decision.

571
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,120
Sign and the file is yours.

572
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,640
I... I changed my mind.

573
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,080
I... I can't sell you my company.

574
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,120
Not for any price.

575
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,280
Alfred, get Bruce away from him now!

576
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,400
- Detective Gordon?
- You're under arrest.

577
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,320
Surprised to see me?

578
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,280
May I ask what the charge is?

579
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,280
The kidnapping and torture
of Aubrey James. Cuff him.

580
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Get him out of here.

581
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Where...

582
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
No!

583
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,640
No!

584
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,520
Tell me who killed them!

585
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,560
Please! I'll do anything...

586
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,800
Finally.

587
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
Oh, my.

588
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,320
Mr. Penguin?

589
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,440
Help me.

590
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Please.
