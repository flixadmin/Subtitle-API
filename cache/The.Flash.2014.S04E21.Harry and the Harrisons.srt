every file, every report, every footnote

23
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,122

when I woke up in the

And now that he has
all of the satellites,

I mean, he could turn on
the machine at any point.

But everyone else in the

So last night, Harry, Cisco, and I

were up all night writing
all the different algorithms

51
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,335
we could think of involving

52

the satellite tech that DeVoe stole.

53
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,114
We think DeVoe plans to position each

54
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,320
of his five satellites
at specifically calculated

55
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,301
- points around the globe.
- And when the quantum computers

56
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:04,703
in each satellite link up...

57
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:07,505
He'll use that network to basically emit

58
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,082
a series of dark matter bursts.

59

Well, we need to nip this in the bud.

62
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,115
We can't let him
launch those satellites.

63
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,551
Yeah, but I mean, how are
we supposed to find him?

64
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,019
I mean, we haven't been able to register

DeVoe's pocket dimension
energy for days.

66
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,687
And with Null's gravitational powers,

67
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,991
he can launch these satellites
from any place at any time.

68
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,527
Yeah, he can.

What are you thinking, Bar?

70
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,458

- Whoa.
- There is one small problem.

72

DeVoe has Kilgore's powers.

Yeah, he can manipulate

we fire at him.

147
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,849
that leaves us with one other option.

your professor situation

it also benefits me.
