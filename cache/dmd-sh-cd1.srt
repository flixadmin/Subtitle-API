I just have a small point of concern.

322
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,512
-How can I help?
-I'd followed the murders with interest.

323
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,516
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

324
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,647
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

325
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,257
-You're too kind.
-However, by comparison...

326
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,262
your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

327
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,969
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

328
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,800
Either that or, um...

329
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,843
shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

330
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,448
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

331
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,609
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

332
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,313
-I'm merely the channel.
-My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

333
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,254
You see,
5 lives might have been spared.

334
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,418
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.

335
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,961
Hm.

336

337

called to serve a greater purpose.

338

I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

339

After you're hanged, of course.

340
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,745

that'd be scientifically significant.

341

Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

342

Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

343

I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

344

You and I are bound together
on a journey...

345
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,388
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

346
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,028
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

347
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,268
That worries me.

348
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,767
Steel your mind, Holmes.

349
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,433
I need you.

350
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,044
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

351

-And I will rise again.
-Bon voyage.

352

Pay attention.

353
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,116
3 more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

354
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,346
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

355
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:35,050
or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

356
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,457

Not for this one.

Lord Henry Blackwood...

362

the unholy murder of
5 innocent young women...

363
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,856
and the attempted murder of a 6th.

364

Do you have any final words?

365
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,154
Death...

366

is only the beginning.

That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.

370
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,432
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

371

Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

and your favorite...

375
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,512
olives from the Cyclades.

376
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,912
Thought we might have a little tea party.

377

And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

378
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,781
A file with my name on it.

379
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,990
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

380

"Missing naval documents lead
to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

in any of these articles.

Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

-It's not. It's in my hand.

Get what's in your hand out of my face.

CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
-Clarkie.

Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

483

What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

484
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,225
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

485
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,925
No, "you" means you.

It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...

Well...

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,466

from the grave, sir.

-Most engaging.
-Very clever.

490

What are the facts?

492
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,125
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

493

I'll leave this in your capable hands.

494
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,731
-I have an appointment with Mary.
-It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

Don't try that.

-That's what we're trying to avoid.

Certainly.

What's the major concern?

499
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,881
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

500
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,916
-Indeed.
-You're not taking this seriously, are you?

501
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,575
Yes, as you should.

It's a matter of professional integrity.

503

No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

Who do you think won the match,

-Sir?
-The rugby match.

-Yes.

The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

That's not Blackwood.

Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

Time of death?

538
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,681
Diptera is...

539
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,348
approximately...

540
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:53,079
2/3 of an inch
which would put the time of death...

541
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,316
at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

It was Blackwood.

A northern stout, to be exact.

I've seen things in war I don't understand.

561

I once met a man

You have to admit, Holmes...

565

that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

566
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,905
is theoretically possible.

567
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,040
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

568

Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

instead of theories to suit facts.

is the key to this.

Hm.

the keyhole where the watch was wound.

-What does that tell you?
-The man was likely a drunk.

574
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,603
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:17,096
together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

794
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,298
which makes you either brothers...

795
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,205
or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

796
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,680
Very few people
are privy to that information...

797
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,684
and we want to keep it that way.

798
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,620
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

799
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,195
His mother wasn't my wife...

800
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,595
but she shared our beliefs.

801
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,927
She was a powerful practitioner...

802
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,764
though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

803
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,775
Death followed him wherever he went.

804
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,376
Those 5 girls were not the first
to be butchered.

805
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,708
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

806
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:02,478
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

807
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,177
The boy was a curse.

808
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:08,323
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

809
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,890
His power grows daily.

810
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,118
His resurrection is evidence of that.

811
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,823
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

812
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:19,457
ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book
of spells. This is the source of his power.

813
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,936
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of world.

814
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,904
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

815
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,711
COWARD: We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

816
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:34,305
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

817
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,042
HOLMES:
Hm, yes.

818
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,118
COWARD:
So...

819
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,390
name your price.

820
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,753
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

821
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,986
is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

822
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,695
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

823
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,131
But not for you.

824
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,270
And certainly not for a price.

825
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,100
-I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
-What is that?

826
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,112
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

827
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,608
Food for thought.

828
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:37,034
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

829
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:40,878
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

830
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,386
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality--

831
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,046
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

832
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,555
of the wine.

833
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,662
Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally.

834
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,722
I found your man.

835
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,231
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

836
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,501
If you still need him.

837
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,270
Oh, dear.

838
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,407
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

839
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,945
He's a professor, isn't he?

840
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,015
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.

841
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:19,450
I've never known a professor to carry a gun,
and on such a clever contraption.

842
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,960
Eye patch, nice touch.

843
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,922
So case closed...

844
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:32,124
which makes this a social visit.

845
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,202
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

846
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,396
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

847
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,769
which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

848
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,535
[CORK POPS]

849
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,506
Let it breathe.

850
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,575
I've never been in over my head.

851
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,277
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

852
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:55,550
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

853
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:02,155
If I'm in danger, so are you.

854
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,496
Come with me.

855
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,801
What if we trusted each other?
