1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We can't change history.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,640
That happens, the Darhks
will be able to free their demon.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,920
Do not let him take you away from me.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,520
We can save Nora and stop Mallus
from being freed.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,400
- Together.
- We have the six totems.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,400
What if the only way to kill Mallus
is to let him out?

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,200
We are here to help you create
the anachronism,

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,320
so we can release Mallus,
and then we can kill him.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,960
- I'll find you...
- Go!

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
No.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Nora.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,560
Mallus is taller than I thought.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,200
My name is "Malice," you fools.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
What?

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
I knew it.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,360
- Sounds way cooler.
- Hand over the totems,

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,360
or I will lay waste to your world.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,680
You want the totems?

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,040
Come and get them.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Amaya!

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,520
All right, everyone fall back.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,200
Rip, we're going to need a evac.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
<i>We're in over our heads here.</i>

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
If my read of the situation
is correct,

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
what you need is a miracle.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,320
I'm going to buy you some time.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,440
- Wally, create a distraction.
- Got it.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm starting to think letting Mallus
out of his cage was a bad idea.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,880
<i>The Waverider's Time Drive
is highly unstable.</i>

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,680
<i>- Removing it...</i>
- May very well be the only way

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
to hold our adversary at bay.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>I believe I know
what you're planning.</i>

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,800
<i>It is extremely reckless
with a low likelihood of success.</i>

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,480
Well, then, it seems like
I've finally learned to think

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,840
like a Legend.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,600
<i>- The odds of survival are 0.0...</i>
- I know.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,600
I will miss you, Gideon, truly.

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,560
<i>No more than I'll miss you, Rip.</i>

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Guys, I can't hold him off
much longer.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm going to get her to the med bay.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,680
Wally, I need you back
on the ship now.

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,960
<i>So, you're saying you don't fit in?</i>

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,600
<i>You're an outcast, a misfit.</i>

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
<i>That's assumed.</i>

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
Sounds to me like you're a Legend.

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,720
Together you are the best crew

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
the best team,
a captain could ever hope for.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
<i>Love changes everything.</i>

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Daddy?

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,440
Gideon, get me eyes on Rip.

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
<i>I have a visual, Captain.</i>

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
What the hell is he doing?

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>Rip disengaged the time drive,
making it unstable.</i>

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>When it reaches critical mass,
it will consume Mallus.</i>

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And Rip.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,760
- Gideon, time-jump us out of here.
- But she can't.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,440
Rip has our time drive.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,400
<i>Yes, but there is another one.</i>

60
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,880
On the Jumpship.

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Wally?

62
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,040
Gideon, put me through to Rip.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
<i>Rip?</i>

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm a little busy at the moment,
Sara.

65
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,520
Look, you didn't tell us
that you were buying us time

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
with your life.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,000
Listen carefully.
This gambit will not kill Mallus.

68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>It will only delay him long enough
for you to make an escape.</i>

69
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,080
There has to be another way.

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,080
No, there isn't.

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
It's all right, Sara.

72
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,160
I should very much like to see
my wife and son again.

73
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
<i>I will miss you, Captain Lance...</i>

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
<i>you and the rest of the Legends.</i>

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,120
My one hope is that you all
live up to that name.

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,720
<i>Captain Lance, the time drive
is reaching critical mass.</i>

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Can we jump?

78
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,320
<i>Miss Tomaz has finished
making repairs.</i>

79
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
<i>We have 15 seconds.</i>

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Good bye.

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,760
Good bye, Captain.

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
Gideon, get us out of here.

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,760
Ironic, isn't it?

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,200
A time demon who's run out of time.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
You don't drink.

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Yeah, well, we lost Rip.

87
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,360
Okay, somebody's got to say it,
so I'm going to say it.

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,640
This is all our fault.

89
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,840
{\an5}Apparently I'm not going to say it,
but, yeah, we let Mallus out.

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,120
{\an5}Well, whose stupid idea
was it to fight him

91
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,160
with some magic necklaces?

92
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,960
It wasn't the totems that failed.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It was us.

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
{\an5}Yeah, we might want
to rethink that whole,

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,800
{\an5}"We screw up things
for the better," motto.

96
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Okay, so, what's the plan, Captain?

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,760
{\an5}All I know is that Rip gave his life
so that we could take the totems

98
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
{\an5}somewhere that Mallus
can't find them.

99
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,680
So, that's what we're going to do.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
And where is that?

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
The Old West.

102
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,840
Salvation, North Dakota.

103
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,720
It's basically a temporal blind spot.

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,240
{\an5}Wait a sec, we just unleashed
an ancient time demon

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,200
who's about to lay waste
to all of history,

106
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,920
and our plan is to hide?

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes, it is.

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,680
Gideon, plot a course.

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,560
{\an5}Well, I hope you're here
to make good on your promise

110
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
{\an5}and kill me, which would work
out for both of us.

111
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,400
It'd be a real win-win.

112
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Mercy killing's not my style.

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,480
{\an5}Even if it was,
you don't deserve my mercy.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
{\an5}You deserve to live out
the rest of your days

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,160
knowing that you destroyed
your own daughter.

116
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
What are you doing here?

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
It's my lab.

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,200
Don't do anything stupid.

119
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,800
<i>Captain, we've arrived
in the Wild West.</i>

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
{\an5}Thank you, Gideon.
Have everyone meet me

121
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,600
in the fabrication room.

122
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,480
Ray, nothing stupid.

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Is she right?

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,040
{\an5}Are you really planning
something stupid?

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Maybe.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,400
Probably. Most likely.

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
But it could fix this whole thing

128
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
and get Nora back.

129
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,680
<i>Salvation 1874</i>

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,800
<i>Salvation Town Hall</i>

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,440
<i>Salvation</i>

132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,240
Yo, this is tight.

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,520
{\an5}I know everyone's dead.
I know time is broken.

134
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,960
But can we just take a second
to acknowledge this?

135
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
{\an5}You know, as much as I enjoy
this getup

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
and I actually really do...

137
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
Mallus is still out there.

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,480
{\an5}And we'll deal with him, but first,
we need to get our heads on straight.

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
{\an5}- How long is that going to take?
- Depends.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,400
- On what?
- How strong the whiskey is.

141
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,440
{\an5}All right, I think it's working.
I am on the edges of a plan.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
Great. Let's hear it.

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
{\an5}So, we know that the six totems
are the only thing

144
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
that can stop Mallus.

145
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,360
They weren't much use
to us last time.

146
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,760
"Us" being the key word.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,280
You and Amaya were born
to wield the totems,

148
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,600
{\an5}- and the rest of us are just...
- Losers.

149
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,160
{\an5}That's why Rip picked us,
Snart, the Professor,

150
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,280
{\an5}those stupid hawk
flying-chicken people.

151
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
We're all expendable.

152
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,160
{\an5}Not that any of these
unwashed hayseeds

153
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
look like righteous totem bearers.

154
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,960
Who you calling a hayseed?

155
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,360
Jonah Hex.

156
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
You know this guy?

157
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,280
Me and these ruffians go way back.

158
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,840
Wally, Zari, this is Jonah Hex.

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Nice hat.

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Thank you, ma'am.

161
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,280
Obviously joking.

162
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
So, who died and made you sheriff?

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,040
That'd be the old sheriff.

164
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,160
Well, now it's my job
to keep the peace around here.

165
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,840
So, you can't be causing any trouble.

166
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,120
{\an5}We are not here to cause trouble.
We are here to avoid it.

167
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,600
This the trouble you aiming to avoid?

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,680
Not exactly.

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,440
- Looks like Phallus...
- Mallus.

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,320
Mallus has brought back
our old buddies.

171
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,880
I thought Mallus wasn't supposed
to be able to find us here.

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
Fools.

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,400
Mallus sees all, knows all.

174
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
Then why did he bring back
you jerks to do his business?

175
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,080
Because he's probably still
recovering from that beat-down

176
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,840
- Rip gave him.
- Oh, now, do not confuse

177
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,000
Mallus' clemency with weakness,
my hearties.

178
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,920
- Mallus will spare your lives.
- It's actually "Malice."

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
- It's actually Mallus.
- Nope, "Malice."

180
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
- Mallus!
- Guys, it doesn't matter.

181
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
If you surrender the six totems.

182
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
Yeah, sorry, we only brought two,

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,240
and mine's kind
of a family heirloom, so...

184
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,280
Then we have no choice
but to march our army on your town

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,480
and kill every fool
who has given you shelter.

186
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,440
You leave my town out of this.

187
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
You have been warned.

188
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,800
We'll be back to collect the totems.
Shall we say high noon tomorrow?

189
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Tootles.

190
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,560
Well, so much for hiding out.

191
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,360
Guys, if you can hear me,

192
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,600
I need you to put
the Waverider on lockdown.

193
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,760
You know, I'm only doing this
because of my daughter.

194
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,800
Well, if this works, we can save her.

195
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,120
Going somewhere, Raymond?

196
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,000
No, no, of course not.
Zari rerouted the time drive, so...

197
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah, Gideon just said someone
re-rerouted it. What are you doing?

198
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,200
Well, Sara wanted the ship
on lockdown, so...

199
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,160
So you decide to load
Damien Darhk onto the Jumpship?

200
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
- Hey, Nate.
- Don't wave.

201
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,440
Have you lost your complete mind?

202
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
- I know this looks bad.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
But there's a completely
rational explanation.

204
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm listening.

205
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Me too.

206
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
- Sorry.
- Oh, my nose!

207
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,080
Ray, what are you doing?

208
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
You know, not that
I couldn't watch Pompadour

209
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
get punched out all day,

210
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
but you could have just told
him where we're going.

211
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,360
<i>- Ray open the door.</i>
- Where are we going?

212
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,160
To right before Mallus
took over Nora.

213
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,720
And I can't tell anybody
because we're not supposed

214
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
to travel to events
in which we've participated in.

215
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
<i>I will punch through this door!</i>

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,360
- And no one on your team trusts me.
<i>- Damn it, Ray!</i>

217
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,600
That goes without saying.

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,240
Did you hear me over comms?

219
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
Ray punched me in the face
with his giant banana hands

220
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
and took off with Damien Darhk.

221
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
What are you doing?

222
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,280
Lyoga root?

223
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,600
Do you really think
this is the best time

224
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
to go on a psychedelic vision quest?

225
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,240
Who am I kidding?
It's never a bad time to go.

226
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,920
You can't come with me, Nathaniel.

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
I'm going all the way back
to the beginning

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,200
to meet with my ancestors...

229
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,000
the original totem bearers.

230
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Why?

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
Sara thinks we're not cut out
to wield the totems.

232
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,360
But I believe the reason
we didn't defeat Mallus

233
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,280
the first time is because
we didn't know how.

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,040
So, you want to talk
to the original bearers

235
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,400
so they can teach you
the totem user manual.

236
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,320
- I am definitely coming with you.
- No.

237
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,840
It was my decision
to save my village.

238
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,880
I shattered history
and allowed the demon to escape.

239
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,160
It's up to me to find a way
to stop him.

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Amaya.

241
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Amaya, look at me.

242
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,720
We decided to save the village.

243
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,320
Now, if you're going to go
on some crazy drug trip,

244
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
you better believe
I'm coming with you.

245
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,280
No, Nathaniel...

246
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,640
You're only supposed to take
a sip of that.

247
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Really?

248
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,840
I'll see you on the other side.

249
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Nate.

250
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
Nate, open your eyes.

251
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
Totem bearers.

252
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,960
What are they doing?

253
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, snap! They got lasers!

254
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
Nathaniel?

255
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Wake up.

256
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
They beat him
with the Care Bear Stare!

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
No.

258
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,480
They stopped Mallus together.

259
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
That is the only way to defeat him.

260
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
Together. Together.

261
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
<i>Database access passthru
alternative delivery</i>

262
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,840
What gives, Gideon?

263
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,080
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

264
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Begging your pardons, ma'am.

265
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,800
Captain Lance thought
that you might need a hand.

266
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,560
Yeah, I think she was just
trying to get rid of you.

267
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
What in tarnation is that?

268
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,240
It's a computer program I designed
to act as a temporal beacon.

269
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,000
Like a smoke signal.

270
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,040
Sara wants us to find
new totem bearers,

271
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,800
but we're a little short on allies.

272
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,920
Well, the Legends,
they may be an unorthodox lot,

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,960
but they got a knack
for making friends.

274
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Like you?

275
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
I don't take a shine to most folks.

276
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Me neither.

277
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,240
Well, you send out a smoke signal...

278
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
I'll bet you a greenback
you get a response.

279
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
I'll take that bet.

280
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Sheriff.

281
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,280
You can call me Jonah.

282
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Ma'am.

283
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
<i>Hello, this is Nathaniel Heywood
speaking,</i>

284
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,640
<i>and we have a code 113.</i>

285
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,000
<i>Repeat, code 113.</i>

286
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
If the code is 113,

287
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,760
it's off to the bridge
for you and me.

288
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,320
You memorized Ray's song?

289
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,040
He sings it often enough.

290
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,360
Nathaniel and I shared
a cup of Lyoga root tea

291
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,880
to access the memories
of the original totem bearers.

292
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,400
Oh, you are still high.

293
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Now, the reason the totems
haven't been working for us

294
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
is not because we're unworthy.

295
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
It's because we've been using
them wrong.

296
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,200
The totems were not designed
to be used individually.

297
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,440
- Individually... individually.
- Shut up.

298
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
Their elemental powers combine

299
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,920
to create a perfect being of light
to fight Mallus with.

300
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,480
- Like Voltron.
- Like Voltron?

301
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
Defender of the Universe.

302
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,040
Right, well, weren't all
of the original totem bearers

303
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,760
actually from Zambesi?

304
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,240
But you all wield them now.

305
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,600
I mean, do you think
that was an accident?

306
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,760
Yes, I do.

307
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Mick...

308
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,040
the chances of you running
into your father in Vietnam

309
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,680
are next to zero,
and yet you did,

310
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,760
and you came out
a better man for it.

311
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
Zari, do you remember the way
your totem called to mine

312
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
the moment you put it on?

313
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,320
It wanted you to stay with us.

314
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,800
So, maybe it wasn't a coincidence
that I joined the team.

315
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
No.

316
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,680
That was just another one
of the Englishman's crazy ideas.

317
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Sara.

318
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,480
Please. We have to try.

319
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,440
- Fine.
- Sick. Yes.

320
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,320
Because, no coincidences.

321
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,800
All right, Amaya. It's your show.

322
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,240
How do we create this
magical light being?

323
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,040
All right, everyone, over here.

324
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
Make a circle.

325
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,720
Mick, your fire is going to provide
our champion with its spark.

326
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,880
Zari, use your air to give it breath.

327
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,600
Wally, use water to flow life's
blood through its veins.

328
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,720
- Nate.
- I will use the Earth totem

329
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,360
to give Voltron flesh.

330
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,840
- You got to stop calling it that.
- I will never stop calling it that.

331
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm going to use my spirit
to provide it with a soul.

332
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,240
But without the final totem,

333
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,160
our champion will be incomplete.

334
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,720
No, it's not happening.

335
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,080
Without the death totem,
the other five totems

336
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,760
can only imprison Mallus.

337
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,000
We need death to kill him
once and for all.

338
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Don't worry.

339
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,200
If you turn into a witch wench,
I'll kill you.

340
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

341
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
All right.

342
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Let's do it.

343
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We're good.

344
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Okay, hold hands.

345
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,040
- Come on.
- Clear your minds...

346
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,120
and focus on your breath.

347
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,040
Imagine a perfect warrior
of justice, mercy, and light.

348
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,760
Why does
Pretty have such girly hands?

349
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,480
Damn, this Lyoga root is strong.
Concentrate, Nate.

350
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,400
Think about
"Voltron, Defender of the Universe."

351
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,440
I kind of pictured myself
wielding something cool,

352
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,840
like a lightning totem.

353
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,160
Am I crazy, or is Jonah Hex hot?

354
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,760
Eh, you could do worse than Hex.

355
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,120
- Wait, you can hear me?
- We can all hear each other.

356
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Even what I said
about Pretty's girly hands?

357
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,000
- Yes.
- Okay, please.

358
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
We need to clear our minds.

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,280
It's working.

360
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,160
Are we making a baby?

361
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,480
Guys, we have to focus.

362
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,640
You telling us to focus
is making it harder to focus.

363
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,880
All right, look, this is why
we're not worthy of the totems.

364
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,040
- Seriously, are we making a baby?
- Everyone, just shut up!

365
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,680
Kraken baby.

366
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,720
Is it supposed to be gooey?

367
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Mick!

368
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,240
What? I'm just putting this slop
out of its misery.

369
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,600
Voltron.

370
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,760
Right, we need to try again.

371
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,880
No, what we need to do
is find some people

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,480
that are worthy of using
these totems.

373
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,040
If that's not an entrance line,
I don't know what is.

374
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,680
I got your message. We all did.

375
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,840
You guys just can't seem

376
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,840
to keep yourselves out of trouble,
can you?

377
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,160
<i>Zambesi 1992</i>

378
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,320
Whoa, sounds like I'm really
giving you the business in there.

379
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
- Yeah, still hurts.
- Sorry.

380
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,160
Okay, so here's the plan.
We have to knock Nora out.

381
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,920
Gently, because I know
she's still your daughter.

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,280
And we probably have to keep
her unconscious

383
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,440
until we figure out a way
to de-demonize her.

384
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
We better move quickly.

385
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,160
I can't believe you were ever
this young, Nana Baa.

386
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,320
I can't believe you came to my aid.

387
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
If you only knew the odds
against that happening.

388
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Odds?

389
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,480
I've been given a chance
to fight alongside the woman

390
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,000
who saved Zambesi.

391
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,840
What was I supposed to say? No?

392
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,280
Am I still high,
or is the water witch a pal,

393
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,160
Helen of Troy a warrior princess,
and Jax is wearing a wedding ring?

394
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,280
I believe you owe me a greenback.

395
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,040
Not to look a gift horse
in the mouth,

396
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,480
but I was hoping
for some real soldiers.

397
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,880
I'm Helen. Nice to meet you.

398
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,280
Huh. Nice to meet you, little lady.

399
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,480
Well, it's really good
seeing you again, Jax.

400
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,120
I just wish it was under
better circumstances.

401
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,440
Hey, listen, I'm just glad
that we got Zari's beacon in time.

402
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,920
I mean, going up
against three armies,

403
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,760
you all are going to need
all the help you can get.

404
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,440
Hey, what happened to Ray?

405
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
You do not want to know.

406
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Come on, do it now.

407
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,960
Before it's too late. Go!

408
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh, man, you really
shouldn't hit your daughter.

409
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,480
You stole my Nanite gun?

410
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,000
But that'll kill her.

411
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,280
Sorry, honey.

412
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Nora...

413
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Nora.

414
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
Dad. Why?

415
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,040
Because I love you

416
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,520
and I couldn't watch you
become a monster...

417
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
like me.

418
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,480
<i>You fool.</i>

419
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,840
<i>You thought destroying this vessel
would thwart my return?</i>

420
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,560
<i>I'll gladly take you instead.</i>

421
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,040
I was counting on that.

422
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,880
Good bye, Nora.

423
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,240
- Go, go.
- No.

424
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Get her out of here.

425
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,120
- Go.
- No!

426
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,040
Dad!

427
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Is it weird that I keep
expecting your granddaughter

428
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,080
to use that thing
to try to drown me again?

429
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
This Kuasa never suffered in the war.

430
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
She never worked for the Darhks.

431
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
She's a good person
who's led a good life.

432
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,320
And she and Mari share the totem.

433
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,800
It worked.

434
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,640
I can't believe it.

435
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can.

436
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,560
You told us the universe
was guiding us,

437
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,200
prepping us for this fight.

438
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,320
You listened to your heart,
and it drove you to do

439
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,200
a really good slash
super messy thing.

440
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,280
Since when did you have time
to have a baby?

441
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,840
You've only been gone
a couple of months.

442
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,600
Well, I mean,
that's how it is for you guys.

443
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,240
But for me, it's been five years.

444
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Here, look.

445
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,640
Her name's Martina.

446
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,880
And her and her mom
are the light of my life, man.

447
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,080
Well, mazel tov.

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,080
- Okay.
- Cheers.

449
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Yeah.

450
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,680
Okay. Stay with me, Nora.

451
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,800
- Okay, you're safe. It's okay.
- No, my dad. My dad.

452
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,600
He traded places with you
as Mallus's vessel...

453
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,960
to save you.

454
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,800
How could you let him do that?

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
- Why didn't you stop him?
- It's okay.

456
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,040
No, no! Dad!

457
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,400
Just point and shoot.

458
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
Damn, girl.

459
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,280
Damn. Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

460
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,760
I learned to fight on Themyscira,

461
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,920
but the Legends were the ones
that inspired me.

462
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,880
You gave me the gift of a new life.

463
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,000
It is an honor to be here
to help you save yours.

464
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,600
Thank you, but we need to be
teaching you to use the totems,

465
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,840
and I'm pretty sure you didn't
learn that on Themyscira.

466
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,400
That's not why we're here, Sara.

467
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,200
We're here to help you,
not replace you.

468
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,160
Look, we've already tried twice,
and we failed miserably.

469
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,520
You still don't see it, do you, Sara?

470
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,160
You guys made Kuasa
and Helen's life better.

471
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,680
And that is just the tip
of the iceberg.

472
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,800
We are all here
to support the Legends.

473
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
And what, you're going to stand there

474
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,120
and tell me that
you aren't the exact people

475
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,160
to wield the totems
against Mallus now?

476
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Good speech.

477
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Thank you.

478
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,800
And it's a good point.

479
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,440
By the way,
I wanted to ask you, just,

480
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,920
did you mean what you said
the last time we saw each other?

481
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
When I told you to run?

482
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,640
No. Before that.

483
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,240
Oh, you mean,
when I told you, I loved you?

484
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Yeah.

485
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
What do you think?

486
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
I...

487
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,360
think that...

488
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,360
Howdy, partners!

489
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,520
What did I miss?

490
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,720
Where's Darhk?

491
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
Wrong Darhk, wrong Darhk!

492
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
No, no, look, look,
she's, she's been de-Mallused.

493
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,280
She's no longer a demon.

494
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
So, so we don't have
to fight Mallus anymore?

495
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Not exactly.

496
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
And what about Damien Darhk?

497
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,160
Long story short,
he sacrificed himself for Nora,

498
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,560
and now he's Mallus's vessel.

499
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
So, what's new in the Old West?

500
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,640
Well, Caesar, Blackbeard,
and Leif Erikson's crazy sister

501
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,880
are demon pawns.

502
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,760
They gave us an ultimatum
to hand over the totems.

503
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,120
Well, how long do we have?

504
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
All right.

505
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,880
We're facing an army of Romans,
Vikings, and pirates.

506
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,120
But you know what today is?

507
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,640
Today's the day that we prove
that Rip did not sacrifice

508
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
his life in vain.

509
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,840
And today is the day
that we prove that we are not losers.

510
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,200
And today is the day
that we earn the name Legends.

511
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,880
All right, all right.

513
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,200
Now, how do we sneak out the back?

514
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Nice of you to bring your fan club.

515
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
So...

516
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,560
about that ultimatum.

517
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,760
There is honor in surrender,
Captain Lance.

518
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,240
Our new god may grant you mercy.

519
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes, be a good girl
and hand us over your magic baubles.

520
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,240
I changed my mind. New terms.

521
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,440
Get out of town or get hurt.

522
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,320
Attack!

523
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,800
Can you believe
this is my first time on a horse?

524
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,960
Haven't you ever learned
never to turn your back

525
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,240
on your enemies?

526
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,640
Caesar.

527
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,040
That's a Roman nose.

528
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,880
I should have known
it was just a tall tale.

529
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,400
You're not the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

530
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,040
No, her name is Amaya Jiwe
of the Great Tribe of Zambesi.

531
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,160
Tootles.

532
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,360
Dynamite? You sure about this?

533
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,120
No, but it's too late
for second guessing.

534
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Do it now.

535
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,960
So, we should probably get
back to fighting.

536
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Right.

537
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,520
Well, next round's on me.

538
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,600
Not to be a buzzkill,
but this doesn't look good.

539
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
It's Mallus.

540
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,920
Go. Make good your preparations.

541
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,840
The rest of us shall buy you time.

542
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
All right, you heard the lady.

543
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,720
Well, hopefully
this goes better than last time.

544
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,720
All right, we have to believe
in the totems,

545
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,200
that they've chosen each of us.

546
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,200
Well, if this really
is the end of the world,

547
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,560
then I choose
to surround myself with you guys.

548
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Come on.

549
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,840
- Whoa. You feel that?
- It's working.

550
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,400
All right, now,
imagine a powerful light

551
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,200
of pure goodness.

552
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,720
Something's forming.

553
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,360
Can I peak? I'm gonna peak.

554
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,760
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God?

555
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
- What "Oh, God"?
- Everyone focus.

556
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,320
Wait, is somebody thinking of...

557
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm sorry, you said think
of something pure,

558
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,480
- and I thought...
- No, you didn't.

559
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Again, I said I'm sorry.

560
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,840
Yeah, I can't stop
thinking about him, either.

561
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
Guys, whenever you got...

562
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,640
What the Sam Hill is going on?

563
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
I think this is part of Sara's plan.

564
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,840
I lo... lo... love you.

565
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,360
The Blue God, he has returned.

566
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,080
That is your captain's plan?

567
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
Where in the hell are Sara
and the others?

568
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,800
- That is Sara and the others.
- What?

569
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,880
Beebo hungry.

570
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,960
Man, have I missed you guys.

571
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,240
Like the gods of Olympus
made manifest.

572
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,760
Oh, hey, I know you're not
gonna take that, Beebo.

573
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,960
- Nana baa...
- Come on, guys. You got this.

574
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Beebo can't breathe.

575
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Don't you dare give up on me, Lance.

576
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,600
Beebo.

577
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,680
Yeah. Come on, that's it.
Kick his ass.

578
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,240
Not even the six can stop me now.

579
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,160
Beebo want cuddle.

580
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,800
No!

581
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,040
Guys. Guys.

582
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Are you all right?

583
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,240
Guys, we did it.

584
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,000
Our totems united to create
a single furry love child.

585
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,960
Worst orgy ever.

586
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Dad.

587
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,840
I'm sorry, Nora.

588
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,720
He died a good man.

589
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,880
Damnation. Now I just have seen
about everything.

590
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,680
So wait. Wha... That's it?

591
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,000
You... you destroyed the demon?

592
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,640
I'm just glad the ancestors
aren't here to see this.

593
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,200
Yeah, but Rip would be proud.

594
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,480
Yes.

595
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,440
We did it, Mick.

596
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,240
Get off of me.

597
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,160
The totems came together
when the world needed them most.

598
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,320
Now it's time for them
to find new bearers.

599
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,120
I trust you'll keep them safe
until they do, Nana.

600
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,960
Are you sure you don't want
the power to move earth,

601
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,200
call on the dead?

602
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,960
No, I'm good with just steel.

603
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,000
And I prefer being a speedster
over a water wizard.

604
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
Too old for jewelry.

605
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,000
Nana baa.

606
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,960
Unhand me, you fiend.

607
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,400
You shall pay dearly for this.

608
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,720
He saved us.

609
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,080
Beebo is our one true god.

610
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,360
The bonny ones always
be the craziest.

611
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,320
Well, I guess we'd better get
to mind wiping Mallus's three amigos.

612
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,240
Guys, you think this was crazy?
Try having a kid.

613
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Oh, no, thank you.

614
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
I bet you're damn good at it.

615
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,720
I'll be seeing you, Miss Lance.

616
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,040
Oh, you can count on it, Miss Sharpe.

617
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
Come on.

618
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
No.

619
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,560
Well, seeing as though
this is the last time

620
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,880
we'll see one another...

621
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,840
Something to remember me by.

622
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,200
Oh, your dirty hat.
That's... that's weird.

623
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
But sweet.

624
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,400
Hey, stop. I need to...

625
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,680
I need to talk to her
for, like, two seconds.

626
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,440
Alone, please.

627
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,800
I lied.
It'll be more like 20 seconds.

628
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,800
So, I found something on the ship
that was your dad's,

629
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,200
and I thought maybe you'd want
something to remember him by.

630
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,440
As I spend the rest
of my life rotting

631
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,800
in a Time Bureau prison?

632
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,480
This is my father's time stone.

633
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,760
He died to give you a second chance.

634
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Don't waste it.

635
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,600
Are you glad I picked you up
in Zambesi six months ago?

636
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,280
I think the words you used were,
"Just one more mission."

637
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,120
It's better than the line
they used on me.

638
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,880
"Come with us if you want to live."

639
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,840
I almost die every week on the ship.

640
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,200
- But you found a home.
- I did.

641
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,320
And as much fun as this has been,

642
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,400
it's time for me to go home.

643
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,240
Come on, you can't leave me
and Sara and...

644
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,960
Thanks. My pleasure.

645
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,800
You guys are my family.

646
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,080
Always will be.

647
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,960
But I have another family
waiting for me

648
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,440
in the years to come.

649
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,320
And they need me more.

650
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,440
Well, you always have a home
on the Waverider.

651
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm gonna miss you guys.

652
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,120
Is that Jonah Hex's hat?

653
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,600
- Shut up.
- Is there...

654
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,840
- I can't.
- Did they is this...

655
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,200
- Stop, please.
- I'll miss that.

656
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
<i>Zambesi 1942</i>

657
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,920
Yeah, I guess this place is all right

658
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
if you like untouched nature
and beautiful views.

659
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
I do love it here.

660
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,080
But there are a lot of things
I'm gonna miss,

661
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,960
like cheese puffs and sports bras.

662
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,160
And you, Nathaniel.

663
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,680
You aren't gonna miss
any of those things...

664
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,960
because you're not
gonna remember them.

665
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,160
I don't want to forget...

666
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,600
Because if I do,

667
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,520
I would have lost the only part
of you that I'm allowed to keep.

668
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Good bye, Amaya.

669
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,320
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

670
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,040
Don't turn around.

671
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,200
<i>Aruba 2018</i>

672
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,960
Good call, Mick.

673
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,480
When I said Aruba,
I meant me, not all of you.

674
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
Still, nothing helps
a broken heart like a good tan.

675
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
Should have invited Ava.

676
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,600
Oh, we've got plans.

677
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,360
And until then, she's busy fixing

678
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,320
all those pesky anachronisms
we left behind.

679
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, that's the thing
about defeating

680
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,360
an ancient time demon
everything else seems boring.

681
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm good with boring.

682
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,120
Hey, idiot. Get out of here.

683
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,680
This is a private beach.

684
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,880
Fancy meeting you lot out here.

685
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Constantine?

686
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,960
Did you really think I was him?

687
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
It's me.

688
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,360
Gary, Ray obviously
has been day drinking.

689
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,040
- The wig's too much, right?
- No, it's very presidential.

690
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,640
Gary, what do you want?

691
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,160
He's been with me, love.

692
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,120
Oh, I need a word with you sorry lot.

693
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Now...

694
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,000
whose brilliant idea was it
to let an ancient demon

695
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,000
out of his bloody cage?

696
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Sara's.

697
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,480
Well, you opened a door, love.

698
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,520
And Mallus wasn't the only thing
that got out.
