1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,681
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,965
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,208
To save my city.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,363
Now others have joined my crusade.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,086
To them I am Oliver Queen.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,244
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else...

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,808
...I am something else.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,530
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,125
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,247
Whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,807
- There's another bidder for the company.
- Who?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,731
Ray Palmer. Yes, I am your boss now.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,564
No!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,924
Roy, I don't trust you. Or anyone.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,329
Don't try to find me. I
am never coming back.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,925
Now I gotta go get Thea.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,088
Long past time she came home.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,764
Well done.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,570
Thanks, Dad.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,520
So where are we going?

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,921
Wherever you want.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,124
- It's up to me?
- Why not?

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,005
I'm the well-traveled man,
been every place in the world.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,362
But you wanna get out of here...

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,803
...because if the police knew
you were alive, they'd come after you.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,684
The Arrow too.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,441
You're very perceptive, Thea.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,164
Knowing when people are hiding something behind
their smiles. Your mother had that talent.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,050
Yes.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,040
If someone knew where I was,
it would be unfortunate.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,571
For both of us.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,929
So why did you reach out to me?

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,805
- You reached first.
- But still.

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,288
I don't want to feel this pain again.

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,602
I don't wanna hurt or get hurt.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,928
Never again.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,122
And you seem like someone
who can teach me how not to.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,843
A woman was killed on a rooftop
last week. Black leather, blond hair.

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,610
- Wore a mask.
- I didn't kill her.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,326
- You were there.
- I don't know anything about it.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,124
Your fingerprints are on this.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,170
- From a fifth I drank up there, but I...
- What did you see?

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,407
Nothing.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,443
I was up on the roof with some buddies.

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,325
This lady, she showed up
and she told us to go.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,602
Looked like she could handle herself.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,883
Whoever it is you're looking for,
I wouldn't wanna be him.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,970
Another dead end.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,481
It took me a week to get
a hit off that print.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,008
I had to reconstruct the partial
using a predictive indexing algorithm.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,249
Appropriate since it was his index finger.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,924
Not particularly relevant now.

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,804
Don't worry, Oliver. We'll find him.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,651
- He's out there somewhere.
- No, he's not.

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,446
Trail's gone cold.

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,927
I hate to do this but I
have to head off to work.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,005
- Tech Village is open this early?
- Not exactly.

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,126
- Have you figured out where in Italy Thea is?
- About that, she's not in Italy.

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,800
Or Europe. Or... Well, she's...

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,087
Where is she?

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,205
I had to ping her cell phone to find out
where in "ltaly" she was texting from.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,609
Turns out, came back Corto Maltese.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,206
C0rto's an island off of South America.
What's up with your family and islands?

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,803
Hey, Oliver.

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,407
- Thea's letter said not to come find her.
- That letter was addressed to you, not to me.

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,606
I'm watching Laurel
go through losing Sara.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,289
It's time for my sister to come home.

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,846
- What are you doing?
- Thea's gone because of me.

69
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,527
Because of lies I told her. I owe this
to both of you to make things right.

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,520
No. What are you doing?

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,330
You can't travel with that.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,691
I've actually never been on a plane before.

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,090
I know. You're not doing anything
and I could literally watch you forever.

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,649
Oh, yeah?
What about once she discovers boys?

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,402
Well, that's what my Glock is for.
Right, baby?

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,443
Right. That's my Glock.

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,603
I'm gonna enjoy some quality time
with her for the next few days.

78
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,161
I'm even looking forward
to changing a few diapers.

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,648
And I'm looking forward to
believing that when I see it.

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,363
Why the time off?

81
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,931
You quit the team again?

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,966
No, Oliver's going to Corto Maltese
for a couple of days.

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,003
Could you go with him?

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,204
Like I don't already spend
enough time with Oliver as it is?

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,284
Team Arrow may have
Starling City purring like a kitten...

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,041
...but the rest of the world
is still a very dangerous place.

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,921
- Including Corto Maltese.
- I already don't like where this is headed.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,006
- We have an operative there who's gone dark.
- All right, so send an agent.

89
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,646
- Send a task force.
- He's not in any kind of trouble.

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,689
He hasn't touched his panic button.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,366
He's probably just drunk
in some belleza's villa.

92
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,245
Mark Shaw has been known
to miss days from time to time.

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,001
Will you just do me a favor...

94
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,043
...and see if he's okay?

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,608
Tell him to check in. Two more days
and I have to call the cavalry...

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,406
...and I don't want him
to get into trouble with Waller.

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,921
Mark's an old friend.

98
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,411
She better not do anything
interesting while I'm gone.

99
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,330
Next time keep your hands up.

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,526
Ted Grant.

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,204
That badge means
you're not here for a self-defense class.

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,961
No, I've had my fair share. I'm here about
one of your students, Tom Bronson.

103
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,243
A witness places him
at the scene of a break-in last night.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Well, that's not possible. See, because
Tom and I were sparring last night.

105
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,366
Mr. Grant, do you know that lying to the
district attorney is against the law?

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,291
You mean am I willing to lie
in order to keep a good kid...

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,324
...who happened to make
a stupid mistake out of the system...

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,045
...I think you know my answer.

109
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,248
Are you admitting to perjury, Mr. Grant?

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,282
Now that's a big word.

111
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,164
I'm just a dumb fighter.

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,771
Right?

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,721
Look, Tom was here with me last night.
We worked on his uppercut combinations.

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,931
Like I said, in this city there's a lot
of good people who get dealt bad hands.

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,966
They lose someone, they lose themselves.
They come in here to work off that rage.

116
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,165
I've gotten good at picking out the types.
Types just like you.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
If I'm angry it's because
I'm dealing with someone...

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,122
...who's willing to lie
to protect a punk kid.

119
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,805
I don't think that's the case.

120
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,566
Either way...

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,080
...if you do have something
you wanna work off...

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,365
So, what's the play with Thea?

123
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,370
Do you mind if I talk to her
alone first? It's been a while.

124
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,526
- Felicity able to pin her down?
- She gave me an address.

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,244
Thea!

126
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,364
You must be Mia's brother.

127
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,723
- I see the resemblance.
- ls Mia around?

128
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,242
- She works at the cafe.
- Where's the cafe?

129
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,249
- I'll show you.
- Thank you.

130
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,246
I didn't come all the way to South America
to have you poison me, did I?

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,761
It's a meditative tea.

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,851
It will activate your mind and body.

133
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,365
I think I'm gonna need a little bit more
than tea to learn how to use one of those.

134
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,330
The Sohei Buddhist warriors
believed that first...

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,568
...you must fight with the mind...

136
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,450
...then your sword.

137
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,005
I remember when I was...

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,090
...training to be a warrior
I began just like you.

139
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,282
Devastated by my wife's death.

140
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,205
I was ar19FY...

141
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,726
...and hurt.

142
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,366
The pain was unbearable.

143
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,524
Like this.

144
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,487
You're out of your mind.
Put your hand in here.

145
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,889
Every warrior must learn the simple truth.

146
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,404
That pain is inevitable
and suffering is optional.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,045
Please, don't... Don't do
what I think you're gonna do.

148
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,848
You asked me to teach you.

149
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,046
No.

150
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,490
Thea?

151
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,164
Good to see you.

152
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,170
You too, but how did you...?

153
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,284
Well, it's not exactly the Amalfi Coast.

154
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,801
Didn't you flunk Spanish?

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,321
More like skipped it altogether.

156
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,327
You look good.

157
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,765
I like your haircut.

158
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,644
Thank you. Yeah.

159
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,525
Wanted it short, you know.
Gets hot down here.

160
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,845
I'm sorry I lied to you about Italy.

161
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,202
I just needed some space.

162
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,404
It's okay. You've had five months of it.

163
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,611
This isn't just a visit.

164
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,808
Got one for you too.

165
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,567
After Mom, I understood
why you left Starling.

166
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,604
But, Thea, I miss you.

167
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,087
And I would really like
it if you came home.

168
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,521
I miss you too.

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,368
And I love you.

170
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,248
So much. But I'm never
coming back to Starling City.

171
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,761
I can't. I'm sorry.

172
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,849
There is strength in you, Thea.

173
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,281
I see it, even if you
can't see it yourself.

174
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,290
I'm sorry, this...

175
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,849
This just isn't me.
I'm not like you. I can't do this.

176
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,324
It's all right.

177
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,807
It's not your fault.

178
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,450
It's mine.

179
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,929
QC stock up 1O bucks
at the open. That is love. Ha.

180
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,367
Ah, Ms. Smoak. Good morning.

181
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,244
I think. I've been here all night.

182
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,410
My predecessor left things, um...
What's the polite way to say this?

183
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,761
A little wonky.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,163
Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm a little
over-caffeinated. I just had three espressos.

185
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,044
- Speaking of coffee...
- Let me stop you.

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,971
I told myself that I would
stand firm on a few points.

187
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,447
No late-night emails. No personal errands.

188
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,527
And definitely no coffee. There'll be
no espressos brought to you by me.

189
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,966
I stand very firm on that last point.

190
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,604
And I admire your conviction.

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,326
This is Gerry Conway,
your executive assistant...

192
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,649
...and I wanted to know
if you'd like him to get you a coffee.

193
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,649
Or are you just anti-latte in general?

194
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,251
Um...

195
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,002
Executive assistant?

196
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,641
I think that's a yes on the latte.

197
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,802
- Thank you, Gerry.
- Thank you, Gerry.

198
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,930
Shall we get to work?
Excellent. Applied Sciences.

199
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,930
Bleeding edge research division
until some wacko blew it up.

200
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,203
- I'm sure they had their reasons.
- The point is...

201
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,131
...it's the cornerstone for my plan
to rebuild Queen Consolidated...

202
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,401
...and thus, the city.

203
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,361
I've had my people working day and night
salvaging what they can, including this.

204
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,365
The file server containing
Applied Sciences' design work.

205
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,127
It's not working, on account
of being caught in a massive explosion.

206
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,089
You want me to access the data.

207
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,245
Brilliant mind at work already.
Speaking of, I gotta get back to work.

208
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,920
Then why are you leaving your office?

209
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,289
I'm not. I'm leaving yours.

210
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,091
This is Lyla's busywork.
You didn't have to tag along.

211
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,363
Well, I don't know how to vacation
like a normal person, Diggle.

212
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,961
- What's the plan?
- This spot's his usual dead drop.

213
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,687
Lyla sent me over this file photo.
Just gonna make sure he's all right.

214
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,887
- Got him.
- I got you.

215
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,730
He's a friendly, Oliver.

216
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,769
Shaw.

217
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,008
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

218
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,288
Listen, I'm with Lyla Michaels.

219
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,524
Have you seen any capuchins today?

220
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,008
If that's a code, I'm not with A.R.G.U.S.
I'm just Lyla's baby daddy.

221
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,488
You didn't check in, Shaw.
She was worried so she sent me to find you.

222
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,809
You're lying, you'll be picking
your intestines off this sidewalk.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,764
That's fair enough.

224
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,166
Lyla gave me a security transcoder
in my right jacket pocket.

225
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,005
- You're prettyjumpy, Shaw.
- Better jumpy than dead.

226
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,651
Copy that. What's going on?

227
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,888
Not here.

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,051
Sorry, I had...

229
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,846
I had eyes on me all week.
A whole follow team.

230
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,526
Wait, Shaw. What makes you so important?

231
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,404
I have hard intel.

232
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,321
Someone hacked into the server,
acquired the A.R.G.U.S. Actual.

233
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,046
- They wanna sell it.
- I don't work for A.R.G.U.S.

234
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,208
The Actual is an encrypted data omnibus.

235
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,529
It's a complete record
of agent covers, personal details...

236
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,610
...affiliated soft targets.
Whoa, soft targets.

237
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,006
As in family members?

238
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,567
Yeah, as in women and children.

239
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,366
You get why this is so important?

240
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,608
Hi, my name is Laurel. I'm an alcoholic.

241
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,450
Hi, Laurel.

242
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,881
A week ago l...

243
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,042
Something happened.

244
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,487
Something that I can't
share with anyone for...

245
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,206
...several complicated reasons.

246
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,842
I thought that I was gonna want a drink.

247
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,040
But I didn't.

248
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,766
Not even tempted, really.

249
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,725
But what I am is...

250
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,086
...I'm afigrY-

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,810
And I don't know what to do with it...

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,604
...or where to put it, I just...

253
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,208
Thank you for letting me share.

254
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,211
Are there any other burning desires?

255
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,402
- Erica. Alcoholic.
- Hi, Erica.

256
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,645
My boyfriend and me
got into another fight last night.

257
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,168
Some of you know he still drinks a lot...

258
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,567
...and I said something.

259
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,490
I know I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

260
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,761
I know I should just leave him, but...

261
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,849
...I can't.

262
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,689
Maybe there's a meeting
I should be going to for that.

263
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,247
Once a month Erica gives a share like that.

264
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,805
- It's getting worse.
- Yeah.

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,606
The boyfriend has eight assault
charges against him.

266
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,043
Not just Starling. He's got warrants
out on him as far as Coast City.

267
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,766
It takes everything in me
not to go after the dirt bag.

268
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,924
The day the cops start bringing
their badges into AA meetings...

269
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,566
...that's the day that
the drunks stop coming.

270
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,247
I'm in position.

271
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,046
That sale of the Actual is going down here.

272
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,767
Only two of us?
You sure you don't wanna call for back-up?

273
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,166
H9)'-

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,846
That's the only insurance policy
you're gonna need.

275
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,287
We're here.

276
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,607
You're not worried
about them seeing our ride?

277
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,762
How'd you know the buy
was happening tonight?

278
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,561
I've been the station agent
in Corto Maltese for three years now.

279
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,081
I got this third-world garbage dump wired.

280
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,570
What's wrong?

281
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,769
There's no buy, is there, Shaw?

282
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,964
Oliver, go! Go!

283
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,370
Sorry for lying to you, John.

284
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,281
Well, partially lying. There is a buy
going down, just not until tomorrow.

285
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,811
I needed to get this first.

286
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,082
Thanks for helping me decode the Actual.

287
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,361
Diggle!

288
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,040
Should have got the heavy-duty ones.

289
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,884
I like your hair.

290
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,845
What, are you and my brother,
like, travel buddies now?

291
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,801
No, we're just worried about you.

292
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,606
Oliver said you weren't
gonna come back, so...

293
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,167
...I figured I'd come here
and try to convince you.

294
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,567
- Well, you can't.
- Look, I get it. You're hurt.

295
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,442
I lied to you. I lied right to your face.
But I need you to know...

296
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,122
...that when I said I wanted to leave
Starling with you, that wasn't a lie.

297
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,802
I didn't just leave because of you, Roy.

298
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,806
My mother lied to me. My brother.

299
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,690
I had to get away from
Starling City and all the secrets.

300
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,286
And I found myself here.

301
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,447
Isn't it lonely here?

302
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,406
That's kind of what I like about it.

303
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,206
There's no one here who knows me...

304
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,724
...or thinks of me
as Thea Queen or Thea Merlyn.

305
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,240
No one who lies to me or...

306
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,488
...tries to protect me with secrets.

307
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,287
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Thea.

308
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,881
I'm sorry I got in the way of that...

309
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,367
...and I'm sorry that I hurt you.

310
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,125
If being here instead of home
makes you happy...

311
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,526
...then you should stay.

312
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,524
Roy?

313
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,728
Are you okay?

314
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,203
You look a little tired.

315
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,083
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.

316
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,969
You take care.

317
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,208
But what do you mean?

318
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,210
It's not your fault, it's mine.

319
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,251
I thought I could do this
differently, but I can't.

320
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,689
I need to train you as I was trained.

321
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,091
Treat you as my student,
not my daughter.

322
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,848
What are you doing?

323
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,447
The way to forge steel
is to temper it with fire.

324
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,041
Stay away from me, you sick son of a bitch.

325
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,487
Now we can begin.

326
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,047
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I could've helped.

327
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,766
Didn't want you to worry.
I thought we could handle it.

328
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,248
We've hacked his email.
He's got a buyer en route to Con'o Maltese.

329
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,801
- Who?
- The tech boys are still working on that.

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,048
But Wailer's dispatched a wet team.

331
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,211
- They're not gonna get here in time.
- They might. Keep your powder dry.

332
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,885
Copy that.

333
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,123
- We're not gonna keep our powder dry.
- Hell, no.

334
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,088
Hey. Any luck raising
our digital Lazarus from the dead?

335
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,770
The hard drive is toast.

336
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,365
And the power supply.

337
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,121
- And the actuator.
- I'm sensing a pattern.

338
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,002
Sorry. One second.

339
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,043
- Hello?
- Hey, Felicity. This is John.

340
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,084
- Where are you?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

341
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,805
- You near a computer?
- Kind of.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,607
- I'm looking for somebody in Corto Maltese.
- I'm in the middle of a...

343
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,371
I need to know where he is.
I've emailed you everything.

344
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,562
Meeting right now.

345
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,842
I am so sorry. It's a friend.

346
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,963
Um, well, a few friends...

347
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,249
...actually. You know what?
It's a long story.

348
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,570
Heh. Why am I under the impression that you
have a lot of stories, all of which are long?

349
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,123
- You want me to come back later?
- What? Sorry.

350
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,641
- Hello?
- Felicity, I need a favor.

351
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,043
Are we favor-friends now?
Are we friends?

352
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,287
- What?
- Never mind. Sorry.

353
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,445
Oh, dear God. One second.
One more second. Hello?

354
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,761
We got cut off.

355
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,964
According to the file you sent me,
this guy is a hacker.

356
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,288
Let me guess. Long story?

357
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,648
The guy I'm looking for
broke into A.R.G.U.S.

358
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,083
He left a trail. It's faint, hacking-wise,
but with a bit of luck...

359
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,564
...I will find him. Or his laptop.
I will email you when I have something.

360
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,005
I'm having a bit of a day.

361
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,527
I need you to find someone
by Googling his phone.

362
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,449
Pinging his GPS.

363
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,491
- Can I call you back?
- Is this what a typical day looks like for you?

364
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,127
Believe it or not,
this is better than most.

365
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,483
When Felicity has Shaw's location,
text me and I'll be there.

366
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,245
- Thea?
- Yeah.

367
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,727
I don't think she's gonna
change her mind on this.

368
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,323
She doesn't wanna hear from anyone and I
don't blame her. We both lied to her, a lot.

369
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,848
- It's why it's time to tell her the truth.
- When you say the truth...

370
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,284
What happened the five years I was away.
Everything we've done since I've been back.

371
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,801
- All of it.
- You might wanna think about that.

372
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,243
Lies are what drove Thea away
from Starling City. The truth...

373
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,365
...is the only thing that will bring her back.
- You won't be telling her the truth.

374
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,007
You'll be telling her that her brother
has been lying to her to her face...

375
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,090
...with almost pathological sincerity
for the past two years.

376
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,569
She won't believe another word you say,
and you will lose her, Oliver, forever.

377
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,722
Oh, look around.

378
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,323
I've already lost her.

379
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,527
I don't have any other choice.

380
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,209
I hear you like to hit women.
How about one who likes to hit back?

381
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,968
You're right. It's better
when they hit back.

382
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,484
On. Baby.

383
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,842
Baby. Baby, you okay?

384
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,407
I'm so sorry.

385
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,207
I'm too relieved to be mad at you.
I really am.

386
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,043
But, sweetheart...

387
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,250
...this is crazy.

388
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,887
What the hell were you thinking
going after that girl's boyfriend?

389
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,321
There's just something
I needed to work out.

390
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,442
I know that the world isn't fair.

391
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,008
I know that it's a terrible place...

392
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,164
...where people deserve to get punished...

393
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,648
...and they don't. I just...

394
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,925
For one night,
I needed the world to be different.

395
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,088
Okay, Laurel.

396
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,403
Laurel,
what's going on with you, huh?

397
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,807
You're not being yourself lately.

398
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,447
Now you're running around, you're
tuning this guy up. What are you doing?

399
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,166
Baby, you could talk to me about anything,
you know that, right? You know it.

400
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,724
I know.

401
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,804
Talk to me then.

402
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,366
Laurel, you're not the Arrow.

403
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,005
Or your sister.

404
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,771
Promise me you'll never
do anything like this again, ever.

405
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,529
Promise.

406
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,802
It was a mistake. I wasn't thinking.

407
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,731
You wanna stay in Corto Maltese, fine,
but there's not much here in sightseeing.

408
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,365
May I talk to you?

409
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,921
Look, between you
and your new best friend Roy...

410
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,727
...I'm pretty sure you guys have said everything.
- I haven't.

411
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,127
Not yet, anyway.

412
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,724
Roy showed me the note you left him.

413
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,686
And you were right about everything.
I've lied. I have kept secrets.

414
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,531
The truth is that if I tell you...

415
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,166
...all the things that you
don't know about me...

416
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,409
...then I might lose you forever.

417
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,443
I spent five years...

418
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,168
...in the worst kind of hell
and there were things that happened...

419
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
...there were things that I did...

420
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,410
...that if...

421
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,685
If you knew, you would see me differently.

422
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,362
No, I'll always see you as my big brother.

423
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,202
I mean, no matter
what happened to you on that island...

424
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,323
...or who you became.

425
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,321
It's the secrets you
kept about my own life.

426
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,045
I mean, you...

427
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,642
You lied to me about who my father was.

428
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,686
Malcolm may have been your blood.

429
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,850
Robert was your father.

430
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,808
I lied to you about him too.

431
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,963
Dad wasn't the man we thought he was.

432
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,968
He was better.

433
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,402
And I've kept something
from you because I just...

434
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,804
I never wanted you to know.

435
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,248
Dad made it off the Gambit with me.

436
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,569
You told me he drowned.

437
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,204
We made it to a lifeboat together...

438
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,244
...but there wasn't enough
food or water for both of us...

439
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,486
...so he killed himself.

440
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,122
And that is one secret
that I'm telling you now...

441
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,290
...because I need you to realize...

442
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,571
...Mom and Dad...

443
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,206
...they sacrificed themselves...

444
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,368
...so that we could live.

445
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,165
But if we're not together, then...

446
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,567
...we're not even really alive.

447
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,808
You are my family...

448
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,929
...and even if you don't need me...

449
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,810
...I need you.

450
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,489
Please just consider what I'm saying.

451
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,051
- He's here.
- And so is his buyer.

452
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,764
I was expecting Armitage.

453
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,970
This country's soil
is not worthy of Mr. Armitage.

454
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,605
Do you have the item?

455
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,011
Where's the money?

456
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,486
And the transcoder?

457
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,290
We better go.

458
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,600
Where'd you get this?

459
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,091
Our hotel room.

460
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,123
Who are they?

461
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,129
Could be A.R.G.U.S.

462
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,044
That's not A.R.G.U.S.

463
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,050
Let's go.

464
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,400
Go.

465
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,083
A.R.G.U.S., they know we're here.

466
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,045
Which is why I got rented soldiers
to secure the perimeter.

467
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,368
It's amazing how cheap you can buy an army.

468
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,241
Diggle!

469
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,771
Behind you.

470
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,807
I never said I didn't
know how to use a gun.

471
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,281
Lyla was your friend and
you endanger her and her daughter for what?

472
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,847
- For a lousy payday?
- Not a payday.

473
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,202
- It's my ticket out.
- Of what?

474
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,371
A.R.G.U.S.! You don't know
the things Wailer's made me do.

475
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,490
You don't know the things
or the person she turns you into.

476
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,480
That still gives you no right
to put a bull's-eye on my family's back.

477
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,682
I had no choice.

478
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,008
But you do, John.

479
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,962
Tell Waller I died.
Tell her you put a bullet in me.

480
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,360
If only.

481
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,162
I've been thinking.
I wanna go home...

482
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,044
...to my brother.

483
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,211
And all his lies and secrets?
Maybe you haven't come as far as I thought.

484
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,801
Let me prove it to you.

485
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,005
Impressive.

486
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,366
I had a good teacher.

487
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,251
Looks like you're going home.

488
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,449
You let me win, didn't you?

489
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,482
I'll be seeing you soon.

490
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,609
Safe flight.

491
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,324
- Thank you.
- Yup.

492
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,170
Thanks.

493
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,961
You Okay?

494
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,690
She's not coming.

495
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,760
I'm sorry, Oliver.
You did everything you could, man.

496
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,171
Oliver.

497
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,167
I'm glad you changed your mind.

498
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,562
Still not sure about
flying commercial though.

499
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,525
Oh. I'm so sorry.

500
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,805
Thea, are you okay?

501
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,447
Yeah, I'm fine.

502
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,924
Laurel?

503
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,449
- I didn't know the Arrow took vacations.
- Hey. What happened?

504
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,011
I'm fine. Please.

505
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,526
What happened?

506
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,483
I tried to do good. It didn't work out.

507
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,841
Laurel.

508
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,931
I know that it probably sounds insane.

509
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,248
It probably is, but...

510
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,444
Sara.

511
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,764
She gave me this.

512
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,402
And when I wear it, it makes me
wanna help people like she did.

513
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,248
Like she's alive again.

514
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,885
I get it.

515
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,681
Sara had training.

516
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,248
- She had years...
- Oliver, I know.

517
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,051
Which is why I need to start.

518
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,651
And I need your help.

519
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,605
L...

520
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,530
No.

521
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,685
- Oliver.
- No.

522
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,529
No.

523
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,165
L...

524
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,966
I want you to consider...

525
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,367
...what would happen to your father...

526
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,484
...if something happened to you.

527
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,726
Oliver, ever since it happened
I have had this fire inside of me.

528
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,844
That I can't get rid of
with booze or pills.

529
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,883
I need another way.

530
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,765
And the other night,
even though it went wrong...

531
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,282
...it was the first time since Sara died
where I haven't felt that fire.

532
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,761
I'm sorry but I can't.

533
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,281
And even if I could...

534
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,363
...Sara would never forgive me.

535
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,530
There we go, yeah.

536
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,929
There we go.

537
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,763
Yeah.

538
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,330
- Hey.
- I love you.

539
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,882
I love you both. The two of you
were all I could think about.

540
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,410
I'm just trying to put her down.

541
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,046
That's okay. I just wanna
look at her for a while.

542
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,248
Okay.

543
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,129
- I have to head into the office.
- Why so late?

544
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,130
I do whatever Amanda Waller asks, remember?

545
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,969
You Okay?

546
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,408
Yeah, just hurry back.

547
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,127
What's with this guy?

548
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,005
Outstanding warrants for
assault and battery in Coast City.

549
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,931
Got an anonymous tip
that he was in Starling.

550
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,122
Anonymous tip, huh?

551
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,771
That's a bad break, buddy.

552
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,168
All right. When can I start?

553
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,365
Do you know how many of QC's techs
said this data was unrecoverable?

554
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,369
Only all of them.

555
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,885
Seems like this would be a good time
to ask for a few days off then.

556
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,048
- You just started.
- I know.

557
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,722
But my friend was struck by lightning
and is in a coma, so...

558
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,684
Well, was.

559
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,930
I don't know. Um...

560
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,963
- it's...
- A long story.

561
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,284
- See you.
- Thanks.

562
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,408
You did good over there.

563
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,045
I had a good teacher.

564
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,046
Ajudgmental and occasionally
temperamental one, but...

565
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,488
Those are the best kind.

566
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,530
Did Thea seem different to you?

567
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,802
Her hair is a lot shorter.

568
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
But that's not what you mean.

569
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,090
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

570
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,010
She say anything? She maybe...

571
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,441
...seeing somebody in Corto Maltese or...

572
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,571
If Thea was with anybody else, I've got
a feeling I'd be the last one to know.

573
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,561
Where is she?

574
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,046
Where is Sara?
