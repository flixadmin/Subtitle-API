something's down here.

in the ice.

477
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:21,959
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

478
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:25,434
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

479
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:28,171
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

480
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:29,945
that are highly destructive
to our planet.

481
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,736
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

482
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:35,511
before we realized
what we were doing.

483
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:39,010
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

484
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:42,716
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

485
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,727
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

486
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,422
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

487
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:49,386
We think he's been
launching secret raids

488
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,292
for at least five months.

489
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:52,828
This is just the time
he got caught.

490
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,427
Well, this spike
in global temperatures

491
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:56,259
that's causing disasters
on the surface

492
00:35:56,395 --> 00:36:01,131
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

493
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:04,769
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

494
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:08,624
Why would he do that?

495
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,665
[Aquaman] I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

496
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,101
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,

497
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,322
we don't have much time.

498
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,264
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

499
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:20,888
He must be stopped or a
global climate meltdown is imminent.

500
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:21,852
[Nereus] We need to find him,

501
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:23,898
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

502
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:26,522
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

503
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,166
But you're not gonna like it.

504
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,098
Your brother?

505
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,514
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

506
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,265
but he's dealt with Manta
in the past,

507
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,684
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

508
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:42,373
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

509
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:44,512
He killed their king.

510
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:46,879
I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

511
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:51,448
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

512
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,950
It would be an act of war.

513
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,986
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

514
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,861
I'm gonna break him out myself.

515
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:03,556
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason
to seize war powers.

516
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:06,369
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

517
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,876
[Aquaman] My place is out there
where I belong,

518
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,340
where I'm actually good
at what I do.

519
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,704
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

520
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,904
I've got to do this.

521
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:18,775
[Nereus] If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

522
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:21,351
it will tear
the kingdoms apart.

523
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:25,554
Then help me not get caught.

(Air Hissing)

802
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:16,758
Okay! Okay!
We can work this out. We can.

803
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:18,187
Talk.

804
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:20,759
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

805
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:23,394
A dormant volcano
in the South Pacific,

806
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,368
called "Devil's Deep."

807
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:27,102
Talk faster.

808
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:28,570
It's been barren for years.

809
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:30,730
But travelers say
there's a jungle there now.

810
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:33,542
Navigation gets scrambled
as soon as you start to get close.

811
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,544
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

812
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:39,579
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

813
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,982
I'd say that's where Kane
is hiding out.

(Explosions)

815

[Ghostly Voice] Soon you'll be

821
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:13,271
But you're not ready yet,

822
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:16,151
and you involved him
far too soon.

823
00:56:16,287 --> 00:56:18,780
I sense them closing in on us.

824
00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:20,588
[David] Do I seem concerned?

825
00:56:21,155 --> 00:56:22,390
Hmm?

826
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:25,418
If anything,
it's even easier now.

827

We couldn't have planned it
any better than...

828
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,005
[Dr. Shin] Oh. Oh.

829
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,873
Hey.
(Nervous Chuckle)

830
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:40,835
Uh, I... I just wanted to tell you
that the orichalcum furnace

831

[Orm] Reinforcements?

844
00:57:55,918 --> 00:57:58,119

You gotta admit, the food

I find that hard to believe.

Hold up.

You telling me you never went topside
to have a cheeseburger?

850
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:10,289
What?
Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

851
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:12,765
Or a thick, juicy,
medium raw steak

852
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,500
with fries and a shake,
and you dip it...

Even the words that surface-dwellers
give their food

854

sound disgusting.

855

You've let your prejudices stop you

It's a cockroach.

Definitely not normal. Ugh.

You see how dangerous

I'm not used to running.

Just do what I do.

Use your arms, use your legs.
Lift them up.

all the time.

is really disturbing.

Here it is.

I'm gonna kill Aquaman and
destroy everything he holds dear.

I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:16,147
I will avenge my father.

We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

952
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,716
[Orm] We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

953
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,677
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

954
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:13,457
[Aquaman] Yeah. Look, Loki,
I'm not asking for your advice on this.

955
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:15,361
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

956
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,818
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

957
01:06:17,953 --> 01:06:19,553
[Orm] So, what's your plan?

958
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,567
[Aquaman] I don't have one, yet.
But he came after my wife,

959
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:23,953
which means I'm gonna pull his tongue
out of his butt.

960
01:06:24,088 --> 01:06:26,726
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot let this get personal.

961
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:29,687
This coming from the guy who
turned the entire nation of Atlantis

962
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:31,431
into his own private ego trip?

963
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,693
My ego?

964
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:34,377
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

965
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:35,921
and challenged my claim
for the throne.

966
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,877
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

967
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:40,970
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

968
01:06:41,106 --> 01:06:42,577
Unbelievable.

969
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:43,871
Wait, wait! Wait!

970
01:06:44,006 --> 01:06:46,014
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

971
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:48,573
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

972
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:51,589
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

973
01:06:51,683 --> 01:06:53,317
And I might even be
screwing that up.

974
01:06:53,452 --> 01:06:54,772
You really
had no ambition for it?

975
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:56,324
Absolutely not.

976
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:58,391
From the day my father found out
you existed,

977
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:00,303
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

978
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:01,629
and challenge me
for the throne.

979
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:03,155
Wow, that's really sad.

980
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:04,639
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

981

whatsoever.

That is not how it happened.

That's exactly how it happened.
Mera saved you.

985
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,609
[Aquaman] No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

986
01:07:14,744 --> 01:07:16,684
[Orm] Nope. She made
the little water tornado. I fell in it.

987
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,468
[Aquaman] Okay, shut up.

01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:31,369
[Aquaman] Once this is over with,

993
01:07:31,393 --> 01:07:32,766
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

994

[Orm] Don't push it.
Tacos and tequila.

They're just burning it up.

[Aquaman] He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

1011
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:00,547
[Orm] This is catastrophic.

1012
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:03,074
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

1013

from the surface's
thermal satellites.

1014

Question is,
how do we stop 'em?

1015
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:08,420
To take out this reactor,

1016
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:10,196
we would have to crater
the entire island.

Get away from there! Now!

1018

This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

1020
01:09:26,877 --> 01:09:29,706
I just didn't want you to break me in half
before I could surrender.

Please take me with you.

No, no. Wait, please.

I didn't want any of this.

All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

1027

I've done things
I'm not proud of.

But he would've killed me
if I hadn't.

Knock him out.

No.

1036
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,384

[Aquaman] I'm sorry

1124
01:19:31,947 --> 01:19:34,293
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

1125
01:19:34,446 --> 01:19:37,116
[Nereus] Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel.

Something happened to me.

01:19:45,873 --> 01:19:48,285
When I touched
that black trident.

1132
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:50,292
Why is he even here?

1133
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:52,496
He should be
on his way back to prison.

1134
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:54,193
We should hear
what he has to say.

1135
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,878
I made that mistake once.

1136
01:19:56,185 --> 01:19:58,031
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

1137
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:01,304
And he cut off my claw.

1138
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:03,977
This thing took a whole year
to grow back.

1139
01:20:04,112 --> 01:20:06,578
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

1140
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,181
And just for the record,

1141
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:10,610
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

1142
01:20:12,852 --> 01:20:14,350
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

1143
01:20:15,347 --> 01:20:17,989
(Waves Crashing)

1144
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:20,725
Mom, I don't know enough
about this.

1145
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,561
Is that even possible?

1146
01:20:22,696 --> 01:20:25,724
All anyone knows for sure is there once
was a seventh kingdom

1147
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,598
and then one day,
just before the fall,

1148
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:31,698
every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

1149
01:20:31,834 --> 01:20:34,470
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

1150
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:37,708
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

1151
01:20:37,844 --> 01:20:39,408
It's called Necrus.

1152
01:20:40,276 --> 01:20:42,114
And I didn't just see it.

1153
01:20:43,419 --> 01:20:44,419
I knew it.

1154
01:20:45,648 --> 01:20:49,352
It's almost like I was...
remembering it.

Flashes
of someone else's memories.

1156

During King Atlan's time,

1157
01:20:56,661 --> 01:21:01,001
there were seven united kingdoms
of Atlantis.

1158
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:05,203
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

1159
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,477
<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

1160

<i>Necrus rapidly became</i>

1161
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,818
But it came
at a terrible price.
