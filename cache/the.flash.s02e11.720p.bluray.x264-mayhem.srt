1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,966
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,010
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,888
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,062
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,644
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,031
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,326
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,532
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,447
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,537
I stabbed your mother
in the heart. And I was free.

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,786
Eddie's his ancestor.
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.

12
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,625
He's being erased from existence!

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,752
- Gideon.
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:40,924
Where the hell am I?

15
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,094
I was accepted into the forensic science
program at Midway City University.

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,379
I'm leaving Central City.

17
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,843
Joe, you have a son.

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,765
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,768
These races, that's the only way that
I can pay for my mom's hospital bills.

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,679
Jesse's my daughter and Zoom has her.

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,224
Daddy! Please help me.
Don't let him take me back.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,101
I would do anything to get you back.

23
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,072
There are many reasons why we run.

24
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,656
But, usually, it's to avoid
what's right in front of us,

25
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,117
a decision to be made,
or a dilemma we have to face.

26
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,955
Lately, for me, it feels like
running is all I've been doing.

27
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,749
What you got for me, Cisco?

28
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,835
You've been playing Good Samaritan
all morning. Take a break.

29
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,172
Are you sure you don't wanna
get to CCPD, give Patty your attention?

30
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,460
No, I can see her later.

31
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,216
'Cause we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

32
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,472
What, 'cause we just been
sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,303
I don't know what you've been sipping
since I got here,

34
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,181
but Barry needs to get
better, stronger, faster.

35
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,891
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

36
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,898
Oh, I see.
You haven't had your coffee this morning.

37
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,650
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

38
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,821
Don't. Don't. Don't.

39
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,445
Runaway chemical transport truck
heading south on Kester.

40
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,737
On it.

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,427
Hey, uh... I can't stop the truck!
Somebody rigged it.

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,100
Sorry!

43
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,020
You can't let that truck crash. If you do,
you'll take out a whole city block.

44
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,181
Great. Thank you. Thank you for that.

45
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,353
That was close. That was close.

46
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,027
Oh, and the plot thickens.

47
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,534
Dead end dump ahead.
You gotta get out of there.

48
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,818
Oh, come on.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,821
Yes!

50
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,845
That one was a little close.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,270
Nice.
Now can you please, please take a break?

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,057
- How's that for training?
- Great.

53
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,813
Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

54
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,478
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

55
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,405
All we got to do is use him to figure
out how to steal Zoom's speed

56
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,566
And then we'll get your daughter back.

57
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,867
That might take longer than we thought.

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,152
Why is that?

59
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,117
Because Turtle's dead.

60
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,247
Barry, we need you back here. Stat.

61
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,832
All right. I'm on my way.

62
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,675
Gideon.

63
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,882
Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne?

64
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,879
I believe it was.

65
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,891
I've finally figured out
what time period The Flash is from.

66
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,556
Now let's figure out a way to get home.

67
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,770
He better not be pulling a Juliet.

68
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,697
Yeah, that's right. I see plays.

69
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,323
He's dead, Cisco.

70
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,734
How'd this happen?

71
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,240
Preliminary brain scan shows
an acute brain aneurysm.

72
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,702
The night we captured him.
How's that for timing?

73
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,618
What does that mean?
You think I did this, Garrick?

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,379
This man is the key to us stopping Zoom.
The key to me saving my daughter.

75
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,748
Why would I want that?

76
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,004
Never understood why you
do anything, Harrison.

77
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,885
That's fine with me, Garrick.

78
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,263
Guys, look.

79
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,304
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.
Everything we've tried so far has failed.

80
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,310
We need to start thinking outside the box.

81
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,642
I mean, we haven't even figured out
how to close the breaches yet.

82
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,896
Maybe that's where we should start.

83
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,691
That's a good idea.
I'll get on that.

84
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,651
L'll help.

85
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,780
I've gotta get to the CCPD.
I'll check in with you guys later.

86
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,110
Okay.

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,902
Every time
you think that Wells is on your team,

88
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,788
something happens that makes you doubt it.

89
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,293
Hey. I just wanted to see
if you could run this trace for me.

90
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,579
Someone messed with
an ethanol transport truck this morning.

91
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,374
They cut the brake line
and tampered with the gear shafts.

92
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,417
Okay. Yeah.

93
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,972
Okay. Wow. You're backed up, huh?

94
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,799
Iam, yeah.

95
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,228
Yeah. I guess I'll find out
what that's like once I finish CSI School.

96
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,856
- Yeah. You will. I guess.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,276
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset,

98
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,070
but I was hoping it wouldn't
be like this between us.

99
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,072
What did you think it was gonna be like?

100
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,201
I just thought we could
at least talk before I left.

101
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,490
You're moving.

102
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,665
I don't know. I mean, it just

103
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,621
doesn't feel like
there's much to talk about now, right?

104
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,540
I guess not.

105
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,460
Hey.

106
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,634
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,765
I sort of overheard some of that.

108
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,021
Mmm-hmm. Um...

109
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,025
Patty's going to CSI school,
in Midway City.

110
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,810
She is moving in two days.

111
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,025
I mean, you don't have to let her leave.

112
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,236
She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life.
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

113
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,234
Hey.

114
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,655
What's wrong?

115
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,866
Just went to see Francine and, uh...

116
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,035
She doesn't have much time.

117
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,921
I already said my goodbyes,
if you want to do the same.

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,301
It's not gonna work.

119
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,521
They're closing the breaches,
that's like solving Einstein's riddle.

120
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,899
Yeah.
I solved Einstein's riddle when I was 10.

121
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,644
Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein
wasn't as clever as ours.

122
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,858
You realize this earth
is my Earth-2, right?

123
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
Listen to this.

124
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,946
What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

125
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,114
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

126
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,408
That's a good idea.
You should get on that.

127
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,201
I need your help, Harry.

128
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,960
What you need, Ramon, is to
figure out what triggers your vibes.

129
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,874
Exactly.
And I don't know what triggers them,

130
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,049
It's completely inconsistent.

131
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,218
Sometimes it's when I touch
something that belongs to a breacher,

132
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,719
Sometimes it just happens.

133
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,516
There's always a cause. Cause, effect.
Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out.

134
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,517
Okay, so what is the cause?

135
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,771
You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light,
when I tried to vibe you.

136
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,518
It took a while to work.

137
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,191
Yes. Yes, it did.

138
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,026
Meet me in the Time Vault.

139
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,529
For what?

140
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,116
Hello?

141
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,536
Hello?

142
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,415
Harry?

143
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
Of course.

144
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,468
Now he's gonna make me wait
in this freaky-ass Braille room.

145
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,312
Hi, Cisco.

146
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,228
Stop! Don't do that!

147
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,107
I figured out your trigger.

148
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,655
The rush of adrenaline.

149
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,076
Dopamine floods the brain.

150
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,457
And the quickest way
to achieve that result...

151
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,994
Fear!

152
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,914
Do not move!

153
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,965
You can't be.

154
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,350
What did you see?

155
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,145
Reverse-Flash.

156
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,060
He's here.

157
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,912
Oh, my God!

158
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,163
Christina McGee.

159
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,669
Who are you?

160
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,962
You're coming with me.

161
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,006
Flash!

162
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
Eobard Thawne.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,252
You know who I am?

164
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,711
You died!

165
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,637
Good to know.

166
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,343
And guess what, Flash?
I know what time period you're from.

167
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:17,141
So that means, very soon, you will die.

168
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,028
No.

169
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,868
You okay, Barr?

170
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,408
I'm good. Yeah, it's just a lot.

171
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,535
Eddie Thawne died,

172
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,048
so Eobard Thawne should've
been erased out of existence, right?

173
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,549
Not necessarily.

174
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,336
It is possible
Eobard was in the Speed Force,

175
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,724
protecting him like a bomb shelter,
keeping him alive and his time line intact.

176
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,680
It's what's known as a "timeline remnant."

177
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,177
A... A what now?

178
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,722
Here, let me... show you.

179
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:02,270
This, this is now.

180
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,445
Here. Today.

181
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,403
This is the time Thawne comes from.

182
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,995
This is the moment
you all erased him from existence,

183
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,409
but since Thawne is from the future,
this is where his timeline begins.

184
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,043
That's why he's still alive.

185
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,630
This Thawne has not yet traveled
back in time to kill Barry's mother,

186
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,087
he's here, now,
in this time period, for the first time,

187
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,376
timeline remnant.

188
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,923
Explains why nothing's changed.

189
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,222
Yeah, it also explains why
he didn't know my name

190
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,549
Or that we have met before.

191
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,342
To him, you hadn't. Not until the future.

192
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,013
If Thawne dies
before he can time travel again,

193
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,931
will that save Barry's mother?

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,938
No. That's not how it works.

195
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,318
In her timeline,
Barry's mother's already dead,

196
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,946
and her death is a fixed point.
Nothing can change that.

197
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,818
All right, well, I'm gonna end this.
Him. In this time, once and for all.

198
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,158
Let's find Dr. McGee, then we'll
figure out what to do about Thawne.

199
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,488
Okay?

200
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,574
I gotta go check on Iris.

201
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,327
Ramon.

202
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,792
Caitlin, I know you're worried
about Dr. McGee,

203
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,255
but we're gonna get her back.

204
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,508
It's not that. It's Jay.

205
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,839
- What about Jay?
- He's sick.

206
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,974
And it's getting worse.

207
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,851
When Zoom stole his speed,
it affected him on a cellular level.

208
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,103
We need to do something about it.

209
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,474
All right. Like what?

210
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,149
I think we should replace
his dying cells with healthy ones,

211
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,689
indistinguishable from his.

212
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,865
How do we do that?

213
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,284
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

214
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,321
There.

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,372
Tachyons?

216
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,500
A man in a yellow suit tried to
steal another tachyon prototype last year.

217
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,790
I must have gotten stuck here once before

218
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,379
and not been able to access
enough of the Speed Force.

219
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,673
Tachyons should do it.

220
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,757
I want you to isolate and accelerate
their energetic properties for me.

221
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,345
I don't know if I can do that.

222
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,560
If you want to stay alive, learn.

223
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,071
Franny...

224
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,240
Hey.

225
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,741
How you feeling today?

226
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,039
Better now.

227
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,586
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

228
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay.

229
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,506
Hey.

230
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,094
Can I get you anything?

231
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,972
Oh, just that brother of yours,

232
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,892
so all of us
can be together for the first time.

233
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,186
Yeah, he should be here.

234
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,446
Well, his mother's leaving him.

235
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,530
Can't blame him
for being angry about that.

236
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,864
I just wish he'd get all that anger out
while I'm here to help.

237
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

238
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:11,049
One thing you learn when you're dying
is not to hold anything back.

239
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:18,765
You want to say something to me,
you need to say it while you can.

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,894
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

241
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,819
Now, when I think about those memories,
I can only wonder

242
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,610
what it would've been like
if you and Wally would've been there.

243
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,325
I'm not angry at you anymore
for what happened.

244
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,754
I just wish
you would've come back to us a lot sooner,

245
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,091
because I would have forgiven you then,
just like I'm forgiving you now.

246
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,797
Mmm...

247
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,056
Thank you.

248
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,342
Thank you.

249
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,867
I don't know why this is so hard.
I barely even know her.

250
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,547
The facial recognition software
at S.T.A.R. Labs

251
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,002
didn't find anything either.

252
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,133
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

253
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,509
We'll find his doppelganger.

254
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:38,670
- Thanks, Barry.
- Yeah.

255
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,962
Hey.

256
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,547
Hi, Caitlin.

257
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,840
Hi.

258
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,930
Uh, can we talk?

259
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,811
Uh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.

260
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,846
Um, I'll let you know what I find.

261
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,310
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

262
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,058
What's up?

263
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,816
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

264
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:02,319
Yeah... Um, yeah, Joe and I
help out every once in a while.

265
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
Really?

266
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,787
Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but there's a lot of weird stuff

267
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,417
that happens over there.

268
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
Is that what you came to tell me?

269
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,838
Um...

270
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,515
You're just rolling
with the whole me-leaving thing.

271
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,885
Yeah, I mean...
I don't know what to tell you, Patty.

272
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,931
Everyone in my life that I love
leaves at some point.

273
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,515
Kind of getting used to it.

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,853
You never told me you love me.

275
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,902
Yeah. I guess I don't get that chance now.

276
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,946
I don't understand. What is it?
What's going on with you?

277
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,622
Why are you being like this?

278
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,668
My life... It's complicated.
And I don't want you to have regrets.

279
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,297
I don't want you to miss out on something
that you've always wanted to do, and...

280
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,886
I wish that things were different
for both of us.

281
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,137
You know, but they're not. Sorry.

282
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,721
Me, too.

283
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,534
So, what did you do to my goggles?

284
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,827
I added a wavelength trigger to stimulate
the fear receptors in your brain.

285
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,459
And then, I took what you already had
to induce slow-wave sleep,

286
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,170
upgraded it to get you
to stage four sleep.

287
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,464
Now, this is good,
this will give us more control.

288
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,753
- Okay.
- Now, I'll be able

289
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,342
to dictate how
long you vibe for.

290
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,423
Put 'em on.

291
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:48,925
What am I gonna see?

292
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,014
I don't know. Never done this before.

293
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,600
You'll have to tell me
so I can steer you where you need to be.

294
00:16:55,598 --> 00:17:00,695
Ramon, if you want to find Reverse-Flash,
put on the goggles.

295
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

296
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,365
Atta boy.

297
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,155
Go ahead.

298
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,051
Oh, yeah, man.
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

299
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,424
What do you see?

300
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,678
It's hard to explain.

301
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,883
It's different events.
Different events in time.

302
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,677
Concentrate on the Reverse-Flash.

303
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,970
Okay.

304
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,474
I see him.

305
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,268
Move toward him.

306
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,653
Okay. Now what?

307
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,989
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

308
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,288
Where the hell am I?

309
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,950
It's charged. You can go now.

310
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,956
You said you'd release me.

311
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,213
Yes, I did, didn't I?

312
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,168
No!

313
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,808
Well, what is it?

314
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,635
She's dead.

315
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,185
Dr. McGee is dead?

316
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,116
Harry and I were trying to hone my powers
to find Zoom.

317
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,777
And then we ended up
using them finding the Reverse-Flash,

318
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,491
and that's when I saw him kill her.

319
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,323
And then he left.

320
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,367
He left? What do you mean, he left?

321
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,953
McGee built him
some kind of speed machine,

322
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,542
and he ran into it
and got flung back to the future.

323
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,588
You'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

324
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,253
- You mean like tachyons?
- Tachyons.

325
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,382
Wait, we can track their location
once they've been activated.

326
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,762
- Anything?
- Nothing.

327
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,597
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

328
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,391
- I'm positive.
- All right.

329
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,896
What else did you see?

330
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,528
There was all sorts of weird
tech everywhere. There was a clock.

331
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,234
What time did the clock say?

332
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,242
9:52, I think. How is that relevant?

333
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,698
It's 6:00 now.

334
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,831
Are you telling me I can see the future?

335
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,241
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

336
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,910
Those goggles are getting
named immediately.

337
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,749
But that means Dr. McGee's alive.

338
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,080
That's right.

339
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,419
Okay, we have 3 hours,
52 minutes to find her

340
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,425
and stop Reverse-Flash.
Let's do it.

341
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,089
Spivot.

342
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,382
Hey.

343
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,967
Can't get away from
those case files, huh?

344
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,181
Ah, just following up on a hunch.

345
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,891
You're gonna miss the action, right?

346
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,143
Maybe. A little.

347
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,934
I'm gonna miss you.

348
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,394
I'll miss you, too.

349
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,612
It's nice to know someone will.

350
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,650
Wait, we talking about Barry? 'Cause it
sounds like we're talking about Barry.

351
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,615
He kept telling me there was stuff
he couldn't share with me,

352
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,281
and I've been going a little crazy
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

353
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,325
Yeah. Barry's not great at sharing.

354
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,619
Neither are you.

355
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,787
What do you mean?

356
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,296
Barry just told me that, you know,

357
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,175
sometimes he helps you out
with S.T.A.R. Labs stuff.

358
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,678
Yeah, he does,
when he has a few extra minutes.

359
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,131
I didn't know that. I mean,
the whole time I've been working here,

360
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,970
you never mentioned it to me.

361
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,432
But then I realized why.

362
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,640
I went through some of Barry's old cases.

363
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,394
All of them involved The Flash
saving the day,

364
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:32,031
with details that Barry
couldn't have possibly even known.

365
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,315
That's weird.

366
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,953
Yeah, it... It is weird.

367
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,617
The only thing that does make sense
is that Barry is The Flash.

368
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,377
Have you ever seen Barry run?

369
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,838
He waddles. Like a slow-ass duck.

370
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,624
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

371
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,004
You know, when I started this job,

372
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,545
you told me I had to learn
how to lie to do it.

373
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,721
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

374
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
See you.

375
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,644
Nice nitrous kit.

376
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,071
You're gonna get caught one of
these days. You know that, right?

377
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
Get thrown in jail?

378
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,988
I'll stop racing
when these hospital bills stop coming in.

379
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,408
I saw Mom today.
She says you haven't been by in a while.

380
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,697
Yeah. She knows why.

381
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,537
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

382
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,374
I have every right to be angry.
Nothing for 20 years.

383
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,084
Then out of nowhere, she tells me
I have a sister. I have a father.

384
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,670
Yeah, the same thing
happened to me, too, remember?

385
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,628
But that shouldn't keep you
from seeing her before you can't anymore.

386
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,594
No, look, that's not what it is.

387
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,098
Then what is it, Wally?

388
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,842
I gotta go.

389
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,181
Last year, my fiancé died.

390
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,058
Unexpectedly.

391
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,860
One moment he was here, the next, gone.

392
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,242
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to him,

393
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,615
to tell him everything
that he meant to me,

394
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,370
that he was my world,

395
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,248
that he was loved.

396
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:10,417
But today, I got to say goodbye
to your mom. My mom.

397
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,879
And it helped us both find peace
with what happened to our family.

398
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,554
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret the rest of your life.

399
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,720
Go, see your mom, while you still can.

400
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,439
No sign of tachyon activity.

401
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,362
We're running out of time.
We've gotta find them.

402
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,445
It'll take a few minutes for the device
to reach full power once it's activated,

403
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,575
but when we find it,
you're gonna have to get there fast.

404
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,578
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah.

405
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,782
Have you found out anything else
about Jay's doppelganger?

406
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,826
There's no Jay Garrick on this earth.

407
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,086
It's so weird.
Everyone has a doppelganger.

408
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,629
Maybe just ask Jay. He's a good guy.

409
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,131
Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

410
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,254
Okay.

411
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,673
Hey.

412
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,133
Hold on. What's up?

413
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,728
We got a problem.
Patty knows you're The Flash.

414
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,640
- What?
- She caught me off guard,

415
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,691
I mean, I played it off, but
come on, she's a smart girl.

416
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,649
And, she was going through some case
files, and you were acting all squirrelly.

417
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,859
- This is my fault now?
- No, it's nobody's fault.

418
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,148
Oh, my God.

419
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,824
Maybe you should tell her.

420
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,485
- No.
- Patty's trustworthy.

421
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,028
It's not even about that, Joe. I...

422
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,369
I don't want another person that Zoom,
or Reverse-Flash,

423
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,331
or any of these meta-humans,
can use against me. I don't want it.

424
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,537
Patty can't get hurt over this.

425
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,376
Tachyons! 87th and Avenue J.

426
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,594
Must be one of Mercury Labs'
off-site facilities.

427
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,930
- Hack into their security...
- I've hacked into the security feed.

428
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,639
- You're one step ahead...
- I'm one step ahead of you.

429
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,223
Uh-oh.

430
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,150
Barry, hurry up!

431
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,063
It's charged. You can go now.

432
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,488
You said you'd release me.

433
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,870
Yes, I did, didn't I?

434
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,534
He's gonna kill her.

435
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,378
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

436
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,342
Okay, get out of here,
all right? Go! Go!

437
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,387
That was my way home!

438
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,772
You're not going anywhere.

439
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,570
You haven't won here, Flash.
I'll find another way back.

440
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,072
You're gonna have to get through me first.

441
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,454
You really think
you're fast enough to stop me?

442
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,738
Well, let's find out.

443
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,032
Catch me if you can.

444
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,254
Oh, it's on.

445
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,554
Get him, Barr.

446
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,445
Not fast enough, Thawne.

447
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,285
I will never lose to you again!

448
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,915
This war between us, it ends now!

449
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,290
Barr, you gotta stop!

450
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,969
Barr! Don't kill him! Just bring him in!

451
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,977
Get the cell ready.

452
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,273
Hey, he can't...

453
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,980
Phase his way out?
No, he can't do that.

454
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,616
It's the same cell
we used to hold Dr. Wells last year.

455
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,035
- Barr, where are you going?
- I'm going down there.

456
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,320
No, you're not.

457
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,498
The more he learns about you,
the more you will alter the timeline.

458
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,954
He killed my mom!

459
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,834
He's from the future,
he hasn't done that yet.

460
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,496
He doesn't even know you're The Flash,
and you need to keep it that way.

461
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,961
You already said that his mother's
gonna die no matter what we do.

462
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,876
Ramifications,
any time anybody messes with the timeline.

463
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,967
And it's impossible to predict
what those ramifications are gonna be.

464
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,975
Barry, you caught him, and you
stopped him from killing Dr. McGee.

465
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,178
In my book, that's a win.

466
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,312
This doesn't feel like a win.

467
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,774
I gotta go.

468
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,449
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

469
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,171
My dad had Multiple Sclerosis.

470
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:08,048
Every day, for years,
I watched this amazingly strong man

471
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,305
fight for his life, and lose.

472
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:17,388
So I can't sit by and watch another man
I care about fight for his life

473
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,392
and not do something about it.

474
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,686
I tried to find your doppelganger.

475
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,526
Same DNA, same cellular structure.

476
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,564
I could replace your dying cells
with his living ones.

477
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,746
But you don't have
a doppelganger on this earth.

478
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,368
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

479
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,285
Meet me at Hofherr Park tomorrow,
and I'll show you.

480
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,577
Why can't you just tell me?

481
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,496
Because you need to see for yourself.

482
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,890
How'd you get your suit in your ring?

483
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,184
Who are you?

484
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,813
My name is Cisco Ramon.

485
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,570
And we know each other well, don't we?
We have a history together.

486
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,029
You could say that.

487
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,734
And that's all you want to know?
How I got my suit in my ring?

488
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,244
I want you to know that I'm the one
who figured out you were back.

489
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,957
I helped stop you. Me.

490
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,462
And how'd you do that?

491
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,914
I have powers.

492
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,799
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

493
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,343
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

494
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,307
And here's what's so ironic about it.

495
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,806
You gave me these powers.

496
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,775
Have fun thinking about that

497
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,439
while you rot away in this cell
that you helped me build.

498
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,400
Bye, Felicia.

499
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,469
Hey.

500
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,472
- Hey.
- Got your text.

501
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,391
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

502
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,902
considering
you've been avoiding me lately.

503
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,654
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

504
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:39,487
No. Just, busy, you know,
speeding around Central City.

505
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,249
I know you're The Flash, Barry.

506
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,534
Patty, come on.

507
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,045
Please don't make me feel any
more stupid than I already do.

508
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,706
Look, I'm a detective and
I should have known.

509
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,833
I was so smitten with you.

510
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:57,172
Okay, look,
what you're saying, it's insane.

511
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,260
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

512
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,098
I understand, I understand why you didn't
want to tell me.

513
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,389
I understand why you've been distant.
Look, I understand everything.

514
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,021
But just tell me the truth now.
Just be honest with me. Just...

515
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,230
Admit to me you're The Flash,
and I'll stay.

516
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,524
I can't do that. I'm not him.

517
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,701
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to stay.

518
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,244
Fight crime during the day,
and be with you at night,

519
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,038
but I was wrong. Take care, Barry.

520
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,104
Is that you, Flash?

521
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,936
Why do you hate me so much?

522
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,271
I didn't always.

523
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:01,281
I was obsessed with you.
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

524
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,118
I spent years figuring out
how you came to be,

525
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,127
duplicated the reaction, and it worked.

526
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,581
I became like you.

527
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,299
All right, so what happened?

528
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:21,301
This ability to travel through time
revealed the truth.

529
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:27,394
My fate was to become your greatest enemy.
I was never going to be The Flash.

530
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,685
So I became the reverse
of everything that you were.

531
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,814
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

532
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,025
the more I had to take from you.

533
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:42,989
That is why you killed my mother?
That's why you ruined my life?

534
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,613
Because you couldn't be me?

535
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,244
I became better than you!

536
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:55,005
I am the one thing you
cannot stop, Flash!

537
00:31:55,288 --> 00:32:00,419
No. No, no. Not anymore.
Our race is over.

538
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,263
And you lost.

539
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,301
I've learned what time period
you're from, Flash.

540
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,897
And one day soon, I'll learn your name.

541
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,273
We need you in the cortex now!

542
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,402
What's happening?

543
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,580
He's experiencing an uncontrollable
amount of electrical energy in his brain,

544
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,866
Putting him in a prolonged state
of clonic seizing.

545
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,660
What? Can you stop it?

546
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,077
I don't know.

547
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,632
Hold him down!

548
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:43,803
We're trying!

549
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,597
- Sedate him, Snow, now!
- Come on! Come on!

550
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,258
Benzodiazepine. This should do it.

551
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,598
Finally.

552
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,647
- What the...
- What was that?

553
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,570
What's going on? Where the hell am I?

554
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:01,821
Cisco!

555
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,899
- It's the time line.
- What? What are you talking about?

556
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,445
When you, when you captured Reverse-Flash,
we ruptured the timeline.

557
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,615
That's what this... All the blood,
and the seizures, and it all.

558
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,706
Cisco is being affected to...
By the changes to the timeline.

559
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,586
The changes to the past,
and the changes to the present.

560
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,122
This is what this is.
We need to do something.

561
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,297
- We need to do it fast.
- Like what?

562
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,091
We need to restore the time line.

563
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,295
Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash
and send him back to the future

564
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,883
As quickly as possible.

565
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,680
I just caught him!
You want me to let him go?

566
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,100
Keeping him here is killing Cisco!

567
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,223
Barry, if this is the only way
we can save him, you gotta do it.

568
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,889
You gotta let go of Thawne!

569
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,643
Okay, all right, look.

570
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,900
I destroyed the tachyon drive
in the speed machine.

571
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,482
There's no way it'll reach the speed
necessary to send him back home.

572
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,238
- You can.
- What?

573
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,406
Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed,

574
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,443
that'll be enough to catapult him
through the time continuum. You can do it.

575
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,291
All right.
All right, let's do it. Let's do it.

576
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,248
Time to send you home.

577
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,755
The time paradox. Yeah.

578
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,213
You've all messed with something
you don't understand.

579
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,470
Can you do me a favor
and just shut up?

580
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,521
And how exactly
are you going to send me home?

581
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,806
Don't worry about it.

582
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,641
You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device?

583
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,020
No. I came up with a different method.

584
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
Is that so?

585
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
Uh-huh.

586
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,910
Who are you?

587
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,954
No one of consequence.

588
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,998
No. I doubt that.

589
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,845
I win again, Flash.

590
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,843
All you have to do is provide him
with enough momentum

591
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,727
to get him past the space-time barrier.

592
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:56,978
All right.

593
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,351
Hey, listen to me.
Thawne knows about you.

594
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,810
Right here, right now.

595
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,938
This is where he learns about you,
all of you.

596
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,073
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,
how he knows about me,

597
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,699
the Harrison Wells from this earth.
And there's nothing I can do about it.

598
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:19,247
There's nothing you can do about it.
This is his origin story.

599
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,001
And it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

600
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:30,297
But right here, right now,
you can send him back to his time.

601
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,017
You can save your friend,
you can save Cisco.

602
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,761
And then move on with your life.

603
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,107
This could be a good thing.
You can finally let go of him.

604
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,028
I could throw him three centuries
from now, he'll always be a part of me.

605
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,782
Time to send you back where you belong.

606
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,874
We'll meet again soon, Flash.

607
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,662
I know. And every time,
I'll be ready for you.

608
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,730
Hurry!

609
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,087
He did it.

610
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,693
He's gonna be okay.

611
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't understand what we're doing here.

612
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,713
Just like you, I thought that if I could
find my doppelganger on this earth,

613
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,174
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

614
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,222
Believe me, I was just as shocked as you

615
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,010
when I couldn't find
a Jay Garrick anywhere on this planet.

616
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:50,106
Took me a while to figure it out.
But eventually, I found him.

617
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,531
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

618
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,736
Hunter Zolomon?
Why doesn't he have the same name as you?

619
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,997
From what I could gather,
his mother died during childbirth.

620
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,907
He bounced around from family to family

621
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,868
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

622
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,089
Why does that mean he can't help you?

623
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,548
My DNA was mutated
when I became a speedster.

624
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,386
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

625
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:24,603
If we can catch Zoom,
I can get my speed back.

626
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,476
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

627
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,241
- Wally, hi.
- Hey.

628
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,406
Um, do you wanna come in?

629
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,499
No, I can't stay. I Just...

630
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,333
I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna
take your advice, go see my mom.

631
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,455
Okay.

632
00:38:55,917 --> 00:39:00,764
Iris, I was...
I was wondering if you would come with me?

633
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,142
Yeah, yeah, I would love that.

634
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,265
- Yeah?
- Okay. Um...

635
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,859
My head feels like it's in a vise.

636
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,280
What happened?

637
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,284
I think you vibed one too many dimensions.

638
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,577
Maybe I should stop doing that.

639
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,539
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

640
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,290
How did you, um, get the vibing to stop?

641
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,750
We sent Thawne back to his time.

642
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,503
You let him go?

643
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,007
I couldn't let him take another person
I cared about.

644
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,102
Thank you.

645
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,304
Of course.

646
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,271
Okay. I think I need a Big Belly burger.
Anyone?

647
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,653
- I'm good, thank you.
- Yeah, no pickles.

648
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,438
Two triple-triples. Please.

649
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,647
You got money?

650
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,525
Mmm-mmm...

651
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,613
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

652
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:10,246
So, Patty,
she's on a train to Midway City right now?

653
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,752
Mmm-hmm, I had to let her go, too.

654
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,835
Mmm, I was thinking about what you said,

655
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:22,630
about part of being The Flash is that you
have the ability to do amazing things

656
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,173
that nobody else can do.

657
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,133
And we see now that a hundred years
from now, you'll still be doing them.

658
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,725
But the other part is,
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

659
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,525
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

660
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,396
And there's gonna be a lot of things
where, eventually,

661
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,398
you'll have to let them go.

662
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,571
You gotta be ready for that.

663
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,576
I am. I'm ready.

664
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,116
That's my boy.

665
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,000
That's weird.

666
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:02,718
Hey.

667
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,297
Barry, I'm on the train.
There's a... there's a man with a gun.

668
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,966
All right, hold on. I'll get you help.

669
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,808
Is everyone okay?

670
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,309
Everyone's fine.

671
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:25,571
It was a false alarm.
But thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

672
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,076
I just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

673
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,206
Don't worry. Everything's good.

674
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,352
Goodbye, Barry.
