1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,699
MILLER: Hey, it's Tim Miller here.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,177
I'm the director of Deadpool
by some crazy chance of fortune.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,555
I'm here with Rob Liefeld,
who's the creator of Deadpool,

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,683
who I'm honored to be doing
a DVD commentary with.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:21,021
Although, he is contractually obligated
to be here, so, Rob.

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,583
LIEFELD: Hey, Tim, thank you
for having me. I'm very excited to be here.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,694
You know how much I absolutely enjoy
this movie, so this is gonna be great.

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,298
I was just kidding, he's not
contractually obligated to be here.

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,635
LIEFELD: I love these scrolls.
I love the Marvel logo.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,536
I think it's a great way...

11
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,164
MILLER: They change that
for every movie, right?

12
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,750
LIEFELD: The Fox one, I think, stays red.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:47,130
Oh, my gosh, this was amazing
when I read it in the script,

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,717
and I thought it would be difficult
to pull off,

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,261
but you aced it.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,057
MILLER: This, oddly enough,
is one of the very first things that

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,813
kind of launched us down, or me,
on this way of doing Deadpool,

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,526
where we were gonna have
this really big mix of all CG characters

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,862
cutting up against live action characters.

20
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,658
And that was our way to sort of
have big-scope action,

21
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,244
but keep it as Ryan Reynolds...

22
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,721
MILLER: Yeah.
LIEFELD: So fantastic.

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,932
MILLER: The Not Green Lantern Corps.
LIEFELD: It is so fantastic.

24
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,709
MILLER: But the first time we did this,
we did it in animatic

25
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,127
and we hadn't cast the movie,

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,423
SO our animatic artists
Just put these placeholder slugs in there

27
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,010
that was like "The Hot Chick,"
"The Other Hot Chick,"" "The Funny Guy."

28
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,763
Ryan was the only cast member
that we actually knew

29
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,348
was gonna be in the film.

30
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,061
And we all thought it was really funny
to have these generic titles in there,

31
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,565
and so, they kind of made it all the way
through to the end.

32
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,649
LIEFELD: And it works.

33
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:52,362
The reaction, every time I've seen it
people, I mean, they love it.

34
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,576
But the whole idea of just pulling
the camera through all these characters

35
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,329
with all this crazy
action is very inventive.

36
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:04,666
It sets the tone perfectly.
It sets the tone for what's coming.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,169
And like I said, great credits.

38
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,422
MILLER: We got a few laughs
from the fake titles,

39
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,134
which is good because it really
starts the audience off in a nice place.

40
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:19,473
We had another version, older version,
where the titles weren't quite as funny,

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:24,478
and we noticed it had a real
dampening effect on the whole first act,

42
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:29,316
because people just weren't
in that mode of laughing.

43
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,403
They weren't as ready to laugh as
they were when the credits were funnier.

44
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,575
We had a good time with
making these faux things

45
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,787
that Deadpool looks at.

46
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,289
We'd put in there exactly
what the writers wrote.

47
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know why they came up
with the things they did.

48
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,585
I'm sure they had a reason.

49
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,463
But the art department
had a really good time making them.

50
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,864
LIEFELD: My gosh, getting
the gum off the lens.

51
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,392
And this guy is so good. He's not an actor.

52
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,246
I feel, through the whole movie,
this is just a taxi driver you guys hired.

53
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,107
MILLER: No, he's a great actor.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,861
And in fact, Karan Soni, he was one
of the hardest actors to get in the film

55
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,407
because he was afraid
that it would hurt his TV career

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,870
to not be able to take other roles because
of the obligations to playing this character.

57
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,999
And we all begged him so much
because he was just perfect.

58
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,168
LIEFELD: Oh, he was.
MILLER: Just the greatest guy.

59
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,045
And everybody called and begged.

60
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,632
I begged, Ryan begged,
Simon Kinberg begged,

61
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,429
and eventually, he gave in, I think,
really just to get us to stop calling him.

62
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,824
LIEFELD: Okay, that's a great story.
I would never have known that.

63
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:48,770
That is a fantastic revelation on this guy,
'cause his scene, later on, is the payoff.

64
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,272
It's fantastic.

65
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:55,235
(LAUGHING) He is so great.
His interaction with Ryan is fantastic.

66
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,282
Later we'll talk about the suit, 'cause
we don't see the whole suit right just yet.

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,160
But, oh, my gosh, he looks fantastic.

68
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,247
Your Blur department, Tim, everything
you did to bring this suit to life,

69
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,710
people constantly say
it is the best-costumed superhero

70
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,919
they've ever seen on film.

71
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,881
I heard that multiple times
since the film came out.

72
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,007
MILLER: Well, thank you.

73
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,471
One of our concept artists at Blur,
Josh Shaw, did the design for this.

74
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,098
And he's an amazing concept guy.

75
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,643
And he put such love
into every design element.

76
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,730
But of course,
it's based off your original design.

77
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,916
- It's not all that different from...
- LIEFELD: No, I love the...

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,376
MILLER: ...the way Deadpool's been...

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,693
LIEFELD: Yeah.
MILLER: ...forever

80
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,654
This shit...

81
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,740
Boo!

82
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,868
MILLER: So, this is our
introduction scene for Ajax.

83
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,454
And those cases that he's sitting on

84
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,624
are actual shipping cases for super-slaves.

85
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,669
Inside are these sedated super-slaves
that he's selling to this Warlord,

86
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:59,174
um, so he can use them as soldiers
in some illicit war.

87
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,135
'Cause that's what
Ajax does, he's a slaver.

88
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,346
Um, and this guy's come in to buy stuff.

89
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,641
And you may not think
that this would be the case,

90
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:12,187
but that is an actual helicopter
built in the early '70s.

91
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,356
And it is a beautiful machine.

92
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,818
We had a couple of shots where
the helicopter flies in,

93
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,571
and we did these long intro shots of Ed
with the helicopter landing

94
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,448
that were really beautiful.

95
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,952
But ultimately,
you gotta keep things moving.

96
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,329
But it is a beautiful machine.

97
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,500
It was kind of great to be out there
on the tarmac early in the morning,

98
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,086
Just feel the power of that thing.

99
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,296
And those helicopter pilots
were just amazing.

100
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,007
They could land that thing
on a dime every time.

101
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,592
It was crazy.

102
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:49,182
And now, this is what hooks up to
this scene of Deadpool.

103
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,060
Deadpool knows where they're going

104
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,580
after they had this meeting
with the Warlord,

105
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,358
and he's going to intercept them
and finally get his revenge.

106
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,860
No, no time.

107
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,946
LIEFELD: I gotta tell you,
when I first met you,

108
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,615
you had the animatics
of this entire scene coming up

109
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,660
on the different screens at Blur Studios
you had set up.

110
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,205
And to see over the course of the movie
getting green lit

111
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,582
and then the final product,

112
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,334
it's just been fantastic
to watch it all come together.

113
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,296
And then actually be in Vancouver
where they were shutting down

114
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,357
- the actual freeway for two weeks.
- MILLER: To film it, yeah.

115
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,261
Well, I think a lot of people thought we
were recreating the test piece in the movie,

116
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,431
but in fact, if they'd happen to read
the script that leaked,

117
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,809
this scene we did as a test
was really just a compressed version

118
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,395
of what had been in the script all along.

119
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,648
And I just changed some things
So that it could tell a story

120
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,233
from beginning, middle to end.

121
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,487
This is actually the way it was originally
before I altered it to make a test piece.

122
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,408
Oh, hello. I know, right?

123
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,410
Whose balls did I have to fondle

124
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,162
to get my very own movie?

125
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,413
I can't tell you,

126
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,999
but it does rhyme
with "Polverine."

127
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,417
And let me tell you,

128
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,504
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

129
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,884
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and, oh...

LIEFELD: As an action movie fanatic
my entire life,

135
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,323
you're always going in looking for
something that's gonna be new and fresh,

136
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,800
and not something you've seen before.

137
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,535
And, buddy, you pulled it off.

138
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,246
This car fight, there's nothing like this.

139
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,209
It's part of why this movie is so fresh,
this right here.

140
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:44,297
This car fight is ridiculously
well-choreographed and executed.

141
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,800
MILLER: You're very kind.
LIEFELD: Big fan.

142
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,928
MILLER: Honestly, I think,
for the whole movie, the trickiest part is

143
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,556
we're going in and out of action,
and it's mixed with comedy.

144
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,308
And the action is pretty brutal, too.

145
00:07:55,392 --> 00:08:00,021
So, a guy getting his head smashed
into a roadside stanchion,

146
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,332
- not so funny.

Deadpool quipping about it the whole time.

148
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,214

in the whole movie, right here.

150
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,544
MILLER: No, I just like that whole sequence
where the car smashes by.

151
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,953
Yeah, the lighter's great, too.

152
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,246
LIEFELD: This is brutal.

153
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,665
Okay, I've now seen this multiple times.

154
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,209

WADE: I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

158
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,027
MILLER: So, in the
interest of talking about

159
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,387
those things
that were left on the cutting room floor,

160
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,223
the original joke here was,
"Love your work in Daredevil."

161
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,183
Because if you know your Marvel comics,

162
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:42,439
you'll know that Bullseye, in the movies,
had that little target on his forehead.

163
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,857
Colin Farrell had that.

164
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,943
So, it was a little inside joke,
which the movie is full of.

165
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,067
LIEFELD: That's fantastic,

166
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,588
- I did not know that.
- MILLER: Yeah.

167
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,240
We thought that, "Don't swallow,"
it's a more universal joke.

168
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,443
LIEFELD: It is.
MILLER: Yeah.

169
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,249
LIEFELD: And the blend of live action
with CG is really seamless.

170
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,459
MILLER: A lot of CG.

this morning.

175
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,600
Gridlock has kept

lo remain in their homes.

The assailant
appears to be armed...

178
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,982
LIEFELD: This depiction of Colossus
excites me the most.

179
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,109
MILLER: As a director, I'm such a nerd that

180
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,653
I underestimated everybody's knowledge
of who the X-Men are

181
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,156
and where they come from.

182
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,408
So, originally we didn't have this scene.

183
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,578
They kind of show up later
to take Deadpool into custody.

184
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,998
When we did some early screenings, a
lot of people were a little confused about

185
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,459
are they against Deadpool,
are they here to arrest him,

186
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,895
are they here to help him?
They didn't know.

187
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,922
And so, I was excited about
adding this scene here

188
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,965
that sort of set up who the X-Men were

189
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,803
and what his connection is
to the rest of the mutant world.

190
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,139
But I really love this little scene,
underneath the mansion,

191
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,474
when they go to the Blackbird.

192
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,951
And it really helped, I think, set us up...

193
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,995
LIEFELD: Sets the table.
MILLER: ...and Colossus shows up. Yeah.

194
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,604
LIEFELD: It 100% setts the table.

195
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,607
Little anecdote. I was reading
in the Marvel X-Men Chronicles

196
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,919
that Colossus was intended to be
the star of the X-Men franchise,

197
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,445
that's why he's so prominent
on the first six covers.

198
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,573
But Wolverine kind of caught the attention
of the fans thrusting forward.

199
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,452
But Colossus has never been served
in a way that you did in this film.

200
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,706
These are great thugs.

201
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,708
I'm telling you,
there's always thugs in movies,

202
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,377
but this brown pants guy...

203
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,463
These guys are fantastic.

204
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,676
MILLER: These are all stunt guys.
And stunt crew did really amazing.

205
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,470
Phil Silvera and Rob Alonzo
were our stunt coordinators.

206
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,180
And these guys were all talented.

207
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,851
Will, that guy right there,
later jumped into the Deadpool suit.

208
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,812
When one of our other
Deadpool stunt doubles got injured,

209
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,772
Will came in and did a great job.

210
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,651
And we shot this sequence for something
like 12 days or something crazy.

211
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,699
You gotta remember, those guys,
once they get shot here and injured,

212
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,451
they gotta lay there
in the rain on the road.

213
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,289
LIEFELD: I didn't think about that.
MILLER: For days after we're done shooting.

214
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,416
When we're shooting
the other scenes around them.

215
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,126
So, kudos to them.

it's a signature set piece.

217
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,801
When I first read in the script
this whole, entire freeway scene,

218
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,678
I was like...

219
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:23,266
Again, the level of violence in this,
you just go, "I hope they put this in.""

When I first saw it
with you, the first cut,

221
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,021
right there, I'm like, "It's happening."

222
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,316
They made this as hardcore
as they could possibly make it.

223
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,194
MILLER: I love it, too, but if you remember
the original script,

224
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,446
it was originally 18 bullets.

225
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,991
- And we had to cut it to 12...
- LIEFELD: That's awesome.

that we, unfortunately, had to cut out.

There was a sequence where he shoots
one of the other motorcycle riders,

and the bike keeps coming at him.

And he ducks and throws, in slow-mo,
the bike over his head,

234
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,865
and then, as it goes
towards some other thugs,

235
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,703
he shoots the gas tank and it explodes,
and kills a bunch of bad guys.

the scene here where he kills
the guy with the katanas

was so lavishly written.

- I fell in love with the script right there.
- LIEFELD: Yes.

MILLER: Because he does
this whole homoerotic monologue

263
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,167
as he's up there and talking about

Just this really prolonged moment.

LIEFELD: And the funny thing is,
when I saw it for the first time with you,

267
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,350
you said, "Rob, I gotta be honest.
I wish we did more with the katanas."

00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,810
And so, we're, what,
14 minutes into the movie,

00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,687
and I see him kebab this guy.

uh, issue 10 Deadpool, I believe.

277
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,793
So, you can match it up.

278
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,712
MILLER: Which I didn't know
at first when I read it.

279
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,174
I'm sure I'd read it in the comic books
and then forgotten about it,

280
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,885
'cause I read eight million comic books.

281
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,639
But, uh, yeah,
it comes right from the books.

282
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,575
LIEFELD: Yeah, no, Rhett and Paul
did a great job

283
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,769
mashing up about 18 years' worth
of Deadpool history

284
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:59,649
and just, uh, getting all the high points

285
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,126
and giving it a brand-new narrative.

286
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,905
'Cause I tell people, "You can't
find this movie in a comic book."

287
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,741
This is very fresh,
but it's the spirit of the character

288
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,702
and it has great details from the comics.

289
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,040
But, like with all great movies,
Donner's Superman movie,

290
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,001
I had never seen that version
of Lex Luthor before.

291
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,962
That was signature to that film.

292
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,880
And that defined Superman to me.

293
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,966
This is the definitive Deadpool.

294
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,343
And those guys did a great job.

295
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,928
When I read it I was blown away.

296
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,680
And then to see it come to life here.

297
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,449
- This guy is hilarious.
- MILLER: He is great, yeah.

298
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,850
Kyle did a great job.

00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,103
The line that Ryan has here,

300
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,815
(LAUGHING AND STAMMERING)
"I'll shoot your fucking cat,"

301
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,276
he did one take of it that was,

302
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,736
"I will shoot you in the fucking cat."

303
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,448
Which, I don't know why,
it's so nonsensical.

304
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,116
Oh, my God, it fucking cracked me up.

305
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,369
I ruined the take
because I was laughing behind the camera.

306
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,305
- And Ryan starts laughing.
- (LIEFELD LAUGHING SOFTLY)

307
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,957
MILLER: And then we do
another couple takes of it.

308
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,292
And I loved it.

309
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,353
It was one of my favorite lines
in the whole movie.

310
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,355
LIEFELD: It's a good one.
MILLER: But nobody laughed.

311
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,757
So, we changed it to,
"I will shoot your fucking cat."

312
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,301
Which always gets a laugh.

313
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,970
Although, it's this weird laugh
because he's confused.

314
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,140
LIEFELD: Yeah, nobody knows what's...
The chaos in this scene.

315
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,060
The jokes are so fast in this movie,
I guarantee the movie benefits

316
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,980
from people going back to hear
the 10 jokes they didn't hear.

317
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,356
Cool?

318
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,566
Yes, sir.

319
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,775
Then we're done.

320
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,028
Wait. (CHUCKLES SLOWLY)
We are?

321
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,779
Yeah. We're totally done.
(LAUGHS)

322
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,907
You should've seen your face.

323
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,634
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

324
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
Soft spot, remember?

325
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,077
(WHIMPERS)

326
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,639
LIEFELD: And when he explodes
right here, it's great.

327
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,124
- MILLER: Oh, yeah, totally.
- (LIEFELD STUTTERING)

328
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,837
MILLER: The kiss was, uh,
an ad-lib of Ryan's, too.

329
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,214
It was great.

330
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,737
LIEFELD: And this is great, establishing him
as a good guy, as a hero, good intentions.

331
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,387
MILLER: Or at least not as a bad guy.
LIEFELD: Yeah.

332
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,356
MILLER: I'm sure a lot of fans picked up on
Feige's Famous Pizza there.

333
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,279
- For Kevin.
- LIEFELD: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

334
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,026
I'm sure he'll get a kick out of it.

335
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:17,703
This sets it up perfectly that,
like you said, he's not a bad guy.

336
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,542
MILLER: Yeah, but he's not a good guy,
either, so we're trying to walk that line.

337
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,963
He's always a mixed bag in the comics
and we wanted to keep that the same.

338
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,423
He should be a little morally ambiguous.

339
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,139
LIEFELD: The mod shirt, people.
MILLER: Yes.

340
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,103
- Little Easter egg.
- (LIEFELD LAUGHING SOFTLY)

341
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,815
MILLER: We originally shot
a different exterior for Sister Margaret's.

342
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,734
And we got this
when we went back to Vancouver

343
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:53,197
because we didn't have Ryan
the day that they had to shoot it

344
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,408
so we shot a Ryan double,

345
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,411
but it looked like a zombie
walking down an alley.

346
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,038
It didn't look like Ryan at all.

347
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,957
It just didn't work.

348
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,518
And so, I'm so happy we got to reshoot it.

349
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,544
And then Ryan, on the day,

350
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,046
he wanted to ride a little bike
down the alley.

351
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
And we tried that, it was really funny.

352
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,217
And then just him
hitting the guy in the nuts

353
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:18,598
was just a perfect expression
of the "I'm no hero" sort of a thing.

354
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,312
LIEFELD: And T.J.
Miller nailed it as Weasel.

355
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:29,942
<i>He and Ryan off each other is electric,
fantastic to watch.</i>

356
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,902
<i>Perfect match.</i>

357
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,615
MILLER: Yeah, T.J. is great.
He is so completely uncontrollable.

358
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,827
He was doing, literally,
a different joke every take,

359
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,330
which was really funny.

360
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,099
Every once in a while,
it would throw Ryan off

361
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:49,253
because Ryan's waiting for a line to finish
and then T.J. just keeps rolling

362
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,547
on five or six other alts on top of it.

363
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,799
But, man, it was great.

364
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,054
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

365
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,972
MILLER: This fight used to be different

366
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,975
because, originally,
he was just watching TV.

367
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,310
He starts to fight.

368
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,746
And there's a whole other scene
that we shot

369
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,856
with the mercs talking about
the code for Sister Margaret's.

370
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,485
It was so hot in there when
we were shooting this fight sequence

371
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,404
that I felt so sorry
for these stunt guys in leather jackets.

372
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,240
And Randal's such a big guy.

373
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,593
LIEFELD: He's huge.
MILLER: And he's sweating like

374
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,994
- a motherfucker.
- (LIEFELD LAUGHS)

375
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:27,750
MILLER: And Kayla has to jump on his back
every time we did another take.

376
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,629
LIEFELD: That's great,
the breath on the mirror.

377
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,172
He's still breathing.

378
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,298
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

379
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,889
MILLER: This location that we shot in,
which is partly a relocation, partly a set,

380
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,849
um, that chalkboard was up there already.

381
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,144
It was like destiny for us
to shoot in this place

382
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,356
because it was the perfect place
for the dead pool.

383
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,150
Of course, there's a lot
of Easter eggs up there.

384
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,237
LIEFELD: There is. There's a lot of names
people should watch in, uh...

385
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,199
Trust me, the entire time I was there,
I think my wife took a picture of it,

386
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,120
and I was like, "You can't blow this.
There's Easter eggs on that board."

387
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,973
MILLER: There's a little Easter egg.
See those shoes in the background there?

388
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:12,378
Those are... Shannon Gottlieb,
our art director for this set, she, uh,

389
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,801
I told her some story about my wife
throwing away my kung fu slippers

390
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,262
that I love to wear, but my wife hated,

391
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,390
and so, she puts up
this little thing that says,

392
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,770
"Lost: Tim's slippers.
If found, please dial whatever."

393
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:34,567
And Deadpool's lair is full of these
little Easter-egg-type things.

394
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,404
LIEFELD: Oh, it's loaded.
It's loaded with Easter eggs.

395
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,156
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.

396
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,367
LIEFELD: And I told you when we saw this,
I turned and I told you,

397
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,746
"Tim, none of these people have ever been
shot as well as you shot them."

398
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,165
And I kid you not,
I've seen a million movies.

399
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,918
Morena, Ryan,
they have never looked better.

400
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,171
They look amazing.

401
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,090
And Morena, their chemistry is fantastic.

402
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,927
I was blown away on set, on screen.

403
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,764
And this entire opening banter,

404
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,934
Just fantastic,
establishing their attraction.

405
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,311
Where else do you put one out?

406
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,645
I was molested.

407
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,355
Me too. Uncle.

408
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,649
LIEFELD: I've told people,
the thing about Deadpool,

409
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,985
why it works, it has so much heart.

410
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,363
It's not what you expect going in,
but it's why you loved it so much,

411
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,991
is you are rooting for these two.

412
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,828
And it all starts right here,
this banter, and back and forth,

413
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,749
"You lived in a house, I lived in a...
Whatever, I lived in a closet."

414
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:37,338
This one-upmanship is fantastic,
the way they establish their attraction.

415
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,342
MILLER: This scene here was actually
the audition scene that we used.

416
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,221
So, I'd literally seen this scene acted out

417
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,349
about 400 times before we actually shot it.

418
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,229
But when we were there,
it was just this beautiful thing

419
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,648
because you hope that two people
have this chemistry.

420
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,151
And we'd tested.
We'd shot a scene with them together

421
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,321
to make sure it worked
before we got on set,

422
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,074
but when they're there and it works
and you can feel it,

423
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,828
yes, it's acting,
but there's also this chemistry

424
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,372
that is just pretty amazing.

425
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,582
(LIEFELD STUTTERING)

426
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,920
LIEFELD: In a movie that just has sequence
after sequence after sequence,

427
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,756
the stuff that we're about to come into,

428
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,926
establishing their yearlong romance...

429
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,427
MILLER: Sex montage.

430
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,681
LIEFELD: ...with Calendar Girl is...

431
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,435
MILLER: Which was the single-most
rewritten scene of the entire film.

432
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,440
I think we had 76 versions
of the sex montage when we wrote it.

433
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,694
When we originally had it.

434
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,823
And I'll tell you where it started.
You can see where it ended,

435
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,909
but it started with scenes like this.

436
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:53,914
- Easter was Ryan dressed in a big...
- LIEFELD: There's a bunny.

437
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,602
MILLER: ...yellow chicken outfit...
LIEFELD: Chicken, chicken.

438
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:03,132
MILLER: ...shitting a chocolate Easter egg
onto Morena's stomach, as it were.

439
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,901
LIEFELD: Now, Tim, would that have
gotten us an R rating?

440
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,469
- Or would we have gotten a little higher?
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

441
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,804
MILLER: I don't know.

442
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,181
FYI, five mini lion-bots
come together

443
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,267
to form one super-bot, so...

444
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:17,938
MILLER: There was also a leprechaun outfit
for Saint Patrick's Day,

445
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,524
and a few other various things.

446
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,192
Rhett and Paul are very into costumes.

00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,988
I'm not sure what that says about them
as people or their love lives.

448
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,157
LIEFELD: Sure.
MILLER: But it was all about costumes.

449
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,075
LIEFELD: All year.

450
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,578
Okay, we haven't touched on it yet,

451
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:38,208
but the music in this movie,
from the opening with Juice Newton

452
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,960
to Calendar Girl.

453
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:43,213
The soundtrack is phenomenal.

454
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:51,263
MILLER: Well, Ryan, Rhett and Paul
are virtual encyclopedias

455
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,641
- of bad '80s and '90s music.
- LIEFELD: Okay.

456
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:57,436
MILLER: And so, a lot of that stuff
was in the script from day one.

457
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,688
Especially Juice Newton,
that was always there.

458
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,374
LIEFELD: Yeah.
MILLER: Calendar Girl wasn't.

459
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,566
We found that.

460
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,450
LIEFELD: No, but you're right,
the Juice Newton was always on page one.

461
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,696
MILLER: Yeah. Ted Caplan
was our music editor

462
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,950
and he did a great job
at finding us all these source cues.

463
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,119
We listened to a million things for this.

464
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,580
This was the scene
I dreaded shooting most

465
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,292
because it had to really flow.

466
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,377
LIEFELD: It's a shocker.

467
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,855
MILLER: Everybody thinks it's a lot of fun
to shoot a sex scene,

468
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,467
but it's actually kind of awkward
when you're telling other people what to do

469
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,971
and it's supposed to be sexy,
but there's 40 people around and...

470
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,223
LIEFELD: Hot lights, cameras, yeah.
MILLER: Yeah.

471
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,893
LIEFELD: (STUTTERING) You would
not know, watching this movie,

472
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,812
they are in the zone.

473
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,358
And again, it's the basis
of the entire relationship.

474
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,070
This entire, what is it,
a minute, two minutes long?

475
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,322
Oh my gosh,
the ugliest Christmas sweaters.

476
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,200
And the ultimate reveal of

477
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,912
why I'm sure every woman
is going to love this movie.

478
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,666
MILLER: (CHUCKLING) Ryan Reynolds' ass.
LIEFELD: Yeah, come on.

479
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,001
MILLER: Here it comes.

480
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,628
LIEFELD: It's a thing of beauty
in and of itself.

481
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,839
When I came to visit, you were like,

482
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,967
"Rob, when you see Ryan, he's chiseled."

483
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,845
He's never been more chiseled
and it's... Yeah.

484
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,805
It's shameful to the
rest of us. (CHUCKLING)

485
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,725
MILLER: I hadn't seen Ryan in a while,

486
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,102
and when he came in,

487
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,647
he'd started working out
while I was up in Vancouver.

488
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,190
It was before he came up.

489
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:29,111
And then we went down and met for
the costume fitting.

490
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,113
And he calls me into the dressing room

491
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,032
and he's got his shirt off and he's like,

492
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,617
"So, what do you think? Am I big enough?""

493
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,872
And I'm like, "Holy fucking shit,
you're a monster.

494
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,876
"Yes. Stop working out right now
'cause you're massive."

495
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,520
LIEFELD: Yeah.
MILLER: And we ended up...

496
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,173
We had had some padding in the suit
to fill it out

497
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,134
because most of the time
that's what you do,

498
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,597
but Ryan put the suit on
and he didn't need any padding.

499
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,223
LIEFELD: That's a great story.

500
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,185
MILLER: It was just filled out perfect.

501
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,063
And even as big as he looks
without a shirt on,

502
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,733
in the suit, I always had this idea
and you always drew him this way,

503
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,153
is Deadpool's not
some kind of jacked monster.

504
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,238
LIEFELD: Right. No.
MILLER: This Hulk-like guy.

505
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,657
- He's slender-fast. Yeah.
- LIEFELD: More slender, yes.

506
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,742
Jesus Christ.

507
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,619
It's like I made you
in a computer.

508
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,329
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

509
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,455
Mmm.

510
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,999
Hey.

511
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,502
- Perfect.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)

512
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,673
- Let's see.
- All right, wee break.

513
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,050
Shake it, yeah.

514
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,597
(SIGHS)

515
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,390
LIEFELD: (LAUGHING) Oh, this is great.

516
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,767
This caught me unaware, Tim.

517
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,060
When I first saw this,

518
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,189
I was not prepared for what's about to
happen here in just a second.

519
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,942
WADE: This had been the ultimate
commercial break.

520
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,193
- (TOILET FLUSHING)
- (SIGHS)

521
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,195
<i>MILLER: You mean Ryan's bare chest?</i>

522
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,006
LIEFELD: Yeah, that and this.
MILLER: Or him passing out?

523
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,782
LIEFELD: Yeah, I... Boom.

524
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,784
- (THUDS)
- Oh, my God. Wade?

525
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,796
LIEFELD: Yeah, the movie's got great heart.

526
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,148
I just keep coming back
to the reason that the movie works.

527
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,792
All the action, all the state-of-the-art...
You nailed it,

528
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,378
these guys,
their relationship sells the whole story.

529
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,382
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

530
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,053
MILLER: This doctor's office
was the first thing we shot, actually.

531
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,682
LIEFELD: This was day one?
MILLER: Yeah, this was day one, this scene.

532
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,978
Sometimes you try and pop something off,
a little scene or something during prep,

533
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,063
you squeeze it in
before actual shooting starts.

534
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,817
So, this was a real day of shooting,
or a half day, anyway,

535
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,071
before the scheduled first day of shooting.

536
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,782
So, this was actually
the first thing that we did.

537
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,076
WADE: I'm memorizing
the details of her face.

538
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,163
Like it's the first time
I'm seeing it.

539
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,247
Or the last.

540
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,832
DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson...

541
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,417
Mr. Wilson?

542
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,031
MILLER: I said to the stunt guy,

543
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,006
"Can you just pull the katanas out
and go into that position?"

544
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,550
And I filmed it on my iPhone
and then I reversed it.

545
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,803
LIEFELD: You would never know
you shot that and then reversed it.

546
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,932
MILLER: And he flips the katanas and they
go back in (IMITATES POPPING) like that.

547
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,226
And it's perfect.

548
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,688
And so, we just filmed it
and then reversed it.

549
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,482
LIEFELD: The wonder of filmmaking.

550
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,234
That is a great trick.

551
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,571
When I was a kid,
they showed how the Sand Person,

552
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:22,117
they only had one shot of him
in the Star Wars film, shaking his stick,

553
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,954
and the guys went back and forth
and made him shake it by moving the dial

554
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,751
and you just basically told me the exact...
I love that. I love the inside stuff.

555
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:35,964
MILLER: Michel Gondry did this thing
that was on the Internet a while ago

556
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,717
where he's putting together
a Rubik's Cube with his feet.

557
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,179
And then you later realize
that he just did it backwards.

558
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,015
He started with a perfect Rubik's Cube
and undid it

559
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,684
and then played the film backwards.

560
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,937
LIEFELD: So, by the time this has come out,

561
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,234
we've already seen the NFL season
use that shot where he lines up the kick.

562
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,694
It was all over football.

563
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,490
And you just go,
"That just worked out perfectly,

564
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,575
"it matched up wonderfully."

565
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,079
Especially given that there is
a Super Bowl spot that ran with it.

566
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,082
MILLER: That is just a coincidence.

567
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,419
We were in mo-cap, actually,
and we were doing previz for this sequence

568
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,756
and we just thought it would be funny
to take his time,

569
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,386
and really savor the fact that he's got
this guy at last where he wants him.

570
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,389
How about now?

571
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,642
(CHUCKLES SLOWLY)

572
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,561
Wade fucking Wilson.

573
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,858
MILLER: And the kick to the head
Just seemed like the perfect joke.

574
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,194
LIEFELD: It's brutal.
Again, it's part of the brutality.

575
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,947
Character's name is Deadpool.
Should be a violent movie.

576
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,032
MILLER: Gonna play with his food.

577
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:48,620
Ed was an excellent sport here, too,
because, for the majority of this sequence,

578
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,456
which again,
was days and days of shooting

579
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,543
for at least a couple
of days of it, anyway,

580
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:58,297
he's sitting over there
on the side of the road in a puddle

581
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,302
while Ryan does this extended scene
with Colossus and NTW behind them.

582
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,012
Never complained.

583
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,430
WADE: ...shit just went sideways

584
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,348
in the most colossal way.

585
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,727
LIEFELD: Oh, my gosh,
this gets such a huge reaction.

586
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,979
This gets a huge reaction.

587
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,190
And for those of you who are not aware,

588
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:21,903
that's the Baraka Deadpool from
the much maligned Wolverine: Origins.

589
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,448
MILLER: Yes.

590
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,827
And originally, Rhett and Paul wrote that
Joke, "I think they're a little mad at me,"

591
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,913
because, originally
the way that scene played is

592
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,292
he says, "This is where Wham!
Earned its exclamation point,

593
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,295
"and this is the worst piece of shit ever."

594
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,796
And he throws it in the trash can.

595
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:45,010
Which was funny, but I like the fact
that it was subtle, the way it is

596
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,763
and so, for people that know
the character well,

597
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,474
- they get it just from seeing that.
- LIEFELD: Sure.

598
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,851
MILLER: It's a little ironic twist.

599
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,773
LIEFELD: Now tell us what else should
we be looking for, in terms of...

600
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,569
Well there's the Lucha Libre mask
in the background,

601
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,131
there's so much stuff going on
in the back of these scenes,

602
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,383
- the set designers must have had a blast.
- MILLER: Oh, yeah.

603
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,702
And don't ask me why,
but there's cocks everywhere.

604
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:16,708
You'll see so many roosters
in Wade's apartment

605
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,879
and then later on in Deadpool's lair,
it's amazing.

606
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,715
Shannon had a real thing for cocks.

607
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,443
LIEFELD: It works.
MILLER: And by cocks, I mean roosters.

608
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,070
LIEFELD: The scene with him
and the chicken,

609
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,970
will that be on the Blu-ray extra scenes?

610
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,764
MILLER: The scene with him
and the chicken?

611
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,432
LIEFELD: Dressed up like the rooster?

612
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,726
MILLER: No, no. We never actually shot it.

613
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,355
No, they wrote it in
the sex montage he's talking about.

614
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,732
No, they wrote it, but we never shot it.

615
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:45,529
LIEFELD: Is there anything in the montage
that'll make it on?

616
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,907
MILLER: Uh, I don't think there is.

617
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,160
There was some other jokes, alts for Lent,

618
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,871
there was Lyme Disease Awareness Day

619
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,998
and happy Alanis Morissette Day

620
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,792
and a few other things there.

621
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,965
Weasel, like he is in the comics,
he's a skeezy arms dealer

622
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,761
that uses this as his office and he's there
selling weapons to everybody

623
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,848
and they had all their interactions.

624
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,853
So, just in terms of streamlining
everything for time and script

625
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,815
we combined Patch and Weasel
into one character.

626
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,108
LIEFELD: It works.

627
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,652
MILLER: And it's great.

628
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:30,532
It gives T.J.
a place to exist in this world that's his.

629
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,076
It's terrific.

630
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,287
LIEFELD: And the recruiter who's coming up,

631
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,123
you could not, again... Brilliant casting.

632
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,793
You don't like him from
the minute you see him

633
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:48,383
<i>and he is wonderfully smarmy
in regards to...</i>

634
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:52,387
MILLER: But you know what?
He's the lead alien in Galaxy Quest.

635
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,432
- Where you love him. He's the nicest guy.
- LIEFELD: Fantastic.

636
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,452
MILLER: He's the captain of the alien ship,
you know?

637
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,394
LIEFELD: I did not...
MILLER: Remember.

638
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,521
LIEFELD: It all clicks now. It all clicks.

639
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,165
MILLER: And you love him in that movie.

640
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,068
I think it's testament that he's
such a great actor and versatile because...

641
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,361
LIEFELD: And here he is.

642
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,381
MILLER: ...you love him there
and you hate him in this.

643
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,657
He's so precise and persnickety,

644
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,077
you can tell
he's got some kind of OCD issues for sure.

645
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,581
(WADE SIGHS)

646
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,124
Mr. Wilson.

647
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,751
How can I help you?

648
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,521
MILLER: We never really say
whether or not he's a mutant.

649
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,841
- I thought that maybe he has some subtle...
- LIEFELD: Mutations?

650
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:34,679
MILLER: Yeah, something
that allows him to the power of suggestion

651
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:38,642
reinforced with pheromones or some
subtle mutant power

652
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,478
that allows him to convince people.

653
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,498
There's a lot of mutants that are like that
in comics.

654
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,983
LIEFELD: I'm laughing 'cause of the lines,
the insults that Ryan is hurling at him,

655
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:52,531
- again, the humor in this film.
- MILLER: It's great.

656
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,867
Ryan had another line here,

657
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:59,204
it was, "How can I help you other than
snacking on the innocence of children?"

658
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,456
He was ad-libbing a bunch of shit here.

659
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,211
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

660
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,924
And what's more,
give you abilities most men only dream of?

661
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,346
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

662
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,557
but not a good one,
like Slap Chop.

663
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,225
More Shake Weight-y.

664
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,188
LIEFELD: Was it always an infomercial line?

665
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:29,317
How many times did he?
I can't believe with Ryan's improv

666
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,903
that he said the same thing over and over,
or was it always...

667
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:36,866
MILLER: Um, you know, Ryan is great,
he does a lot of improv,

668
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,121
but he always makes sure that
you get the lines that are on the page.

669
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:49,254
As a director you wanna make sure
that you have at least that as a safely

670
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,675
and once you get a good version of what
was on the page, the studio likes that,

671
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,386
they don't want you
to ad-lib everything either.

672
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,640
But you get a good version
of what's on the page and then you ad-lib.

673
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,971
This scene, we had a couple of different
versions of this in the original script.

674
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,735
There was another version where

675
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,404
she wakes up because
he's throwing up in the toilet

676
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,116
because the treatments are starting,
the cancer is really kicking in.

677
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,869
It would have been a nice scene actually

678
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,373
to see the horror of his beginning
disintegration and how it affects her.

679
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,959
I love the way that this is shot, too.

680
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,129
I remember Ryan looking
when he finally got up

681
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:35,425
and took a look at the monitors
after we shot the coverage on this scene.

682
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:39,721
He was like,
"Hey, you can't see my tears here,"

683
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,057
and I said, "You were crying?"
He's like, "Yeah."

684
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,310
"I was crying, I was really crying.

685
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,521
"You can't see my tears."
He was laughing, he wasn't angry about it.

686
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,233
LIEFELD: They work hard for those tears.
MILLER: Yeah, he was really

687
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,737
giving it everything for that moment.

688
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,216
LIEFELD: Now, see, I was gonna ask you
a couple of scenes back

689
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,117
when it looks like
she's been crying all day

690
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,829
when she tells him
they're gonna get through this.

691
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,332
MILLER: Yeah, she does.
She's great with that

692
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,752
and it became a joke on set with me,

693
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:17,175
because it's, I guess, a faux pas
to ask an actor to cry.

694
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:22,764
It's frowned upon, you don't wanna do it
for whatever reason.

695
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:27,352
And so, I would just ask it
and then they would all look at me like,

696
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,689
"You fucking amateur.
You can't just ask us to cry."

697
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,693
And so, it became a joke because
I would find some other way to say it.

698
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,028
LIEFELD: "You want us to cry, Tim?"
MILLER: I really...

699
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,923
"Could you just cry?
Can you just cry for me now?"

700
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,240
LIEFELD: Fantastic.

701
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,951
WADE: Pro: They pull down
a gaggle of ass.

702
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,411
Local dry cleaning discounts.

703
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,246
Lucrative film deals,

704
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,540
and larger ensemble team movies.

705
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,671
LIEFELD: I had to keep it under wraps for
a while when I read this 'cause

706
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:58,299
I knew that it was sensitive, but the way
that Colossus is utilized as the straight cop

707
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,093
and somebody for Deadpool to play off.

708
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,055
That's what I really thought
when he first appears,

709
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,975
the dynamic that Rhett and Paul
had established

710
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:11,229
was just a perfect way
to give him somebody to play straight man.

711
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:15,024
It elevates his looniness more.

712
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,318
MILLER: I thought it was great, too.

713
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:20,321
There was some concern
in the middle there when

714
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,158
you show people the initial cuts

715
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,078
and Colossus is either
a guy in gray pajamas...

716
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:30,082
- Andre, who did a great job acting on set...
- (LIEFELD CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

717
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,726
MILLER: ...but he's still a big guy
in a mo-cap suit,

718
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,752
or he's previz or something like that,

719
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,170
and people start to worry.

720
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,840
They can't see the final version
of what he's going to be.

721
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,136
This scene is gonna be a big DVD extra,

722
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,307
So we actually shot a much longer version
of this scene

723
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,603
where he does a huge rant about

724
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,522
a thinly veiled reference to Green Lantern.

725
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,276
And he really goes on and on,
and this is the scene

726
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,405
where he always earned
the Merc with a Mouth title.

727
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,866
There's some other stuff that's going on
that we cut around,

728
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,370
like he goes and he pulls the wallet
from one of the dead guys

729
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,749
and then he goes to the other guy's pockets
and he gets Ray-Bans and he puts 'em on

730
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,210
and he takes 'em off
and he does a Green Lantern rant.

731
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:20,256
This scene was five minutes long,
it was incredibly long.

732
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,344
And it was all funny
and I hated to cut any of it,

733
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,139
but sometimes you have to sacrifice jokes
for pacing,

734
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,558
but I'm glad we got to put it on the DVD.

735
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,036
LIEFELD: I was gonna say,
that's the kind of stuff,

736
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,478
I'm a huge extras guy.

737
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,980
I buy these things for the extras
and the commentary,

738
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,315
so I can't wait to see it.

whiners at the Neverland mansion...

I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

743
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,955
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

744
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:57,126
MILLER: This joke with the whole Xavier
in Heaven's Gate

745
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:01,548
and making fun of the X-Men
and calling Colossus a cock gobbler.

746
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,009
Fuck, I fell in love with the character
all over again

747
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,636
when I read the speech in the script.

748
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,682
It was just so not done
in a comic book movie,

749
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,687
that when I read it, which again,
was Six years ago, the first time,

750
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,689
it was so perfectly Deadpool,

751
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,525
and so, against everything
that had been done

752
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,319
in comic book movies so far that
I just loved it.

753
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,489
LIEFELD: And it plays huge,
it's some of the biggest laughs.

754
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:32,036
When I've seen it,
the "McAvoy or Stewart" line

755
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,913
is one of the biggest laughs.

756
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,999
MILLER: Yeah, that was a Ryan ad-lib.
LIEFELD: Oh.

757
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,709
MILLER: No, I think that was Ryan's.

758
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,711
LIEFELD: And let me tell you, this scene,

759
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,715
I know Hugh Jackman heals as Wolverine
in the other X-Men films,

760
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,592
but they're generally always cuts,

761
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,470
and when I read the script
and then eventually watched this,

762
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,891
this is an audience
experiencing a healing factor

763
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,060
in a whole different way that they have
never experienced in a movie before.

764
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,063
And that's why
I absolutely adore this scene.

765
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,441
(STUTTERING)

766
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,779
And when he eventually leaves the scene...

767
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:11,159
MILLER: Digital Domain did a great job,
of course, it's visual effects,

768
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,911
So it came later in production,

769
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,288
but when you finally see
those broken hands,

770
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,751
which up until near the end of production

771
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,005
were just Ryan's hands,
they weren't all broken and mangled.

772
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,716
The CG guys did that later.
That's pretty amazing.

773
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,959
Same with the Blackbird,
the Blackbird was never there.

774
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,931
LIEFELD: So great. I honestly...
(STUTTERING)

775
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,516
You can ask Paul and Rhett,
I would always ask them...

776
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,269
My gosh, and this reference to Margaret.

777
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,522
MILLER: For the Judy Blume fans
in the audience.

778
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,860
LIEFELD: You know what?
My wife, it hit home with her.

779
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,655
She got it. Oh, my
gosh, it's just fantastic.

780
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,782
This was the scene I was like,
"Did this make it?"

781
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,385
And Rhett and Paul said, "It made it,
it's wonderful, you'll love it.""

782
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:58,623
By the way, the hand coming off with
the "fuck you" on it, was Ryan was over

783
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,419
at Blur and we were looking at some of
the previz shots and that was Ryan's idea.

784
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,903
He's like, "Man, it'll be fucking funny if
the hand has just got a big fuck you' on It

785
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,053
"when Colossus looks at it,"
which we knew was great, immediately.

786
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,848
You finally hit "fuck it."

787
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,018
Just promise
you'll do right by me.

788
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,562
So I can do right
by someone else.

789
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,897
Of course.

790
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,400
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

791
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,946
LIEFELD: This workshop sequence,
I love the darkness, I love how dark it is.

792
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,241
It takes the movie to a different place.

793
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,328
MILLER: Well, again, the tone was
the trickiest thing

794
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,579
to handle across the movie

795
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,708
because you've got that action,
you've got the comedy,

796
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:48,089
and now we've got pathos and drama
with cancer, which is not funny,

797
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,591
and now we're into
this workshop sequence,

798
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,261
which has got a lot of laughs for sure,

799
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,097
but at the end of the day,
we're talking about

800
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,475
torture and death and people being hurt

801
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,687
in really horrible ways
by really terrible people,

802
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,731
and it's not a lot of laughs, you know?

803
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,443
(GROANS) Easy.

804
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,504
LIEFELD: Here's Gina.
MILLER: Here's Gina.

805
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,654
She's great.

806
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:16,200
MILLER: So, Rob introduced me to Gina
for the first time

807
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,578
for another project of his.

808
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,416
And I loved her from the minute...
I knew who she was of course,

809
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,170
but I didn't know her personally
until Rob brought her down to the studio.

810
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,049
And so, when we rewrote this part
for Angel Dust

811
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:35,428
she was my first and only choice
to play that role.

812
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,515
LIEFELD: And she's fantastic, especially
as we get towards the end of the film,

813
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,852
we can talk more about
how perfect she is for this role.

814
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,898
MILLER: People don't know this about Gina,
or maybe some people do,

815
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,567
but she is the sweetest person
in the world

816
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,613
and you expect some really tough fighter,

817
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:57,158
which she is, but she's also
one of the nicest people around,

818
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,579
and so, she actually, when I first said,
"Hey, do you wanna do this?"

819
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:06,292
She was like, "So, it's a bad guy?
I don't know, Tim.

820
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,337
I wanna be a good guy,
I don't wanna be a bad guy."

821
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,633
And she had some second thoughts
about doing it

822
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,344
because she has the heart of a hero.

823
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,596
And that's what she wanted to play.

824
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,641
LIEFELD: And I know for a fact
that she was concerned.

825
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,227
She called me,
she asked me about the character

826
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,522
and I said, "Gina, you need to trust him,

827
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:32,819
"and this is going to be absolutely
a memorable role for you."

828
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,862
And, Tim, when I saw it the first time,

829
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,533
I believe it will be
one of the most popular roles

830
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,452
she's been featured in,
and she's been in some big films.

831
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,873
MILLER: What I was telling Ed was,

832
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:50,419
I said, "I see your character
as Roy Batty in Blade Runner."

833
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:55,967
He's charming and self-educated

834
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,760
and naive at the same time,

835
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:01,264
but he's got this sinister quality to him
that is just frightening,

836
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,891
but also he's got a bit of a sense of humor

837
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,270
and Ed really took that to heart,

838
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,690
and, man, he just nailed this character.

839
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,110
This is one of my favorite scenes.

840
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,071
When he puts him in the punch bowl,

841
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,198
he just fucking kills It.

842
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:23,411
LIEFELD: You know what?
Tim, I have not seen Ed in a film,

843
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,206
and when I saw this,

844
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,417
he holds his weight,
the charisma that he has,

845
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,420
and the way he plays off of Ryan,
again getting back to chemistry.

846
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:38,301
This is one of the best cast films
I've seen in so long

847
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,195
'cause everybody just plays
well with each other.

848
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,264
There's no performance you go,
"That didn't quite cut it."

849
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,349
Everyone blends well together.

850
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,935
And Ryan's a powerhouse.

851
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:53,232
This entire workshop,
he gets the shit beat out of him.

852
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:57,403
It looks like
he went through hell filming this.

853
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,990
That is not comfortable
under any circumstances.

854
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,785
MILLER: This torture montage,
we had a bunch of things,

855
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:09,248
and we didn't want to make it look too
horrible or scarring or like it would kill him,

856
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:14,754
so I was trying to think more things
that were part psychological torture.

857
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,758
And this black goo thing, which
if you saw it on set, it was really funny

858
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,137
because I stupidly didn't test
Ryan in the tub

859
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:27,391
and the tub we had
was actually rather small

860
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,811
and Ryan's feet stuck out the end of it,
they looked really goofy,

861
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,982
but anyway, he walks on set
and he sees us setting up for the shot

862
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,027
and Gina is up there with this stand-in

863
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,447
who was a really well-built,
good-looking guy,

864
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,492
and Gina's like, "Let me go in there,

865
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,994
"and test my role out here,
let me give this a shot."

866
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,497
So, Gina goes up there
and she's with the guy

867
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:55,086
and he gets out of this goo,
which makes him all shiny and slimy,

868
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,855
and Ryan takes one look at that,
and he goes,

869
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,715
"Tim, what the fuck are we doing here?

870
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,968
"I don't know about this, man.
I don't know."

871
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,428
And I'm like, "I know, I know,

872
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,848
I know what it looks like.
Trust me, it's gonna be really cool. ""

873
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,770
And he's like, "All right, all right."
And he goes and he gets in the tank.

874
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,857
And we also had these things
that made bubbles under the water

875
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,111
that of course just looked like
he was farting in the tub.

876
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,113
So, we killed that.

877
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,449
It was one of those moments
where I thought to myself,

878
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:29,578
"I have to test everything," because I have
this idea that I think is gonna be cool

879
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,457
and then, if I don't test it,
I see it on set for the first time,

880
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,793
and there's problems.

881
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,922
How tough can he be...

882
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:47,221
MILLER: So this actor that plays Worm,
who is in the comics, he's in the workshop,

883
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,349
and he's Wade's friend

884
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,437
and Ajax really fucks with him
in order to get back at Wade

885
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,402
and he's got this...
I don't know his powers...

886
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,983
What were his powers in the comics?

887
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,861
He had some kind of mental powers.

888
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,255
LIEFELD: He could get in your head.

889
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:07,366
MILLER: Okay, so, we didn't wanna do
a big metal prosthetic,

890
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,494
but we hinted at it
with the scars on his face,

891
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,748
and um, Hugh Scott did such a great job

892
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,584
with the little screen time
that he actually got.

893
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:22,590
Ryan is great here, too,
he sounds like he's distressed, um,

894
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:29,430
and he's really been tortured horribly
and yet he's distracting Ajax

895
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,060
because he knows otherwise
Hugh is gonna be tortured,

896
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,105
So he's taking a bullet for him
and distracting Ajax

897
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,566
knowing that he's
probably gonna get tortured instead.

898
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:45,154
One of the great little hero moments
that maybe people don't think about it,

899
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,157
what's going on there,
because the jokes are good and it's funny,

900
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,452
but I think it's just a great moment
for Wade.

901
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,580
If your heart rate slows...

902
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,540
meaning you're able to catch your breath...

903
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:00,294
Deadpool's not quite sinister
and he's not quite a hero,

904
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,921
but he's got some heart

905
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:06,926
and that's why he's been so beloved
for so many years.

906
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,304
But never better than here.
And no one told me to say that.

907
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:14,308
I have been a huge fan of this,
from the script

908
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,813
to the product that you guys...
The art that you have delivered here.

909
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,902
And I can't wait until the world will...
I guess they've already seen it.

910
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:29,824
It's very exciting as
people who have seen it have gone

911
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,909
absolutely crazy for this.

912
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,621
And it's just a good movie, like you said,
everything you said, it's just a good film.

913
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,541
It's not just a good comic book film.
It's just a good film.

914
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:43,003
It's got a great story, great characters,
great consequences.

915
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,464
This is horrible.

916
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:51,137
MILLER: But as an animator,
Ed's face is so mobile it's crazy.

917
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,141
The way his jaw muscles move and the
way his face is just always in motion...

918
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,225
LIEFELD: And that mouth.

919
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,979
MILLER: Fuck, it's crazy.
LIEFELD: Yeah. He's terrific.

920
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,565
Yeah, he's I'm sure...

921
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,736
MILLER: And Ryan just does
this amazing job.

922
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,199
It's all in the eyes,
he just looks so scared

923
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,369
and yet tough, and yet vulnerable
all at the same time.

924
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,705
Even when he's selling the joke,

925
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,292
like the joke here, you know,
he's pretending to be in pain

926
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,335
and then he turns it around with a joke.

927
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,173
LIEFELD: And again,
that doesn't look comfortable.

928
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,344
The amount of discomfort
that Ryan put himself through for this.

929
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,472
MILLER: Oh, my God, it really is like

930
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,141
the whole movie was designed
to make him uncomfortable.

931
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:41,312
This, you can only do so many takes
'cause he's really gasping.

932
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,814
You can't fake
getting red in the face like this,

933
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,150
you gotta choke yourself out.

934
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:51,363
And he was either
covered in this smothering makeup

935
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,825
or in a suit
that was incredibly uncomfortable.

936
00:49:54,909 --> 00:50:00,206
And a friend of mine, actually,
played stunt double for something else,

937
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,726
he's like, "Dude, I don't know how
he fucking wears that suit,

938
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,377
"it's so hot and uncomfortable,

939
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,338
"and much less, act in it."

940
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,758
LIEFELD: I remember Morena at the Hall H
talking about how much he smelled...

941
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,404
- (MILLER LAUGHING)
- LIEFELD: ...coming out of the suit.

942
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,098
She uh, commented on how bad,
and I'm like,

943
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,410
"Come on, you're wearing leather,
of course you're gonna stink.""

944
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,062
MILLER: I didn't notice it.
I didn't notice the smell.

945
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,939
LIEFELD: Oh, this is great. Look at him.

946
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,607
...high enough
to trigger a mutation.

947
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,443
LIEFELD: Now, uh, Bill Corso,

948
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:36,534
I met Bill, day one,
and when I entered the makeup trailer

949
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:42,164
this life-size head of Ryan
that they had used,

950
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,501
- that Bill had created...
- MILLER: Which is now in my office.

951
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,895
LIEFELD: Oh, dude.
MILLER: Yeah, I know.

952
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:50,039
LIEFELD: It scared the crap out of me.
MILLER: Bill gave it to me as a present.

953
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,011
LIEFELD: |/ walked into the trailer
and no one was there yet

954
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:59,598
and opened it, and there is
a life-size Ryan Reynolds head,

955
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,977
as disfigured Wade,
looking right back at you.

956
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,480
I did a double take.
Bill obviously was fantastic.

957
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,400
The makeup work that he did is terrific.

958
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,444
MILLER: When we first started,
Ryan, he's done a lot of movies,

959
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,088
and he knows everybody in the business,

960
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,323
Ryan immediately said,
"We gotta get Bill Corso,

961
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,576
"he's the best guy in the world

962
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,662
"and he's the only guy
that should be doing this."

963
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,665
And he just came in, did an amazing job,

964
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,585
and we tried a whole variety of
looks and feel

965
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,004
and we're trying to walk
that balance between,

966
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,922
you don't wanna make him repulsive.

967
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:36,635
Sometimes in the comics
he's drawn with oozing pustules

968
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,265
and the skin rotted off
SO you see tendons underneath.

969
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,351
I don't think we could have done that.

970
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,521
But also, he needs to be

971
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:53,277
hideously deformed enough that it
drives the whole plot,

972
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,574
because he's too ashamed of how he looks
to go back to the woman he loves.

973
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:05,539
So, it was this fine balance of
how horrible he could look

974
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:09,460
and still be empathetic.

975
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:13,964
LIEFELD: Great makeup effects, especially
in the age of CGl, is kind of a lost art.

976
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,050
And when you see the work Bill did...

977
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,552
'Cause he showed me his portfolio

978
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:23,474
and everything that he was doing,
and the full body that's coming, of Ryan,

979
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,227
again his artistry, he is a master.

980
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,938
MILLER: Every day in this makeup,
the sweat would pool

981
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,191
underneath it on Ryan's skin,

982
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,319
so by the end of
five or six hours of shooting,

983
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:41,283
he would literally have a cupful of water
beneath the makeup in his skin

984
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:45,245
and it would have driven
any person insane.

985
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:48,165
So, as soon as we had the last shot
of the day that required makeup

986
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,959
he would immediately
start tearing his face off.

987
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:52,753
We got some great shots of that

988
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,464
behind the scenes
of him pulling the makeup off,

989
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,675
like, "Oh, my God, get it off."

990
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:01,178
LIEFELD: Yeah, again I'm talking about the
torture that he's going through in this,

991
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,141
the workshop, but again,
Ryan Reynolds, man, gave it all

992
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,144
for this film. All that makeup...

993
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,564
MILLER: He paid for his art.
LIEFELD: ...that alone, this is terrific.

994
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,820
So, this workshop sequence
we shot in two days, um, and, uh,

995
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,990
and one day of it was supposed to be
main unit, which was me,

996
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:26,286
and the other day was supposed
to be second unit, which was Rob Alonzo.

997
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,874
It was shot on a Saturday, second unit,
and I was supposed to be off,

998
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,169
but I wanted to shoot this sequence so bad

999
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:38,090
I just said, "Rob, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
come on my day off and shoot."

1000
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,092
I didn't actually have any days off,

1001
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:44,179
<i>but I came and shot the sequence
'cause it was so great.</i>

1002
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,975
But they were some long days,
they were 16 hours of shooting

1003
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,020
and for Ryan, in that makeup,
the full body thing,

1004
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,649
took about six hours
to get the face and body on

1005
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,404
and so, he had that on top of a 16-hour day

1006
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,824
of shooting inside this place,

1007
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,077
which a lot of that fire is CG,
but a lot of it isn't.

1008
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:12,458
And so, the rest of the crew were
all in fire suits with breathers on

1009
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,126
and everything else.

1010
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,920
And they're running around in this heat.

1011
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,090
And every take where you turn,
the fire comes up.

1012
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,384
It's fucking hot in there,

1013
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,263
and these guys are sweating.

1014
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:31,560
And I couldn't wear a mask either
because I'm yelling all the time,

1015
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,899
so I just probably took a couple of years
off my life sucking down fumes.

1016
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,589
LIEFELD: Hey, you paid for your art.
MILLER: But it was great.

1017
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,076
Each time I see this it's...
I mean, come on. One of them's naked.

1018
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,121
This is as raw a fight as I've seen.

1019
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,998
That punch right there was...

1020
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,875
MILLER: Brutal.
LIEFELD: Oh, crazy.

1021
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:59,421
<i>MILLER: This is where... Again,
16 hours of shooting on top of Ryan's...</i>

1022
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:04,218
Ryan, on one take, literally fell asleep
in that harness when he's there,

1023
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:08,555
because he's exhausted,
but always had a good mood,

1024
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,349
always ready to do another take.

1025
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,393
Ed 16 hours, too,

1026
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,731
and just hopping to get in.

1027
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,859
"Don't let stunt guys do it, Tim.
Put me in, put me in, put me in."

1028
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,236
It was great.

1029
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,529
Hugh waited around all day

1030
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,215
- 'cause we shot that at the end.
- LIEFELD: Sure.

1031
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,366
<i>MILLER: It was terrible.
I felt so bad for him.</i>

1032
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:31,745
But I love it, too, I think it's
one of the most brutal scenes in the movie.

1033
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,208
In the original script, um,

1034
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,837
he wins that fight against Ajax.

1035
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,633
<i>But we changed it because,
of course, the bad guy's gotta win.</i>

1036
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,010
LIEFELD: Absolutely, it was the right call.

1037
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:52,850
And this emergence scene
is really beautifully shot.

1038
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:57,813
And all the soot and the grime on Ryan

1039
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,524
is really memorable.

1040
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,151
As an artist, it really
burned into my head.

1041
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:07,239
I'm like, "This is a great depiction
of the character."

1042
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:11,201
MILLER: Yeah, we had to shoot this
on the stage

1043
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,328
'cause we couldn't find a good location.

1044
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,541
So, the art department put together
this great little set

1045
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,544
that we could have it be one long move.

1046
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,881
And we had to bury Ryan in all the shit
that, I don't know what,

1047
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,008
I'm sure it's reasonably safe.

1048
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,219
But you don't want to be breathing it in.

1049
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:34,558
And so, Ryan had to put a little mask on
as we buried him beneath all this shit

1050
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,393
and wait for the cameras to roll.

1051
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,956
LIEFELD: That right there, that is...

1052
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,647
MILLER: It's a great shot.
LIEFELD: It is fantastic.

1053
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,821
Rainy Vancouver, you didn't really need
to make it rain there, did you?

1054
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:54,036
MILLER: No. This just so happened,
a fortuitous event.

1055
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,414
'Cause we were pretty lucky
with the weather most of the shoot.

1056
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:01,209
This day, we wanted it to rain. And it did.

1057
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:05,339
"Cause we never would have been able to
bring all this rain into the street

1058
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,299
if it hadn't been raining already.

1059
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,551
It's pretty miserable to shoot in...

1060
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,738
LIEFELD: But it worked out,
it worked out great.

1061
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,490
MILLER: Yeah, it really did. LIEFELD:
It sets the tone, it sets the mood.

1062
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,350
This does, this wrenches your heart.

1063
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,813
MILLER: Yeah, this was a later add.

1064
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:26,068
And we just felt like
we really needed to see

1065
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,781
Wade try and go and get his old life back.

1066
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,992
And just can't quite get over

1067
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,205
the shame of what he's become,

1068
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,042
and can't bring Vanessa into that world.

1069
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,088
And so, he tries, but he can't do it.

1070
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,715
- And you really feel how close he gets.
- Yeah.

1071
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,471
MILLER: And this is one of the things where

1072
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,474
I think everybody empathizes with it
to some degree.

1073
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:02,229
But I also think that
Vanessa would have taken him back.

1074
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:06,066
She's the stronger character,
and we prove it at the end.

1075
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,609
And he should have gone back to her.

1076
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,821
If he was stronger, it would have worked.

1077
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,990
But there would be no movie then.

1078
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,313
LIEFELD: It plays on the insecurities
that everybody has.

1079
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,662
Now, this, Tim, and all these
insults they're about to trade,

1080
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,414
how many versions of this are there?

1081
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,833
MILLER: Oh, we got quite a lot of that.

1082
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:29,756
T.J. and Ryan both had
their fair share of comebacks here.

1083
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,384
So, we just let this roll.

1084
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,262
And you know Ryan,
he's very generous as an actor.

1085
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:40,225
When we got to this scene, Ryan is like,
"T.J., this is all you, my friend.

1086
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,935
"You just go."

1087
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,564
And it was literally this showcase for T.J.

1088
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,275
to do run after run of insults.

1089
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,074
LIEFELD: It is where he absolutely shines.

1090
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,660
He's so good at this.

1091
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,789
And in the trailers
and the commercials alone,

1092
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,292
I think I've seen four versions of this.

1093
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,005
You guys use various
versions of it to sell.

1094
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,649
MILLER: Yeah, it's a pretty funny scene.

1095
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:17,220
In the audience screens,
it never quite got as many laughs

1096
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,474
as it did when you watch it out of context,

1097
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:25,395
because you've been in the workshop
watching torture,

1098
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:31,735
and really watching this heartbreaking
scene as he tries to go back to Vanessa.

1099
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,904
And so, you've been in the darkness
a long time,

1100
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,074
and then, suddenly you come out
and you need to laugh.

1101
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,367
And it's a hard transition.

1102
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,702
What?

1103
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,638
LIEFELD: Look at all that.
MILLER: But it works.

1104
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:47,334
LIEFELD: Look at all that. Ryan is
acting through all of that amazing...

1105
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,835
MILLER: Makeup.

1106
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,589
LIEFELD: ...Bill Corso artwork on his face.

1107
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,092
MILLER: I fucking love
that "Captain Deadpool" joke.

1108
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,195
MILLER: Yeah, just so cool.
LIEFELD: Yeah, that was fantastic.

1109
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,262
MILLER: Yeah, just
a great little misdirect.

1110
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,430
Deadpool.

1111
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:01,954
That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

1112
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,016
(GLASSES CLINK)

1113
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:08,271
MILLER: T.J. added the,
"That sounds like a fucking franchise."

1114
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:13,193
He did a couple of lines
that sort of violated my rules,

1115
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,570
for nobody breaks the fourth wall.

1116
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,281
But Deadpool, Wade doesn't break it.

1117
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,660
But, I don't know, it
doesn't really break it,

1118
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:25,122
but it suggests
that he knows he's in a movie.

1119
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,334
But they were just so funny
that we had to keep it.

1120
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:35,090
LIEFELD: This is the freshest take
on Deadpool creating his costume

1121
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,342
that there has been
in the history of Deadpool.

1122
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,764
And this comes right at
the right time in the movie.

1123
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,642
It really gives it the pop,
like you said, we've been in the workshop.

1124
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,037
- My gosh, he's trying to get the stains out.
- MILLER: Oh, Yeah.

1125
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,481
We had this laundry scene in there

1126
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:56,528
and Ryan is like, "We should bring Leslie
back up and put her in this scene."

1127
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,698
'Cause we never suggest
how those two meet.

1128
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,993
And that was a great idea,
putting her in that scene.

1129
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,286
LIEFELD: I didn't know that.

1130
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:08,915
'Cause it works perfectly,
it does make their intro sweeter.

1131
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,251
- (PEOPLE SCREAMING)
- WADE: Don't make me ask twice.

1132
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,879
Where...

1133
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,173
is Francis?

1134
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,341
He made me ask twice.

1135
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,177
Is the mask muffling my voice?

1136
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,263
MILLER: And so, we went and shot
a lot of these little pieces.

1137
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,349
Like, the swords
and this little workshop gun

1138
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,518
and this little fight here on the stairs.

1139
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,520
We shot that all in and around this place.

1140
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,480
We just made locations.

1141
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:36,151
We found locations in this complex
to shoot these little vignettes.

1142
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:40,238
And because we're in Canada,
and of course everybody is into ice hockey,

1143
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:43,366
our first AD said,

1144
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:47,537
"Fellows, Zamboni.
We should do a sequence with a Zamboni."

1145
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,582
I'm like,
"Oh, my God, that's great. Absolutely."

1146
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:54,502
And I think I laughed harder
when Ryan was on that Zamboni,

1147
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:55,962
driving around, filming that.

1148
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,232
I think I laughed harder
than any other time in the movie.

1149
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,050
- He was so funny.
- LIEFELD: Look.

1150
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,885
Great humor comes out of great visuals,

1151
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,138
and him on the Zamboni,
and the way you blocked the shot,

1152
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,723
and him leaning in,

1153
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,309
it's just a funny shot.

1154
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,603
(STUTTERING)

1155
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,358
And the reveal of how far he is
from the Zamboni. (LAUGHING)

1156
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,817
MILLER: Yeah, he's great.

1157
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:21,404
That's the ultimate joke payoff.
It's so good.

1158
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,370
MILLER: So, Deadpool's been
working his way up through Ajax's crew.

1159
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,206
So, finally he's gonna get Agent Smith,
who he finds...

1160
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,083
The original idea is

1161
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:39,256
it's sort of a hospital for people
that can't afford real hospitals.

1162
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,842
It's sort of set up in the back of
this rice warehouse.

1163
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:47,347
And he goes to recruit somebody
and Deadpool's tracked him down.

1164
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,516
So, Ryan had...

1165
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,435
Jesus, what a run on this. He's up there.

1166
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:57,357
We've got maybe 10 or 15 alts
for that little moment up there.

1167
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,236
LIEFELD: And he would
stay in the costume...

1168
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,863
Through all those takes,
would the mask stay on?

1169
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,031
MILLER: Oh, yeah.

1170
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,450
LIEFELD: So, he's in the mask 15 takes.

1171
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,161
- Wow.
- MILLER: Oh, yeah.

1172
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,080
LIEFELD: "Cause that mask is snug.

1173
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,456
Mr. Wilson?

1174
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,626
LIEFELD: Look at those ears.
Look, it's pressing up.

1175
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,430
MILLER: Yeah. No, it's not comfortable.
LIEFELD: That is a snug mask.

1176
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,774
MILLER: This lady in the background here
was great.

1177
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:27,137
This extra, every time she did Just
a really terrific take of being surprised

1178
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,388
every time we killed Jed.

1179
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,806
LIEFELD: Oh, this is fantastic.

1180
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,058
You might wanna
look away for this.

1181
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,505
Now this little piggy went to...

1182
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,853
(AGENT SMITH SCREAMS)

1183
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,897
WADE: Thank you, Agent Smith.

1184
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,193
Taxi!

1185
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,239
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1186
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,867
LIEFELD: Look, here's...

1187
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,076
Come on. How many...

1188
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,747
In an age where the other heroes
ride these fancy jets,

1189
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,292
even in this movie
you got Colossus in the Blackbird.

1190
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,561
MILLER: You got Deadpool in a cab.

1191
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,354
LIEFELD: And you got Deadpool
taking the taxi.

1192
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,673
It just is why this movie works so well.

1193
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,592
It's just taking a different page.

1194
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,723
MILLER: Ha. I love this scene.

1195
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:15,393
We did a bunch of different takes on this,

1196
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:19,856
but the one we used was
Ryan gets really angry in the middle

1197
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,027
about the wrong guy getting dismembered.

1198
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,363
Oh, my God. So many of these things,

1199
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,366
I forget sometimes that I'm directing.

1200
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:33,828
And I'm sitting over there at the monitor
and I ruin lots and lots of takes

1201
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,414
because I would forget
and I would just start laughing.

1202
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,375
And then people would get mad at me.

1203
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,879
And luckily, our monitors were
quite a ways away from the action

1204
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,965
because when Ryan did that,
it fucking cracked me up.

1205
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,260
But I wasn't near a microphone, thank God.

1206
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,345
Her.

1207
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,890
(GASPS) Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

1208
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,684
That's like 16 walls.

1209
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,397
That joke, fresh to the film,

1210
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,651
it's why my respect for Rhett and Paul
is just off the charts.

1211
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,239
You all took Deadpool
to a level he hasn't been,

1212
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:13,201
and it's why the film has had
the reaction it's had.

1213
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,245
MILLER: That joke is super-meta.

1214
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,539
LIEFELD: Super-meta.

1215
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,249
Oh, my gosh. And the cruelty.

1216
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,419
These are some of the first scenes
you showed me when I...

1217
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:27,257
MILLER: Yeah, this was the first week
we shot all the stuff in Deadpool's lair.

1218
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,844
LIEFELD: And you showed these
to me on your iPad.

1219
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,431
And his cruelly there is...

1220
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,558
It plays right, it plays great.

1221
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:41,354
MILLER: Originally this was written,
and it was throughout the movie,

1222
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,106
there was a little more slapstick.

1223
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,985
Like, she falls down, then the door
hits her in the head and knocks her,

1224
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,862
and Deadpool steps on her.

1225
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,115
And we actually filmed a version of that.

1226
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,034
And as soon as we started filming it,

1227
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,329
I don't know, it just
didn't feel quite right.

1228
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,916
And I wanted it to be
a little bit more believable and realistic,

1229
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,217
and it kind of jumped
the shark a little bit.

1230
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,922
So, we altered the tone
right at the beginning there

1231
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,178
<i>that ultimately, I think,
was a better one for the film.</i>

1232
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:17,140
Where I don't think it would have
the same heart and reality

1233
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:21,269
- If we had made it more Airplane! Yeah.
- LIEFELD: It was the right call.

1234
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,523
And what's about to come up here,

1235
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:29,277
that's the perfect amount of
what you're talking about right there.

1236
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,778
You didn't need anything else.

1237
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:36,951
MILLER: Oh, my God. That thing would not
fall on cue, and it would not go together.

1238
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:42,957
We were behind schedule already, and
the props guys, I felt so sorry for them,

1239
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:48,254
'cause we couldn't get that dresser
to fall over the way we wanted it to.

1240
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:53,092
And the clock's ticking,
and people are standing around,

1241
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,970
and it's terrible when shit doesn't work.

1242
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,472
I felt so badly for them.

1243
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,683
I felt badly for all of us
'cause we were all fucked,

1244
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,311
but particularly for those guys.
But they pulled it together.

1245
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,747
LIEFELD: It's kind of stuff
you never think about.

1246
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,011
I would never have considered that
if you didn't tell me.

1247
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,027
MILLER: I know, it's one of those things
where you don't think is gonna fuck up.

1248
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,451
So, this little piece here is

1249
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,872
Angel Dust putting super-slaves
into the cabinets

1250
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,917
and shipping them out to people
that have bought them.

1251
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:30,129
So, there's a few super-slaves there
being readied for transport.

1252
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,965
That's what's going on there.

1253
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,760
There was some confusion about this
from the audience,

1254
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,805
and I don't think we ever did
a good job of making it clear,

1255
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:44,269
but Ajax has increased strength
and speed and durability,

1256
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,104
but he doesn't heal like Deadpool.

1257
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,274
His power is those things that I mentioned,

1258
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:52,860
but also the fact that
he doesn't feel pain at all.

1259
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:56,948
So, you really have to
completely debilitate him to stop him.

1260
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,617
And so, there we have that scene where

1261
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:03,162
it's meant to display the fact
that he doesn't heal like Deadpool.

1262
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:06,708
LIEFELD: Now, how many days
did Blind Al film?

1263
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,587
She was there about a week and a half.

1264
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,922
(LIEFELD LAUGHING)

1265
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:18,428
LIEFELD: See, that's all...
The missed table gets me every time.

1266
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,721
And the little hand.

1267
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:23,391
Oh, I cannot tell you how many people
have talked to me about the little hand.

1268
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:27,937
You know when you nail a joke. This one.

1269
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,522
It's so creepy. It's so creepy.

1270
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,275
MILLER: Leslie was amazing.
She was so professional.

1271
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,319
She would do anything.

1272
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,738
She's so respectable and kind.

1273
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:41,701
But I would go, "Hey, say,
'Sounds like you got a dick in your mouth."

1274
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,287
And she'll say,
"Sounds like you got a dick in your mouth."

1275
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,624
And I'd go,
"Okay. Now say this really filthy thing."

1276
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:50,793
And she would do it.
Never questioned it. She'd just do it.

1277
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,755
LIEFELD: And, Tim, was she in Roots?

1278
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,715
MILLER: She was, yeah.
LIEFELD: Yeah.

1279
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,925
She is so good in this role.

1280
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:02,722
And she does so much with
a relative, small role in the film,

1281
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,307
but she's meaningful.

1282
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,934
In the meantime,

1283
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,478
you might wanna leave the room.

1284
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,522
I bet it feels huge
in this hand.

1285
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,401
MILLER: Ed and Gina and T.J.,

1286
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,237
their entrance is cued
off the end of his jokes.

1287
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:22,075
So, he told 10 different jokes here
to these guys

1288
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,702
and every one of them had
a different rhythm to it.

1289
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,830
And so, Ed and Gina would start to walk in

1290
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,792
and then stop because
the joke wasn't finished.

1291
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:34,212
And I'm like, "T.J., just tell
the same fucking joke, please,

1292
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,589
"because they gotta walk in
on the end of it."

1293
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,468
But he is uncontrollable
in the best possible way.

1294
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:45,973
LIEFELD: Oh, I think anybody who saw him
at Hall H saw how uncontrollable he can be.

1295
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,850
He is a force.

1296
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,829
I would not know
this was the first day they filmed.

1297
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,522
You don't pick that up at all.

1298
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,441
MILLER: Yeah.

1299
01:09:55,525 --> 01:10:00,405
It's nice about her, she's looking at
him like you can tell that he's in control

1300
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:02,675
- and she's there to do...
- LIEFELD: Waiting for the cue.

1301
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,033
MILLER: Yeah, do what he wants.

1302
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:09,122
I wanted to do this little thing
where she picks Weasel up here

1303
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,666
and is a little minor display of strength.

1304
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,043
And I asked for it and they were like,

1305
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:17,088
"Oh no, we can't rig wires
and you gotta put him in a harness,"

1306
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,132
and all that other stuff.

1307
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:23,052
And again, I said,
"What if we just put an apple box tier?"

1308
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:26,305
And when Gina grabs his throat,
he steps up on the apple box.

1309
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,784
LIEFELD: Works great. You'd never know.
MILLER: Yeah, you'd never know.

1310
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,934
You'd never know.

1311
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:35,314
LIEFELD: I was gonna ask you
if she really lifted him up.

1312
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,358
'Cause, as you know, Gina is very strong.

1313
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,902
- Yeah. But she's not quite that strong.
- No, I guess not.

1314
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,404
Whoo.

1315
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,740
MILLER: Yeah, originally there was a fight.

1316
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:47,660
There was a character Wyre
in the original script.

1317
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,831
And he comes after Wyre

1318
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:56,085
and catches him in
the back of a strip club,

1319
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:59,005
which was a really nice fight scene
in the original script,

1320
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,923
and kind of funny, too.

1321
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,848
Have you decided
what you're gonna say to her?

1322
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:03,885
Fuck me!

1323
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,930
MILLER: But when we go in here now...

1324
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,893
This is No5 Orange.
This is a real strip club in Vancouver.

1325
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,354
And these guys were so great
about letting us shoot there.

1326
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,900
And I went in and I got
the original guy who...

1327
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,444
I haven't been to any strip clubs.

1328
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,406
But if you do, you notice these guys
that announce the girls,

1329
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,368
sometimes they're comedians
and they have their own little act.

1330
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,121
So, I asked the guy
who normally announces the girls

1331
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:35,416
to give me some lines
that maybe Stan could say.

1332
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,794
They were so incredibly foul.

1333
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:41,380
I gave them to Stan Lee and I'm like,
"Here's some suggestions."

1334
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,674
And Stan and his folks go,

1335
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:47,845
"Tim, come on, Stan can't say this stuff.

1336
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,847
"This is really tasteless and terrible.""

1337
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,516
LIEFELD: It worked out.

1338
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,477
MILLER: But it's perfect for what
it... Yeah. LIEFELD: This is perfect.

1339
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,314
He has that one line later.
You just hear him over...

1340
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,816
It's my favorite line.

1341
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,544
MILLER: Oh, "You can't buy love,
but you can rent it for three minutes."

1342
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,611
LIEFELD: That's right.

1343
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,774
MILLER: Yeah.
LIEFELD: It's the "three minutes" line.

1344
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,258
MILLER: This is one of my favorite scenes
in the movie, too.

1345
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,283
LIEFELD: Oh, me, too.

1346
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,911
MILLER: It always worked
'cause of this beautiful slow-mo.

1347
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:17,166
Our cinematographer, our DP, Ken Seng,

1348
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,586
he just did a great job
lighting this whole scene.

1349
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,296
(MUSIC FADES IN)

1350
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,631
(MEN CHEERING)

1351
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,884
ANNOUNCER: You can't buy love,

1352
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,512
but you can rent it
for three minutes.

1353
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:31,889
(EXHALES)

1354
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,102
MILLER: This was shot separately.

1355
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,146
That bar is actually at Sister Margaret's.

1356
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:42,859
I'm sorry, that bathroom
is actually Sister Margaret's bathroom.

1357
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,778
In that club. Uh.

1358
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,198
And then the club is No5 Orange.

1359
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:53,786
No5 Orange's bathroom
was actually way too nice. Um, but, uh...

1360
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:59,959
It was the longest day of the shoot,
so we shot all day in the strip club.

1361
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,629
And we were behind the whole day,
SO much so

1362
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:07,925
that I didn't have time to actually enjoy
the beautiful women all around.

1363
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:12,805
I was so intent on getting the shots.

1364
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,057
And then we moved to another location.

1365
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,828
LIEFELD: Is this closer to Sister
Margaret's? MILLER: And we did this alley.

1366
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,532
Yeah, this is closer to Sister Margaret's.

1367
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:23,107
And then we did this alley sequence
at the end of the day,

1368
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,776
and just dealing with rain.

1369
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,737
It's not really raining here.

1370
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,907
It's actually rain machines up on the roof.

1371
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,630
But just shooting in that, it's difficult
because after every take,

1372
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:37,038
you have to take the actors in
and dry them off and everything like that.

1373
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,748
And it's cold because it's Vancouver.

1374
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:42,960
Although the water's warmed up,
it's still cold and miserable.

1375
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:47,062
LIEFELD: That entire area around
where you shot Sister Margaret's,

1376
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,769
when we were being driven there,
they said,

1377
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,093
"You know,
they found themselves a really...

1378
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,971
"That dive bar was
in a dive part of the town."

1379
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,097
MILLER: Oh, yeah.

1380
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,350
LIEFELD: So, those locations
served you so well.

1381
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:58,726
MILLER: There's a...

1382
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,787
The bar we were really going
to shoot for Sister Margaret's

1383
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,065
was a bar which was really terrific,

1384
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:07,860
but it was a real dive bar.

1385
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,948
MILLER: And this is in
a pretty scummy part of town.

1386
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:15,534
And it's funny 'cause they have to
clean the alleys out completely

1387
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:20,289
and then dress it back up
with fake junk and fake garbage

1388
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,749
so it's clean.

1389
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,001
Although, how clean can you get an alley?

1390
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:27,546
And we're still throwing Morena down
on the ground in it and everything else.

1391
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,633
I don't think it's in the DVD extras,

1392
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,094
but we had originally had
a little bigger scene with her

1393
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:36,305
where she fights back a little bit more,
she punches Angel Dust.

1394
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:41,644
And then she grabs a Taser out of her purse
and she jams it into Angel Dust.

1395
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,647
And then Angel Dust
just doesn't even do anything.

1396
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,526
And she crushes the Taser in her hand
and then throws her up against the wall.

1397
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,862
But again,
you just gotta move things along.

1398
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,700
LIEFELD: The pacing of the film
is one of the best attributes of it.

1399
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,243
It's lean, it's mean.

1400
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,913
There are so many movies in
the last several years that are so bloated.

1401
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,707
And this one just moves.

1402
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,360
MILLER: Ryan made fun of me for...

1403
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,628
I got a little choked up
when he shot this scene

1404
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,588
because he's just so good.

1405
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,549
He comes in and he's so full of rage.

1406
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:17,138
And you can just feel it
coming off of him in waves.

1407
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,848
And he was going for it.

1408
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,184
And he came in
and after two or three takes, he's like,

1409
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:25,604
"Okay, I only got a few
of these takes like that in me."

1410
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:30,317
Because it's just so big
the way he was playing it.

1411
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:33,654
LIEFELD: And this is early on in the shoot.
This is, again, first-week stuff.

1412
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:38,325
MILLER: Yeah, first or second week
we'd shot all the stuff in this location.

1413
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:42,496
Because you go to one location,
you shoot everything out there.

1414
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,873
Then you go to another location

1415
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,459
and sometimes it's not in order
or sequence.

1416
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,752
So, yeah,

1417
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:51,047
even though it's the end of the movie,
it was the beginning of the shoot.

1418
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,674
LIEFELD: And this is, by far,
my favorite exchange

1419
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:57,011
between Blind Al and Wade.

1420
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,097
MILLER: You mean the payoff on the Ikea?
LIEFELD: Yes.

1421
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,242
MILLER: Or the cure for blindness?
LIEFELD: And what he says...

1422
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:05,853
- The cure for blindness and the cocaine.
- MILLER: Yeah.

1423
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,563
No, I love that one.

1424
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,191
LIEFELD: And I love that she has a gun.

1425
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:18,157
And here's where
we say goodbye to Weasel.

1426
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,409
MILLER: Yeah, "I'd go with you,
but I don't wanna."

1427
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,871
That was a T.J. ad-lib,
I believe, on the day.

1428
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:30,169
Yeah, the cure for blindness thing
was fucking awesome.

1429
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,673
And Leslie just plays it so straight.

1430
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,902
...buried somewhere
in the apartment...

1431
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,388
I don't think it's on the DVD, we cut it.

1432
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,933
Originally, she's gonna
hand him the little gun,

1433
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,016
and then, before she hands it to him,
she turns around and shoots the Roomba

1434
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:48,938
and Kills it.

1435
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,649
And she goes, "It was either him or me."

1436
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,068
Which was a nice little thing,

1437
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,088
but again, it was funny
but we cut it out for pacing.

1438
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,988
LIEFELD: Now, where is this shipyard?

1439
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,867
MILLER: You mean in real life or...
LIEFELD: In Vancouver?

1440
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,036
MILLER: Oh, yeah. This shipyard...

1441
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,790
Well, the scrapyard, the bottom part of it

1442
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:12,545
that we have the big fight in
is the Amix scrapyard.

1443
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:16,465
And that's in a different place
than where this set actually is,

1444
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:20,678
which is out in a place called Richmond
in a giant parking lot

1445
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,514
<i>where we had several sets.</i>

1446
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:28,769
We had the top of the flight deck
for the carrier.

1447
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:32,398
And we also had the tilting flight deck,
which was this big gimbal set.

1448
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,161
And then we had the collapsed flight deck.

1449
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,068
They were all three different big sets

1450
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,404
out in this parking lot
in the middle of nowhere.

1451
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:39,572
So, the bottom,

1452
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,175
everything you see in the bottom
of the scrapyard's a different place.

1453
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,828
This is a huge moment, huge joke,
maybe one of the best jokes in the film.

1454
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,914
MILLER: The, "Looks like you couldn't
afford another X-Man."

1455
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,291
Yeah, that's...

1456
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:54,920
LIEFELD: Didn't see it coming.
And it gets roars.

1457
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,840
MILLER: We shot all this on the stage,
and Ryan,

1458
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,676
again, he just did a bunch of ad-libs.

1459
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,428
We've got so many options here

1460
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:07,975
that sometimes there was a couple
where I was laughing so hard that...

1461
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:12,229
We had enough material, by far,
but I was still in the middle of laughing.

1462
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:17,359
And so, we were just going again
because it was easy to reset.

1463
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,628
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1464
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,755
It's a big house.
It's funny that I only ever see two of you.

1465
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:24,033
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1466
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,097
WADE: And that is why,
in my opinion...

1467
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,582
the movie Cocoon
is pure pornography.

1468
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:37,046
LIEFELD: And the big reveal coming here
is also just a great punch in the gut

1469
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,341
when you see Colossus
crammed into the taxi.

1470
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,510
MILLER: Yeah, I always thought
this scene would be great.

1471
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:48,224
It wasn't a huge laugh, but I just thought,

1472
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:51,644
for a comic book fan, it's just great.

1473
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:56,106
LIEFELD: And here's where we see the
payoff of all the suggestions he gave...

1474
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,001
MILLER: For the Dopinder scene.
LIEFELD: In the opening...

1475
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,445
MILLER: Ryan on the day, came up
with the whole whisper thing.

1476
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,781
Originally we played this pretty straight.

1477
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,576
But then Ryan had this idea
to do the whispers,

1478
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,412
which, I think,
makes the whole scene work.

1479
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,332
LIEFELD: It absolutely enhances
the entire exchange.

1480
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:19,338
Ban who?

1481
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,591
LIEFELD: Okay, we have gone this far
and we have not discussed

1482
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,802
how brilliant Colossus' voice is.

1483
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,513
(STUTTERING)

1484
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:31,433
We are going to hear people
imitating Colossus for...

1485
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,853
In the way people imitated Borat. Uh.

1486
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:39,275
And other... The voice is So...

1487
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,068
It has such great impact.

1488
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:46,615
Is this the same actor who's
acting him out and giving the voice?

1489
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,617
LIEFELD: Or did you combine
the two elements?

1490
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:50,021
MILLER: No, Andre did him on set.

1491
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,791
Well, Colossus is really...

1492
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,629
It takes a village to create
a CG character like that.

1493
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,632
But Stefan is the guy who did the voice

1494
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:07,344
and he just came in
and just did an amazing job.

1495
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:11,640
He's got this really rich and
powerful voice, but it's also nuanced

1496
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:15,436
and full of emotion.

1497
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,689
And he plays it straight,
but there's so much range.

1498
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,734
And, man, he's just such an amazing actor.

1499
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:27,656
We would do 10 takes
and every one of them would be different

1500
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,366
and every one of them would be good.

1501
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,553
And I'd go, "Okay, man, we got it covered."
And he'd go,

1502
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,579
"Wait, wait, wait,
I got one more. I got one more."

1503
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,332
And then he'd do another five.

1504
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,167
We have so much good material from him.

1505
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,336
He was so enthusiastic.

1506
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,587
LIEFELD: It's definitive.

1507
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,070
MILLER: And, I think, more than
any other actor in the movie,

1508
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,883
he was so excited.

1509
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,926
He's just such a huge comic book fan.

1510
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:52,556
He was so happy to be in the movie
and be Colossus

1511
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:58,020
that he was literally bouncing
every time he came in to do ADR.

1512
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,271
It was amazing.

1513
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:03,901
LIEFELD: Look, his voice
defines the character.

1514
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:09,073
MILLER: But, really, it's this amalgam
because you have Andre on set.

1515
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:11,533
Then we did motion capture on top of that,

1516
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,179
in which you have another actor playing,
doing the motion capture.

1517
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:17,498
Then you have the facial performance,
which is again a different actor.

1518
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:19,541
And then you have the animators

1519
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:23,587
taking all that data and bringing them
together and tweaking the performance.

1520
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,523
LIEFELD: Well, anybody who knows you,
Tim, knows that

1521
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,550
when you're given a chance
to show how well you can mo-cap,

1522
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:32,471
you're gonna leave it all out there,
and Colossus is 100%.

1523
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,393
Oh, my gosh, I love this.

1524
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:44,274
This whole "What's my name?"
and the "Francis," great bit.

1525
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,902
(LAUGHING)

1526
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,946
WADE: Whoo!

1527
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:50,197
Superhero landing!

1528
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,217
You know,
that's really hard on your knees.

1529
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,659
Totally impractical.
They all do it.

1530
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,704
LIEFELD: When I saw this, I was
not prepared for what's coming.

1531
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,416
They talk about throwing punches
in comics and in film.

1532
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:07,047
And the way he right comes at you in
the foreground here, that's a comic book.

1533
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,258
That's quintessential comic book.

1534
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,010
MILLER: But I'm trying
to make it not unbelievable.

1535
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:16,265
You know, if you had two
super-strong people hitting each other.

1536
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:20,811
LIEFELD: I meant, like, the way Kirby
or Buscema would have cropped that shot.

1537
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:24,022
Like in
How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way,

1538
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,668
they'd say, "Here's how you do it wrong,
and here's how you do it right."

1539
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,110
And that's how you do it right.

1540
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,030
I love what you did with Negasonic.

1541
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,867
All right, then. Fire!

1542
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,201
(GUNS FIRING)

1543
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,538
MILLER: We took a little liberty
with her character.

1544
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,624
In the comics, she can read minds,

1545
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,295
and we had to get special permission
to make her blow up.

1546
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:50,674
But I'm so glad Marvel let us do that.

1547
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:57,639
She was only in three or four
episodes of X-Factor, I believe.

1548
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:02,227
Normally, I'm a by-the-book sort of a guy,

1549
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:06,982
but I thought, "Okay, this is not
a character that is beloved by millions

1550
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,067
"because she's had her own book..."

1551
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,778
LIEFELD: She's being discovered
through this film, for sure.

1552
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:16,950
MILLER: Yeah. So, I felt a little
Hollywood, to be honest, doing it.

1553
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:22,664
Because I feel like you shouldn't
change that basic character.

1554
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,501
But I thought, in her
case, it was worth it.

1555
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,420
LIEFELD: What was the decision
to go with the...

1556
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,940
Because I don't think we've seen
that level of yellow and black,

1557
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,342
the traditional New Mutants costume?

1558
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:37,846
MILLER: Oh, no, it's a new design.

1559
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,933
Again, Josh Shaw designed the costume.

1560
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,726
But it's very much based on...

1561
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,521
I loved New Mutants back in the day.

1562
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:47,314
Remember the Bill Sienkiewicz
run on that?

1563
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:48,941
LIEFELD: Come on, it was the best.

1564
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:56,740
MILLER: I originally thought Cannonball
would be a good trainee to be with him.

1565
01:23:56,823 --> 01:24:02,204
Because I thought, "Okay, you're gonna
take this hick, redneck with an accent,

1566
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,707
"and Deadpool will just have
a fucking field day with him.""

1567
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:06,833
LIEFELD: Oh, come on.

1568
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:09,253
MILLER: And he's visually spectacular, too.

1569
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,880
LIEFELD: No, you made the right choice.

1570
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:14,466
Like I said, Negasonic,
this movie will define her.

1571
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,926
And you're right.

1572
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,594
In this fight, it is very grounded,

1573
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:23,433
and it is a great MMA throwdown.

1574
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,312
MILLER: The amazing thing, though,

1575
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:31,233
again, in hindsight, I
feel like I got so lucky

1576
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:35,904
because Gina was just amazing.

1577
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:40,200
She had a stunt person,
but we laughed all the time,

1578
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:43,745
because she didn't have as much to do
as she should have,

1579
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,999
because Gina just did
all of that stuff herself.

1580
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:51,062
LIEFELD: She was looking forward to this.
MILLER: And she was amazing.

1581
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:56,133
So, we would have her do the fight
with Andre in the suit, or a stunt guy,

1582
01:24:56,216 --> 01:25:00,679
and then she would do it without them,
Just fighting an invisible foe.

1583
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,349
And she was amazing.
It was like she had photographic reflexes.

1584
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:13,942
It's one of the best superhero throwdowns
that I have seen.

1585
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,988
MILLER: So, this of course is Bob.
LIEFELD: Yes.

1586
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:33,128
LIEFELD: I loved
the katana action you worked in here.

1587
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,880
MILLER: Yeah, we'd originally...

1588
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:40,135
Actually, I could've cut some more of that
into the DVD extras, come to think of it.

1589
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,530
LIEFELD: Great joke.
MILLER: We had a little bit more. Yes.

1590
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:43,597
That is so sweet.

1591
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,975
MILLER: Yeah. The boob joke. It's good.

1592
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,352
LIEFELD: Ultimate payoff.

1593
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:52,147
MILLER: As much as I wanted to see
Gina's breasts there, she wouldn't do it.

1594
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,231
I don't blame her.

1595
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,586
LIEFELD: Well, it's gonna play off the fact
that Gina, as beautiful as she is,

1596
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,755
the audience wants to see it, too,
So it plays on their desire.

1597
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:00,864
- And then she gets the last laugh.
- MILLER: Yeah.

1598
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:05,077
LIEFELD: That is a terrific...
That punch to Colossus.

1599
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,287
That's, again, not something
you've seen in a movie.

1600
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:08,890
MILLER: No.
LIEFELD: This entire movie is so fresh.

1601
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,583
MILLER: Unless it's Austin Powers.
We stole it from that.

1602
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,337
Not the punching,
Just the hiding of genitalia.

1603
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,755
LIEFELD: No, no. Sure.

I liked it and I thought it was funny.

1606
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,974
But it really came alive, oddly enough,

1607
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:30,185
when the sound guys put
Deadpool screaming

01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:37,943
In the original script,
when it was Garrison Kane fighting,

1611
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,362
Garrison Kane comes up
to the edge of the flight deck,

1612
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:45,909
and he's firing missiles from his
bionic arm down into the scrapyard,

1613
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:51,790
and Deadpool shoots up on the wing,
knocks him off, he stays up there,

1614
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:55,168
and then Garrison Kane fought NTW
down in the scrapyard.

about cutting out.

One of the guys who is wounded
with the wing grabs his ankle,

01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:26,450
MILLER: Which is
really funny, but I thought

1622
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:30,912
he sees her in the punch bowl,
and he knows that it's some serious shit,

1623
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:35,584
so I wanted to keep focused on
this emotional moment.

1624
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:39,337
And again, it's this weird balance.

1625
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:40,464
"Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1626
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:46,428
LIEFELD: No, you gotta hone the story,
hone the emotion.

1627
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,637
I think it works.

1628
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:51,141
Like I said, you're ready for these two
guys to throw down. It's been building.

1629
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:52,559
MILLER: That's my favorite joke.

1630
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,228
Maybe my favorite joke in the movie.

1631
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:59,024
So many times after that,
on set or something,

1632
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:00,668
we would go, "Yeah, that was a good one,"

1633
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:03,028
and you'd just do that joke
over and over again.

1634
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,782
LIEFELD: You talked about it earlier,
but you can really see Ed.

1635
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:10,744
He does give it everything he's got,
and he sells it.

1636
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:14,289
MILLER: Oh, yeah, they practiced

1637
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,000
and trained and really
worked on this sequence.

1638
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,960
- It's crazy.
- LIEFELD: Love the axes.

1639
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,631
Great choice.
Again, you don't see that in a film.

1640
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:25,634
You don't see that. That's fresh. Great.

1641
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,513
MILLER: Yeah, the axes, they were
always there, from the beginning.

1642
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,181
A little CG move there.

1643
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,601
(COLOSSUS GROANING)

1644
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:37,813
LIEFELD: This low angle you shoot here,
her choking him,

1645
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:42,067
and later you cut back to it again,
just great.

1646
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,944
This right here. Terrific.

1647
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:48,323
MILLER: Yeah, you see all that metal skin
sort of cinched up around the cable.

1648
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,827
It's pretty badass, I love it.
He looks great in that scene.

1649
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:55,121
Oh, sounds like
your last Saturday night.

1650
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,832
MILLER: Another great joke.

1651
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:58,708
Just throwing it away, you know.

1652
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,460
"Sounds like your last Saturday night.""

1653
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,430
LIEFELD: Is this towards
the end of the shoot?

1654
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,809
MILLER: Um, yeah,
this was later in the shoot.

1655
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,603
There was another joke there,

1656
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,982
where Deadpool had him by the mouth,
and he pulls out his tooth,

1657
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:25,068
and he goes, "You see that? You didn't
feel this, did you? It's your tooth."

1658
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:31,074
But again, you shoot all this stuff
and you think...

1659
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:32,510
LIEFELD: No, it's got the right momentum.

1660
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,334
MILLER: Yeah, you just gotta
keep the pace up.

1661
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:39,916
It's great. I love the fact that she
saves him when he's going down.

1662
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,812
LIEFELD: Oh, yeah. Like you said
from the beginning, she's the tough one.

1663
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,171
MILLER: Yeah.
LIEFELD: And she's no damsel.

1664
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,799
MILLER: Even though she's angry, which,

1665
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,468
something we decided to do on set

1666
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:54,556
was lo really make her angry
through this whole sequence.

1667
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,351
LIEFELD: Yes, audience, the cartoon animals
have begun to crawl into the frame.

1668
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,567
This just is disarming
in the best possible way.

1669
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:11,990
MILLER: This was a French artist
one of our guys at Blur knew.

1670
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:19,497
And uh... Nobody was sure that
this was gonna work, most of all me,

1671
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,958
but I thought, "Okay, it's worth a try,""

1672
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,793
and then I fell in love with it.

1673
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:28,089
The first time I saw it, I'm like, "This
might jump the shark, but it's funny."

1674
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:32,552
LIEFELD: Well, if it wasn't set
to Peter Cetera, it wouldn't have worked.

1675
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,305
It works perfectly with Peter Cetera.

1676
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:38,767
MILLER: That Chicago song is the shit.

1677
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,354
For a long time, it was
John Denver's I Want To Live.

1678
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:46,149
But Chicago, at the end of the day, won.

1679
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:50,236
LIEFELD: I tell ya, I could see
an entire movie with Colossus and Brianna.

1680
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,698
I'm not gonna mince words here.
They work so well.

1681
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,826
And people who have seen this movie
have asked me,

1682
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,622
"Hey, when's the spin-off
with Colossus and Negasonic?"

1683
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:03,124
And I'm like, "Well I'm sure
Fox would love to hear that.""

1684
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:05,728
MILLER: Well, they are doing
a New Mutants movie.

1685
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:08,022
LIEFELD: So, there you go, kids.
There's a New Mutants movie coming.

1686
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:10,090
Maybe you'll see Negasonic there.

1687
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:11,675
(SCREAMS)

1688
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:20,642
MILLER: This whole sequence,
it's pretty cool what the effects guys did.

1689
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:26,481
The whole gimbal sliding set
is about 20 by 20.

1690
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,732
It's very small.

1691
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:30,694
And it's on this big arm, moving,

1692
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:35,740
and yet, when the effects are done,
it feels like this huge expanse, high up.

1693
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,867
They did an amazing job with it.

1694
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:43,206
Digital Domain did this sequence,
the bulk of it.

1695
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:48,670
And it's just fucking phenomenal when you
finally see all this stuff going for real.

1696
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:50,481
LIEFELD: For years, I
felt like a lot of movies

1697
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,358
had their biggest moments
in the middle of the movies,

1698
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,467
and the finales were a letdown.

1699
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:59,472
And Deadpool literally gets so much bigger
in this final conflict,

1700
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:03,852
and you feel like the movie's expanded,
it's gotten bigger. The stakes are bigger.

1701
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:05,020
Look at this.

1702
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:08,690
This one, I felt like
I jumped the shark a little bit,

1703
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:13,403
because I really tried hard to make
everything grounded and believable,

1704
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:17,949
but there's no way
she can survive that fall.

1705
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:24,581
Momentum doesn't stop just
because you're encased in something else.

1706
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:26,708
So, she would have died for sure.

1707
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:27,852
LIEFELD: Come on, Tim, you...

1708
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:30,271
MILLER: So, the fans that listen to this
know that I know these things.

1709
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:31,296
LIEFELD: Okay.

1710
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,149
MILLER: Yes. She would have died for sure.
End of story.

1711
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,568
LIEFELD: And you're ruining
my suspension of belief, come on.

1712
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,427
Of course she survived that
in the glass case.

1713
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,722
MILLER: It's not glass.
It's reinforced Plexi.

1714
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,557
LIEFELD: Reinforced Plexi?
MILLER: Yeah.

1715
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,728
But she wouldn't have survived it.

1716
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:51,191
She certainly wouldn't have survived it
without severe damage.

1717
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,836
LIEFELD: So, we can look forward to
something like that on a real...

1718
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,695
MILLER: But she is a mutant, right?

1719
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,698
LIEFELD: I'm contractually
not able to say that.

1720
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:00,533
MILLER: Even though that's not her power.

1721
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,495
WADE: Yoo-hoo!

1722
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,500
Oh, my God! That was so...

1723
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,711
LIEFELD: And again, Morena,

1724
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,465
she's gamer, too, man, she gets
dragged on the floor and thrown around.

1725
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:16,591
MILLER: Oh, yeah.

1726
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,194
LIEFELD: You guys
put her through her paces, too.

1727
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,260
MILLER: She's a trouper.

1728
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:23,556
She was up on that gimbal, too,
and it was really high off the ground,

1729
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,684
and it was not a comfortable place to be.

1730
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,355
She doesn't like heights either,

1731
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:34,359
but she never complained about it.

1732
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,277
You know, there's a...

1733
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,948
It's so fast, you hardly see it,
but Deadpool... You hear it,

1734
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,908
he breaks one arm, and then the other.

1735
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,910
But you actually see it in that other shot.

1736
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:48,790
It's a little quick,
but he snaps the arm at the elbow,

1737
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,458
it bends back the other way.

1738
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:56,422
LIEFELD: Yeah. Ed's a rock star. Let's just
go on record and say, "Ed is a rock star."

1739
01:33:56,506 --> 01:34:01,010
He just has so much charisma.

1740
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:04,139
MILLER: I love the way, when he delivers
that line,

1741
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:06,307
"It sounds even stupider when you say it."

1742
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,476
He's just got this charm about him that...

1743
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,644
LIEFELD: Swagger.

1744
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,939
MILLER: I didn't want him
to be this typical villain

1745
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:17,569
who is So serious
and takes himself seriously.

1746
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:21,156
I really thought his
whole character arc is,

1747
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:25,326
he's a dick, obviously, not a nice guy.

1748
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,495
And Wade gets under his skin for sure.

1749
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,790
But at the end of the day,
he doesn't take any of this shit seriously.

1750
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:33,251
And I like his last moment here where,

1751
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:37,046
when he's facing death, and he
thinks he's gonna die, and he still...

1752
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,674
His last little moment of defiance.

1753
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,593
You should like your villains.

1754
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,927
LIEFELD: 100%.

1755
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:45,513
Four or five moments.

1756
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:46,806
I'm sorry?

1757
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:52,187
MILLER: Tom Holkenborg,
Junkie XL, did the score.

1758
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,899
He did just a fucking fantastic job.

1759
01:34:55,982 --> 01:35:00,278
And he really mixes
this sort of retro sound

1760
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:03,448
with new instrumentation,

1761
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,743
and it's just got
the right amount of quirkiness

1762
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:10,205
to work for this movie, I thought.

1763
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,456
It's a great score.

1764
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,291
LIEFELD: It is. It moves.

1765
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:19,881
MILLER: So, Stefan here, with this speech
with Colossus, man, I thought he crushed it.

1766
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:22,717
He gives the right amount of sincerity...

1767
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,636
- (LIEFELD LAUGHING)
- MILLER: ...with um,

1768
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:27,889
pomposity and self-satisfaction,

1769
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:32,477
and then Deadpool just
takes the piss out of it.

1770
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,188
We had a lot of discussions on

1771
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:38,066
what Colossus" vomit
would look like, by the way.

1772
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,487
LIEFELD: Spilled milk?

1773
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:46,699
MILLER: At the end of the day,
we settled for liquid mercury.

1774
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:51,412
I figured, when he transforms,
everything inside him transforms as well.

1775
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,997
LIEFELD: Good call, Tim.

1776
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:55,541
MILLER: It would have to work, right?

1777
01:35:55,625 --> 01:36:01,297
Some sort of mutagenic field that works
its way inwards and transforms everything.

1778
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:04,151
LIEFELD: We haven't said this
through most of the film,

1779
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,654
but what people need to know about you,
especially when I met you,

1780
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:10,807
you have a vast comic collection,
and you've read comics,

1781
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,309
and anyone listening to this commentary
can pick up on

1782
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:16,020
Tim is not some passerby
in the comics world.

1783
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:20,525
And that's why it's great hearing you
work this stuff out about Colossus.

1784
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:26,739
MILLER: I've been a Marvel boy
since maybe 12 or 13.

1785
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:30,368
(STUTTERS) For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1786
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,996
MILLER: Man,
Morena just kills it in this scene.

1787
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:36,624
I've watched it 1,000 times,

1788
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:42,422
and every time,
I'm just amazed at how good she is.

1789
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,590
When we started
putting this scene together,

1790
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:47,302
our editor, Julian Clarke,
who did an amazing job...

1791
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:51,306
Julian is just the best with structure,
and such an easy-going guy,

1792
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:54,267
So collaborative, and easy to work with.

1793
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,312
He says, a lot of times
when you're making a movie,

1794
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,938
the third act is the hardest thing.

1795
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:02,150
It's the last thing to come together.
It's the resolution to the story.

1796
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:08,031
And it's really where
all the threads are kind of tied up.

1797
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:10,992
And we got really lucky,

1798
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:14,162
or maybe it wasn't luck
because the writers wrote a great script

1799
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,164
and the actors did a great performance,

1800
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,708
but the third act just worked.

1801
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:21,669
This whole scene
where everything comes together,

1802
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:26,466
it worked from
the initial rough cut ever after.

1803
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:32,263
This scene here, especially the end of it
with Morena and Ryan,

1804
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:35,725
is pretty much actually the way we shot it.

1805
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:39,520
The edit didn't really change
from the initial assembly edit,

1806
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:42,065
all the way through the end of the movie.

1807
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:46,027
It just worked. They're both so terrific.

1808
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,757
LIEFELD: And again, if I can speak on
behalf of the comics history of this stuff,

1809
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:52,241
this entire Beauty and the Beast...

1810
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:57,288
(LAUGHING) / forgot about the...

1811
01:37:57,372 --> 01:37:58,539
MILLER: The Hugh Jackman?

1812
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,708
LIEFELD: And that has been
there in the script.

1813
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:03,086
Paul and Rhett, they did their work.

1814
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:04,962
MILLER: Oh, man,
and we got some great ADR.

1815
01:38:05,046 --> 01:38:08,466
Like, Ryan does this great
Hugh Jackman imitation,

1816
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,594
and he did a whole run of jokes there,
that would have been terrific,

1817
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:15,223
but again, it just took us
out of the mood too much.

1818
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,432
But, fuck, they were funny.

1819
01:38:16,516 --> 01:38:19,060
LIEFELD: And uh, yeah. I know.

1820
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,604
This Beauty and the Beast dynamic

1821
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:27,693
has never been as good
in the comics as it's been here.

1822
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,612
The whole movie is pinned on it,

1823
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:33,074
and here's the payoff right here,
where she's...

1824
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,910
I love the comment,
"And a whole lot of drinks."

1825
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:40,998
MILLER: Yeah, well, again, you want to
make it believable,

1826
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:44,168
and this is a pretty shocking
development for her,

1827
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,045
not only to find that
her boyfriend's alive,

1828
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:51,050
but that the man she knew
has been pretty tragically altered.

1829
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,804
I think that would take anyone aback,

1830
01:38:54,887 --> 01:39:00,101
and to not see her process that,

1831
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:02,854
I just thought
it would have been unrealistic.

1832
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:07,442
So, I think she did just
a great job of making it real,

1833
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:11,362
but also, her love wins in the end.

1834
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:18,870
You can see it in her eyes that
once she's processed it, she's in again,

1835
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,955
and she loves him as much as she ever did.

1836
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,516
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1837
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,333
And you, chicken noodle...

1838
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,127
Nothing compares to you.

1839
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:31,757
<i>LIEFELD: (LAUGHING) Great Sinead
O'Connor for those people who get that one.</i>

1840
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:35,928
MILLER: Yeah, that was a late Ryan add.

1841
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:40,016
When he first did that, I'm like,
"Nobody is going to laugh at this.""

1842
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:45,521
I mean, Sinead O'Connor, I had the album,
and I loved it, but it was '90s, right?

1843
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:47,106
LIEFELD: '80s.

1844
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:52,361
All the parents
that took their kids to see this,

1845
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:53,905
<i>because they needed to,</i>

1846
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,865
will get the joke. Got the joke.

1847
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:59,452
MILLER: It got a really
good laugh in the screenings.

1848
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:02,955
Come here.

1849
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,460
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

1850
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,087
MILLER: And she's really
going for it here.

1851
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:12,298
Now, you talk about smell.

1852
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:15,968
That mask, and that makeup,
was not pleasant,

1853
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:21,307
and she really just didn't complain a bit.

1854
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,601
Just went right in every time.

1855
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:28,689
LIEFELD: If I could mention one
of the screenings that you invited me to,

1856
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:31,609
that I was able to attend.

1857
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,278
Afterwards, one of the ladies,

1858
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:37,490
who identified the movie as excellent
and that she loved it

1859
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:39,158
and when she was asked, "Well, why?"

1860
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:43,704
And she said, "I just love all the Wham!
I just love all the Wham!"

1861
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:47,208
My kids asked me,
"Dad, how does Deadpool end?"

1862
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:51,045
And I said, "Careless Whisper, Wham!"

1863
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,714
And they were like, "Are you kidding me?"

1864
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,800
I said, "Yes, and Deadpool is singing it."

1865
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,802
MILLER: Big Wham! song. Yeah.

1866
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:04,225
LIEFELD: Tim, this is a triumph
of the art form, buddy.

1867
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:07,144
This is one for the books.
This is a game changer.

1868
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:10,982
I've been saying it for months,
I'm sticking to it.

1869
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:14,986
And this animated credit, you just...

1870
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,362
Who did this?

1871
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:19,740
MILLER: Oh, this is actually Blur,
my company,

1872
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:25,329
and my wife, who is the art director
for the design side.

1873
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:27,290
And this was her idea.

1874
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:32,420
They pitched a couple of
really great ideas for the credits.

1875
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:38,092
Another one, we were gonna do the whole
end sequence like an '80s action movie.

1876
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:41,721
Like, process the footage,
and do a special thing.

1877
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:46,934
Then we wanted to get the Honest Trailers
guy to review the movie in the credits.

1878
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:48,954
- Where they tear the movie apart.
- LIEFELD: Oh, my gosh.

1879
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:50,497
MILLER: I thought that
would have been fucking great.

1880
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,249
LIEFELD: Yes.
MILLER: He would have tore me up.

1881
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:54,334
LIEFELD: When you were saying,
"She wouldn't survive this,"

1882
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:57,170
I'm like, "They're gonna get you, Tim,
they'll get you on the Honest Trailer."

1883
01:41:57,194 --> 01:41:58,834
MILLER: Oh, they're totally gonna get me.

1884
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:02,175
But that's why I want them to know
that I know these things.

1885
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,559
LIEFELD: You beat 'em to it? Okay.

1886
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:07,663
Oh my gosh, the Deadpool and the unicorn.

1887
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,457
I may or may not have, after seeing this,

1888
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:13,461
drawn a page in my newest Deadpool book
with Deadpool on a unicorn.

1889
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:16,881
MILLER: You know, this funny thing
about international marketing,

1890
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,799
they play the movie in lots of territories,

1891
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:24,263
and in some movies, it's okay for Ryan
to have a dildo shoved up his ass,

1892
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:27,099
but it's not okay to jerk off a unicorn.

1893
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:28,225
LIEFELD: Oh, my gosh.

1894
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:30,203
MILLER: Who makes these rules up, right?
LIEFELD: Exactly.

1895
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:34,023
MILLER: Why can't you jerk off a unicorn?
Go figure.

1896
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:36,525
LIEFELD: Jerk off a unicorn
that sprays rainbows?

1897
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:39,654
MILLER: Yeah, so, it's really not even
Jerking off a rainbow.

1898
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:40,988
I mean, jerking off a unicorn.

1899
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:42,382
LIEFELD: It's just a jerk off motion.

1900
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:46,410
MILLER: Yeah. He's polishing the horn
and rainbows come out.

1901
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:50,998
LIEFELD: So, look. Congratulations, Tim.

1902
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:54,168
From reading that you were
coming on the picture,

1903
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:59,465
to seeing the picture done,
I couldn't be happier for you, man.

1904
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:01,092
MILLER: Thank you, Rob.

1905
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:04,679
LIEFELD: And the fans
are the real beneficiaries here.

1906
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:09,684
I saw a test screening with you.
I saw fan screenings with you.

1907
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:11,268
And the reactions were both the same.

1908
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:16,232
And then, hopefully, there's a whole lot
more Deadpool to come, based on this,

1909
01:43:16,315 --> 01:43:21,153
<i>"cause you gotta nail the landing
to get more, and you guys stuck it.</i>

1910
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:24,049
MILLER: Well we wouldn't have been here
if it wasn't for you, so, thank you.

1911
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:27,118
LIEFELD: Yeah, that's
nice, very, very king,

1912
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:30,496
but I'm not a filmmaker,
and films are hard to make, as I saw.

1913
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,623
MILLER: Comic books are hard to make.
You know that.

1914
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:34,875
LIEFELD: But we live in a great age,

1915
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,212
and I'm looking forward to more Deadpool.

1916
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:41,173
Hey, just as we're
watching the credits roll here,

1917
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:44,885
I do wanna say that
everybody on this movie...

1918
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:49,014
I, of course, have seen a lot of credits,
watching movies over the years,

1919
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:54,812
and you think, "How do all those people
contribute to the movie?"

1920
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:59,400
And seeing it, up close, just how much
of a difference everybody makes

1921
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:03,237
to the final product is really inspiring.

1922
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,991
We shot up in Vancouver,

1923
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:11,620
and I could not say more
about the professionalism, the quality,

1924
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:14,749
and just the nice,

1925
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:19,795
pleasant-to-work-with people
that inhabit that town.

1926
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:22,548
All of these folks were
SO professional and so good,

1927
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:25,426
it really made the whole set experience...

1928
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:29,221
It really felt like a family to me
by the end of our time there.

1929
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:33,309
Our first AD, James Bitonti,
made me laugh.

1930
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:38,939
Susan Lambie, our script supervisor,
created this warm little place

1931
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:44,653
where I could, at my monitors,
get frank and honest feedback.

1932
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:48,073
And picked me up
when I was feeling a little down.

1933
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:52,787
Our effects crew was amazing.
Jonathan Rothbart did a great job.

1934
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:56,081
And Annemarie Griggs,
managing the whole effects pipeline.

1935
01:44:56,165 --> 01:45:02,046
It was huge, and we got
a lot of effects for our budget on this.

1936
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:03,964
And they just did a great job.

1937
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:07,676
Like, we talked about Bill Corso.
We talked about Ken Seng, our DP.

1938
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,845
Everybody just did an amazing job.

1939
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:13,641
Russ Shankle built the costume down here.

1940
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,560
He did a crazy job.

1941
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:21,106
Angus Strathie did costumes for us on set.
Did an amazing job, as well.

1942
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,609
And then
look at all these visual effects folks.

1943
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:25,194
LIEFELD: Yeah, this is crazy.

1944
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:27,321
MILLER: Yeah.

1945
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:30,658
LIEFELD: This is some great houses...
How long, total, in post? Five months?

1946
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:37,665
MILLER: I got back in June 1st,
and we wrapped mid-January.

1947
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:41,961
So, I think the last visual effects shot
came in mid-January.

1948
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:47,591
LIEFELD: And uh, as people know by now,
if you're not, you're about to find out,

1949
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:51,512
we love our post-credits scenes
in comic book films.

1950
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:52,638
MILLER: Yes.

1951
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:54,807
LIEFELD: So, you got a couple
of fun ones here,

1952
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:58,644
coming up again,
in keeping with the entire film,

1953
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:00,646
another very fresh...

1954
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:01,897
MILLER: Yes, we do.

1955
01:46:01,981 --> 01:46:03,357
LIEFELD: It's very fresh.

1956
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,608
MILLER: We do, thank you.

1957
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:06,986
Oh, before we get to that, I gotta say,

1958
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:13,993
John Kelly, my producer, was amazing
at keeping everything running,

1959
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:17,246
and really doing a great job
for me as a first-time director,

1960
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:22,376
to sort of walk me
through the whole process,

1961
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:25,963
and keep everything real
and help me along and explain it.

1962
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:27,464
He really did an amazing job.

1963
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:29,466
Nevin Swain, our property master,

1964
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:35,055
he was just an unending source
of just asking me questions,

1965
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:40,561
but providing all this information
about what I should be thinking about

1966
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:43,439
at every stage of the process.
He was really terrific.

1967
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:45,399
Anyway. Everybody.

1968
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:47,443
And of course, Simon Kinberg

1969
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:51,864
and Lauren Shuler Donner
and Aditya Sood, amazing.

1970
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:54,575
Simon protected us the whole time.

1971
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:57,536
So, this.

1972
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:58,996
Coda.

1973
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:04,209
We had a bunch of different ideas
for the coda, as you could imagine.

1974
01:47:04,293 --> 01:47:07,463
One that almost got there was

1975
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:11,675
Beast coming and shitting
on Deadpool's lawn in the morning

1976
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:13,427
as Deadpool's having coffee.

1977
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:16,597
That was a good one,
but we ended up with this.

1978
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,224
I thought Deadpool should
break the fourth wall.

1979
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:23,896
And what better version of it
lo come out with the Ferris Bueller...

1980
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:26,124
LIEFELD: The Sam Jackson line got me.
The Sam Jackson line.

1981
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:27,358
MILLER: That's a good one.

1982
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:29,485
Go. Go.

1983
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:34,865
MILLER: I know the fans really wanted
a Hugh Jackman cameo.

1984
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:37,785
And we had seriously
considered it for the coda,

1985
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,871
but at the end of the day,
I thought this was perfect.

1986
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:44,166
LIEFELD: Tim, people have
lost their minds at that news.

1987
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:45,960
You know how long
they wanted Deadpool?

1988
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:48,337
- And now they're getting Cable.
- MILLER: Yeah.

1989
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:51,131
LIEFELD: And I saw, we were in that when...

1990
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:54,134
And you didn't tell me,
and that was a surprise to me.

1991
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:57,221
Did you see those guys in the row?

1992
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,306
- "Yeah!"
- MILLER: Yeah, that was great.

1993
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:01,850
LIEFELD: So, I think that's going
to be worldwide.

1994
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:03,185
(VOCALIZES)
