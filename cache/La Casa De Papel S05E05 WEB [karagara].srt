1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,500
René!

2
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,916
René!

3
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,125
No!

4
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,333
René!

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,541
Three people were killed
after an attempted bank robbery.

6
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,208
According to early reports,

7
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,833
at least one of the robbers
was able to escape.

8
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,125
The suspect is a woman
between 25 and 30 years of age.

9
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,583
According to witnesses…

10
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,625
Sergio, come look at this!

11
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,416
…despite the large police presence.

12
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,625
Two of the deceased
were security guards at the bank.

13
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,000
The third was one of the robbers,

14
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,458
an unidentified 30-year-old male.

15
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:03,000
The police are looking for a young female
of average height,

16
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,416
brown hair, and thin build.

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,708
The state security and police forces

18
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,541
have set up roadblocks
on all roads leaving Madrid.

19
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,250
They warn that the suspect
is armed and dangerous.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,250
We must find her.
She's got the talent we need.

21
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,791
Our battering ram.

22
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,708
She's the most wanted person
by the police.

23
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,375
We shouldn't involve
someone so high profile.

24
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,500
Four armed people. Three die, one doesn't.

25
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,583
What more do you need to know?

26
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,291
That woman is a survivor.

27
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,291
And now she's a killer, too.

28
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,041
That heist was a botched job.

29
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,500
She clung to the ceiling like Spider-Man.

30
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,708
Who does that?

31
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,458
Instead of tying up
the officers in the parking lot,

32
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,208
she took them in the patrol car

33
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,541
and passed all the roadblocks
with the sirens on.

34
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,458
She escaped like a queen,
with the police's blessings.

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,583
That's art, isn't it?

36
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,666
There's no information about the operation
set up by the authorities

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,208
in pursuit of the woman.

38
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,125
Look, Sergio.

39
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,208
I just got out of prison,

40
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,375
and I can assure you
I only met dumbasses in there.

41
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,541
Brain-dead people. People with no talent.

42
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,083
Not everyone has

43
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,125
what we just saw.

44
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,750
It's not easy to find.

45
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,583
That may be.

46
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,416
She may be talented. She is talented.
But that girl is a lost cause.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
That's exactly why.

48
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,083
And she's got nothing to lose.

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,500
That's exactly what we need.

50
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,125
ROBBERY SUSPECT AT LARGE
THREE CASUALTIES

51
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,958
If they haven't found her in 72 hours,
we'll start looking for her.

52
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,291
-I'm going to the library.
-Okay.

53
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,000
Get some pastries from San Onofre!

54
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,458
Silene Oliveira.

55
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,166
That was my name when this story began.

56
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,125
When I was convinced
you could outrun pain,

57
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,625
just like the police.

58
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,416
Run,

59
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,458
close your eyes,

60
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,291
and resist.

61
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,041
But inevitably, at some point, you stop.

62
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,208
And all that pain runs through you.

63
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,125
And you feel like there's nothing
you can do to escape it again.

64
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,541
I spent ten days in hiding.

65
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,416
Playing the images of my life with René
over and over again in my head.

66
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,625
Thinking about how he never liked banks.

67
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,791
And when we decided to rob one.

68
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,625
And just like that,

69
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,750
my pain got worse.

70
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,125
And so did my sense of guilt.

71
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,625
For leaving him there, all alone.

72
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,208
Lying on the wet ground, under the rain,

73
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,125
as if René could still feel it.

74
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,000
And then I thought
I had to run faster than before.

75
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,958
So that grief wouldn't catch up with me.

76
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,750
And I didn't stop.

77
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,625
Not even when I arrived at that dead end,

78
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,583
where an army commando
was determined to kill us.

79
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,666
At this point in my life,

80
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,375
I was miles away from standing down
and making it easy for them.

81
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,625
Take cover!

82
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,458
Fire!

83
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,666
This is a fucking rat trap.

84
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,166
We have to block the door!

85
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,041
How the fuck do we do that?

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The stove top!

87
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,875
Tokyo, cover us!

88
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,791
Fire!

89
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,250
Arteche, destroy that door!

90
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,458
Hurry up!

91
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,333
Fucking hell!

92
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,250
We have to lift the stove top.

93
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,708
Three.

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,000
-Two.
-Two.

95
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,583
One. Now!

96
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,708
Tokyo!

97
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,375
Tokyo!

98
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,375
Wait!

99
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,375
Grenade!

100
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,583
Up!

101
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,583
Hey, chefs!

102
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:43,125
Put it inside a piece of cheese next time!

103
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,666
LISBON, PORTUGAL
FOUR YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

104
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,250
When I was little
and summer vacation ended, I thought,

105
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,833
"When I grow up, I won't have
to go back to school anymore."

106
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,166
Now I don't go back to school.
I go back to something worse.

107
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,750
Why do we have to give this up?

108
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,916
Because vacation always ends, baby.

109
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,958
But I also smile when I see you
in our neighborhood.

110
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:24,500
And I'm happy when we stroll around
the streets of Madrid

111
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,541
and have a beer in the square.

112
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,375
We live like royalty.

113
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,375
We spend our days trying to make a living,

114
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,875
wondering if we can afford
to turn the heat on.

115
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,833
You spend all day breaking your back
with those gas bottles.

116
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,375
I don't care.

117
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,958
And I spend all day
looking for another shitty job.

118
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,541
I want to be with you all the time.

119
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,291
So we need to rob bigger things.

120
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,291
Because you don't want
to have money to buy things.

121
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,375
You want it to be free,

122
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,000
and that's very expensive.

123
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
That's what I want.

124
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,041
To be free.

125
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,666
Why do we need to settle?

126
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,958
If we don't steal,
our life is stolen from us.

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,166
What do you think?

128
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,583
I want to travel the world with you.

129
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,416
I want to see you on a desert island,

130
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,708
in the middle of nowhere,

131
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,541
with a mojito in each hand

132
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,375
and think, "Fuck, I'm so lucky."

133
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,791
So if we're that lucky,

134
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,625
we should make the most of it.

135
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,833
Name a city.

136
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,166
Very far away.

137
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,958
I promise to take you there.

138
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,750
Tokyo.

139
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,458
Get ready, Japan.

140
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,166
The first time I chose Tokyo

141
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,666
was to travel with René
to the farthest city in the world.

142
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,000
I'd learned that loving him
in different cities made me happy.

143
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,416
Saint Anthony.

144
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,583
You beautiful thing!

145
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,541
The second time I chose Tokyo
was to change one life for another.

146
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,500
They're using the stove top as cover.

147
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,416
They've got a good shooting angle.

148
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,708
And aim.

149
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,583
Cañizo, Sagasta speaking.

150
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,291
They're in the kitchen.

151
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,500
Find a shooting angle from the outside.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,791
Sniper unit in position.

153
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,791
Let's throw grenades,

154
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,000
blow up their fortification and go in.

155
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,333
Screw it.

156
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,958
Anyone who gets close to that corridor
is a dead man.

157
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,250
We won't accomplish anything
with a grenade.

158
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,625
That stove top is made with cast iron
and I'm sure they fortified it.

159
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,125
And what do you suggest?

160
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,750
Sit here and see if they come out
to use the bathroom?

161
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,541
We're going to drill through the wall.

162
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,333
We'll drill a hole
and attack from the pantry.

163
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,708
It'll take us at least ten minutes,
and time is the only thing on our side.

164
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,750
We need to go in now,
before they come from the museum.

165
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,958
Negative.

166
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,583
Push harder.

167
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,416
Get it in there, damn it!

168
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,791
I got it!

169
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,416
Done.

170
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,750
Rio, can you hack this shit?

171
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,375
I can. It's cracking the codes.

172
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,416
It'll take at least 30 minutes.
Realistically, one hour.

173
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
One hour?

174
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,125
What? No, there's no time.

175
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,333
We need the foundry workers up here now.

176
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,333
Come on.

177
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,833
First-aid kit.

178
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,833
Bogotá. How long would it take
to cut through the door?

179
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,708
At least 11 minutes,
if there's enough gas.

180
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,666
We need to decide.

181
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,333
When we cut, the system will block,
and I won't be able to do anything.

182
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,208
Bogotá, go with the foundry workers.

183
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,125
Copy.

184
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,583
-You good alone?
-Of course.

185
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,416
Come on, Helsinki. You can do it.

186
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,208
God.

187
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,458
Tokyo, how long can you resist?

188
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,916
As long as it takes.

189
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,791
Start drilling. Canalejas, help him out.

190
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,625
Major, you've got no fucking clue
what you're doing.

191
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,166
Captain, do you know
what we're going to do?

192
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,416
Exactly what I say.
And you're going to zip it.

193
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,666
What's going on?

194
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,208
They're arguing, Professor.

195
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,500
The boss wants to drill the wall
and come in through the pantry.

196
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,875
Gandía wants to attack
through the corridor.

197
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,583
Gandía is questioning orders.
Tokyo, that's his weak point.

198
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,291
-You know him. Can you do something?
-Of course.

199
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,333
Then do it.

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,666
Hello, Gandía.

201
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,500
How are you, sweetie?

202
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,500
Did you miss me?

203
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,333
Only at night.

204
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,416
But you didn't come back for me, did you?

205
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,166
You're back
because you felt like a traitor.

206
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,833
You were an ally to the robbers
through a walkie-talkie.

207
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,083
You lied to the CNI,
and thanks to that, Lisbon got in.

208
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,458
That's why you're back.

209
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,208
Because you don't have the balls
to go home

210
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,083
and look your wife
and your son Juanito in the eyes.

211
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,916
Shut up, you little rat.

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,125
I'll come in
and wash your mouth out with soap

213
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,875
if you talk about my family.

214
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,916
No.

215
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:16,208
They saw you come out alive on TV.

216
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm sure they cried, hugged each other,

217
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,458
and thought you'd be home for dinner.

218
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,458
But nope.

219
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,833
You didn't even call them, did you?

220
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,750
Of course not.

221
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,250
What would you say?

222
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,208
"I killed a defenseless woman,

223
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,416
and then betrayed myself and my people
because I'm a coward"?

224
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,375
Gandía, calm down.

225
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,666
"Hi, Juanito. Do you know what, son?"

226
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,833
"Daddy's a piece of shit."

227
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,541
"Why? Because I'd rather get myself killed

228
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,041
than stay with you and read you a story."

229
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,166
What are you doing?

230
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,833
Don't, Captain.

231
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,416
Captain, did you hear me?

232
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,000
"And tell Mom…"

233
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,458
That's an order, Captain!

234
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,166
"…I was always late
because I didn't want to fuck her."

235
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,083
I'm talking to you. Captain!

236
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,916
Gandía!

237
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,000
Grenade!

238
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,000
Take cover!

239
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,833
What was that?

240
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,791
-Rio.
-Rio!

241
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,250
-Come back!
-Where are you going?

242
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,958
Bogotá, we need you here now!

243
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,083
We'll be there in two minutes, Lisbon.
Move, fuck!

244
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,083
Everyone against the wall!
Come with me, move!

245
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,291
Hang in there.

246
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,333
It's okay.

247
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,833
I've got it.

248
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,458
Stockholm, status? Do you copy?

249
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,583
I'm trying!

250
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,416
I'm fucking trying!

251
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,750
-Ramiro, are you okay?
-Yes, sir.

252
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,958
Hernando?

253
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,541
Canalejas?

254
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,916
Torrecilla and Tosco, injured, Major.

255
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,875
You got him killed.

256
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,458
You got him killed!

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,583
One casualty, Professor.

258
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,333
It was an accident.

259
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,208
These things happen.

260
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,250
-Not here.
-Arteche.

261
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,458
-What's going on?
-They're fighting.

262
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,166
That buys us a few minutes,
but not much more.

263
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,250
Arteche, calm down.

264
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,416
Cañizo speaking.
We can shoot one of the kitchen windows.

265
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,333
Visibility isn't good,
but one of the pantries is within range.

266
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,916
-Stay in position.
-Roger that.

267
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,708
Arteche.

268
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,708
I got him, didn't I?

269
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,208
-Did I get him or not?
-You got his vest.

270
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,875
Congrats.

271
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,083
Arteche! Two members of your team
have been wounded.

272
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,333
Go look after them.

273
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,500
Arteche! That's an order.

274
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
You're doing great.

275
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,416
Maybe the same thing
will happen to you two.

276
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,166
Shut your little mouth.

277
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,166
Because of what happened earlier,
on the rooftop.

278
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,750
I understand that people say things
they don't mean under pressure.

279
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,833
No worries.

280
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,625
Not really. I was being honest.

281
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, I think now is not the time to talk
about these things.

282
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,041
I decided to start being honest
a long time ago.

283
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,708
What's gotten into you?

284
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,916
Nothing. It's how I feel.
I want to be clear, Dani.

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,708
Let me be clear, Manila.
This is a fucking war.

286
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,583
I'm with Stockholm.
I can't be clearer than that.

287
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,208
Are you in love with her?

288
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,166
I'll cover you.

289
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:19,083
Disobey me again and I'll put you
on your knees and shoot you in the head.

290
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,583
-You're not answering me.
-I'm madly in love.

291
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,250
-Come on.
-"Come on" what?

292
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,833
We know each other.

293
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,791
I know who you are, what you like.

294
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,083
I know your dreams.

295
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,833
The huge, three-floor techno nightclub
you wanted to open.

296
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,750
You've got more than enough dough now.

297
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,500
Listen, the thing is, Spanish-style clubs
aren't popular in Indonesia,

298
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,333
but I can tell you
I've danced a ton with Stockholm.

299
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,208
We even danced in a vault.

300
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,083
Okay, what about the martial-arts gym?

301
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,541
That's popular in Indonesia,
you can't say it isn't…

302
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,166
But I can't spend my life kicking asses.

303
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,125
I wanted to grow up.

304
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,208
Tell me something.

305
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,083
You've been in Indonesia
for two fucking years.

306
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,000
In all that time,
have you ever had any doubts?

307
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,000
Never.

308
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,375
I get up in the morning,

309
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,750
and I see Stockholm asleep,

310
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,250
rays of sunlight
coming through the window and…

311
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,666
my life looks like a fucking commercial.

312
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,083
A commercial for cologne.

313
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,500
That's not you.

314
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,916
That's not your life.

315
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:47,291
It's a different life, but it's his
just as much as the previous one was.

316
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,291
One life can be made up of several.

317
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,041
There's no need for this.

318
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,541
Shut it.

319
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,166
Keep walking.

320
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,750
Is anyone here?

321
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,750
No.

322
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,833
Are you living with grandma?

323
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,958
Well, it's just a safe place.

324
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:33,958
Who are they?

325
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,583
People in same situation as you.

326
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,500
Potential members for our gang.
You're the first recruit.

327
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,458
Good.

328
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,083
I'll stop you
from making a fool of yourself.

329
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,916
If you want to steal 2.4 billion euros,

330
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,000
you'll get shot in the head.

331
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,458
So stop talking about it.

332
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,458
You get shot when you don't think.

333
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,791
When you go into a bank barefaced
and act without thinking.

334
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,041
But this plan is many years in the making.

335
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,333
How many years?

336
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,958
Twenty years.

337
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,833
I'm offering you freedom.

338
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,375
I'm already free.

339
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,541
I can go out that door right now
and vanish.

340
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,416
Why don't you?

341
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,958
Because out there,
nothing, no-one, is waiting for you.

342
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:45,458
Your life ended in the last robbery.

343
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,541
I can bring you back to life.

344
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,625
A second life.

345
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:54,208
Or you can just linger on the memories
of the first one.

346
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,625
What do you know about me and my life?

347
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,791
Or how much I've given up to be free?

348
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,541
All I need to know,
and I'm going to find out right now, is…

349
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,375
whether you're brave enough

350
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,875
to be born again.

351
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,750
To live again, find love again, a family.
It's a yes-or-no question.

352
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,458
Today is the day to decide.

353
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:18,916
Now.

354
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,625
Wouldn't he want you to be happy again?

355
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,750
Who are you?

356
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:40,916
Welcome.

357
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,166
Come on!

358
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,791
Hurry up!
Three lives are at stake. Let's go!

359
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,833
The foundry workers are in the museum.
We're cutting.

360
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,916
Good.

361
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,291
Come on! Now!

362
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,208
I need the jackhammer.

363
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,166
Where's the jackhammer?

364
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,166
Stockholm! Where's the jackhammer?

365
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,166
Over there.

366
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,583
Morphine.

367
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,458
Give me morphine. Please.

368
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,750
I know that look.

369
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,375
First dead.

370
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,083
Always stays in head. Turning and turning.

371
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,833
It'll pass. It's the shock.

372
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,083
Morphine. Please.

373
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,500
Get ready, Tokyo, freshen up.
I'm on my way.

374
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,500
People think true love
only happens once in a lifetime.

375
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:29,708
What people don't know
is that you can live several lives.

376
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,541
Rio, right?

377
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,500
Yes.

378
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,291
What are you doing?

379
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,416
Stargazing.

380
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,958
What is it?

381
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,458
That doesn't seem like you.

382
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,666
You don't know me.

383
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,791
Look, that's the Big Dipper.

384
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,250
That's the Ursa Major

385
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,041
and that's the Ursa Polaris.

386
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,708
Hacker and astronomer. How about that?

387
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,708
The Professor has it all covered.

388
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,041
Some people can read
the future in the stars.

389
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,416
Do you know how?

390
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,416
Well, I mean, kind of.

391
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,375
Tell me my future.

392
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:47,916
Really?

393
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:49,416
Okay.

394
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,083
Okay, so, from the star alignment…

395
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,416
it looks like you're going to meet a guy.

396
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,875
Is he cute?

397
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,958
We'll have to check
with Andromeda's angle.

398
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,583
Look. There it is. 

399
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,083
-What?
-The constellation.

400
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,000
Where?

401
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,041
Look. Right there.

402
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,125
Oh, yeah.

403
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,875
What is it?

404
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,375
He's a normal guy.

405
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,625
A bit of a loner too.

406
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:35,958
An average guy,

407
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,208
but a good guy.

408
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't know how I'll meet him

409
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,375
locked up in here,
attending Professor's classes.

410
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,291
I bet Cassiopeia knows.

411
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,666
Let's ask her.

412
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,583
-Wow, that's weird.
-What?

413
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,916
Cassiopeia says you'll meet him dancing.

414
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,333
Can I have this dance?

415
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,583
It's okay. We've lost one of the lances.

416
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,333
How much time do we have?

417
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:40,916
No less than six minutes.

418
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,875
Professor, what was that?

419
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,916
I've got to tell you something.

420
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,833
There's one more of us
in the stormwater tank.

421
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,708
Inspector Alicia Sierra
gave birth to a baby,

422
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:08,083
a beautiful girl
weighing around three and a half kilos,

423
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,500
and she's in great health.

424
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,625
Congratulations.

425
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,333
A baby is always a joy and…

426
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,625
there's no surplus of joy
around here lately.

427
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,541
What's her name?

428
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:31,541
Well…

429
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,666
I was thinking of Germán,
after her father.

430
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,375
But since she's a girl, I've gone blank.

431
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,250
What about Danica?

432
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:47,333
In my country it means "morning star."

433
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,208
You're a true poet, Marseille.

434
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,250
If you're accepting ideas,

435
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,500
I've always liked Lucía for a girl.

436
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,541
I don't know if she looks like a Lucía.

437
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,041
She looks more like a Victoria.

438
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,250
Victoria.

439
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,625
I'm going to name her Victoria.

440
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,541
That's beautiful.

441
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,666
That's it, Victoria.

442
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,708
Because she's going to be
as strong as a bombshell, and so will I.

443
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,125
And so will I.

444
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,166
Take her.

445
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:31,833
Victoria.

446
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,791
Everything you bought is pink.

447
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,000
Pink, because she's a girl.

448
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:40,458
And? First of all,
there are no colors for girls or for boys.

449
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,041
And second, you're conditioning her.

450
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:47,291
You don't know if she'll feel like a girl,
a boy, or God knows what.

451
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,458
She's not even a day old,
and you're already traumatizing her.

452
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,583
Even the rattle you bought is pink.
Give me the baby.

453
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,500
No. She gave me the baby.
You've lost your mind.

454
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,916
Cover the door.

455
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,333
The lance is out!

456
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,166
We've got two lances left.

457
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,625
Come on, hurry up!

458
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,791
Cañizo, they're in the pantry.

459
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:45,791
Tokyo, run!

460
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,041
Fire!

461
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,166
Tokyo!

462
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,708
Tokyo!

463
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,416
Tokyo, no!

464
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,333
The day I killed Gandía,
the odds were against me.

465
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,791
I was like a puppet riddled with bullets.

466
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,625
And with five bullets in my body,

467
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,250
I thought about my samurai.

468
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,875
Open it. Don't worry, it's not a ring.

469
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,833
It's a Japanese samurai.

470
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,416
I found it in a shop window.

471
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,958
It's a sign.

472
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,541
I know what you're thinking.

473
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:25,791
You can read my mind with a snow globe?

474
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,375
You don't want to live the high life
and leave your mom behind.

475
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,708
I already thought about that.

476
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,125
We're going to give her a gift.

477
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,291
A male stripper to spice up her life?

478
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,375
We'll pay off her mortgage.

479
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:48,333
If we go to Polynesia, she can go to Rome,

480
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,000
or Paris or wherever she wants,

481
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,416
so she can enjoy life.

482
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,458
She deserves it too.

483
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,875
And you need it.

484
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,000
Where will we get all that cash?

485
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,750
Ask it. Rub it a little
and see what it has to say.

486
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,291
Let's see.

487
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,250
It says that…

488
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,791
It says you've already thought
about how we'll do it.

489
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,166
Banks.

490
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,791
We've already pulled off 15 clean heists.

491
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,166
We understand each other.

492
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,291
-We're good.
-The best.

493
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,916
Let's go after the banks.

494
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,750
You know it's higher risk, don't you?

495
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,125
Hang in there.

496
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,500
Tokyo is injured, Professor.

497
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,333
She took bullets in her arms and legs.

498
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,458
Fuck! The lance is out.

499
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,583
Enough. Guys, go down to the foundry.

500
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,666
Hang in there.

501
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,875
Professor, we're out of gas.

502
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,291
Help me, Lisbon.

503
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,666
Denver, listen.

504
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,000
We need more time to open the museum.

505
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,916
Set up a defensive position
to cover any possible entry.

506
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,041
As long as you're covered,
you stand a chance.

507
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:06,250
We'll resist.

508
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,333
Ready.

509
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,125
Now.

510
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,333
Fuck!

511
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,708
You're not going in,
you're benched. Follow me.

512
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,583
You lot, set up the explosives.

513
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,083
Shoot anyone who comes through that door.

514
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,041
Everyone else, take cover.

515
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,041
Can you shoot?

516
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,250
Until my arms fall apart.

517
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:15,416
Manila, come on. Let's go!

518
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,208
Professor, we're behind the trench,
and there's no fucking way out.

519
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:34,875
There's no way out.

520
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,583
Denver?

521
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,666
Denver, the hole.

522
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,958
Denver, there's a hole.

523
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,916
The dumbwaiter.

524
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,833
The dumbwaiter from the office, Denver.

525
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:49,375
Denver, the dumbwaiter…

526
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,458
from the office, Denver.

527
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,791
It's right here.

528
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,541
What?

529
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,083
It's at least six floors.

530
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,791
Fucking hell!

531
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,291
Come on. Go down.

532
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,125
-What?
-You have to go.

533
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,791
Both of you, come on.

534
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,125
Go down now.

535
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,791
-What about you?
-I'm staying.

536
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,083
-What?
-I can't go down.

537
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,291
Manila, listen to me. Manila!

538
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,666
I can't hold on to the ropes, okay?

539
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,666
I need you to go down really fucking fast,

540
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,041
and put cushions, curtains,
cardboard boxes, anything, at the bottom.

541
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:59,750
Anything, you hear me?
Okay? And I'll jump.

542
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,125
-Manila.
-No.

543
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,458
Go! Now!

544
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,500
Manila, go down! Come on! Go down!

545
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,375
I won't leave you.

546
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:15,250
You're coming with me.
I'm not leaving you here.

547
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,833
-No, Denver!
-Let's go.

548
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,000
-Leave me here. You're hurting me.
-Tokyo.

549
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,375
Listen to me, please.

550
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:25,375
My dad died in a heist.

551
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,916
I won't let my sister die.

552
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:31,833
I won't.

553
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:34,583
Sweetie,

554
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:38,083
I need you to save my life.

555
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,166
-Everything's going to be fine.
-Okay.

556
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,125
Okay?

557
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,625
Go.

558
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,500
I'm okay.

559
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,708
-Explosives ready.
-Connect the detonator.

560
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,333
Tokyo!

561
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,666
Detonators ready.

562
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Tokyo.

563
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,458
Tokyo. I'm here with you.

564
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:46,625
I'm here.

565
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,666
Ramiro?

566
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,041
Hold on. I'm going to get you out, okay?

567
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,166
-You're good at construction too?
-I'm full of surprises.

568
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,208
Take cover!

569
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,541
Tokyo, what is it?

570
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:02,583
What's going on?

571
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,166
Rio, they're here.

572
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,125
We're going in!

573
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,250
Manila, hurry up!

574
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,041
-I'll open the gap.
-Rio.

575
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,583
There's no time.

576
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:26,416
There's no time.

577
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,666
Don't say that, and don't smile like that.

578
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,750
It's because I'm happy you're here.

579
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,291
No.

580
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,000
Tokyo.

581
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,375
Come on.

582
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,125
Do you know what I'm thinking about?

583
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,291
Our first night in Toledo.

584
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,666
When we danced together.

585
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,208
Now!

586
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,541
Professor, we're downstairs.

587
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,875
Tokyo, they're downstairs.

588
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,000
Resist 30 seconds.

589
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,500
Mónica!

590
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,250
Mónica! Fuck!

591
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,666
Come on! Hurry up!

592
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,958
Fire!

593
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:54,583
Tokyo.

594
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,375
Rio.

595
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,666
Don't be sad.

596
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,208
-Something is ending today.
-No.

597
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,750
But it's the first day of your next life.

598
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,458
You've got a lot of lives to live.

599
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,083
-No.
-Lots of them.

600
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,833
Advance!

601
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,416
You need to leave…

602
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,041
because it's party time.

603
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,333
No!

604
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,416
Tokyo!

605
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,458
Fire, Arteche!

606
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,500
No!

607
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,000
Canalejas!

608
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:57,583
Fucking shit!

609
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:01,458
Fire, Gandía!

610
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,208
Tokyo, jump!

611
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:11,875
Tokyo!

612
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,375
Tokyo!

613
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,541
Can you hear me?

614
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,541
Tokyo, there's no time. Jump now.

615
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,208
Tokyo!

616
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:26,916
You're out of time. Jump now.

617
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,458
It's going to be hard.
How will you manage without me?

618
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,541
I won't, Tokyo. Jump now!

619
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,625
You've always been my guardian angel.

620
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,083
Now it's my turn to be yours.

621
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:49,000
No!

622
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,708
I'm not the type to rot in prison.

623
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,791
I'm more of the runaway type.

624
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,291
And if my body can't run away,

625
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,500
at least my soul can.

626
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,041
Get back!

627
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,291
Tokyo!

628
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,583
