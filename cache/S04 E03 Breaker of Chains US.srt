1
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,204
You did this. You did this!

2
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,040
-We have to leave.
-Take him! Take him!

3
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,547
Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?

4
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,634
Find her. Bar the gates of the city.
Seize every ship in the harbor.

5
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,265
-Where is she?
-No one leaves the capital! No one!

6
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,713
-Get in.
-Where are we going?

7
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,714
Somewhere safe.

8
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,844
Up you go, my lady.

9
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,059
You'll be fine.
You're stronger than you know.

10
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,330
-Lord Baelish?
-Petyr.

11
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,709
Are you hurt, my lady? Good. Good.

12
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,713
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy. The worst is past.

13
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,091
Lord Baelish.
I promised I'd get her to you safely.

14
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,678
Softly, my friend.
Voices carry over water.

15
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,014
I should get back
before someone thinks to look for me.

16
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,224
First you'll want your pay.

17
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,102
-Ten thousand was it?
-Ten thousand.

18
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,693
Wait!

19
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,949
You don't want the queen to hear, do you?

20
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,576
A thousand gold cloaks are searching
for you.

21
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,036
And if they found you,

22
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,249
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

23
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,627
-I didn't murder anyone.
-I know. I know.

24
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,172
But you must admit it looks suspicious.
The king who executed your father,

25
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,385
who tormented you for years,
and you fled the scene of his murder.

26
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,932
-Why did you kill him?
-Because he was a drunk and a fool,

27
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,184
and I don't trust drunk fools.

28
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,855
-He saved me.
-Saved you?

29
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,024
My lady, he followed my orders,

30
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,610
every one of them,
and he did it all for gold.

31
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,031
Money buys a man's silence for a time.

32
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,908
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

33
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,581
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

34
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,665
Yes.

35
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,463
And he gave you a priceless necklace
that once belonged to his grandmother.

36
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,549
The last legacy of House Hollard.

37
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,393
I had it made a few weeks ago.

38
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,397
What did I once tell you
about the capital?

39
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,067
We're all liars here.

40
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,114
Come, my lady.
I know you've had a difficult day.

41
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,742
But you're safe now.

42
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,827
I promise you that.

43
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,832
You're safe with me, sailing home.

44
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,049
So, am I the queen?

45
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,843
More than you were with Renly.

46
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,138
Less than you would have been
if Joffrey had done you the courtesy

47
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,849
of consummating the marriage before dying.

48
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,559
In any case,

49
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,437
this would not be an opportune moment
to press the issue.

50
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,065
Clawing at his own throat,

51
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,943
looking to his mother to make it stop.
It was horrible.

52
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,362
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

53
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,531
But they're all a tray of cakes
next to death.

54
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,077
They brought me your grandfather's body
when he died, you know?

55
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,288
-Made me look at it.
-What was it like?

56
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,583
They took me to the Great Hall,
and there he was.

57
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,213
The man I'd married
and suffered to father my children.

58
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,594
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to
at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

59
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,055
There he was,

60
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,641
lying on a table.

61
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,189
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men,

62
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,566
and was stabbed through the heart.

63
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,320
Another was happiest torturing animals,
and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

64
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,531
-I must be cursed.
-Nonsense!

65
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,993
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

66
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,913
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

67
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,207
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

68
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,084
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

69
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,961
But I would have been the queen.

70
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,088
Our alliance with the Lannisters

71
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,551
remains every bit as necessary to them
as it is unpleasant for us.

72
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,554
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

73
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,265
The next one should be easier.

74
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,694
Your brother is dead.

75
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,989
Do you know what that means?

76
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,661
I'm not trying to trick you.

77
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,168
-It means I'll become king.
-Yes, you will become king.

78
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,338
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

79
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,507
A good king?

80
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,718
I think so as well.

81
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,680
You've got the right temperament for it.

82
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,434
But what makes a good king?

83
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,064
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

84
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,899
This is hardly the place or the time.

85
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,276
Holiness?

86
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,240
Baelor the Blessed was holy.

87
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,158
And pious.

88
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,118
He built this sept.

89
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,831
He also named
a six-year-old boy High Septon

90
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,376
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

91
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,214
He ended up fasting himself
into an early grave

92
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,968
because food was of this world,
and this world was sinful.

93
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,306
-Justice?
-Yeah.

94
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,059
A good king must be just.

95
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,229
Orys the First was just.

96
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,943
Everyone applauded his reforms.
Nobles and commoners alike.

97
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,778
But he wasn't just for long.

98
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,616
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

99
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,661
Was that truly just of him?

100
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,124
To abandon his subjects to an evil
that he was too gullible to recognize?

101
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,001
-No.
-No.

102
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,256
-What about strength?
-Yes.

103
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:51,966
Strength.

104
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,219
King Robert was strong.

105
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,349
He won the rebellion
and crushed the Targaryen dynasty,

106
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:06,272
and he attended
three small council meetings in 17 years.

107
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,192
He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking,

108
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,778
until the last two killed him.

109
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,825
So, we have a man
who starves himself to death,

110
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,578
a man who lets his own brother
murder him,

111
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,790
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

112
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,587
What do they all lack?

113
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,469
-Wisdom.
-Yes!

114
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,388
-Wisdom is what makes a good king.
-Yes.

115
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,516
But what is wisdom?

116
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,105
A house with great wealth
and fertile lands

117
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,565
asks you for your protection

118
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,528
against another house with a strong navy
that could one day oppose you.

119
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,449
How do you know
which choice is wise and which isn't?

120
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,495
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries,

121
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,121
or shipyards and soldiers?

122
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124
-No.
-No. Of course not.

123
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,961
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

124
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,297
You're young.

125
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,509
A wise young king
listens to his counselors,

126
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,261
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

127
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,514
And the wisest kings

128
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,892
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

129
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,856
Your brother was not a wise king.
Your brother was not a good king.

130
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,277
If he had been,
perhaps he'd still be alive.

131
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,240
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.

132
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,327
-Do you understand why?
-A king needs a queen.

133
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:48,082
Yes, but why? To further the family line.

134
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,752
-Do you know how that happens?
-Yes.

135
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,464
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

136
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,510
-I don't think so.
-It's all relatively straightforward.

137
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,055
-How are you?
-I'm all right.

138
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,684
You are. You will be. I'll see to that.

139
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,067
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

140
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,986
-Yes, my lord.
-All of you.

141
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,766
It was Tyrion.

142
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,270
He killed him.

143
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
He told me he would.

144
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,862
"A day will come when you think
you are safe and happy

145
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,241
and your joy will turn to ashes
in your mouth."

146
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,704
That's what he said to me.

147
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,210
You saw it.

148
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,588
You saw Joff point at him

149
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,340
-just before he--
-I don't know what I saw.

150
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,677
Avenge him.

151
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,097
Avenge our son.

152
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,851
Kill Tyrion.

153
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,774
Tyrion's my brother. Our brother.

154
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,943
There'll be a trial.

155
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,362
-We'll get to the truth of what happened.
-I don't want a trial.

156
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,491
He'll squirm his way to freedom
given the chance.

157
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,493
I want him dead.

158
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,457
Please, Jaime. You have to.

159
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,045
He was our son.

160
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,381
Our baby boy.

161
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,172
You're a hateful woman.

162
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,010
Why have the gods made me
love a hateful woman?

163
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,146
Jaime, not here, please. Please.

164
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,150
-Stop it. Stop it.
-No.

165
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,237
Stop. Stop it! Stop.

166
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,701
Stop.

167
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,586
Stop. It's not right.

168
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,091
-It's not right. It's not right.
-I don't care.

169
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,969
-Don't.
-I don't care.

170
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,513
-Don't. Jaime, don't.
-I don't care.

171
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,059
Gonna rain soon.

172
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,438
Where are we?

173
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,693
Near Fairmarket, I think.

174
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,531
-You think? You don't have a map?
-No, I don't have a map.

175
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,493
-Maybe we should get one.
-All right, just point out

176
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,495
the next map shop you see,
and I'll buy you one.

177
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,039
-How far is it to the Eyrie?
-Far.

178
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,166
And you're sure we're going the right way?

179
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,211
Believe me, girl,
I want you there as soon as I can.

180
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,005
Get my gold, be on my way.

181
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,925
-On your way where?
-Why do you care?

182
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,226
Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.

183
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,269
Fight as a sellsword.

184
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,149
Second Sons, could be...
Seems like a good fit for me.

185
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,318
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

186
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,653
Why Braavos?

187
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,614
I have friends there.

188
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,493
-I doubt it.
-Seven blessings to you.

189
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,999
-What do you want?
-What do I want? This is my land.

190
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,835
If I'm standing on it, it's my land.

191
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,879
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

192
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,054
Forgive my father.
He was wounded fighting in the war.

193
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,265
Our cottage burned down
while he was gone,

194
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,766
and my mother with it.

195
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,021
He's never been the same.

196
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,237
Which house did he fight for?

197
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,161
The Tullys of Riverrun.

198
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,418
There's a storm coming.
You'll be wanting a roof tonight.

199
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,462
There's fresh hay in the barn.

200
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,382
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

201
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,763
We don't have much, but any man that bled
for House Tully is welcome to it.

202
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,773
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy,
accepting our human frailty.

203
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,317
We ask the Mother to bless our crops,

204
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,361
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

205
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,449
We ask the Warrior to give us courage
in these days of strife and turmoil.

206
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,160
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue,

207
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,078
and keep her from the clutches
of depravity.

208
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,956
-You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
-Father!

209
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,798
We ask the Smith to strengthen
our hands and our backs,

210
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,841
so we may finish
the work required of us.

211
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,179
We ask the Crone to guide us
on our journey from darkness to darkness.

212
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,015
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us in our beds tonight

213
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,391
for no damn reason at all.

214
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm so sorry.

215
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,672
-Really good.
-Did you fight at the Twins?

216
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,925
Call that a fight?
Slaughtering livestock more like.

217
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,552
The Red Wedding they're calling it.

218
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:02,307
Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.

219
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,435
-He offered them guest right.
-Guest right don't mean much anymore.

220
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,104
It means something to me.

221
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,566
The gods will have their vengeance.

222
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,986
Frey will burn in the seventh hell
for what he did.

223
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,573
Things were different
when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.

224
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,285
Well, we had good years and bad years,
same as anyone, but we were safe.

225
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,911
Now, with the Freys,

226
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,832
raiders come plundering,
steal our food, steal our silver.

227
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,459
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

228
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,337
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

229
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,423
You got any ale?

230
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,092
Afraid not.

231
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,265
How can a man not keep ale in his home?

232
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,436
You look like
you could really swing that sword.

233
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,980
A real warrior with proper training.

234
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,192
Those raiders wouldn't stand
a chance against you.

235
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,321
How would it be if you stayed on
'til the new moon?

236
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,698
I could use a man
to help with the farmwork.

237
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,994
Sally does what she can,
but she can't lift a bale of hay.

238
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,997
And if any thieves came looking
for easy pickings,

239
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,041
one look at you,
I'd bet they'd run the other way.

240
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,003
Meaning no offense.

241
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,219
What'll you pay?

242
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,388
I don't have much.

243
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,767
But I have hidden a bit of silver
from the bandits.

244
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,063
Fair wages for fair work?

245
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,738
Fair wages for fair work.

246
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,731
-What did you do?
-Get your horse saddled.

247
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,526
-You told me you weren't a thief.
-I wasn't.

248
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,070
He took us in. He fed us,

249
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,197
-and you--
-Aye, he took us in. He's a good man,

250
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,657
and his daughter makes a nice stew.

251
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,409
And they'll both be dead come winter.

252
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,869
-You don't know that.
-I do know it.

253
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,747
He's weak. He can't protect himself.

254
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,041
They'll both be dead come winter.

255
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,210
Dead men don't need silver.

256
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,298
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

257
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,175
There's plenty worse than me.

258
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,803
I just understand the way things are.

259
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,515
How many Starks they got to behead
before you figure it out?

260
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,272
Raper. Raper.

261
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,942
Horse thief. Ninth born son.

262
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,905
Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.

263
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,286
-There he is, Sam the Slayer.
-Going to visit your wildling whore?

264
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,705
-She's not a whore.
-No?

265
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,749
Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight
and find out.

266
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,006
They all think I'm lying.

267
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,010
-About what?
-Killing the White Walker.

268
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,887
You're not lying.

269
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,973
I'll never forget the way it screamed.

270
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,812
But you're the only one that saw it,
and they all think you're just a--

271
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,900
-A what?
-Well, a wildling.

272
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,195
My father hated that word.

273
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,365
It's not a very nice word, I suppose.

274
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,741
I don't know.

275
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,828
It makes me sound a bit dangerous,
doesn't it?

276
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:09,679
So, are you all right?
No one bothering you?

277
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,973
I get a lot of looks.

278
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,101
I hear them making their jokes,

279
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,520
but no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

280
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,107
I worry about it sometimes.

281
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,025
All the time.

282
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,861
Why do you worry about it?

283
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,615
One hundred men, one woman.

284
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,159
They've got other things to think about.

285
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,495
That's the only thing they think about.

286
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,373
-You're being silly.
-I'm not being silly.

287
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,918
There's 100 men lying awake at night
picturing you.

288
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,338
What about you?

289
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,551
What about me?

290
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,972
Gilly?

291
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,895
I worry about you.

292
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,652
Thank you.

293
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,322
-For what?
-For worrying about me.

294
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,830
I don't know if you're safe here.

295
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,668
They're my brothers, but some of them
were thieves before they came here.

296
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,295
Some of them were rapers.

297
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,881
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

298
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,342
So, what are you saying?

299
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:36,516
Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.

300
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,398
Are you bored of me?

301
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,817
Bored of you?

302
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:47,944
I...

303
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,075
I want to protect you.

304
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,669
I'll get these to Hobb.
Keep an eye on little Sam.

305
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,284
Your Grace.

306
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,496
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

307
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,010
-Joffrey?
-The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

308
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,514
I said those words
when I tossed a leech into the fire,

309
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,599
a leech filled with bastard blood.

310
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,060
A bastard you set free.

311
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,854
I am now faced with a great opportunity,

312
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,148
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

313
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,276
I will find you an army, Your Grace.
I've been working day and night--

314
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,443
What progress have you made?

315
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,571
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

316
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,572
House Peasebury.

317
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,076
-House Musgood.
-House Musgood.

318
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,245
-And House Haigh.
-House Haigh.

319
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,128
They don't have enough men between them
to raid a pantry.

320
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,259
Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.
We need to look east for ships and men.

321
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,470
Ten thousand skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

322
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,556
-The Golden Company?
-They've never broken a contract.

323
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,641
-They're sellswords.
-We're willing to use blood magic

324
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,019
to put you on the throne,
but we're not willing to pay men to fight?

325
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,232
Now, the Red Woman's magic is real.
Her visions and prophecies may be, too,

326
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,068
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

327
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,404
Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground.

328
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,823
-It's dirty on the ground.
-We don't have any gold.

329
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,700
Not yet.

330
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,624
If I do not press my claim,
my claim will be forgotten.

331
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,711
I will not become a page
in someone else's history book.

332
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,548
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos.

333
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,509
Which means you're running out of time.

334
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,726
-You're late.
-I'm sorry, Princess.

335
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,436
I thought you weren't coming.

336
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,689
The Hand of the King
doesn't have much leisure time.

337
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,900
You won't be a very good Hand
if you see the word "knight"

338
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,361
-and say "ka-nigit."
-That happened once, weeks ago.

339
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,656
You're your father's daughter, no mistake.
Bloody relentless, the both of you.

340
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,201
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

341
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,786
But I think you can manage.

342
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,749
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

343
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,042
That's how children do it.

344
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,219
"The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas."

345
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,304
"First Sword of Braavos."

346
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,223
Thank you very much.

347
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,684
I like this one.
It's full of sword fights and pirates.

348
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,854
-You were a pirate once.
-No, I was never a pirate.

349
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,023
-I was a smuggler.
-What's the difference?

350
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,901
Well, if you're a famous smuggler,
you're not doing it right.

351
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,072
-My father says a criminal is a criminal.
-Your father lacks an appreciation

352
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,116
of the finer points of bad behavior.

353
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,744
-So do the Braavosi.
-You've sailed to Braavos?

354
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,705
Of course. Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

355
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,460
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

356
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,713
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

357
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,341
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

358
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,094
and each one of your gold barges
is worth half a kingdom,

359
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,180
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction...

360
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,452
-What was that for?
-I need you to write a message.

361
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,620
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

362
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,830
It's too important for me.

363
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,250
I need a smart person to do it. Go on.

364
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,296
"To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos."

365
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,966
"From Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of Westeros."

366
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,261
-But that's not you.
-I need to get their attention.

367
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,680
Go on. Write.

368
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,859
He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?

369
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,632
-Precious little thing.
-Thank you.

370
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,718
-What's his name?
-Sam.

371
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,178
Lovely.

372
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,389
-That the daddy?
-No.

373
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,933
Where's the daddy?

374
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,560
He's dead.

375
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,647
Where you from?

376
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,027
-North of here.
-North of here?

377
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,908
You a fucking wildling?

378
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,703
-Only room and board?
-That's right.

379
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,041
She'll clean and cook
and look after the other girls' babies.

380
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,835
Could find other work for her, too.

381
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,296
-No other work.
-There'd be money.

382
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,841
-Give you a piece of it.
-No other work.

383
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,283
I promise to come back and visit
whenever I can.

384
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,788
You'll be safer here.

385
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,666
Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black?
Me?

386
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,296
-You protected me north of the Wall.
-This is different.

387
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,924
They're brothers of the Night's Watch
and I can't just stab them in the back,

388
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,760
and I can't run away,
which is what we did at Craster's.

389
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,931
You have to trust me.

390
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,309
It's for the best.

391
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,109
-Best for you.
-Oh, Gilly.

392
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,030
Please don't.

393
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,439
You're greedy.

394
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,906
No?

395
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,285
I'm sorry. You're lovely,
I just never acquired the taste.

396
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,829
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

397
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,583
That's quite all right, lover.
That's more for you.

398
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,837
Your loss.

399
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,553
You like them both the same?

400
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,765
-Boys and girls?
-Does that surprise you?

401
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,558
Everyone has a preference.

402
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,811
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

403
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:06,192
The gods made that, and it delights me.
The gods made this...

404
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,112
and it delights me.

405
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,240
When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne.

406
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,785
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

407
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,162
I hope I have as much stamina
when I'm your age.

408
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,872
What are you, 25?

409
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,666
Children.

410
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,338
Someday, if you're lucky,
you will wake up and realize you are old.

411
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,716
That pretty ass of yours will sag.

412
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,010
Your belly will grow soft,
and your back will ache in the night,

413
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,389
and gray hairs will sprout from your ears.

414
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,850
No one will want you anymore.

415
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,603
Make sure you fucked your fill
before that day.

416
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,189
Did you?

417
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,401
He is a prince of Dorne.

418
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,449
Girls and boys will line up
to fuck him 'til the day he dies.

419
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,996
They will all have to line up behind you.

420
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,337
-Prince Oberyn.
-Lord Tywin.

421
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,964
May we have the room?

422
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,970
Call my name if you need me, lover.

423
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,401
-Would you like to sit?
-No, thank you.

424
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,363
-Some wine?
-No, thank you.

425
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,243
-I'm sorry about your grandson.
-Are you?

426
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:43,498
I don't believe that a child
is responsible for the sins of his father.

427
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,042
Or his grandfather.

428
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,669
An awful way to die.

429
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,797
Which way is that?

430
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,633
Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?

431
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,468
Some believe the king choked.

432
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,637
Some believe the sky is blue

433
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,181
because we live inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

434
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,310
The king was poisoned.

435
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,022
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.

436
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,149
I did. This is why I know.

437
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,778
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

438
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,906
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

439
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,827
some days later,
my grandson dies of poisoning.

440
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,996
Rather suspicious.
Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?

441
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,959
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel
on the day that you arrived.

442
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,004
-What did you discuss?
-You think we conspired together?

443
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,341
-What did you discuss?
-The death of my sister.

444
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,553
For which you blame me.

445
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,471
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

446
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,182
The Mountain follows your orders.

447
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,017
Of course, I blame you.

448
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,647
And here I stand unarmed, unguarded.
Should I be concerned?

449
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,067
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

450
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,530
I am a man of reason.
If I cut your throat today,

451
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,574
I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

452
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,244
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes
without their superiors' knowledge.

453
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,788
So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

454
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,165
Categorically.

455
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,969
I would like to speak with the Mountain.

456
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,722
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

457
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,099
Might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

458
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,937
I could arrange for this meeting.

459
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,566
But you want something in return.

460
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,404
There will be a trial for my son.
And as custom dictates,

461
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,201
three judges will render a verdict.
I will preside.

462
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,037
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

463
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,207
-I would like you to be the third.
-Why?

464
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,295
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

465
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,131
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.

466
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,594
-Now, they are our strongest allies.
-Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

467
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,015
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

468
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,768
I will also invite you to sit
on the small council

469
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,230
to serve as one of the new king's
principal advisors.

470
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:23,199
I never realized you had such respect
for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

471
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,203
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

472
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,123
The king is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

473
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,126
A wildling army marches on the Wall.

474
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,130
And in the East,
a Targaryen girl has three dragons.

475
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,511
Before long,
she will turn her eyes to Westeros.

476
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:48,432
Only the Dornish managed to resist
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

477
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,978
You're saying you need us?

478
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,982
That must be hard for you to admit.

479
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,609
We need each other.

480
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,280
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins,

481
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,825
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

482
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,096
Podrick.

483
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,141
Apologies for the stench.

484
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,059
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

485
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,352
A noble effort.

486
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,730
They didn't find the candles, though.

487
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:41,527
A quill, some parchment,
duck sausage, almonds,

488
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,821
and some hard cheese.

489
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,406
You're a good lad.

490
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,244
-Any word of Shae?
-I've heard nothing, my lord.

491
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,455
I suppose that's a good thing.

492
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,625
What are they saying about me out there?

493
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,797
You're to stand trial in a fortnight
for murdering the king.

494
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,925
-Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
-No, my lord.

495
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,222
-You didn't?
-No. Gods, no.

496
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,101
The world is a better place without him,
but I had nothing to do with it.

497
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,231
I would like to think,
if I were arranging a royal assassination,

498
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,692
I'd plan it in such a way
that I wouldn't be standing there

499
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,861
gawking like a fool when the king died.

500
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,032
Trial in a fortnight.

501
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,785
Have they announced the judges yet?

502
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,373
-Your father.
-Of course.

503
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,918
Mace Tyrell.

504
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,880
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

505
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,882
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

506
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,384
Oberyn?

507
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,220
Give it to my father.

508
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,306
He never fails to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

509
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,309
I'm supposed to get
a list of names from you, my lord.

510
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,562
Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

511
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,399
I can call my own witnesses?
How generous of them.

512
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,445
-Very well, my wife. Sansa.
-My lord, she's gone.

513
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,156
-Gone?
-No one's seen her since the wedding.

514
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,495
You don't think she...

515
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,710
No one had more cause
to kill Joffrey than Sansa,

516
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,587
but the girl is no assassin.

517
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,966
Whoever killed the king,
wanted me to lose my head for it.

518
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,469
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

519
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,848
-Podrick.
-Yes, my lord?

520
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,432
-They'll be following you now.
-Who will?

521
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,144
I don't know. They. They.
The ominous they.

522
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,063
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

523
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,608
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.

524
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,528
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

525
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,573
Whenever something bad happens to me,

526
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,950
I assume
it's my sister that had a hand in it.

527
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,745
But say what you will of Cersei,
she loves her children.

528
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,000
She is the only one I'm certain
had nothing to do with this murder.

529
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,546
Which makes it unique
as King's Landing murders go.

530
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,464
Any other witnesses, my lord?

531
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,926
Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

532
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,053
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

533
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,805
Of course. Fetch Bronn.

534
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,807
-I have a job for him.
-I've already asked, my lord.

535
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,309
-They won't let him see you.
-Why not?

536
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,270
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

537
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,731
-He's under investigation himself.
-And my brother?

538
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,443
-Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
-I'll ask, my lord.

539
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,501
There's something else, my lord.

540
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,214
A man, I didn't know his face,

541
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,966
he came to ask
if I'd testify against you.

542
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,969
Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne

543
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,723
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called "The Strangler."

544
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,058
Ser Podrick Payne?

545
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,436
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

546
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,938
I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

547
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,441
Are you going to accept their offer?

548
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,610
My lord.

549
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,695
Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.

550
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,823
If they can't tempt you with honey,
they'll choose something less sweet.

551
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,661
-You've been good to me, my lord.
-Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

552
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,289
-They'll want an answer before that.
-I already gave them an answer, my lord.

553
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,836
I will not have you dying on my behalf.
Do you hear me?

554
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,839
If I have to take that long walk
to the executioner's block,

555
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,384
I don't want to see your head
already mounted.

556
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,178
-My lord--
-Pod, I am giving you an order.

557
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,598
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

558
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,395
And get yourself out of King's Landing
before it's too late.

559
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,522
Pod!

560
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,440
This is farewell.

561
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,820
Farewell, my lord.

562
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,702
Pod.

563
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,500
There has never lived a more loyal squire.

564
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,569
-Mother says it's time to eat.
-What's she got boiling?

565
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,614
-No. Wait. Wait. Let me guess. Potatoes.
-Potatoes.

566
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,035
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

567
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,077
She got--

568
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,998
-The wildlings!
-Guymon!

569
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,254
-Hide. Hide!
-Run!

570
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,058
-You know how to get to Castle Black?
-Yes. Yes.

571
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,609
Those your parents?

572
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,113
Open your eyes.

573
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,157
I'm going to eat them.

574
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,204
Do you hear me?
I'm going to eat your dead mama,

575
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,957
and I'm going to eat your dead papa.

576
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,336
Go tell the crows at Castle Black.

577
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,973
We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.

578
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,057
-Aye.
-Aye!

579
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,269
Three dozen bodies with slit throats
tossed off the top of the Wall.

580
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,980
-Seems like that would be a good lesson.
-Aye!

581
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,941
If we go after them,
we'll be giving them what they want.

582
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,195
They want to draw us out,
pick us off a few at a time.

583
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,198
We have just over 100 men,

584
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,952
and that's including
stewards and builders.

585
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,539
And me.
We can't afford to lose a single man.

586
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,376
We must remember our first responsibility.

587
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,963
We are the watchers on the Wall.

588
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,799
There's got to be a way to protect them.

589
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,095
You're a champion of the common people,
Lord Snow.

590
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,890
What do you say
to Brother Pyp's proposition?

591
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,146
Mance Rayder is coming.

592
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,358
If the wildlings breach the Wall,

593
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,737
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for a thousand miles

594
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,530
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

595
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:32,247
We need to shore up Castle Black,
and we need to defend the Wall.

596
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,250
That is our job.

597
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,467
Rangers returning.

598
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,098
Somebody help.

599
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:51,892
Help him.

600
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,647
Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

601
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,403
-What took you so long?
-We were held up.

602
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,989
-By what?
-Chains.

603
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,743
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

604
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,079
-And the mutineers stayed?
-They're not going anywhere.

605
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,831
They've got Craster's food and his wives.

606
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,211
Poor girls.
Never thought they'd miss their daddy.

607
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,879
Karl's running things now.

608
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,173
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

609
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,843
-We need to ride north and kill them all.
-We just went over this, boy.

610
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,012
-Justice can wait.
-It's not about justice.

611
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,977
I told the wildlings we had
over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

612
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:36,979
A thousand.

613
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,523
Karl and the others know the truth
as well as we do.

614
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,360
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

615
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,571
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

616
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,200
Mance has all he needs to crush us,
he just doesn't know it yet.

617
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,245
As soon as he gets his hands on them,
he will.

618
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,665
Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

619
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,043
And even if every one of us
kills 100 wildlings,

620
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,421
there's still not a thing we can do
to stop them.

621
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,009
I don't think I can kill
100 wildlings.

622
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,740
Are they attacking?

623
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,409
A single rider.

624
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,496
A champion of Meereen.

625
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,166
They want you
to send your own champion against him.

626
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,777
What is he doing?

627
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,530
I believe he means to...

628
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,833
He says that we're an army of men
without man parts.

629
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,752
He claims you are no woman at all,
but a man who...

630
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,588
hides his cock in his own asshole.

631
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,925
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

632
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,470
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

633
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,060
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

634
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,148
First, I will need this one to be quiet.

635
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,359
Do I have a champion?

636
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,664
Your Grace, I've won more single combats
than any man alive.

637
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,875
Which is why you must remain by my side.

638
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,086
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

639
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,505
Let me stand for you today as well.

640
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,632
You are my most trusted advisor,

641
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,594
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

642
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,137
I will not gamble with your life.

643
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,222
I was the last to join your army.

644
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,309
I'm not your general,
or a member of your Queensguard,

645
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,518
or the commander of your Unsullied.

646
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,313
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

647
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,899
And before long, I will return to nothing.

648
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,319
Let me kill this man for you.

649
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,071
Very well.

650
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,242
You have quite an audience.
Make it worth their while.

651
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,498
-He is very brave, Your Grace.
-Yes, win or lose,

652
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,500
as long as the whole city is watching.

653
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,890
-You sure you don't want a horse?
-Why would I want a horse?

654
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,100
Horses are faster than men.

655
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,978
Horses are dumber than men.
