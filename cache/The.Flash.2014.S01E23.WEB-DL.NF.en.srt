1
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:09,176
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.</i>

3
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,434
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

4
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,395
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,858
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...</i>

6
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:30,030
<i>...but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime
and find others like me.</i>

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,743
<i>And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.</i>

8
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>That day is today.</i>

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,960
What?

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,378
No Big Belly Burger?

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,880
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

12
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,968
We're out of cows where I come from.
You don't care about that. You have questions.

13
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,136
I'm not sure where to start.

14
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,429
Thawne.

15
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,223
That is your real name?

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,392
-Eobard Thawne?
-Since the day I was born.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,311
-When was that?
-One hundred and thirty-six years from now.

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,772
This is not what you wanna know.

19
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,608
Go ahead, Barry.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,152
Ask it.

21
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,489
Why did you kill my mother?

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,449
Because I hate you.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,118
Not you now.

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,578
You years from now.

25
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,330
-In the future.
-In a future, yes.

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,792
We're enemies, rivals, opposites.
Reverses of one another.

27
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,586
Why? Why were we enemies?

28
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,337
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,008
It doesn't matter anymore.

30
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:35,137
What matters is neither of us
was strong enough to defeat the other.

31
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,140
Until I learned your secret.

32
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,767
I learned your name.

33
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,437
Barry Allen.

34
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,524
And finally, I knew how to defeat you
once and for all.

35
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,360
Travel back in time, kill you as a child...

36
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,406
...wipe you from the face of the earth.

37
00:01:54,615 --> 00:02:00,370
But then you, future you, that is,
followed me back and we fought.

38
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,332
WELLS:
<i>We both landed some pretty solid shots.</i>

39
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,211
And then you, future you,
got your younger self out of there.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,799
I was so mad.

41
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,636
But then I thought...

42
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,930
...what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

43
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,228
What if you were to suffer something
so horrible, so traumatic...

44
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,149
...that your child self could never recover?
Then you would not become the Flash.

45
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,068
So I stabbed your mother in the heart.

46
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,403
WELLS:
<i>And I was free.</i>

47
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,325
Finally able to return to a future
without the Flash.

48
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,538
Only to realize that in traveling back,
I lost my way home.

49
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,959
Lost my ability to harness the Speed Force.

50
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:53,090
And without it,
I was stuck here, stranded in this time...

51
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:58,929
...unable to return to my home,
and the only one way back was the Flash.

52
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,974
But the Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

53
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,940
Why train me?

54
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,026
Why help me save so many people?

55
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,113
Because I needed you to get fast.

56
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,036
Fast enough to rupture the space-time barrier
and create a stable wormhole...

57
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,122
...through which I could return home.

58
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,624
Why would I ever do that?

59
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,919
Because, Barry Allen...

60
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,797
...if you give me what I want...

61
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,717
...I'm gonna give you what you want.

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,513
You can go back and save your mother.

63
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,142
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

64
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,645
You can reunite the Allen family.

65
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,442
No.

66
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,110
No, I don't believe you.

67
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,782
I wanna kill you right now.

68
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,159
I know that rage.

69
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,120
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

70
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,539
And now somehow...

71
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,794
...I know what Joe and Henry feel...

72
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,922
...when they look on you with pride.

73
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,467
With love.

74
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,512
No. No, don't you ever say that to me.

75
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,141
I know you're upset,
but I'm giving you a chance.

76
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm giving you a chance
to undo all the evil I've done.

77
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,026
Don't you want that chance?

78
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,710
A rare opportunity to go back in time
and right a wrong...

79
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,296
...and save your mother's life.

80
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,342
Quite the paradox
Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen.

81
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,053
The chance to be with someone you love?

82
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,888
Seems pretty cut-and-dry to me.

83
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:11,895
At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear so,
but this gift has unparalleled risk.

84
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,232
Barry, the night your mother died...

85
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,360
...the night you saved yourself
from being killed...

86
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:23,740
...that event altered the timeline you were
already on, and changed the course of history.

87
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,661
So, what you're saying is
we're living in a parallel universe?

88
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,374
-Just like when I time-traveled before.
-But he only changed one day that time.

89
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:37,754
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

90
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,551
One different decision, no matter how
big or small, impacts everything that follows.

91
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,888
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices, new relationships.

92
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:51,643
Nothing would be as it is today,
and you'd never know the difference...

93
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,771
...because you'd never remember any of it.

94
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,154
So if I go back and save my mom,
my dad doesn't go to prison.

95
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,450
I never live with Joe and Iris.

96
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,874
You might never meet me
or Caitlin or Ronnie.

97
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,125
STEIN:
Truth is...

98
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,756
...there's no real way of knowing
what your life will be.

99
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,388
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

100
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,808
You gotta change the past.

101
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,482
Joe.

102
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,321
So, what, that's it?

103
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,657
You think I should just do it?

104
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,745
Yeah, I do.

105
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,040
Which means
I will never come to live with you...

106
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,708
...and you're okay with that?

107
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,420
Barry, you get the chance to grow up
with both parents.

108
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,592
-You don't have to grow up without a mother.
-What about growing up without a father?

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,470
You will have a father. Your real father.

110
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,017
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

111
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,312
This is why you became the Flash, Barry.

112
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,439
To put things right.

113
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,526
You saved a lot of people's lives
this past year.

114
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,363
Now it's time to save yours.

115
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,385
BARRY:
Dad, look, I know this sounds crazy.

116
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,929
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

117
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:55,350
Look, you're fast, I get it,
but turning back time...

118
00:07:55,558 --> 00:08:00,855
I wouldn't be turning time back.
I would be going back.

119
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,858
To that night, to save her.

120
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,111
What does Joe think about all this?

121
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,948
He thinks I should do it.

122
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,325
No.

123
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,120
You can't.

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
Dad...

125
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,255
I can make it so
that night will never have happened.

126
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,133
-We'll be a family again.
-We are a family.

127
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,553
Not like this, not without Mom.

128
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,849
Barry, there's a natural order to things.

129
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,351
Okay, things happen the way they do.

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,230
We may not know why at the time,
but there must always be a reason.

131
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,942
Now, I believe that. I've had to believe it.

132
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,572
I... I can save Mom.

133
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,906
At what cost?

134
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,577
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

135
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,787
-Well, I don't care.
-I do.

136
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,334
I am in awe...

137
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,838
...of the remarkable man
that you are becoming.

138
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,426
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as the Flash...

139
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,969
...but you, Barry...

140
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,972
...your honesty, your heart.

141
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,267
You were always a hero.

142
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,688
And your mom would be just as proud.

143
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,816
And if she had a say in this,
if she thought for one second...

144
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,820
...you going back to save her would mean
you losing what makes you so special...

145
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,031
...she would never want that.

146
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,452
Barry, what I hope for you...

147
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,665
...maybe the greatest thing
that a father can hope for his son...

148
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:47,337
...is that one day
you will become a father yourself.

149
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,131
And then you will know...

150
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:58,473
...how much I truly love you.

151
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,894
[THERMOMETER BEEPS]

152
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,188
CAITLIN:
Ninety-eight-point-six.

153
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,439
Normal.

154
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,192
-Don't know what that word means anymore.
CAITLIN: Me neither.

155
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,238
I know Barry really appreciates you
coming back to help him stop Wells.

156
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,865
That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait.

157
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,659
I'm here now, for good.

158
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,994
-But I thought...
-I thought too.

159
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,082
Okay, I thought too much about what might
happen if the government tracked us down.

160
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,878
If we couldn't control our powers
and we hurt someone, if we hurt you.

161
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:35,510
But I realized that, although
sometimes, I'm more than one man...

162
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,721
...I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

163
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,014
I love you, Cait.

164
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,604
-Are you sure?
-I am.

165
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,273
Once upon a time...

166
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,442
...and a particle accelerator or so ago...

167
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,861
...you agreed to marry me.

168
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,030
-Yes, I did.
-What do you say we do that?

169
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,624
IRIS:
Thought I might find you here.

170
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,922
I needed to get out of the lab.

171
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,469
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

172
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,305
Oh, it is, trust me.

173
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,766
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

174
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:28,021
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings
with the mysterious Streak.

175
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,109
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

176
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,321
Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.

177
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,780
[IRIS LAUGHS]

178
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,324
No.

179
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,248
So are you gonna do it?

180
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,922
It's just so huge.

181
00:11:55,506 --> 00:12:00,470
It's the biggest decision of my life,
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

182
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,931
Why would you want to? I mean...

183
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,935
...you'd get to see your mom again...

184
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,186
...your dad.

185
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,271
Have a great career.

186
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,690
Even get married.

187
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,861
Iris West-Allen, huh?

188
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,032
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

189
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,702
Must be a 2024 thing.

190
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,373
We don't know that
that's gonna happen. I mean...

191
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:33,586
Do you think that
because you didn't live with us...

192
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,339
...that's why things are different there?

193
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:43,137
Growing up together
and knowing so much about each other...

194
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,601
...it made it hard for me
to admit how I felt about you.

195
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,731
And I waited too long,
and you fell in love with Eddie.

196
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,984
But...

197
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,531
But living with you and Joe...

198
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,411
I've had a great life, Iris.

199
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,747
Come here, Barry.

200
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,589
What do you think I should do?

201
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,135
I need someone to tell me.

202
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,057
I think...

203
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,353
...that for once in your life, Barry Allen...

204
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,939
...you should stop thinking
about other people.

205
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,276
I think you should do what's in your heart.

206
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,446
Do what you need to do for yourself.

207
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,079
Ah.

208
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,958
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

209
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,378
...it took you a whole hour longer to decide
than I thought it would.

210
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,381
So how does this work?

211
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,762
-Your grand plan.
-Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry.

212
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,388
In fact, it's rather simple.

213
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,475
-We use the particle accelerator.
-The particle acce...

214
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,979
The last time that happened, you caused
an explosion that hurt a lot of people.

215
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:20,068
This time, the accelerator will operate
exactly the way it was designed to.

216
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,238
Except instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions...

217
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,949
...colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring...

218
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,453
...we're only gonna inject one particle
into the accelerator.

219
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,707
And I'm what it collides with.

220
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,001
And if you can go fast enough, Barry...

221
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,004
...if you can hit that particle
with enough speed...

222
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,091
...you will punch a hole
right through the fabric of reality.

223
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,926
And you will create a portal...

224
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,097
...connecting this time...to infinite times.

225
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,974
A wormhole.

226
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,811
Through which one might travel
back to the past...

227
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,817
...say, to the night your mother died,
or forward to the future to, say, my time.

228
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:06,823
You said if I run fast enough.
What happens if I don't?

229
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,201
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity, Barry...

230
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,328
...you'll die.

231
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,166
STEIN:
According to Wells' calculations...

232
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,086
...Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

233
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,588
Once Barry reaches optimum speed...

234
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,259
...we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

235
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,679
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms...

236
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,641
...opening a gateway into time itself.

237
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,145
At that moment, I plan on shouting
something along the lines of:

238
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,272
"Eureka," or possibly, "Excelsior."

239
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,566
I'm uncommitted.

240
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,151
What do you think?

241
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,698
I mean, on the one hand,
it does make a kind of sense.

242
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,199
On the other hand...

243
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,659
...why?

244
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,202
Why?

245
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,789
-Why would you ever consider doing this?
-You know why.

246
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,459
So for this to work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

247
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,295
By my estimates, Mach 2 at a minimum.

248
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,798
You've never gone that fast.

249
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,968
So, what happens
if Barry doesn't reach that speed?

250
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,388
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield. How far off am I?

251
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,849
Not very far, I'm afraid.

252
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,643
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

253
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,022
-We're gonna need something else too.
-Really?

254
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,774
And what's that?
Because I don't know about you guys...

255
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,320
...but I'm not at all interested in helping you
get yourself killed.

256
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,322
I need you to build a time machine.

257
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,991
Go on.

258
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,330
So if Wells is as fast as you,
what's he need a time machine for?

259
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,999
Apparently, he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

260
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,669
He gets it back sometimes, but only in spurts.
He can't fully control it.

261
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,506
I was right. He was using
the wheelchair to charge himself.

262
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,135
So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna need
the ship to travel back to the future.

263
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,014
-He's been squirreling away the parts.
-Now we just need to put it together.

264
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,184
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine...

265
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,894
...not a bookcase from Ikea.

266
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,189
We got a problem.
These tiles, they're made of tungsten.

267
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,234
Tungsten has the highest
melting point of any other element.

268
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,861
Yeah, uh, but the dust it generates
is flammable.

269
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,531
-The pressure exerted from the wormhole...
-Yeah, yeah.

270
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,742
It could cause a hole
to be melted into the exterior.

271
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,202
It could explode.

272
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,703
Any ideas?

273
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,706
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

274
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,252
Heh. Which used to be a name
that made me smile.

275
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,553
-Something on your mind, Cisco?
-No.

276
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:39,559
Yes. How did you fit your Reverse-Flash suit
into that little ring?

277
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,978
Is it some sort of compressed microtech?

278
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,231
Or... Actually, forget it. I don't care.

279
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,568
Maybe a little.

280
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,280
Ronnie's right. I should've accounted
for temporal shearing.

281
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,615
Glad we're still good for something.

282
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,077
I've never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

283
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,457
Or Ronnie. As a matter of fact,
do you know how many times...

284
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,294
...I wished you were with me
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

285
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,296
-Would've been a lot more fun.
-Yeah?

286
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,593
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that your nifty little Time Sphere...

287
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,804
-Oh, is that what you're calling it?
-Whatever. It's gonna blow.

288
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,223
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

289
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,476
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

290
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,812
Okay. Fine, we'll try that.

291
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,439
That's it? That's all?

292
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,232
Well, what do you want me to say?

293
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,278
I don't know. I thought of anyone, you'd be
more understanding of my predicament.

294
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,280
I don't belong here.

295
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,366
These barbaric times.

296
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,786
-It's like living among the dead.
-Is that what you told yourself...

297
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,371
...when you killed me?

298
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,542
What?

299
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,961
What did you say?

300
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,135
It was an alternate timeline,
one that Barry reset.

301
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,553
But I never forgot it.

302
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,974
It just kept coming back to me.

303
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,021
And I can still picture
the way you looked at me...

304
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,689
...when you called me a son.

305
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,860
And you crushed my heart...

306
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,278
...with your fist.

307
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,822
Cisco...

308
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,325
...I'm sorry.

309
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:24,038
-Yeah, it sucked.
-Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a reason.

310
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,792
I'm sorry for the fact that you're able
to retain traces of another timeline.

311
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,796
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe. It means...

312

628
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,390
...that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

629
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,060
-What does that mean?
-We have to disrupt the motion.

630
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,731
Basically, it's just like the tornado,
only upside down and bigger.

631
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,900
-And scarier.
STEIN: Barry...

632
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:53,112
...that event has an energy level
of at least 6.7 teraelectron-volts.

633
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,405
It cannot be stopped.

634
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,951
I have to try.

635
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,354
Oh, God. Barry.
