3

What's going on.

18
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,611
- The time masters,

19
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,813
They took me to a place
called the vanishing point.

20
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:51,183
I've spent lifetimes training
by them, being reborn.

21
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,385
- Don't kill him.

22

you're comfortable, mr. Rory.

26
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,139
Or do you answer to chronos
these days?

27

30
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,218
I'm calling on you
for two reasons.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,888
First, we could use your help.

32
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,623
- What's the second reason?

33
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,460
- We're headed to 2147
to engage savage.

34
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:37,930
- Is that the second reason
or the first?

35
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,599
Ah, forget it.

36
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,502
- I owe you an apology,
mr. Rory.

37
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,903
I failed you.

38
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,505
I brought you along
on this mission

39
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,608
Under false pretenses,
in denial of your true nature.

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,678
And when that nature
took its course,

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,249
I asked mr. Snart to...

42
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,086
Deal with you.

43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,455
My point being,

44
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,557
Your quarrel should be with me
and not with him.

45
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:09,394
- Well,
if it makes you feel any better,

46
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,864

Set a course

50

people are still wearing wool?

51
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,448
Man, I hate wool.
- Be grateful, mr. Jackson.

52
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,617
Those living outside
the kasnian conglomerate

53
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,918
Are dressed in rags.

54
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,186
- Conglomerate?

55
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,587
- Yes, in the year 2080,

56
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,290
Government began to give way
to corporations.

57
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,758
- More like 2008.

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,727
- According to gideon,
in two hours time,

59
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,329
Our favorite immortal psychopath
is scheduled to attend a meeting

60

Of the conglomerate's
share holders.

61
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,666
- Ooh, sounds exciting.

62
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,669
- You think savage takes over
the world by trading stocks?

63
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,371
- What we do know is,
in 20 years time,

64
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,406
Kasnia is the foothold
from which savage

65
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,841
Takes over the world,
so we hardly want

66
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,976
To take him on there,
but if we can figure out

67
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:02,481
How his actions here lead
to his rise to power,

68
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,949
Then we won't need to.

69
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,651
- Copy that, captain,

70
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,486
But if we're gonna be
checking out the future...

71
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,622
- We should probably
invite the nerd twins.

72
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,224

about 2147.

- Fascinating.
- Astonishing.

76
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,799
- Well, it was a 50-50 chance
which one he'd choose.

77
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,668
- Actually I was going to say,
"remarkable."

78
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,969
- Isn't it?

79
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:27,606
2147 was considered
the world's zenith.

80
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,374

To look forward to.

82
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,977

83
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,212

84

comes to power,

85
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,450

- Ghosted me
the week before we left.

352
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,043
- Sh-she died?

353
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,412
- No, no, ghosting.

354
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,847
It's where you
pretend to be dead

355
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,649
By not answering
somebody's text.

356
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,617
- What a strange age for dating.

357
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:24,589
- You think maybe she didn't
reply to your text because...

358
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,858
- She knew she was pregnant?

359
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,059
[scoffs]

360
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,694
No wonder my kid
started the company

361
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,229
That manufactures evil robots.

362
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,864
If I'd never left 2016,

363
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,232
My child would have had
a loving father,

364
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,167
And palmer tech
might not have gone on

365
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,102
To build a robot army
that savage uses

366
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,104
To conquer the world.

367
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,240
- Bit of a stretch,
don't you think?

368
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:46,644
- Either way,
I was someone's father

369
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,014
And didn't even know it.

370
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:55,019
<i>â™ª</i>

371
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,888
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,623
- Are you okay?

373
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,059
- Fine.
Oh, I'm fine.

374
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,361
- You don't look fine.

375
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,331
- I'm just a little...Peckish.

376
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,632
- Peckish?

377
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,835
- It's nothing
a little energy bar won't fix.

378
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:14,038
I'll see you.

379
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,615
- Edith and joseph boardman?

380
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,317
- Our new names.

381
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,487
- Joe boardman is a good name.

382
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,290
And besides, I've never
kissed an edith before,

383
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,360
But I certainly think
I can get used to that.

384
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,333
- And what about all this?

385
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,802
How do we explain to our son

386
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,873
Why his mother and father keep
moving every couple of years,

387
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,341
Changing their names,

388
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,510
Looking over their shoulders
at every turn?

389
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,914
I don't know why we thought
we could do this again.

390
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,684
Do you think we're selfish?

391
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,852
- To have a family?

392
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,320
- Because when savage finds us--

393
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,822
- He won't.
- He always finds us.

394
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,791
- Maybe this life is different.

395
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,394
- Do you honestly believe that?

396
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,699
- Look...

397
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,870
All I know is that
savage is not the only thing

398
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,073
That's immortal, my love.

399
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,643
So is this.

400
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,689
- What do genocidal maniacs
dream about, I wonder?

401
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,926
- He's imagining himself baking
<i>cookies with his mother.</i>

402
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,496
- Wait, you can monitor
our dreams?

403
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,465
<i>- Of course.</i>
<i>For example, last night,</i>

404
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,000
<i>You had a rollicking fantasy</i>
<i>involving a young nurse--</i>

405
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,235
- Okay, gideon, enough.

406
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,471
- Gideon, check the timeline
to make sure

407
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,739
That the kidnapping of the boy

408
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,575
Had the desired effect
upon the future.

409
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,343
<i>- Oh, dear.</i>

410
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,480
<i>I'm afraid you'll be</i>
<i>disappointed with the results.</i>

411
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,981
- What do you mean,
it did nothing?

412
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,716
- I mean,
that kidnapping per degaton

413
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,518
Had a nominal effect
upon the timeline.

414
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,987
- Maybe we need to dump
the little brat

415
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,190
Somewhere he can't get
into any trouble,

416
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,925
Like the stone age.

417
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,693
<i>- No matter where and when</i>
<i>you sequester him</i>

418
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,962
<i>In the timeline, savage</i>
<i>will still rise to power.</i>

419
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,731
- But rip said this kid's
like a baby hitler.

420
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,667
- Yes, I also said
that time wants to happen,

421
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,370
And such a world-changing event
like savage's rise to power

422
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:30,141
Can't be stopped merely
by kidnapping his young pawn.

423
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,476
- So we're back to plan a?

424
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,444
- Snuffing the kid
out in his sleep?

425
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:37,348
- Let us not forget
that this kid will one day

426
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,385
Be responsible
for billions of deaths,

427
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,454
Including those of my family.

428
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,289
- Say that you do stop savage

429
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,724
And save the lives
of your family.

430
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,426
Will you be able
to look your own son in the eye

431
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,028
Knowing what you did
so he could live?

432
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,799
- When the alternative is that
I shall never see him again.

433
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,434
- I got a better idea.

434
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,069
Instead of us arguing about
whether we should kill him,

435
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,171
Or where and when
to dump him off,

436
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,539
Why don't we just talk to him?

437
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,641
- Savage has spent years
corrupting his mind.

438
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,878
- It's not too late
for per degaton to change.

439
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,079
- Says who?

440
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,081
- Says someone with two tours

441
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,849
With the league
of assassins and a case

442
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,852
Of bloodlust under her belt.

Someone who's willing

448
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,766

449

How you guys

Like it's some kind of
confessional or something.

- Okay,
I'll bite.

454
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,080
- Everybody's out there
arguing about

455
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,415
Whether or not
we should kill this kid,

456
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,418
'cause no one
thinks he can change,

457
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,720
Which made me think of you.

458
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,360
You know no one
thinks you can change.

459
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,296
That's why you're in here.

460
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,798
- The only reason
I'm in here is if I get out,

461
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,266
I'm gonna give snart
some payback

462
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,534
He's not walking away from.

463
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,936
- He saved your life.

464
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,638
- He wussed out on killing me,
not the same thing.

465
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,073
He marooned me.

466
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,643
- It's not like
he had many choices.

467
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,545
You know, while you were busy

468
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,348
Selling us out
to a homicidal time pirate,

469
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,551
Leonard and I almost died.

470
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,721
He was thinking about you,

471
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,526
Told me about your partnership,
your friendship.

472
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,728
- Di it make you weepy?

473
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,066
You think it's gonna
make me weepy?

474
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,769
- He's your friend,
a loyal one.

475
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,273
You should know that.

476
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,709
- Well, thank you.

477
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,512
I'll work it out with him
as soon as I can.

478
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,251
Oh, killing a kid,

479
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,254
Not very hero-like.

everyone inside the conglomerate

Has submitted biosamples

So they can be tracked

What's important is that
I can get your son back.

- How do you know
they haven't killed him already?

493
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,199
