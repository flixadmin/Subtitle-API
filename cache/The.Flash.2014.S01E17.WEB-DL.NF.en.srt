We can't let that happen.

647
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,193
Detective.

648
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,334
Eddie, we need your help.

649
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,008
Brazil?

650
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,718
Why would...

651
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,680
...Mason move to Brazil?

652
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,016
Apparently there was a girl involved.

653
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,854
And he decided to go hike the Amazon
with her for a year.

654
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,190
You know, live off the grid,
write his memoirs or something.

655
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,526
Wow, I guess you really don't know anyone.

656
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,446
-No, you don't.
JOE: Hey, baby. Everything good?

657
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,157
Yeah, yeah, of course. Um...

658
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,369
-Dinner will be ready in a jiff, okay?
-Okay.

659
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,875
She buy it?

660
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,460
I think so.

661
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,547
Keeping her in the dark, it's for her safety.

662
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,216
That is debatable
and we will have that debate.

663
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,803
But for right now, what's our next move?

664
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,681
How do we figure out what Wells is up to?

665
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,935
When Wells was talking me
through phasing...

666
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,646
...so I could get the Trickster's bomb
off my wrist...

667
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,942
...the way that he described
my being the Flash running...

668
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,569
...feeling the wind...

669
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,529
...and the power...

670
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,575
...it's like he was talking from experience.

671
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,785
What are you saying?

672
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,579
I don't know how...

673
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,081
...but he's the man in yellow.

674
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,877
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

675
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,758
I got an 11-80, possible 10-54...

676
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,969
...County Road J,
requesting immediate assistance.

677
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,639
DISPATCHER:
<i>Copy that, units en route to your location.</i>

678
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,310
Sir, we're gonna get you out of here.

679
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,939
Can you tell me your name?
Do you know who you are?

680
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,942
My name...

681
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,569
...is...

682
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,365
...Harrison Wells.
