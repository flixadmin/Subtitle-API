No, but that may have
a little something to do

Especially since my grandfather
was called Commander Steel.

Rex Tyler? As in Hourman?

His killer stole the Askaran Amulet.

Why can't you save Rex?

107

Because we're dealing
with another time traveler.

108
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,900
If we go back and save Rex,

109
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,490
the time traveler will just go back
before then and kill Rex again.

I'm still alive.

162
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,499
(GROANS)

163
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,718
So far so good.

164
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,594
(BREATHES HEAVILY) Oh, samurais.

165
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,062
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

166
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,156
- (FAINT BEEP)
- (CLEARS THROAT)

167
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,241
Can you understand me now?

168
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,619
I'm looking for a friend of mine, okay?

169
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,950
He fell from the sky.

170
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,365
He's about yea tall.

171
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,079
<i>Made out of metal.</i>

172
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,367
No?

173
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,661
(GROANS)

174
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,796
You're alive.

175
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,801
Um... Hi. How did I get here?

176
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,641
I found you lying
at the bottom of a crater

177
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,182
like you had been dropped from the sky.

178
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,396
"Dropped from the sky"?

179
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,482
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

180
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,404
(SCOFFS)

181
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,866
I sailed here, you know, across the ocean.

182
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,111
<i>With some friends.</i>

183
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,905
Who, hopefully, know where to find me.

184
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:19,373
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say
we're on the island of Honshu,

185
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,914
in the vicinity of Kyoto?

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,172
Yes.

187
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,467
How did you learn to speak my language?

188
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,549
I studied it for many years.

189
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,095
You know, so I could trade
with your countrymen.

190
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,429
Yup, feudal Japan is my jam.

191
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,525
MAN: <i>Masako!</i>

192
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,564
What are you doing talking to this <i>gaijin?</i>

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,573
He was hurt, Father.

194
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,699
I brought him home
so you could care for him.

195
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,076
And who will care for us

196
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,956
when the Shogun finds out
we're aiding a foreigner?

197
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,209
Please, Father.
You know what they would do to him.

198
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,080
Very well.

199
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,420
Get him inside quickly.

200
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,839
My name is Nate, by the way.

201
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,058
My name is Masako.

202
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,600
Masako.

203
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,682
That's a pretty name.

204
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,905
The Shogun asked you a question.

205
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,161
Where did you find your armor?

206
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,204
I made it.

207
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,838
Your armor is mine now.

208
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,929
(SCOFFS) You don't understand.

209
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,556
I designed the suit
specifically for my body.

210
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,263
Take the armor away.

211
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,389
You're making a big mistake!

212
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,766
It can kill you.

213
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,145
Too hot?

214
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,617
Are you sure your old man is cool
with you giving me a bath?

215
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,278
My father is not home.

216
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,996
I am only giving you a bath
because you are dirty and injured.

217
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,538
About that.
I'm more durable than it looks.

218
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,087
You still have not told me
where you are from.

219
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,672
The United States.

220
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,007
Which you've never heard of because
it doesn't exist for another 200 years.

221
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,179
You are a strange man.

222
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,561
You have no idea.

223
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,680
Enough about me.

224
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,850
I overheard your father
talk about the Shogun.

225
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,860
Is that Tokugawa Iemitsu, by any chance?

226
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,525
Historians view him
as a particularly brutal warlord in...

227
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,706
Did I say something?

228
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,545
Tomorrow, I am to be married
to Tokugawa Iemitsu.

229
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,873
Then my life is over.

230
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,973
How can you bring a thug
on a rescue mission?

231
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,218
I've known men like you.

232
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,761
Men who take and prey on the weak.

233
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,057
Listen, girly, I'm risking my neck
for two morons who fell out of the ship.

234
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,726
Why? Because they'd do the same for me.

235
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,109
Why are you on the ship?

236
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,738
'Cause I'm a member
of the Justice Society of America.

237
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,115
- It's my job to protect everyone.
- RORY: <i>Except for me.</i>

238
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,573
Snuck up behind me
and sliced my throat like a ninja.

239
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,238
There's no such thing as ninjas,
you idiot.

240
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,247
- Tell that to Chuck Norris.
- Who's that?

241
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,454
- And I'm the idiot.
- By the way, I'm not your girly.

242
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,414
All right, if you two
don't quit your squabbling,

243
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:52,253
I am going to maroon you
in a time period of my choosing, together.

244
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,879
(RORY GRUNTS)

245
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,006
Ah.

246
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,937
Not to brag, but between the
docking stabilizers and the blast doors,

247
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,768
I think this might be
my best patch work ever.

248
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,025
Well, charming as your confidence is,
I think we better consult the expert.

249
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,779
Gideon, would you be so kind
as to run a diagnostic report?

250
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,944
GIDEON: <i>Mr. Jackson's work
has done the trick.</i>

251
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,950
<i>A scan has revealed that
all 36 compartments of the ship</i>

252
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,611
<i>are in optimal condition.</i>

253
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,945
That's weird.

254
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,784
Actually, I think it's astonishing,
given the considerable abuse...

255
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,459
No, no. Not that.

256
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,463
Gideon, did you say 36 compartments?

257
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,798
<i>Correct. The entirety of the ship.</i>

258
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,177
Before Rip, you know, disappeared,

259
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,968
he made me learn
every inch of the Waverider,

260
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,845
and of those inches,

261
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,009
35 compartments.

262
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,849
So, either I miscalculated or...

263
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:51,024
Captain Hunter had a secret compartment
he failed to tell you about.

264
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,144
Gideon, please pull up
the schematics of the ship.

265
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,563
No, we still have to fix the time drive.

266
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,072
And we will.

267
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
After.

00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,665
The Shogun's men are here.

00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,180
We found a <i>gaijin</i> in the forest.

276
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,316
The Shogun wants to make sure

277
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,227
there are not any other foreigners around
to bother you.

278

Oh, that is very kind of him.

But you are the only visitor
we've had today.

Good.

But seriously.

Why don't you boys mosey on back
to your big, bad boss

289
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,220
and tell him the news?

290
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,680
Or what?

I am wearing a Samurai's armor.
You are not.

293
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,236
I wear my armor on the inside.

Stop! Stop, please.
You're going to kill him.

00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,180
You should all be safe here.

476
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,154
They've never seen foreigners before.

477
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,114
I was once just like them.

478
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,571
My village was also small and isolated.

479
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,908
Some would say that
my people were superstitious,

480
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,707
but in truth, we were protected.

481
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,955
Protected by that?

482
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,548
Legend has it that this totem was
one of five created by the gods,

483
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,506
and given to the five great tribes
of Zambesi.

484
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:13,136
This totem harnesses the <i>ashe</i>
or the life force of the animal kingdom.

485
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,603
It was passed down to me from my mother
and from hers before that.

486
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,185
And why did you leave?

487
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,391
I was recruited by the JSA.

488
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:27,363
And I realized that the world was
much larger than just my village

489
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,317
and that there are people beyond
its borders who also needed protection.

490
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,868
Sometimes I can't help but worry
that with me gone,

491
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,825
there's no one left to guard my home,

492
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,500
from people like Mr. Rory.

493
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,919
At the end of the day,
Mick does the right thing.

494
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,334
Usually.

495
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,301
(SIGHS)

496
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,180
You remind me of my son.

497
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,101
Why? Was he a terrible teacher, too?

498
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,435
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

499
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,449
He was a great Samurai.

500
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:19,908
I built him the strongest
and most formidable armor in all of Japan.

501
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,795
Forged him a sword fit for an emperor.

502
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,957
What happened to him?

503
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,133
My son was popular

504
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,969
with the men who served under him,

505
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,384
and the Shogun resented him for it.

506
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:43,598
So he ordered Oda to commit <i>seppuku.</i>

507
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,103
We will make sure that the Shogun
pays for what he's done to your family.

508
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,316
Maybe.

509
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,322
Maybe not.

510
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:59,322
But I ask you, would I rather
hold my son again or his armor?

511
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,658
Your son, obviously.

512
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:07,087
An armor is nothing
but iron, leather and silk.

513
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,664
It can be replaced.

514
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,011
But the man who wears the armor is...

515
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,013
I get it.

516
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,179
You're saying I don't need
a suit of armor to defeat the Shogun.

517
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,846
Don't be ridiculous.

518
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,846
He'll kill you in seconds.

519
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,602
Follow me.

520
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,354
- I'm going to die.
- Yeah, probably.

521
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,363
That was actually your cue to cheer me up.

522
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,699
If you accept death,
you have nothing to fear.

523
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,116
I'm more afraid of what's
going to happen to you if I die.

524
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,710
I know I have these powers inside me.
I just can't figure out how to use them.

525
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,299
Does a child learn to laugh?

526
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,506
Does he sit and practice laughing?

527
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,513
No, he just laughs.

528
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,340

00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,851

639
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,676
- I've figured you out.
- Congratulations.

640
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,092
You act like this selfish meathead,

641
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,474
but secretly you're not so bad.

642
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,352
You know, you might even have
the makings of a hero.

643
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,851
Well, that proves one thing.

644
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,524
You don't know me.

645
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,939
Perhaps not.

646
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,694
Trying to kill me again?

647
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,329
Trying to give you a present.

648
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,532
In case you ever need proof
you met an actual ninja.

649
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,966
All right, what's your secret?

650
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,687
What on earth do you mean?

651
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,560
Well, you two must be magicians

652
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,646
considering how badly damaged
the <i>Waverider</i> was before we left.

653
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:40,063
Oh, that. Well, Jefferson and I went over
the ship top to bottom.

654
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,699
And it's safe to say there
are no surprises left on the <i>Waverider.</i>

655
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,578
Great. I'll go prep for takeoff.

656
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,495
So, we gonna say something about
future-Barry's message or not?

657
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,173
Barry was very clear about the team
not knowing what he told Captain Hunter.

658
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:03,095
- Except now we know.
- Indeed.

659
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,929
You were right, Jefferson.

660
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,096
Some things you just can't un-see.

661
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,442
I think it's time we said <i>sayonara</i>
to feudal Japan.

662
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,022
Now, where to next?

663
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,231
I could always open the hatch,
jump out, and see where I land.

664
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,234
I say we just sit back and
see where the timestream takes us.

665
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,869
Aren't you forgetting
that Rex's killer is still at large?

666
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,571
Not my problem.

667
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,542
I mean, we should
find the bastard and kill him.

668
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,624
Perhaps we can enjoy
a little takeoff music?

669
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,090
- ("TIME IS ON MY SIDE" PLAYING)
- Ah, nice one, Gideon.

670
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,464
GIDEON: <i>Captain Hunter
always enjoyed this song.</i>

671
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,425
Speaking of problems...

672
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,758
Don't worry. We're gonna find Rip
and Hourman's killer.

673
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,428
In the meantime, everyone just shut up
and let me do the flying.

674
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,730
