1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,560
It's a miracle.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,120
- How do you feel?
- Different.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,080
His name is Will Thomas.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,120
Detective Gordon,
my friends, you'll save them.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,480
Say hello to Butch.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,320
No!

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,600
Gordon comes with me.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,600
I'll take his head,
and you can have the rest of him.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,800
This is what got you all hot
and bothered?

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Crazy bitch!

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,440
Not all square yet, though.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,080
You're going to help me do
what we all know needs doing.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,200
- What's that?
- Kill Penguin.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,680
- You made it?
- Show me what you got.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,000
250 apartments.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,120
Once the kids we liberated moved in,
word got out pretty fast

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
that there was a safe place
to live in the city.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,040
You wanted to know
where the Street Demonz base was.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,080
- Where is everybody!
- Holy crap.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
What about that?

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Penguin did this.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>Penguin, our hero</i>

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,320
<i>He knows, no fear, oh.</i>

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,840
<i>He brings us joy and cheer, oh.</i>

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,840
<i>Oh Penguin, our king</i>

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,360
<i>Oh Penguin, our Penguin</i>

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>He's brave and clever and kind</i>

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,840
<i>With a strong resourceful mind</i>

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,400
<i>He rules our land all day</i>

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,280
<i>In the most magnificent way</i>

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,320
<i>Oh Penguin, oh Penguin</i>

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
<i>Oh Penguin, our king</i>

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,720
<i>Oh Penguin, our king, oh Penguin</i>

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,720
Production is steady, Mr. Cobblepot.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Our stores contain 512 loaves
of bread,

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,160
2,001l of filtered water,

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,480
400,232 bullets, and...

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Penn.

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,280
- Why is my counter tenor out cold?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,200
Everyone was working through
the night in the bullet factory.

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,720
We've been shorthanded,
since people started defecting.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Defecting?

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
You've been holding out on me, Penn.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,960
A thousand apologies, I... I simply
couldn't stand seeing you upset

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,360
while you were recovering.

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
Tell me everything!

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
Rumor is they've fled to a place
called Haven,

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
in Jim Gordon's sector.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,160
My subjects are fleeing
to Jim Gordon?

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
After he shot me?

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
What of my bounty on Gordon's head?

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,080
We've had trouble finding takers.

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,600
The gangs are too disorganized.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,600
And ordinary people, well,
they love him, sir.

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
They should love me.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,040
Without me, this entire island
would sink into chaos!

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,160
It's not just us.

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
People from every territory
are fleeing to Haven.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,520
Finally, breakfast!

61
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,040
The Street Demonz.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,280
To what do I owe this honor?

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,720
You hit our stronghold
and killed our men!

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Not just us.

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,600
You hit the Lo Boyz
and the Undead too.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,920
- Did I now?
- You tagged the scenes with graffiti

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,720
that said "Penguin was here!"

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
You dolt!

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,520
If I wanted to start a gang war,
you'd all be dead.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,240
I wouldn't leave a few
and sign my name.

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
Someone wanted you to attack me.

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
That's a good point.

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,520
We didn't really think this through.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Well, there'll be plenty of time
for thinking

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,200
when my men are ripping out
your fingernails.

76
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,240
- Chain them up!
- Wait! Wait!

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
Tighten our borders.

78
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
No one in or out

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,240
or it's your head!

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
That's right, Edward.

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,360
It's Mr. Penn's head.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,960
It's his head.

83
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,360
You're a good dog.

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,800
{\an5}Word of this place is spreading
like a bad case of the clap.

85
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,720
{\an5}We've got refugees coming in
from every territory in Gotham.

86
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,960
{\an5}Can you blame them?
You saw what it was like out there.

87
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,480
{\an5}People being starved and terrorized.
Used by the gangs as slave labor.

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,080
{\an5}You think those same gangs
aren't gonna want them back?

89
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,240
{\an5}Sooner or later, they're gonna come
looking for us.

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
{\an5}Let them.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,000
{\an5}Hey, I get it.

92
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,520
{\an5}But after our excursion
through Nightmare-town last week,

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,880
{\an5}- we hardly have any ammo left.
- Sorry.

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,840
{\an5}- And we barely have any food.
- Okay, all right.

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,800
{\an5}This is the only safe place left
in Gotham.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,120
{\an5}I'm not turning people away.

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
{\an5}I was afraid you were gonna say that.

98
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,400
{\an5}- Hey, how you feeling? How are...
- I'm fine.

99
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
{\an5}You getting any sleep?

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
You've been going full-tilt
for months.

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
{\an5}Carrying the weight of everyone.

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,240
{\an5}Share the load.
We can't have you fall apart.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
Thanks.

104
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
I'm okay.

105
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,960
{\an5}Please tell me some good news.

106
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
{\an5}Water purification system repurposed
from Wayne Enterprises tech.

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,760
{\an5}I know it's a drop in the bucket,
but every bit helps.

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,040
The last can of beans.
I ain't had my rations yet!

109
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
{\an5}Hey. Break it up. Break it up.

110
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Break it up.

111
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,040
{\an5}For all the new people here.

112
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
{\an5}Everyone is welcome in Haven.

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
{\an5}But there are rules,

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,320
and one of them is we leave
the fighting outside.

115
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,560
The government already thinks
we don't deserve help.

116
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,360
We have to show otherwise.

117
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,320
Gangs want to tear themselves
apart outside, that's their business.

118
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,920
In here, in Haven...

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,160
we help each other survive.

120
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Your speech worked.

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
For now.

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,600
What happens when they find out
the government abandoned them?

123
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Sorry.

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
For what?

125
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
Jim, you're holding
this place together.

126
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
You're giving these people hope.

127
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,240
Hope can only go so far.

128
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,760
Not to put more on your plate,

129
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,840
but the kid whose friends
you saved from the slavers,

130
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
his bunkmates say
he's been having nightmares.

131
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,120
Last night he fell off his bed
half asleep and broke his arm.

132
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Maybe you could talk to him.

133
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Hey.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Don't feel like joining
the other kids?

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,320
We can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,160
But it's over, you're safe now.

137
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,200
I promise, I will never let anyone
hurt you ever again.

138
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
All right?

139
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
I got something for you.

140
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
My rations.

141
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Pineapple.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Hang in there.

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,320
I'll come check on you later, okay?

144
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Selina?

145
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
One second.

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,080
What are you doing out of bed?
The doctor said you need rest.

147
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,200
Does it look like I need rest?

148
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
No, but...

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Look.

150
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Whatever Ivy's root did to me,
I've never felt better.

151
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,400
So, now I have to find the freak
who shot me.

152
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,400
I've been looking for Jeremiah
since the bridges blew.

153
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
I haven't found a thing.

154
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
Right, but there have never been
refugees in the Green Zone before.

155
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,880
These people come from
all over Gotham, Bruce.

156
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Someone has to know something.

157
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
I want to find Jeremiah
just as much as you do.

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,560
But even if we find him,
he's had months to fortify himself.

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
We can't go after him alone.

160
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
You scared, Bruce?

161
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Of course I'm scared.

162
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,600
Jeremiah shot you to get to me.
He almost killed you.

163
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I won't lose you.

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm not yours to lose.

165
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,640
You can't stop me
from going after Jeremiah,

166
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
but I am asking you for help.

167
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,480
We take him down, we do it right.

168
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,360
We bring him back here,

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,000
and he's stands trial
for turning Gotham into a madhouse.

170
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
What?

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,480
I was hoping I could count on you.

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,120
I heard rumors about Jeremiah
in the Dark Zone.

173
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,920
But, who knows if they're true.

174
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,600
- The Dark Zone?
- On the other end of the island.

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
It's chaos.

176
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,480
Ruled by those who've lost their
minds since the bridges went down.

177
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,120
They said Jeremiah is there,
gathering followers.

178
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,640
Sounds like a lead.

179
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
No.

180
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
You can't go there. You'll die.

181
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,120
We've fought Jeremiah before.

182
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,680
You don't understand.

183
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,040
If you go to the Dark Zone, Jeremiah
is the least of your worries.

184
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,800
Everyone there is insane.

185
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,080
Look at what they did to my friend.

186
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Penn! Where the...

187
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,040
<i>Penguin, my hero</i>

188
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,240
<i>He having, no fear, oh.</i>

189
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>-He brings us joy and cheer, oh.</i>
-Stop.

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,120
Stop.

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Where is my staff? Where is Mr. Penn?

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,760
They having to defected.

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
To Haven.

194
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,320
My guards didn't stop them?

195
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
My guards too?

196
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Edward?

197
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,160
Edward, Edward!

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,320
They took my dog?

199
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,720
Rumors say pup went willingly.

200
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,160
Lie.

201
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,040
You're in luck, my friend.

202
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,400
Jim Gordon is luring people
from every territory in Gotham.

203
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
Including yours.

204
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,080
As our interests are now aligned,
I have decided that you may live.

205
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,280
He's been dead since yesterday.

206
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,520
Contact the Lo Boyz and the Undead.

207
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,280
You have men, vehicles, and gas.

208
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,440
I have the bullets.

209
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,600
It's time we paid a visit
to this Haven.

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Right after I put on some clothes.

211
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,800
Jim!

212
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Border guards just radioed.

213
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
Penguin broke through the barricades.

214
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,160
Street Demonz, other gangs,
rolling with him.

215
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,320
They're heading for Haven.

216
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,680
We can beat them there. Load up.

217
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
What the hell are we gonna do?

218
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,920
We don't have more than a dozen
bullets between us.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
You're right.

220
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,440
If we get a firefight, we're dead.

221
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,920
Okay, I'm gonna need you to go
get some help.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm not sure we got any friends left.

223
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm hoping we still have one.

224
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,200
So, this is the Dark Zone.

225
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
They should call it the Dull Zone.

226
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Place is dead.

227
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
What?

228
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
You seem yourself again.

229
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm glad.

230
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,040
Wait, I know this block.

231
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
Used to be the posh part of town.

232
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,160
Everyone with money got out.

233
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
You didn't.

234
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I had a reason to stay.

235
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,320
Oh, God.

236
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,840
Help me, please.

237
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,680
- Come on!
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

238
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,960
- Oh, God.
- Get down!

239
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,320
Now we know who carved
"kill" into that guy's chest.

240
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,160
Do you think they know anything
about Jeremiah?

241
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,640
Let's find someone else to ask.

242
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Let's go.

243
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Before they see us.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Kill.

245
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,840
We're not here for you.

246
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
We're looking for Jeremiah Valeska.

247
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Kill you.

248
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
Kill Jeremiah!

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,280
I don't think this guy's much
of a talker, Bruce.

250
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
What do you want to do?

251
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Easy.

252
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,760
Find the schoolyard's biggest bully.

253
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
And kick his teeth in!

254
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
The chicky-chick is mine!

255
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Selina.

256
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,480
<i>Mine eyes have seen the glory</i>

257
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,720
<i>Of the coming of the Lord</i>

258
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,920
<i>He is trampling out the vintage</i>

259
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,880
<i>Where the grapes of wrath
are stored...</i>

260
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,520
Everyone inside!

261
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Inside.

262
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
Let's go, get inside.

263
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,080
What's going on, Captain Gordon?

264
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Inside. Go.

265
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Hold your fire.

266
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Hold your fire.

267
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,080
Well, if it isn't my old friend,
Mr. Penn.

268
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,000
And the Gertrud Kapel
put Memorial Choir!

269
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,520
It is so nice to see
some familiar faces!

270
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,280
You shouldn't have come here,
Oswald.

271
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,280
Oh, well, perhaps you shouldn't have
stolen my people

272
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,400
or my dog.

273
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,360
Every refugee is here
of their own free will,

274
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,600
and under the protection of the GCPD.

275
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,800
Edward, Edward!

276
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,120
Come here.

277
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,880
Right now!

278
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,080
I will make this very simple, Jim.

279
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,440
You return our people, and Edward,
and an apology,

280
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
or we will destroy this little
commune of yours

281
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,840
and salt the earth
on which it stands.

282
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,880
The answer is no. Now turn around
unless you want a bloodbath.

283
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,280
Let me explain something, Jim.

284
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,680
I heard about your little excursion
through the territories.

285
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,880
So, whatever ammo you stole from me,

286
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,560
I'm betting you used it up,

287
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,560
which means you're bluffing.

288
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
You want to test us, Oswald?

289
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
I'm sure my men could use
the target practice.

290
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,000
Slice and dice, little chicky.

291
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
You look soft.

292
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,760
You look like 300lbs of ugly.

293
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,080
Kill and kill.

294
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Where's Jeremiah?

295
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
- Where is Jeremiah?
- Jeremiah?

296
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,320
Tell me where Jeremiah is

297
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,200
or my face is going to be the last
thing you ever see.

298
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,080
Old Town North, okay?

299
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,680
We don't mess with him.

300
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Old Town North?

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
It's the truth.

303
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,000
Selina, he's had enough.

304
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,600
He's had enough
when I say he's had enough.

305
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
What the hell?

306
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
You won.

307
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
It's over.

308
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,760
Old Town North, see?

309
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,160
That was easy.

310
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
What are we waiting for?

311
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
You said they'll be out of bullets.

312
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
He's bluffing, you idiot.

313
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
How do you know?

314
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
I know Jim Gordon.

315
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,840
But if you require a demonstration,

316
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
three of you, march.

317
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,120
But, they have guns.

318
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
So, do I

319
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,160
and mine is most certainly loaded.

320
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
On my mark.

321
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Make them count.

322
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
Well, Jim,

323
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
it seems you are out of ammo,
after all.

324
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,160
Now, if you don't want your men

325
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,200
to die in a hail of bullets,
you know what to do.

326
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,720
Fine. On the count of three.

327
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,240
- One, two...
- All right.

328
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
All right. Put them down.

329
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Put them down.

330
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
Selina, what was that back there?

331
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,480
They had to know I was serious.

332
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
You didn't have to hurt him
like that.

333
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,280
He was trying to kill me, Bruce,

334
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,600
just like Jeremiah tried to kill me.

335
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
So, as far as I'm concerned...

336
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
he got off easy.

337
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
Whose side are you on, Bruce?

338
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Yours.

339
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,360
Always.

340
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,800
Then let's do what we came here
to do.

341
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,520
Looks like we're close.

342
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
When I see him,

343
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,040
I'm gonna tear his throat out.

344
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Selina.

345
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,040
Welcome, pilgrims,

346
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
to The Church of Jeremiah Valeska.

347
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,720
The only place
where you faithful pilgrims

348
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,640
can become your very best selves.

349
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Who the hell is that?

350
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
I don't know.

351
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,200
I bet she knows
where Jeremiah is, though.

352
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,000
Stay here.
I'm gonna get a closer look.

353
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,320
No.

354
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,560
We do this together, Selina.
That was the deal.

355
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,560
Funny, I don't remember saying that.

356
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,280
Now, I know you've come from far
and wide to meet the man himself.

357
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,760
But first, he requires a show
of faith.

358
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Don't be shy.

359
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,840
Jeremiah awaits.

360
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Who is ready?

361
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,320
Lovely.

362
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,840
Jeremiah will be so happy.

363
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
But remember,

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,320
he wants only the most
faithful followers.

365
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,320
And you all have a chance
to prove yourself,

366
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,840
right up those stairs.

367
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,920
And the rest of you, get out!

368
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Selina.

369
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Wait.

370
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,360
I want to meet Jeremiah.

371
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,280
You don't look like
one of Jeremiah's worshipers.

372
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,720
I have witnessed his work firsthand.

373
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,480
I will never forget it.

374
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,400
Then right this way.

375
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
You're gonna regret this.

376
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Strong words,
for someone who is out of options.

377
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,560
First, I'm gonna make you watch
while I destroy Haven.

378
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,320
Then, I'm gonna shoot you

379
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
and leave you for dead,
just like you did to me.

380
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
Sound fair?

381
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,920
If the government liberates
the city and finds out about this,

382
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,120
you'll be at the top of their list.

383
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Wake up, Jim.

384
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,520
The government has abandoned us.

385
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,480
The only law in Gotham is power,
and that power belongs to me.

386
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,120
We have children here, families.

387
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,800
What happens when the gangs
take them?

388
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,320
They probably go back
to being slaves, I guess.

389
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,600
My people, on the other hand,
will go back to their regular lives,

390
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,120
with their bellies full of gruel
and their heads

391
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,560
full of wonderful thoughts
about their grand protector, me.

392
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,000
If this is about revenge against me,
do your worst.

393
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,240
But leave the refugees out of it.

394
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
So heroic.

395
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Almost tempting.

396
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,640
But I think I'm gonna stick
to my original plan.

397
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,040
Jim's gonna die, isn't he, boy?

398
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
Oh, you're a good dog, yes, you are.

399
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Mr. Cobblepot.

400
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Stop. That one belongs to me.

401
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
No can do.

402
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,360
You sacrificed one of my guys
calling the cop's bluff.

403
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
So, what?

404
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
I said, he's mine.

405
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,560
Oh, thank you, Mr. Cobblepot.

406
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,960
Then, how about we take
your territory?

407
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
And your bullet factory.

408
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Penn! Penn!

409
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

410
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,840
You fool!

411
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,040
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me.

412
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,160
Why did you leave?

413
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,840
Everyone hated you.

414
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,960
You will pay for this!

415
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,040
Hey, Penguin,
you got something on your face.

416
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,640
Let me go! We had a deal!

417
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,760
Shut your mouth...

418
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,640
or the next thing that comes
out your mouth is a bullet.

419
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,480
Man, you are on fire!

420
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
I take it that didn't work out
the way you'd hoped.

421
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Barbara?

422
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Barbara?

423
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
Hey, you in here?

424
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
You've gotten good at that.

425
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
Haven't you heard, Harvey?

426
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,800
No men in the Sirens past midnight.

427
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,440
Sorry to bust up ladies' night,
but Jim Gordon needs your help.

428
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,280
Perhaps it's time Golden Boy
learned to save himself.

429
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,120
And aren't you tired
of playing sidekick?

430
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
See, I don't see it that way.

431
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,320
Me and Jim are friends.

432
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,760
We're fighting for the same thing.

433
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
It seemed like you got that.

434
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,320
You know, I remember
when you first partnered up.

435
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,040
He, the idealistic rookie.

436
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,600
You, the cynical veteran.

437
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
You were sane.

438
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,360
Now you carry his laundry.

439
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,200
Do you ever wonder what your life
might've been like

440
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,400
if you'd never met Jim Gordon?

441
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,960
I'd be dead, or wishing I was.

442
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,400
You're delusional, Harvey.

443
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Just like all the sad saps
who think the government

444
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,840
is just gonna sail in and save them.

445
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Maybe, and look, I know
you've had your differences with Jim,

446
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,000
but if you don't help him now,

447
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,200
- Penguin and the other gangs...
- Penguin?

448
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,040
You should've opened with that.

449
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's move!

450
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
It's not working.

451
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,320
We need to find a way
to cut these bindings.

452
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
Well, I'm not helping you, Jim.

453
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,760
You are the reason
I'm in this predicament.

454
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
You have taken everything from me.

455
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Keep your voice down.

456
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I kept people safe.
I protected them from chaos.

457
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,960
They should have loved me.

458
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,920
Instead, they came here,
to this pigsty,

459
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
to be covered in fleas and filth.

460
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,040
Why? What makes this place
so special?

461
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,960
Well, for one thing,
it's far away from you.

462
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,280
Oh, that's rich, Jim.

463
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,680
You should be proud of yourself
for that one.

464
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Quiet.

465
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,480
I think I saw someone place
a stash there.

466
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,200
- Who is that?
- A friend.

467
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,880
Just act normal.

468
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,040
I know it's a stretch.

469
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Hey.

470
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Bingo.

471
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm gonna get out of here, Jim.

472
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,600
And I'm gonna watch these animals
tear this place to the ground.

473
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,720
So, you make your way back
to your territory, then what?

474
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,960
You don't think that eventually,
these gangs are gonna come after you?

475
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
We need to take them out.

476
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,080
Right here, right now.

477
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Now, how do we pick it up?

478
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,720
I'll have to have a word
with the cleaning lady.

479
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,000
Mind your step, pilgrims.

480
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,400
But first,

481
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,000
the main attraction.

482
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,480
Six-shooters.

483
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Bang, bang.

484
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,200
Each of you get one gun,

485
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,120
and one bullet.

486
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,880
What is this?

487
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Like I said, a show of faith.

488
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,720
But if
you're ch...ch...ch...chicken...

489
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Try me.

490
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,360
Oh, my little pilgrims.

491
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
This will make Jeremiah so happy.

492
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Now,

493
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,480
on the count of three.

494
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
One.

495
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Two.

496
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Chicken poo.

497
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,440
Just seeing if y'all were listening.

498
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Three!

499
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,960
Well, well, well.

500
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,160
You disappoint me, curls.

501
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,520
I had such high hopes for you.

502
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What, with that

503
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,880
cocky little swagger and all.

504
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,960
I'm just not a mindless idiot

505
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,680
who's willing to get shot
in the head for nothing.

506
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Hear that?

507
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,720
Curls is here to judge all of us,

508
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,280
to judge Jeremiah and his methods.

509
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
What a fitting reminder.

510
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
To outsiders,

511
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,640
Jeremiah's methods
may look like madness,

512
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,040
but we believers know,

513
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,680
his methods will be our salvation.

514
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Now...

515
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
I need to have a word
with our friend.

516
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,480
The rest of you

517
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,520
get straight A's.

518
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,560
Please proceed

519
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
and be reborn.

520
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
What's the matter?

521
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,240
Don't you want to meet Jeremiah?

522
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
I do.

523
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm just not willing
to play your little psychotic game.

524
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,240
But, baby, it's so fun.

525
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,160
If it's so fun, why don't you play?

526
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Don't you get it?

527
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I have.

528
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,800
The bullet's still inside.

529
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,360
Rattling around this old noggin
of mine.

530
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,640
Ping. Ping.

531
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Ping.

532
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,200
Boy, do I feel it
when the nights get cold.

533
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
You're insane.

534
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No.

535
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I was willing to look death
in the face,

536
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,040
to allow the old me to die.

537
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,600
It's the gift Jeremiah's
brother Jerome gave him.

538
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,960
And the gift he wants
for all his followers.

539
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,320
Don't you want to experience
this gift for yourself?

540
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,000
I know I want you to.

541
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,400
Selina.

542
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
You know me.

543
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,120
There isn't a single part
of Bruce Wayne's life

544
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,240
that we don't know about.

545
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,240
His joys, his disappointments,

546
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,840
his desires.

547
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,200
But just like Bruce wasn't ready
to embrace his true self,

548
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,760
looks like you aren't either.

549
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
Maybe.

550
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,440
But one thing

551
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,840
Jeremiah did teach me is I...

552
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,680
hate having a gun pointed
at my face.

553
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,840
Oh, puddin', aren't you delicious.

554
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,760
Don't call me puddin'.

555
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,880
There you go, Selina.

556
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,520
I knew you had it in you.

557
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,200
All it took was a little kick
in the pants.

558
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,480
Where's Jeremiah?

559
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,440
Selina, drop the gun.

560
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,360
Oh... oh, your boyfriend's worried.

561
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,360
But I still don't think
you have what it takes.

562
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Yeah?

563
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,800
Well, let's see what happens
when someone deserves

564
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,360
to get shot in the head.

565
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
Selina, stop!

566
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,960
Wait. You're bleeding.

567
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,160
If you know what's good for you,
you will let me go.

568
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,560
We need to get you patched up.

569
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,720
- What are you doing?
- I have been doing it your way.

570
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,840
I'm gonna do it my way.

571
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
Selina!

572
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
Selina!

573
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,480
Look at those biceps.

574
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,520
I need him to build barricades.

575
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,040
Nah, homie. This guy's got cage match
written all over him.

576
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
I'll give you two of mine
in exchange.

577
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
How about this.

578
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,360
Drop your guns,
and I won't shoot you.

579
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,120
How the hell did he get free?

580
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,360
Don't matter. He's bluffing again.

581
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm afraid he's not.

582
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
Neither am I.

583
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,840
Come on out, boys.

584
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
Yes, Edward, I killed the bad men.

585
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,200
- Penguin did.
- Penguin shot the gang leader.

586
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
We're safe now.

587
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,640
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

588
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,640
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

589
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,040
Penguin! Penguin!

590
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,200
Penguin! Penguin!

591
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,080
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

592
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,040
Penguin! Penguin!

593
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,360
You'd said we'd be safe here.

594
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,800
We were better off
where we came from.

595
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,720
Give it a rest, he saved us!

596
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
All right, listen up.

597
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,960
- Listen to me.
- For what?

598
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Listen to me!

599
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,400
I know today was a hard day.

600
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,480
And I can't say
there won't be others.

601
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
But we won.

602
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,200
We got Penguin's guns,
his ammunition.

603
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
We survived.

604
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,640
And as long as we survive,
hope survives in Gotham.

605
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,320
I think that's worth fighting for.

606
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
So do I.

607
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
There's work to be done...

608
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,080
wounded to be cared for.

609
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,520
Food, water to be doled out.

610
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Tomorrow's another day.

611
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Go to.

612
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,760
Captain, we've got Penguin outside.

613
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
All right, give me a minute.

614
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
Hey.

615
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,280
That was a brave thing you did there.

616
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,440
We wouldn't have escaped without you.

617
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,280
You saved me and my friends.

618
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
I wanted to help.

619
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,480
I can't be everywhere at once.

620
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,160
I'm gonna need people
I can trust watching over this place.

621
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Maybe...

622
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,320
you could be my deputy
here in Haven.

623
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Thanks.

624
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,400
Because, honestly,
I'm allergic to pineapple.

625
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Go get 'em, Deputy.

626
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,000
Jim, is this really necessary?

627
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,920
I did just save,
I don't know, hundreds of people.

628
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,960
After endangering them to begin with.

629
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,120
Forgive me
if I wanted to play it safe.

630
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,920
Still, I do hope that there are
no hard feelings.

631
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,440
You did the right thing today,
Oswald.

632
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,560
You're free to go,
just don't make me regret it.

633
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Jim!

634
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Harvey.

635
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,880
- Hi, Pengy.
- Jim!

636
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,480
- Hold your fire.
- Bye, Pengy.

637
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,440
- Barbara, no. No.
- Get out of the way! Now!

638
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,080
Outside of the Green Zone,
he's fair game, but not here.

639
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Last chance.
Move now or you get my first bullet.

640
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I'm not moving.
