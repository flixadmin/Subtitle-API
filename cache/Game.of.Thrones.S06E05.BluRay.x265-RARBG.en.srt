"We shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy."

322
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,826
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

323
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,787
Let the old Euron drown.

324
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,706
Let his lungs fill with seawater.

325
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:26,007
Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

326

What is dead may never die.

327

Won't be enough to save them.

339

Go back to your homes.

340
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,683
Chop down every tree you can find.

341

Quarter-saw the timber and start building.

I want every woman spinning flax for sails.

Build me 1,000 ships.

And I will give you this world.

346

You must send me away.

Is there a cure?

353
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,842
I don't know.

354
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,845
How long does it take?

355
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,764
I don't know that either.

356
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,184
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

I'll end things before that.

Goodbye, Khaleesi.

365

Do not walk away from your queen,
Jorah the Andal.

366
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,529
You have not been dismissed.

367
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,659
You pledged yourself to me.

368
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,411
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

369
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,041
Well, I command you to find the cure,

370
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,170
wherever it is in this world.

371
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,800
I command you to heal yourself,

372
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,678
and then return to me.

373
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,016
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

374
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,144
I need you by my side.

375
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:13,021
In the last fortnight
since our pact with the Masters,

376
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,524
how many killings have been carried out
by the Sons of the Harpy?

377
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,692
None.

378
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,903
And how many Masters have been butchered
by the free men?

379
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,323
Two, but that was the day of the pact.

380
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,116
Since then, nothing.

381
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,494
So, it's safe to say
that a fragile peace has taken hold.

382
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,704
For now.

383
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,789
"For now" is the best
we get in our profession.

384
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,082
It's not enough.

385
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,144
Considering the city
was on the brink of civil war,

386
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,128
I'd say it's a good start.

387
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,422
It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.

388
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:42,258
They need to know
Daenerys is responsible for it.

389
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,053
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

390
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,305
Resist the foreign invaders.

391
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,599
Our queen has an even better story.

392
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,145
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains, all that.

393
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,856
The people know who brought them freedom.

394
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,442
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

395
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,444
Who brought about an end to the violence?

396
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,155
We need someone the people trust,

397
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:07,450
someone they know
cannot be bought or influenced.

398
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:10,828
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

399
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,247
Who said anything about "him"?

Welcome to Meereen.

408
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,318
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

409
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,661
Thank you for traveling all this way.

410
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:55,456
I know from personal experience
how uncomfortable the journey can be.

411
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,922
The truth is we need your help.

412
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,426
We had hoped that
we could somehow persuade you to...

413
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,636
You don't need to persuade me.

414
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:09,971
I came to help.

415
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:14,183
Daenerys Stormborn
is the one who was promised.

416
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,603
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

417
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,106
TYRION: Yes.

418
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:24,694
She has freed the slaves from their chains
and crucified the Masters for their sins.

419
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,363
TYRION: She did indeed.

420
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,408
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

421
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,493
a gift from the Lord of Light.

422
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,204
But you heard all of this before,
haven't you?

423
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,707
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

424
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:43,504
The dragons will purify nonbelievers
by the thousands,

425
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,048
burning their sins and flesh away.

426
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:51,095
Ideally we'd avoid
purifying too many nonbelievers.

427
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,973
The Mother of Dragons
has followers of many different faiths.

428
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,477
You want your queen
to be worshipped and obeyed.

429
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,772
And while she's gone, you want her advisors
to be worshipped and obeyed.

430
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,276
I'd settle for obeyed.

431
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,237
KINVARA: I will summon
my most eloquent priests.

432
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,114
They will spread the word.

433
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,702
Daenerys has been sent
to lead the people against the darkness

434
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:18,748
in this war, and in the great war
still to come.

435
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,541
That sounds most excellent.

436
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,586
A man named
Stannis Baratheon was anointed

437
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,589
as the chosen one by one
of your priestesses.

438
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,383
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

439
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,260
He attacked King's Landing

440
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,931
and was soundly defeated
by the man standing beside me.

441
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,475
Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

442
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,646
this time at Winterfell,
and this time for good.

443
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,899
We'd be most grateful
for any support you could provide the queen.

444
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,610
I suppose it's hard
for a fanatic to admit a mistake.

445
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:51,531
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

446
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,866
You're always right.

447
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,452
Everything is the Lord's will.

448
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,497
Everything is the Lord's will.

449
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,543
But men and women make mistakes.

450
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,336
Even honest servants of the Lord.

451
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,465
And you, an honest servant of the Lord,

452
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:14,011
why should I trust you to know any more
than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

453
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,223
My friend has a healthy skepticism
of religion,

454
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,725
but we are all loyal supporters
of the queen.

455
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,274
Everyone is what they are,

456
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,985
and where they are for a reason.

457
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,073
Terrible things happen for a reason.

458
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,660
Take what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when you were a child.

459
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,291
If not for your mutilation
at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,

460
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:46,377
you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen

461
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,254
bring his light into the world.

462
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:52,174
Knowledge has made you powerful.

463
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,178
But there's still so much you don't know.

464
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,767
Do you remember what you heard that night

465
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,187
when the sorcerer
tossed your parts in the fire?

466
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,651
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

467
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,698
Should I tell you what the voice said?

468
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,578
Should I tell you
the name of the one who spoke?

469
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,381
We serve the same queen.

470
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:37,303
If you are her true friend,
you have nothing to fear from me.

00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:21,610
He touched you.

480
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,532
He knows you are here. He'll come for you.

481
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,617
But he can't get in.

482
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:32,371
He can now. His mark is on you.

483
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,123
You must leave, all of you.

484
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,938
Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

485
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:40,963
Hodor.

486
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,216
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

487
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,052
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

488
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,222
For you to become me.

489
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,476
But am I ready?

490
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,478
No.

491
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:02,860
JON: We can't defend the North from
the Walkers and the south from the Boltons.

492
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:07,197
If we want to survive, we need Winterfell,
and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

493
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,954
DAVOS: Aside from
the Starks and the Boltons,

494
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,832
the most powerful houses in the North

495
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:20,419
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,
and the Manderlys.

496
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,380
The Umbers and the Karstarks

497
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:26,967
have already declared for the Boltons,
so we're not doing so well there.

498
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,845
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

499
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:34,725
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
without knowing they had another choice.

500
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,162
Uh, I beg your pardon, my lady,

501
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:40,397
but they know that
a Stark beheaded their father.

502
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,161
I don't think we can count on them either.

503
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,862
How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?

504
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,238
Precious little, my lady.

505
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,741
SANSA: My father always said
Northerners are different.

506
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,495
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

507
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,163
They may well be loyal,

508
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,875
but how many rose up against the Boltons
when they betrayed your family?

509
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,838
I may not know the North, but I know men.

510
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,651
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

511
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:09,760
and even the bravest of them

512
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:14,139
don't want to see their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

513
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,601
If Jon's going to convince them
to fight alongside him,

514
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:19,645
they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

515
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,022
There are more than three other houses
in the North,

516
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:26,777
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood.

517
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,028
Two dozen more.

518
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,406
Together they equal all the others.

519
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,324
We can start small and build.

520
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,243
SANSA: The North remembers.

521
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:36,537
They remember the Stark name.

522
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:40,666
People will still risk everything for it,
from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

523
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,918
I don't doubt it.

524
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,254
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

525
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,630
No, but I do.

526
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,430
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

527
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:57,075
And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,

528
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,935
but they will back us
against the Boltons without question.

529
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,854
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

530
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,773
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it
and retaken Riverrun.

531
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,192
How do you know that?

532
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,321
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

533
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,451
That's good.

534
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:19,121
The Blackfish is a legend.
His support would mean a great deal.

535
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,000
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

536
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,335
almost starts to look like a winning side.

537
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,798
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

538
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,635
You heard them. We need more men,
and my uncle has an army.

539
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,137
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

540
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,141
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
It has to be you.

541
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,225
Ride for Riverrun.

542
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,645
My uncle will talk to you
and you'll know how to talk to him.

548

A bit brooding, perhaps.

551
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:09,505

helped a man murder his own brother

00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,756
with blood magic.

553
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,717

where were they?
