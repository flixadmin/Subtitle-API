<i>The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...</i>

3

at the Afghan border...</i>

4

<i>...will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.</i>

its recent series of military exercises...</i>

The United States does not start fights.

10
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,089
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

11
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,061
...in order to maintain peace...

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,963
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

13
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,196
"Do the consequences
of attacking America...

14
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,001
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

15
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,804
As a result of the Soviet activity...

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,776
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

17
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:27,352

<i>Question:</i>

On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility...

21
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,529
...10 meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

22
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:44,193
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

23

Pat Buchanan.

24
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,170
Zero.

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,968
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

26
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,977
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

27
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,615
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

28

<i>...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.</i>

29

stopped the Soviet Union...</i>

30

<i>...from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.</i>

31
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,490
You don't think it's just posturing?

32
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,255
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

33
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,957
...are doing these bomb tests...

34
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,504
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

35
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,201
<i>Maybe the whole world feels like that.</i>

<i>Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters...</i>

37

Just a matter of time, I suppose.

38
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,040
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

39
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,945
Mother, forgive me.

40
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,693

is not the way to peace.</i>

Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

Edward Blake. Sixty-seven
years old. Six-two, a solid 225.

48
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,167
Guy was built like a linebacker.

49
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,237
Yeah, I saw the body.

50
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,465
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

51
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,304
You mean apart from being dead?

52
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,036
That's plate glass.

53
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,115
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

54
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,343
Had to have been thrown.

55
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,713
Check the bedroom?

56
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,822
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

57
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,050
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

58
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,694
Or made to look like one.

59
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,625
See this?

60
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,162
- Shaking hands with the president.
Whoa.

61
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,564
Think Blake was a spook?

62
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,400
Government or black ops?

63
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,607
I think...

64
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,208
...this is way bigger than both of us.

Pirate outfits, ghosts.

90

They thought it was funny:
dress up and pull heists.

As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

So a few of us cops, we get together...

...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

We'll finish what the law couldn't.

00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:19,371
Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys...

105

You guys who picked up where we left off.
- with Nixon forcing you out.

Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

109
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,859
Truth?

110
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,265
You were a better Nite Owl

Watch it with the language.

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,604
Yeah.

00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,341
Next week?
Well...

00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:03,113
...you know, you don't have to

Rorschach.

125
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:30,304
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

126
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,910
No, no. Course not.

127
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,073
You want me to heat those up for you?

128
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,773
Fine like this.

129
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,546
How have you been keeping?

130
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,721
Out of prison.

131
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,683
So far.

132
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,822
Daniel...

133
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,954
...look at this.

134
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,834
Is this bean juice?
Human bean juice.

135
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:09,037
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

136
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,516
Let's talk downstairs.

137
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,081
It could have been a burglary.

138
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,950
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

139
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,856
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

140
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,865
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

141
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,196
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

142
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,305
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

143
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,735
Maybe.

144
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,173
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

145
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,437
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

146
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,173
That what they say about me now?

147
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,678
Paranoid?

148
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,684
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

149
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,344
...even among his friends.

150
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,683
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

151
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,518
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

152
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,757
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

153
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,761
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

154
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:11,603
- You were never that sentimental.
- Attack on one is attack on all of us.

155
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,478
What do you suggest we do about it?

156
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,540
Retribution.

157
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,249
- Watchmen are over.
- Says Tricky Dick.

158
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,183
Says me.

159
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,418
Nobody knows who you are.

160
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,562
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

161
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,631
That what you have now?
A normal life?

162
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,001
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

163
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,638
...past the human cockroaches...

164
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,570
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

165
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,266
...do you really feel normal?

166
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,175
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

167
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,311
No.

168
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,113
You're hiding in plain sight.

169
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,650
Be seeing you, Dan.

170
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,626
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

171
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,523
Yeah, I remember.

172
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,757
Came here often,
when we were partners.

173
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,834
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

174
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,567
- What happened?
- You quit.

175
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,824
<i>Mr. Veidt...</i>

176
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,763
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

177
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,371
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

178
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,474
...the first being Hollis Mason.

179
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,634
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

180
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:59,079
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

181
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,311
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

182
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,546
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

183
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,921
- I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
- I'm sorry. Do you think...

184
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,654
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

185
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,560
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

186
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,759
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

187
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,928
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

188
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,700
...sells more magazines.

189
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,976
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

190
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,082
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

191
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,481
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

192
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,646
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

193
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,258
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

194
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,827
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

195
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,488
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

196
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,564
But if we make resources infinite...

197
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,831
...ah...

198
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,099
...we make war obsolete.

199
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,777
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

200
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,642
...wherever they may be.

201
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,117
Thanks for your time.

202
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,021
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

203
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,425
It's been too long.

204
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,227
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

205
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,769
You think it's possible?

206
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,669
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

207
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,778
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

208
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,780
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

209
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,642
You know that better than anyone.

210
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,014
I'm not here because I miss him.

211
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,519
It's occurred to Rorschach...

212
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,658
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

213
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,253
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

214
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,497
That's why I'm warning you first.

215
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,093
Thank you, Dan...

216
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:04,505
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

217
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,270
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

218
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,308
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

219
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,114
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

220
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,486
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

221
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,857
...the 1 percent that get through could
still kill every living thing on Earth.

222
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,965
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

Good evening, Rorschach.

242
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,688
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

243
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,300
Yes...

244
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,538
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

245
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,436
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

246
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,804
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

247
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,037
I have a real name I've been using.

248
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,237
Try it.

249
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,508
Whatever you say, Laurie.

250
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,912
What are you doing here?

251
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,417
The Comedian is dead.

252
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,681
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

253
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,491
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

254
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,753
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

255
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,831
Even if I wanted to help...

256
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,337
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

257
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:51,800
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

258
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,378
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

259
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,210
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

260
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,378
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

261
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:09,516
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

262
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,494
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

263
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,698
I must return to my work.

264
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,993
Wait a minute.

265
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,659
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

266
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,068
So we can't do anything to stop it?

267
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,071
Goodbye, Rorschach.

268
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,506
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

269
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,009
I'm not leaving...

270
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,612
...till I've had my say.

271
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,059
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

272
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,923
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

273
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,527
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

274
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,760
But you always say time is simultaneous.

275
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,337
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

276
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,501
If only you could perceive time as I do.

277
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,941
Please let me show you.

278
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,856
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

279
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,084
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

280
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,695
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

281
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,627
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

282
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,964
- It was a mistake. One time.
- Man tries to rape you...

283
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,636
Stop!

284
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,873
Your mind goes to dark places...

285
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,373
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

286
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,750
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

287
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,317
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

288
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,185
...like we used to...

289
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,753
...but you won't.

290
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,793
You know I can't.

291
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,698
So you'll call Dan...

292
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,332
...which is only natural.

293
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,267
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

294
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,100
Dan Dreiberg's table.

295
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,032
Did you know that
he and H.J. were-? I had no idea.

296
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,597
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

297
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,263
Captain Carnage.

298
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,638
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

299
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,212
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

300
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,407
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

301
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,382
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

302
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,145
I'm just saying, "No, get lost".

303
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,759
God, whatever happened to him?

304
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,088
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

305
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,662
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

306
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,538
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

307
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,732
- It's a little funny.
- Yep.

308
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,613
I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

309
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,749
It's really good to see you again.

310
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,508
It's great seeing you too.

311
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,845
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

312
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,323
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

313
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,587
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

314
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,732
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

315
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,334
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

316
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:15,495
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

317
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,769
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

318
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,211
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

319
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,041
What?

320
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,514
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

321
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,384
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

322
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,351
Soon.

323
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,563
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

324
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,794
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

325
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,734
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

326
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:53,169
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

327
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,539
Everyone.

328
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,310
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

329
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,509
...or if he's just pretending.

330
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,155
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

331
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,885
Hold on, I'll get the door.

332
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,028
Thanks, Dan.

333
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,425
- Got it?
- Yeah.

334
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,468
I'm sorry.

335
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,543
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

336
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,279
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

337
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,249
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

338
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,472
Laurie? Is that you?

339
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,153
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

340
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,814
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

341
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,859
Well, it beats flying coach.

342
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,219
Margarita?

343
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,625
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

344
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,802
Mm.

345
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,769
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

346
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,439
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

347
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,774
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

348
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,975
- He sent you this? - Sure.
They're very valuable, like antiques.

349
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,481
Mother, this is gross.

350
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,919
I think it's kind of flattering.

351
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,355
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

352
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,788
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

353
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,796
I saw it in the paper.

354
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,370
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

355
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,165
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

356
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,476
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

357
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,704
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

358
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,417
You don't know.

359
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,348
Things change.

360
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,951
What happened happened 40 years ago.

361
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,389
I'm 67 years old.

362
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,758
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

363
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,760
But the past...

364
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,260
...even the grimy parts of it...

365
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,433
...keep on getting brighter.

366
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,779
I've got spots in my eyes.

367
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,915
Stop it, Eddie.

368
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,257
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr. Owl.

369
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,658
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

370
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,994
- Little place on 21 st.
- Sounds good.

371
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,764
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

372
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:20,271
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

373
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,785
Eddie.

374
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,924
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

375
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,692
Sure I did.

376
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,929
Come on, baby.

377
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,363
I know what you need.

378
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,602
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

379
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,077
I said no, Eddie.

380
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:02,618
- No spelled Y-E-S.
- No spelled N-O.

381
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,223
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

382
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,753
Eddie...

383
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,330
You little bastard.

384
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,967
This what you like?

385
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,635
- This what makes you hot?
- What?

386
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,321
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

387
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:20,590
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

388
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:24,599
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

389
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,437
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

390
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,034
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

391
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,977
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

392
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,744
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

393
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,979
...O holy and merciful savior.

394
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,386
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

395
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,892
Suffer us not
at our last hour for any...

396
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,921
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

397
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,822
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

398
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,322
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

399
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:05,458
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

400
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,934
But we didn't, thanks to you.

401
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,843
You sound bitter.

402
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,672
Me? Bitter?

403
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,906
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

404
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,087
Oh, Jesus Christ.

405
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,250
- Mr. Eddie?
- Just what I fucking needed.

406
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:35,491
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

407
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,794
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

408
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,301
I'm gonna forget about you...

409
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,305
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

410
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,035
Get the fuck out of here.

411
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,643
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

412
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,179
You will remember.

413
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,680
You will remember me and my country...

414
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,181
...forever!

415
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,656
My face!

416
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,022
Blake. Don't.

417
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,128
Blake!

418
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,496
She was pregnant...

419
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,505
...and you gunned her down.

420
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,940
That's right...

421
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,046
...and you know what? You watched me.

422
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,207
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

423
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,979
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

424
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,756
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

425
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,760
You're drifting out of touch, Doc.

426
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,527
God help us all.

427
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,833
Medic!

428
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,840
<i>Most holy and merciful savior.</i>

429
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:02,013
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

430
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:07,051
In the midst of life, we are in death.

431
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,989
Welcome to the first meeting-
- This is bullshit.

432
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:17,532
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

433
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,102
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

434
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,070
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

435
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,368
...because you wanna play
cowboys and Indians.

436
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,910
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

437
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,445
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

438
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:38,952
A group this size seems like a publicity
stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

439
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,920
We can do so much more.

440
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,286
We can save this world...

441
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,058
- ...with the right leadership.
- Yeah.

442
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,164
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

443
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,100
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

444
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,934
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

445
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,972
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

446
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:06,883
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

447
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:11,886
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

448
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,751
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

449
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,921
Then Ozymandias here...

450
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,196
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

451
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,169
<i>For as much as it hath pleased...</i>

452
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:40,315
...almighty God to take onto himself
the soul of our dear departed brother...

453
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,780
...let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

454
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,414
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

455
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:14,981
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

456
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:23,550
Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

457
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:28,164
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

458
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,495
If you could-
Please, there's no need for violence.

459
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,763
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

460
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,144
There's no need for violence.

461
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,446
Fuck you. Fuck you!

462
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,424
Oh, this is getting heavy.

463
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,721
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

464
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,324
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

465
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,120
How long can we keep this up?

466
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,890
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

467
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,327
Our days are numbered.

468
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,766
Until then, it's like you always say:
We're society's only protection.

469
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:45,500
- From what?
- Are you kidding me? From themselves.

470
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,871
- Son of a bitch.
No, Comedian, wait!

471
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,313
Get your stinking hands off me.

472
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,952
What the hell happened to us?

473
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,589
What happened to the American dream?

474
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,260
What happened to the American dream?

475
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,557
It came true!

476
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,757
You're looking at it.

477
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,049
Edgar William Jacobi.

478
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:37,051
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

479
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,355
What are you talking about?

480
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:45,727
I'm a retired businessman...

481
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,864
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

482
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,059
I did my time.

483
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,035
I'm not Moloch anymore.

484
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,077
- What do you want from me?
- Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

485
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,703
I just felt I should...

486
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,784
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

487
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:15,988
- How'd you know he was the Comedian?
- He broke in here. A week ago.

488
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,491
He had his mask off.

489
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:22,454
- He was drunk.
- Enemies. For decades.

490
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,659
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

491
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,771
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

492
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,907
He was upset.

493
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,999
He was crying.

494
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,808
Crying? The Comedian?

495
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,971
<i>He was babbling, not making any sense.</i>

496
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,141
<i>I was pissing in my pants.</i>

497
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,617
<i>I thought he was gonna kill me.</i>

498
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,052
<i>What did he say?</i>

499
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,019
It's a joke.

500
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,321
It's all a fucking joke.

501
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,765
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

502
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,961
I thought I knew how the world was.

503
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,767
I've done some bad things.

504
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,037
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

505
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,476
In 'Nam, you know.

506
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,482
But that was fucking war.

507
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,782
This...

508
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,115
I never done anything like this.

509
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,727
God, here I am...

510
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,988
...spilling my guts...

511
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,954
...to one of my archenemies.

512
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,466
But the truth is...

513
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:38,667
...you're the closest thing to a friend
I got. What the fuck does that say?

514
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,774
Shit.

515
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,977
And your name...

516
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,676
...your name was on the list...

517
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:55,187
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

518
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,793
Manhattan's old girl.

519
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,160
Mother, forgive me.

520
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,996
<i>And then he left.</i>

521
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:12,601
<i>I swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.</i>

522
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,317
Funny story.

523
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,117
Sounds unbelievable.

524
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,822
Probably true.

525
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,686
So that's it?

526
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,990
- I'm clean?
- You?

527
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,529
Clean?

528
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,563
Amygdalin.

529
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,435
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

530
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,840
- It's illegal.
- Come on.

531
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,046
Please don't confiscate that.

532
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,682
I'm trying anything.

533
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,645
I have cancer.

534
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:01,988
What kind of cancer?

535
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,920
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

536
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,823
That ain't the kind I got.

537
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,030
<i>Rorschach's journal. October 16th.</i>

538
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,041
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

539
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,008
<i>- Thought about Moloch's story.
- Come on.</i>

540
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,115
<i>Could all be lies.</i>

541
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:30,583
<i>A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.</i>

542
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:35,851
Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

543
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,618
<i>But if it's true...</i>

544
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,058
<i>...what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...</i>

545
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,095
<i>...enough to cry in front of Moloch?</i>

546
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,491
<i>What was it he saw?</i>

547
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,930
<i>And that list he mentioned.</i>

548
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,510
<i>Edward Blake. The Comedian.</i>

549
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,079
<i>Born 1918.</i>

550
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,273
<i>Buried in the rain.</i>

551
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,315
<i>Murdered.</i>

552
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,513
<i>Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?</i>

553
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,620
<i>Only our enemies leave roses.</i>

554
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,828
<i>Violent lives ending violently.</i>

555
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,862
<i>Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.</i>

556
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,733
<i>No matter how much you try
to dress it up...</i>

557
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,034
<i>...to disguise it...</i>

558
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:29,337
<i>...Blake saw society's true face.</i>

559
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:34,143
<i>Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.</i>

560
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,978
<i>I heard joke once.</i>

561
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,954
<i>Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.</i>

562
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,992
<i>Life seems harsh and cruel.</i>

563
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:49,030
<i>Says he feels all alone
in threatening world.</i>

564
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,997
<i>Doctor says treatment is simple.</i>

565
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:56,839
<i>"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.</i>

566
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,998
<i>That should pick you up".</i>

567
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,444
<i>Man bursts into tears.</i>

568
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:06,946
<i>"But doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci".</i>

569
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,681
<i>Good joke.</i>

570
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,854
<i>Everybody laugh.</i>

571
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,184
<i>Roll on snare drum.</i>

572
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,182
<i>Curtains.</i>

573
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,899
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

574
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,698
Don't worry.

575
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,831
We've got plenty of time.

576
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,078
Your finger's like licking a battery.

577
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,169
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

578
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,673
Please don't be upset.

579
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:10,506
I always thought you liked this.

580
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,079
No.

581
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,552
I don't- No.

582
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,220
I don't want that.

583
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,653
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

584
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:29,424
Look, I know you were just trying...

585
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:33,702
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

586
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,306
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

587
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,937
- I didn't think it was necessary to-
- To what?

588
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,638
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

589
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,224
My attention was completely focused
on you.

590
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,090
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

591
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,492
...I am prepared to discuss it.

592
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:06,997
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

593
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,630
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

594
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,505
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

595
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,281
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

596
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,651
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

597
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,659
He's all yours.

598
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,073
<i>Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.</i>

599
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,739
No, she won't.

600
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:08,389
<i>He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon...</i>

<i>...deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.</i>

603
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,966
<i>Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...</i>

604
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:24,102
<i>...will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...</i>

605
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,149
<i>...brought to you commercial-free

606
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,262
Who is it?

607
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,403
It's Laurie.

608
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,546
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

609
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,186
I didn't know where else to go.

610
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,517
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

611
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:15,988
What's wrong?

612
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,927
I left Jon.

613
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,934
Oh, God.

614
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,134
I'm so sorry.

615
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,140
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

616
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,146
I don't know anybody else.

617
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,280
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

618
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,513
That's okay.

619
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,951
You probably just had an argument
or something.

620
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,488
No, Dan.

621
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,721
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

622
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:48,022
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

623
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,666
...remember what they are.

624
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,161
<i>It's like this world, this real world...</i>

625
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:57,136
<i>...to him,
it's like walking through mist.</i>

626
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,868
And people are just shadows.

627
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,936

<i>God, how did everything
get so tangled up?</i>

629
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,011
I'm sorry, Dan.

630
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,748
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

631
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,185
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

632
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,890
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

633
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,058
You're more than welcome to join.

634
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,536
In fact, I insist.

635
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,837
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

636
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,909
He just-
- We don't have time for makeup.

637
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,375
That blue is too light for television.

638
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,140
Is that dark enough?

639
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,754
<i>Yeah, that's dark enough.</i>

640
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,584
Seymour.
Bernie, how's tricks?

641
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,163
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

642
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,441
Girl.
What we got here?

643
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:46,480
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

644
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,447
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

645
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,985
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

646
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,852
...a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

647
00:59:56,025 --> 01:00:01,793
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

648
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:06,231
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

649
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,733
Welcome.

650
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:13,970
Thank you.

651
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,077
That's right.

652
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,417
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

653
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:27,021
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

654
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,886
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

655
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,620
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

656
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,955
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

657
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,296
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

658
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,405
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

659
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,138
My father was a watchmaker.

660
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:51,310
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

661
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,473
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

662
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,642
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

663
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,084
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

664
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,154
So you're saying there is no danger.

665
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:08,320
<i>Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.</i>

666
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,170
And would you say, as so many claim...

667
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,102
...that you are, in fact, a god...

668
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:21,107
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

669
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,575
I can only see my own past...

670
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:27,915
<i>...my own future. I am not omniscient.</i>

671
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,883
Doug Roth, your question?

672
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,783
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

673
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,719
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

674
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:41,023
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

675
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,089
He died of cancer.

676
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,230
- He was a good man.
How about Edgar Jacobi...

677
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:49,303
<i>...also known as the supervillain Moloch?</i>

678
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:54,369
<i>You encountered him several times
in the '60s: battles, conflicts.</i>

679
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,045
<i>Did you know that he has cancer as well?</i>

680
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,208
I wasn't told.

681
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,612
<i>And what about
General Anthony Randolph?</i>

682
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:05,220
<i>He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.</i>

683
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,645
Cancer.

684
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,485
You're suggesting I was the cause.

685
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,884
<i>From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.</i>

686
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,087
<i>Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.</i>

687
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,062
<i>A live human body
and a deceased human body...</i>

688
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,327
<i>...have the same number of particles.</i>

689
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,972
Structurally, there's no difference.

690
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,742
All right. Let's settle down, please.

691
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,753
What about Janey Slater?

692
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,859
You think it makes a difference to her?

693
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,261
Janey?

694
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,157
Your ex-girlfriend?

695
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,963
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

696
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,662
Doug, one question at a time.

697
01:02:56,839 --> 01:03:00,206
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

698
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,207
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

699
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,524
You were the world to me, Jon.

700
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,359
You were my whole life.

701
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,893
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

702
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,763
Janey, I wasn't told.

703
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:33,607
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

704
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,309
This is how you repay me?

705
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,653
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
- Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

706
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,813
Janey, wait.

707
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,659
- That's it. This interview is over.
Get up there.

708
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,194
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

709
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:58,060
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

710
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:04,332
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

711
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,408
...and leave me alone...

712
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:08,976
Do you care to comment?

713
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,171
I said, leave me alone!

714
01:04:22,645 --> 01:04:24,840
<i>I am looking at the stars.</i>

715
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:27,339
<i>They're so far away...</i>

716
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:30,446
<i>...and their light takes so long
to reach us...</i>

717
01:04:33,189 --> 01:04:37,387
<i>...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.</i>

718
01:04:40,363 --> 01:04:44,197
<i>It is July, 1959, and I am in love.</i>

719
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:46,695
That's great.

720
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:48,496
- You can pick it up tomorrow.
- Okay.

721
01:04:48,671 --> 01:04:50,400
- Seventy-five cents.
- Okay, thank you.

722
01:04:50,573 --> 01:04:51,597
Thank you.

723
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:55,972
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us
a little notice. I'm sure I made a face.

724
01:04:56,145 --> 01:05:01,139
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

725
01:05:05,054 --> 01:05:07,386
<i>Her name is Janey Slater.</i>

726
01:05:08,224 --> 01:05:10,886
<i>She is a physicist, like me.</i>

727
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:13,924
<i>I am 30 years old.</i>

728
01:05:18,635 --> 01:05:22,571
<i>We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.</i>

729
01:05:26,175 --> 01:05:28,735
<i>It is February 12th, 1981.</i>

730
01:05:28,911 --> 01:05:32,677
<i>Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.</i>

731
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:53,600
<i>That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.</i>

732
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:02,601
<i>A month from now,
the accident awaits me.</i>

733
01:06:09,786 --> 01:06:13,278
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

734
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:16,186
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

735
01:06:18,928 --> 01:06:23,331
<i>I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.</i>

736
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:31,199
<i>When I get to the door...</i>

737
01:06:32,975 --> 01:06:34,169
<i>...Wally is turning white.</i>

738
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:38,405
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

739
01:06:39,782 --> 01:06:41,113
<i>I am terrified.</i>

740
01:06:41,284 --> 01:06:42,308
Jon?

741
01:06:48,257 --> 01:06:50,020
I'm sorry, Jon...

742
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:53,486
...but I can't...

743
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:57,289
Janey, don't leave me!

744
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:59,825
Don't leave me!

745
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:33,961
<i>It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.</i>

746
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:36,338
<i>She buys me a beer...</i>

747
01:07:36,506 --> 01:07:39,373
<i>...the first time a woman
has done this for me.</i>

748
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:43,534
<i>As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...</i>

749
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,041
<i>...our fingers touch.</i>

750
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:58,386
Yes, Jon, good.

751
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:04,056
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

752
01:08:07,904 --> 01:08:08,996
<i>I feel fear...</i>

753
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:12,366
<i>...for the last time.</i>

754
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:30,923
<i>A token funeral is held.</i>

755
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,251
<i>There is nothing to bury.</i>

756
01:08:33,596 --> 01:08:35,928
<i>Janey frames the snapshot.</i>

757
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:39,098
<i>It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.</i>

758
01:08:40,403 --> 01:08:45,272
<i>A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.</i>

759
01:08:45,675 --> 01:08:47,142
<i>A few days later...</i>

760
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:50,541
<i>...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...</i>

761
01:08:50,713 --> 01:08:54,547
<i>...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.</i>

762
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:20,766
Oh, God.

763
01:09:20,943 --> 01:09:22,467
Jon?

764
01:09:23,513 --> 01:09:25,344
Is that you?

765
01:09:25,615 --> 01:09:28,743
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

766
01:09:28,918 --> 01:09:31,546
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

767
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:35,680
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

768
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:44,758
<i>They call me Dr. Manhattan.</i>

769
01:09:55,344 --> 01:09:57,278
<i>They explain the name
has been chosen...</i>

770
01:09:57,446 --> 01:10:01,678
<i>...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.</i>

771
01:10:03,686 --> 01:10:06,712
<i>They are shaping me
into something gaudy...</i>

772
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,917
<i>...something lethal.</i>

773
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:16,221
<i>In January, 1971...</i>

774
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:20,358
<i>...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...</i>

775
01:10:20,536 --> 01:10:23,869
<i>...something that his predecessors
would not ask.</i>

776
01:10:25,107 --> 01:10:27,940
<i>A week later, the conflict ends.</i>

777
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:32,547
<i>Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.</i>

778
01:10:34,383 --> 01:10:37,978
<i>Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.</i>

779
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:42,215
<i>In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.</i>

780
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:00,671
<i>I am not sure if I know what that means.</i>

781
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:03,937
<i>You see, at the time, I was misquoted.</i>

782
01:11:04,213 --> 01:11:07,273
I never said, "The superman exists
and he is American".

783
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:13,411
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American".

784
01:11:13,923 --> 01:11:16,391
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

785
01:11:16,559 --> 01:11:20,461
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

786
01:11:20,896 --> 01:11:22,921
...don't be alarmed.

787
01:11:23,566 --> 01:11:27,593
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

788
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:31,798
<i>It is Christmas, 1963.</i>

789
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,472
<i>Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.</i>

790
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:39,340
<i>She says I am like a god now.</i>

791
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:42,779
<i>I tell her I don't think there is a God...</i>

792
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:46,349
...and if there is, I'm nothing like him.

793
01:11:47,023 --> 01:11:49,457
<i>I tell her I still want her...</i>

794
01:11:50,226 --> 01:11:52,285
<i>...and that I always will.</i>

795
01:11:53,295 --> 01:11:57,959
<i>As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.</i>

796
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:02,362
<i>I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.</i>

797
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:08,133
<i>A very young girl looks at me and smiles.</i>

798
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:10,902
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

799
01:12:11,814 --> 01:12:17,810
<i>After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...</i>

800
01:12:17,987 --> 01:12:19,978
<i>...like a signature.</i>

801
01:12:21,323 --> 01:12:24,486
<i>Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.</i>

802
01:12:24,994 --> 01:12:30,261
<i>She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.</i>

803
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,264
<i>It's true.</i>

804
01:12:34,336 --> 01:12:37,362
<i>She's aging more noticeably every day...</i>

805
01:12:43,946 --> 01:12:46,779
<i>...while I am standing still.</i>

806
01:12:47,717 --> 01:12:50,379
<i>I prefer the stillness here.</i>

807
01:12:51,353 --> 01:12:53,446
<i>I am tired of Earth.</i>

808
01:12:53,622 --> 01:12:55,283
<i>These people.</i>

809
01:12:55,858 --> 01:12:59,555
<i>I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.</i>

810
01:13:22,384 --> 01:13:25,717
<i>They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...</i>

811
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:29,746
<i>...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.</i>

812
01:13:30,226 --> 01:13:32,888
<i>Perhaps the world is not made.</i>

813
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:35,887
<i>Perhaps nothing is made.</i>

814
01:13:36,732 --> 01:13:40,293
<i>A clock without a craftsman.</i>

815
01:13:41,237 --> 01:13:43,228
<i>It's too late.</i>

816
01:13:43,672 --> 01:13:45,572
<i>Always has been...</i>

817
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:48,403
<i>...always will be...</i>

818
01:13:48,978 --> 01:13:50,605
<i>...too late.</i>

819
01:13:56,118 --> 01:13:57,813
Mr. President...

820
01:13:58,154 --> 01:14:02,591
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
to just short of the Afghan border.

821
01:14:03,259 --> 01:14:04,487
They are testing us...

822
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,063
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

823
01:14:09,231 --> 01:14:11,961
...to coax a move out of them.

824
01:14:14,103 --> 01:14:17,470
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

825
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:19,965
Two days.

826
01:14:20,342 --> 01:14:24,039
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

827
01:14:24,213 --> 01:14:26,272
...before they get their missiles airborne.

828
01:14:26,849 --> 01:14:28,510
Assuming conservative projections...

829
01:14:28,684 --> 01:14:31,380
...of how many Soviet warheads
we destroy beforehand...

830
01:14:32,188 --> 01:14:34,019
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

831
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,314
The last gasp...

832
01:14:37,193 --> 01:14:39,661
...of the Harvard establishment.

833
01:14:40,095 --> 01:14:43,360
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

834
01:14:43,532 --> 01:14:47,093
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

835
01:14:47,269 --> 01:14:49,499
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

836
01:14:49,672 --> 01:14:51,731
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

837
01:14:51,907 --> 01:14:53,534
Not so bad...

838
01:14:54,143 --> 01:14:56,941
...all things considered.

839
01:14:59,748 --> 01:15:01,579
Mr. President...

840
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,377
...what would you like to do?

841
01:15:11,727 --> 01:15:14,025
Take us to DEFCON two.

842
01:15:14,196 --> 01:15:16,187
Begin fueling the bombers.

843
01:15:16,799 --> 01:15:19,700
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

844
01:15:20,135 --> 01:15:21,932
After that...

845
01:15:22,104 --> 01:15:25,733
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

846
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:29,311
Let's just hope he's on our side.

847
01:15:30,546 --> 01:15:32,241
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

848
01:15:32,414 --> 01:15:35,315
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

849
01:15:35,484 --> 01:15:39,887
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

850
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:41,716
You can understand.

851
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:46,988
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

852
01:15:47,162 --> 01:15:49,392
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

853
01:15:49,565 --> 01:15:52,329
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

854
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:55,402
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist".

855
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:57,539
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

856
01:15:57,706 --> 01:16:00,971
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

857
01:16:01,377 --> 01:16:04,244
Mr. Lacocca, gentlemen...

858
01:16:05,414 --> 01:16:07,644
...I respect your position...

859
01:16:07,816 --> 01:16:11,718
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

860
01:16:12,121 --> 01:16:14,612
You wanna know my past? Hm?

861
01:16:15,424 --> 01:16:18,154
Okay. Happily.

862
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:21,785
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

863
01:16:21,964 --> 01:16:23,795
...leaving me alone.

864
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,167
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

865
01:16:28,337 --> 01:16:33,240
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

866
01:16:33,409 --> 01:16:36,901
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

867
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:40,480
Well, anyone living, that is.

868
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:42,617
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

869
01:16:42,785 --> 01:16:45,913
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

870
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:51,458
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

871
01:16:51,627 --> 01:16:54,653
His vision of a united world was...

872
01:16:57,967 --> 01:16:59,662
Well, it was unprecedented.

873
01:16:59,835 --> 01:17:01,530
I wanted...

874
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:04,002
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

875
01:17:04,173 --> 01:17:07,370
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

876
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:11,035
And so began my path to conquest.

877
01:17:11,213 --> 01:17:14,444
Conquest not of men...

878
01:17:14,616 --> 01:17:17,449
...but of the evils that beset them.

879
01:17:17,686 --> 01:17:22,589
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

880
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:25,591
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

881
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:27,388
- ...are the pushers.
- Now, listen.

882
01:17:27,963 --> 01:17:29,590
No.

883
01:17:31,934 --> 01:17:33,731
You listen.

884
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:37,457
The world will survive...

885
01:17:37,668 --> 01:17:41,104
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

886
01:17:41,272 --> 01:17:43,866
So let's cut to it, shall we?

887
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:46,610
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

888
01:17:46,777 --> 01:17:50,372
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

889
01:17:50,548 --> 01:17:56,851
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

890
01:17:58,322 --> 01:18:00,756
I think you know the way out.

891
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:04,222
Gentlemen.

892
01:18:06,731 --> 01:18:10,223
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

893
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:13,859
- Seems all the old villains are dead.
- Mr. Veidt?

894
01:18:14,038 --> 01:18:17,599
- I think I have some ideas.
- Mr. Veidt?

895
01:18:17,775 --> 01:18:20,573
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

896
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:58,910
He's got a poison capsule.

897
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:04,044
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

898
01:19:04,222 --> 01:19:05,314
Give me a name!

899
01:19:17,435 --> 01:19:18,732
<i>Suicide pill.</i>

900
01:19:19,837 --> 01:19:22,772
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

901
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,771
Thanks, hon.

902
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:27,301
Then Rorschach was right.

903
01:19:27,478 --> 01:19:29,639
This wasn't some lone nut.

904
01:19:29,814 --> 01:19:33,944
It's an organization:
well-funded, well-equipped.
