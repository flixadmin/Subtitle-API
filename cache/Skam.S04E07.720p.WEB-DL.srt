1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,420
Toughes girl, real!

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.420
- You can not handle the ball.
-I can handle it better than you do.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.660
-What?
-I do not really want to be there,

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.860
- when Sana learns that she is
Can not be on the bus.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,900
I left the bus.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,940
It contradicts mine
Values ​​to be observed,

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.860
-like girls their entire self-respect
For a fuck in the forest.

8th
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,980
Sara does not like Vilde!

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.320
I have heaps of insults
Have to read about their bus friends.

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.340
You do not want it all
Share your own past.

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.320
You are a good person.

12
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.620
Will you give it to me, please?

13
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.740
Come and get him.

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,500
Really now, I do not feel like it.
Just throw it over.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Really now, I do not feel like it.
Come and get him.

16
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
I have no desire!

17
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.740
All right. Then I take the ball with me.

18
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.100
-And disappear.
-I am serious.

19
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.440
Bye!

20
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.960
Let me play!

21
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.960
I'm playing alone.

22
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
How long do you want
Still be sour, Sana?

23
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,580
Sana?

24
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.780
I did not know Isak was a friend
Of you. I told you!

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,460
I swear, she remains angry,
No matter what I say and do.

26
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.680
I warn you,
It is really crass on it.

27
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
<B> Sunday </ b>

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Frida said today that she
To become a doctor. LOL

29
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm sorry for her. I believe,
Her mother is alkie or junkie

30
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.300
Matilde has seen her with a woman,
Which looked like a homeless,

31
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.100
And as Matilde wanted to say her "hello"
Vilde has tried to hide.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Fuck! Olivia has yesterday one of
The new one blown. Pääädoo

33
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
... Eva behaved like a bitch ...
... Vilde is the purest cliché ...

34
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Ingrid is annoyed with her grief
And their insecurity

35
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,000
You know Sana from the Vilde clique?
That is totally psycho I've heard today-

36
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,200
-that she's on the Urra school
In the sweatbox

37
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
(Voices from outside)

38
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.320
... with couscous.

39
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,900
I am getting hungry,
If I only talk about it.

40
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,700
Why are you wailing,
If you have already eaten?

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09.820
- He's eaten something.
-Adam has his days and does not fast.

42
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.300
I'm sick.

43
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,300
-All are sick.
- No, I'm really sick.

44
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Unlike you, I-

45
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,700
- in the paradise 72 young women get!

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27.880
Because I am a good Muslim!

47
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.660
Just because you're fasting one day a week.
-You must begin right now.

48
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.940
Look at the sun, it's warm.
I am proud, I am a good Muslim.

49
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.140
Hey, hey, hey!
What do you want with 72 young women?

50
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.540
You can not even make it,
To make a 00er clear!

51
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.740
(They talk.)

52
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.380
- You know it yourself. 00er do not go at all.
-And 72 young women go clear?

53
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.180
Says, where is Yousef?

54
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.300
-Where is that?
-Yousef meets with Noora.

55
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,860
-Noora? The girlfriend of Sana?
-Yes, the Noora.

56
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.620
That's true. I have seen,
As they have been sleeping together.

57
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.500
Is that your seriousness?
That's stupid ...

58
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,300
-He is jealous!
-Hey, chill times!

59
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.500
- That's a woman!
- She's damn sweet.

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,200
He is jealous, old man!

61
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,100
<B> Tuesday </ b>

62
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.840
There you are!

63
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.780
Yes, im learning.

64
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,920
Yes, you learn and learn and learn.

65
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.880
I wanted to tell you something.

66
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,360
You do not have to say it.
I already know it.

67
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.800
What?

68
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.560
With Yousef.

69
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,700
Yes...
Did he tell you?

70
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Or what?

71
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,360
And how do you think about it?

72
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.240
I do not think anything.

73
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.240
-Do you like him?
-No!

74
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.580
For sure?

75
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.380
Just because you find him sweet,

76
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.160
-this does not mean that all
Others.

77
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,040
OK...

78
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,840
I said I was trying,
Me to focus on the exam.

79
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,460
What the hell is this ?!

80
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.180
-No idea!
- Did you write about me?

81
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.340
No! Why should I have done this?

82
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.500
Somebody's kidding me.
You can see that it is gephotoshopt.

83
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:24,720
Delete that! I want such crap over
Do not see me on Instagram!

84
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
<B> Wednesday </ b>

85
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.460
... have 300,000 for a bus
And are now split.

86
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.980
I would die if the whole
School my chats would have read!

87
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.820
I looked at myself, how much crap
I write about the people in chats.

88
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.740
This is a lot! You have to be real
Be careful to whom you write that.

89
00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.820
How many times have we tried?
You are using your data volume.

90
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.980
I have a flat rate.

91
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,700
-Was they?
-No.

92
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12.620
-Is she currently active on Facebook?
- Before a while, but not now.

93
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.820
-You wrote to Facebook?
-More than a message.

94
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.420
- Did you call her parents?
-No. We could go to her.

95
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.100
-What's happening?
-We can not reach Sara.

96
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,140
She is ashamed because everyone has read the crap
They is writing about people.

97
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.260
Are we really sure,
That Sara wrote that?

98
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.700
That she hopes Iselin's school
She had also written to me.

99
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41.740
That Olivia is pedophile,
She wrote to me.

100
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.620
-Ob someone hacked their account?
-Shoes, is the creepy!

101
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:53.540
There is still much more creepy that ours
Bus boss so talking about the people on the bus.

102
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.820
I will log off from the bus.

103
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.380
It is really important that we get along
Which can not be broken.

104
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.780
We will be attacked and should
As a bus group.

105
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,260
This is really a serious thing!
To publish the chats!

106
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.100
Is not that criminal?

107
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,400
(They talk.)

108
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.180
Drama?

109
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,500
Yes.

110
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.980
Have heard that Sara is some crap
About the girls on Instagram?

111
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.100
Yes...

112
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,300
Believe me; You do not want to know that.

113
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.580
I really do not want that!
Are you ready for the exam?

114
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.820
Yes. You also?

115
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:50.120
I'm Stephen Hawking on Redbull,
What do you think?! Yes Yes Yes. See you!

116
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05,000
delete account

117
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,200
Clear account permanently

118
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.300
<B> Thursday </ b>

119
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.760
(Notification)

120
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
GROUP FOR ALL THAT FROM
CYBERMOBBING ARE CONCERNED

121
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,500
(Ingrid :) Hi have made the chat for all
Who were attacked on Instagram.

122
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,400
I finally reached Sara
And she is of course totally finished.

123
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.300
She is in the cottage on Kragerø and
Will return to school on Monday </ u>.

124
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
She wanted me to see you
Which leads here:

125
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.500
Tell the girls that I'm never angry
And I love them all.

126
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,000
If I wrote this crap really
Should, then the long-

127
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,500
-and I did not mean anything seriously.
I do not know who did this to me,

128
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
-but I'll find it out.

129
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:07,400
Sara is so ready that she today
The exam did not write

130
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.800
(Iselin :) Greet her and tell her that it is
Okay, no one cares what, -

131
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
-all tell crap about all.

132
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:35,200
The Arms

133
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.800
(Lea :) Nobody deserves it,
To experience something like that.

134
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42.400
(Ingrid :) The real problem is,
Who has done this to Sarah and us.

135
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,900
Sara tried to do the things
In their chats,

136
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,400
-but she has not yet succeeded.
She will look further.

137
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.900
Some of us know they are us
Some of these things has been written.

138
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Therefore, we know that there are extracts
From different chats.

139
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.100
Maybe Sara is
Victims of faceraping.

140
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,300
(Olivia :) Sorry ...
Now I think of something

141
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,700
Was not Vilde last week in Saras
Facebook? When she posted the photo?

142
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:15,000
(Ingrid :) Shit, right!

143
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,800
(Leas :) Right!

144
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:35,100
If the speech bubble were not blue,
If this comes from Saras Facebook?

145
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
(Lea :) And she said yesterday that Sara
No more bus boss should be !!?

146
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,700
(Iselin :) So stupid is she not?

147
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
(Ingrid :) Yes, could be!
She must have been it !?

148
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
And she wanted to
Always be bus boss!

149
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,400
(Lea :) And there stands The one and only
Perfect Bus boss on the Insta account !!

150
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
The same was above the photo !! It must
So be someone from this group !!

151
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
(Ingrid :) AND:We have it already
Once thrown out of the bus, -

152
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,900
- as she has tried,
The bus boss to overthrow.

153
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.860
Hello, Sana.

154
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.340
Hello.

155
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.560
Hello.

156
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.640
I really wanted to
To report a while ago.

157
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.600
What happened?

158
00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:01.320
When I wanted to do it, I knew
Somehow not what I should write.

159
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:19.040
I've heard you're doing now
A nurse training?

160
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Mm.

161
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30.560
- How is that?
-It's OK.

162
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.700
-You still go to the Nissen?
-mm.

163
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50.520
Yes.

164
00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:01.240
-What do you have?
-I have biology, chemistry, math ...

165
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.620
What is your chemistry teacher?

166
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.420
-Lars?
-The great? With brown hair?

167
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.160
-Yes. Did you have it, too?
-mm.

168
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.660
He always wore the same shirt.

169
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.620
A blue shirt.
Is he still wearing it?

170
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.140
Yes. He already had that when you
With him? The whole advanced level?

171
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.660
The whole advanced level.

172
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.760
Bah!

173
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.260
That is already special.

174
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.840
Then I'm not the only one,
Which finds him somehow special.

175
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.900
-Du fastest, right?
-mm.

176
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,860
-You also?
-mm.

177
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.140
-Are you hungry?
-Little.

178
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.820
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

179
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.160
But it becomes easier every day,
When one has got used to it.

180
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.620
-Maghrib is today at 22:25.
-22 ...?

181
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.900
22.25 hrs.

182
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,660
-How many hours are they still?
- Hours and 40 minutes.

183
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.180
So long still!

184
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.880
This is full of humor. Even Elias
Know now when Maghrib is.

185
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.760
You know it, too
Such people who say -

186
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.180
- that you can not sing, dance or
Listening to music while you're fasting?

187
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.740
There are also some who say,
That you can not.

188
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.420
And many of them make up their makeup
Not even while they are fasting.

189
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.100
Yesterday I was made up, and
Then someone stared at me.

190
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.400
Certainly because I was made up.

191
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.300
I've heard that some
The whole time spit out.

192
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:17.100
They think their own spit
Do not swallow because that is a violation.

193
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,220
-I have such a girlfriend.
- She always spits?

194
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:27.520
She spat at school.
She spits out at work.

195
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.500
She makes it quite self-confident.
About ...

196
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,080
This is funny.

197
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.440
- You're fine, right?
-Yes.

198
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.500
<B> Friday </ b>

199
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.500
- He will separate from me.
- He will not.

200
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.580
These were some assholes.
This is totally unjust to you.

201
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.980
It will certainly be all right.
You're just sad.

202
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,500
What happened?

203
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:44,840
Someone has started "ellevillevilde2"
And heaps of crap over Vilde.

204
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.820
This is really bad.

205
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.740
-That's gonna be back, it's ...
This is still really bad.

206
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.760
-This is so unnecessary.
-Yes, unnecessary!

207
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05.420
I just do not understand,
Who does that?

208
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,220
Who opens hate accounts
And published chats?

209
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.960
How shit can someone be?

210
00:24:48,800 --> 00:25:01,100
The account saranors2
Is not from Vilde.

211
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,700
(Ingrid :) We know that
It was Isak

212
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,600
No, Isak was not

213
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:26,900
(Ingrid :) Yes? He admitted it

214
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29.400
Sara has read all her chats
And found it out.

215
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.900
And then she asked him and he
Said he has been it.

216
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,300
(Lea :) Why does he have
Actually done?

217
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.500
(Ingrid :) Because Sara hurt him,
When she left him?

218
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,800
(Lea :) ???? What is he not gay?

219
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.440
What do you think you are doing?

220
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.700
Were not you the one,
Which has said,

221
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20.640
-that she abhors people,
Which their friends leave behind?

222
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.980
It was...

223
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.500
It was not my intention that
Which affects you. I'm so sorry.

224
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,320
What was your plan? How should
Does not that affect me?

225
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,220
It's a shame to me, Saras
Clique has something against me.

226
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.140
But you might have
Can ask before you ...

227
00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.680
Before you take photos of mine
Private chats.

228
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.480
Excuse me.

229
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:24.180
I just wanted the other girls
See how Sara is in reality.

230
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28.440
They know how she is.
They are themselves.

231
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.420
What did you actually do about Sara?

232
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.340
She is a racist Tussi, who ...

233
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:46.800
She lied to me and
Wanted to get me out of the bus.

234
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:57.060
Maybe she wanted to throw you out because
You're a derelict, bossy bitch?

235
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,560
Why are you human
So hard, Sana?

236
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:09.020
Try it, without hardship in this country
As a Muslim girl.

237
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.880
I tried to be as gay
Youths.

238
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,180
That is not the same.

239
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.060
Nobody looks at you,
That you are different.

240
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,820
You will not get the
Same looks as I do.

241
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:33.020
You know what people think when they do
see me? When they see my headscarf?

242
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.740
That I wear it because I have to
Not because I want it.

243
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.780
And when I say I wear it,
Because I want it, I am brainwashed.

244
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,500
Because I do not have my own opinion.

245
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,060
We are talking about religion-
Freedom and all possible freedoms,

246
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:58.840
-but if I wear an extra layer,
Then what is wrong with me?

247
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:08.420
People think we're getting married
However, that everything is arranged,

248
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.580
-and that I'll be tomorrow
My cousin was forcibly married.

249
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.660
You know what people do when Elias
And I am together on the road?

250
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.340
People spit at him because they
Believe that he oppressed me.

251
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.500
Elias!

252
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:33.580
He does not even want me to wear a headscarf
Wear so I can not get hate!

253
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.620
You know how exhausting it is, every day
With the knowledge to go out of the house, -

254
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:43.580
- that you can prove again today
Must not be suppressed?

255
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.400
Do you think people think that?

256
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54.340
Wear a headscarf for one day.

257
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.500
Then you realize that most
Norwegians are racists.

258
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.220
This is bullshit.

259
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.620
-What?
-This is bullshit.

260
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.900
Most Norwegians
Are not racists!

261
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,740
Most Norwegians
Are interested in ...-

262
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.980
- Freedom, peace ... other cultures
And want to know more about it.

263
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.580
They want other cultures
Feel comfortable here.

264
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.100
But it is not surprising that so
Many are afraid of Muslims,

265
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.620
- if they are affected by genital mutilation, the
IS, terror and "foreign fighters".

266
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.940
You know that most do not
so are. So only damn few.

267
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.500
When you first meet a Muslim,
You do not know what to say.

268
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.220
If one says "foreign"
"Multiethnic" or "multicultural"?

269
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.860
What is right? You do not know if you
Women shaking hands with headscarf.

270
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:58.440
And is it disrespectful,
To ask for Allah?

271
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.640
And then you ask
Nothing at all because ...

272
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.260
Is perhaps also better so.

273
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.980
I've had enough in my life
Stupid, racist issues.

274
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,940
No, Sana! The stupid questions
Are damn important!

275
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.500
People must not stop,
The stupid questions.

276
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.020
For otherwise they seek their own
Reply. And that is dangerous.

277
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.820
Listen for racism in
The stupid questions.

278
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.380
Even if they're damn annoying
And feel racist,

279
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.240
- it's totally important that you have them
answered. You have to answer them.

280
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.360
Who the hell are you really ?!

281
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.940
I swear, you sound
Like my Imam.

282
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.620
This is something new.

283
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.280
Imam Valtersen. I like it.

284
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm not saying that there are no racists in
Norway. There are certainly many.

285
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.940
I am not a Muslim
Girl grown up, -

286
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.860
- but believe me:I was
Even where you are now.

287
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.500
Once you start,
To look for hatred,

288
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,980
- you will find what.

289
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,680
And if you find hate,
You start hating yourself.

290
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.340
I am sorry, that i
Read your chat.

291
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.160
Do not worry about that.
I've also done stupid things.

292
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.060
And...

293
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,200
Sorry that Elias and his
Boys are homophobic.

294
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,240
Are the homophobes?

295
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.620
Yes, did not they ...?

296
00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.140
That?

297
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.700
No no no.
It has nothing to do with it.

298
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.800
I had struck Michael.

299
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.940
I..

300
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.960
I was a little jealous.

301
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:28.740
And then Elias came and hewed me
A pure one. He is much stronger.

302
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.260
I had earned it. If someone
Jonas, I would be ...

303
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,960
No, I would not,
Because I'm not strong enough.

304
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55.140
No no no.
Who would have thought?

305
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.440
The Homo and the Muslima
- best buddies.

306
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,060
We are not the best buddies.

307
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.220
Are you serious?

308
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.420
