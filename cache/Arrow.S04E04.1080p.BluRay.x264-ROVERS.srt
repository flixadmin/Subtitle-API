1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,889
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,841
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,570
<i>to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,364
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,287
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,206
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,451
Previously on Arrow...

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm not gonna kill you.
But you need to trust me,

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,121
or we're both dead.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,443
What this city needs is someone willing to
stand up in the light of day,

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,284
not a guy lurking around in the shadows.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,289
I'm going to run for mayor.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,247
What a pleasant surprise.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,925
I want you to bring my sister
back to life.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,963
<i>Even if Sara went into the Pit,
even if it worked,</i>

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,204
what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,965
<i>"MALCOLM". We are in uncharted waters here.</i>

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,641
I suggest you prepare yourself
for the worst.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,250
Leave a couple of those
on the table, Junie.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,764
Thought you said
we're delivering 40 kilos.

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,645
So they'll get 38.
Dumbasses can't count, anyways.

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,005
- Get out! Now! Now! Now!
- S.C.P.D.! On the ground!

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,961
<i>Clear!</i>

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,288
- MALE SWAT <i>11 Clear!</i>
<i>- All clear!</i>

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,970
We're good to go here.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,845
S.C.P.D., hands in the air!

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,682
Relax. We got this.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,765
What're you guys doing here?

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,849
We didn't hear a call for ESU go out.

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,529
You guys
aren't supposed to be here, either.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,771
Well, we got a tip from one of our Cls.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,526
Sons of bitches.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,521
Let's go.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,643
Well, this is horrible.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,645
What type of secret lair has windows?

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,646
Well, you know, Oliver said
he wanted to do things differently.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,849
I think I just saw a cockroach.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,649
Listen, about Oliver...

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,724
Oh, no. Look, it's fine, he

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,208
still thinks
we spent the weekend at a spa.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,082
But why can't we tell him about Sara?

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,810
Sara, she needs more time.

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,202
And I don't need Oliver's judgment.

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,246
Just a couple more days,
and she'll be back to herself.

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,041
I promise.

47
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,927
Guessing he didn't tell you
what we're doing here, either.

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,925
No. He just had a perma-grin on his face
the whole way here.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,366
Okay, now I'm worried.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,244
He said he has some big announcement
to make.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,931
Oh, my God, wait.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,528
Where is it? Why aren't you wearing it?

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,726
Wearing what?

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,446
Uh...

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,081
What is it that you wanted to tell us?

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,446
And why are you telling us here?

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,443
- Remember this office?
- Yes.

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,604
This was
Sebastian Blood's campaign office.

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,285
And now it's mine.

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,522
Anyone who's qualified is afraid to run,
for good reason.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,246
But I can protect myself.

62
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,089
So, I'm running for mayor.

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,285
Uh, don't everyone
congratulate me at once.

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,805
- Oh, you're serious?
- Yes.

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,248
The other week, Lance was saying
that this

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,487
city needs someone to stand up,
who isn't hiding behind a mask.

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,087
- It needs a leader.
- But why does that person have to be you?

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,801
I mean, don't get me wrong,
but you're not a politician.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,566
Well, maybe that's the best reason
for me to be elected.

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,129
What are you going to do for a staff,
or campaign manager, money?

71
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,481
The money part's taken care of.

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,930
Palmer Tech has funded enough
to kick-start the campaign.

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,290
The decision I'm sure
my Board of Directors

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,487
are gonna be thrilled with.

75
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,801
What platform are you gonna run on?

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,449
- I'll figure it out.
- What qualifies you to be mayor?

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,965
I care about this city.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,849
But you can't say that you're gonna run

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,684
because being the Green Arrow
isn't enough.

80
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,285
I'm working on that.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,164
We need to brush up on those answers
before the first press conference.

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,651
Obviously.

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,525
Kind of thought everyone would
be a little bit more supportive.

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,524
It's not that
we're not supportive, Oliver.

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,920
- It's just...
- We just want to make sure

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,684
- that you're not in over your head.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,525
Maybe the other announcement
will go over better.

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,921
Okay.

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,281
For real?

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,806
There's a reason we had Felicity
buy Blood's campaign office.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,684
Blood also needed his own lair.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,970
But don't worry,
I burned a lot of incense.

93
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,881
- Oliver, how did you...
- How did you do this all by yourself?

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,726
- Well, I had help.
- He had a lot of help.

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,561
Cisco and S.T.A.R. Labs.

96
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,925
Four polycarbonate cases,

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,526
each keyed to your individual biometrics.

98
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,924
God, I didn't even think
you could pronounce biometrics.

99
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,730
I had some design input.

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,201
Wow!

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,525
Oliver, this is amazing.

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,089
Well, when I set up shop in the foundry,
it was just me.

103
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,369
That's not the case anymore, so I thought
we could use a little more space.

104
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,251
What was that? Did it break?

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,765
- Oh.
- You okay?

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,763
Yeah, I'm just not used to this chair yet.

107
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,721
I'm feeding police emergency services and
Homeland Security radio transmissions

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,763
through a processing algorithm, 24/7.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,243
This way, if anything happens in the city,
we will know about it.

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,289
Two police detectives found shot to death
responding to a code three.

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,284
Um, there's no record of them
calling dispatch for backup.

112
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,602
Which means either their comms failed,
or they were ambushed

113
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,921
the moment they arrived on the scene.

114
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,605
Thea and I will do recon.
See if there's anything

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,290
the CSI missed at the crime scene.

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
Right. I'll talk to Lance.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,803
Maybe skip the part
about running for mayor

118
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,644
because I'm pretty sure
you're not gonna have his vote.

119
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,086
That'll have to change.

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,641
Can't run the city
without the help of the S.C.P.D.

121
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,441
- Okay.
- Hmm.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,282
What did Thea think that you were wearing?

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,451
Noidea.

124
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,883
Fast track ballistics and have
CSI dust every shell casing for latents.

125
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,804
Hey, Forensics recovered this. SIM card.

126
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,491
Probably belongs to one of the doers,

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,642
but CSU says they need 48 hours
to get a full work-up.

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,487
What? How is evidence from a crime scene
where two detectives were killed

129
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,005
not a top priority?

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,731
We don't have the manpower.

131
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,961
You spend more time here now
than when you were getting collared

132
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,322
- for hitting paparazzi.
- You have a moment for me?

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,167
Yeah.

134
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,922
So these visits,
are they gonna be a weekly thing?

135
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,684
Well, I was just trying to help with...

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,685
- What's that?
- I wouldn't know.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,843
City Hall has cut my budget so tight,

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,128
I can't get evidence turned around
before I'm 80.

139
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,521
I'm hoping that's something
I might be able to help with eventually.

140
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,002
- Yeah?
- I've decided to run for mayor.

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,850
- Really?
- And I know it's a long-shot,

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,923
but it would mean a lot
if you would endorse my candidacy.

143
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,207
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,600
After what happened
to the last few mayors,

145
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,125
I'm hoping you win in a landslide.

146
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,363
Till then,
I'm trying to catch a cop killer

147
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,211
and I don't have time to wait
for my under-staffed crime lab.

148
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,521
I want you to wait until nightfall
to light a fire.

149
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,371
Okay? Otherwise,
you're gonna draw attention. All right.

150
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,203
There's fresh water coming off a stream
at the base of the hill.

151
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,403
There's edible plants, maybe 50 feet
to the north.

152
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,646
Just... Hey. Do not eat the red berries.
And do not let anyone see you.

153
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,563
Why are you doing this?
Risking your life, to save mine.

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,410
It's complicated.

155
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,723
They may think I'm dead, but
they're going to come looking for you...

156
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,848
They're not gonna come looking for me.
I'm going back to camp.

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,320
I've watched those men.

158
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,008
They are like brothers to each other.
They have a history. A bond.

159
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,045
You are not one of them.

160
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,243
That's why you're gonna have to
do something for me.

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,490
And you're not gonna like it.

162
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,004
All right, so I figured it out.

163
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,045
It's Neal Adams in data processing.

164
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,602
He won the archery medal
three years running at a summer camp,

165
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,451
he has a problem with his temper,
and he likes the color green.

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,364
Right. You think that Neal Adams
is the Green Arrow?

167
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,528
- He's 5'2".
- Lifts?

168
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,081
I am not telling you who he is.

169
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,886
Oh, and B-T-dubb, next time you want to
prank your boss, worst career move,

170
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,769
but whatevs,
you might wanna try a little harder.

171
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,285
And you lost me.

172
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,090
- I've been receiving these all week.
- Okay, well, I didn't send this.

173
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,442
And trust me, if I were gonna prank you,
I'd be a lot more creative.

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,125
This code is from 2013.

175
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,282
But the IP address
is coming from Palmer Tech,

176
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,204
from a terminal here, in your workspace.

177
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,127
I believe the term is,
"You are so busted."

178
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,284
I'm not busted. I can't be busted.
I didn't send you two-year-old code.

179
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,965
Though it is elegant.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,961
And familiar.

181
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,646
I was going through some of Mr. Palmer's
old prototypes, and I found this.

182
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,930
Yeah, that was Ray's.
I mean, Mr. Palmer's.

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,085
I mean, this has code that's, like,
identical to what you have on the phone.

184
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,124
I mean, the question is,
why is Mr. Palmer's prototype OS

185
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,084
sending you texts in your phone?

186
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,404
Ray must have connected
the prototype's computer

187
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,005
to the company's Local Area Network.

188
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,169
He did. it uploaded a crash log.

189
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,926
I mean, the equipment's programed
to record the user's voice

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,491
right before a fatal malfunction.

191
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,680
Sorry.

192
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,164
Poor choice of words.

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,802
The... The point is, is that
Mr. Palmer's last recorded statement

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,650
could shed some light on how he died.

195
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,611
Except that it's password protected.

196
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,650
I already know how he died.
I don't need to relive it.

197
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,441
- Bub-
- But“

198
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,171
Ray and I were close.
We were, um, friends.

199
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,962
He died six months ago, I don't
really want to open that particular wound.

200
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,445
- It did it again?
- No. Different mystery.

201
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,681
Lance gave us a SIM card
recovered from the crime scene.

202
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,281
Where's Laurel?

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,283
Said she had something
she needed to deal with.

204
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,281
Ah, it's a good thing you guys
aren't short-handed these days.

205
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,486
This SIM card isn't from a cell phone.
Looks like some kind of walkie with GPS.

206
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,371
GPS as in we can track it?

207
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,210
As in, I can figure out
all the places it's been

208
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,888
and triangulate from there
to determine, hmm, where it came from.

209
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,167
Gear up.

210
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,883
- Fifth floor is clear.
- Yeah, this place is completely empty.

211
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,964
I think I found something. Third floor.

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
Headed your way.

213
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,008
Every door here is open or unlocked.

214
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,206
Except for this one.

215
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,568
- Clear.
- It's not empty.

216
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,766
M-Fours, there's Kevlar,
Flashbang grenades...

217
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,001
Some of this stuff is military grade.

218
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,367
What, do you think
we found the Ghost armory?

219
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,566
No.

220
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,441
- Wait...
- Star City Police Department.

221
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,685
The people who killed those detectives
were police officers.

222
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,445
All right. All right, I'll bite.

223
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,726
- What are we doing down in your basement?
- It's better if I just show you.

224
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,450
After what happened between us last year,

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,762
I swore that I would never keep secrets
from you again.

226
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,962
Especially when it has to do
with our family.

227
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,567
Family? Oh, my...

228
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,801
Baby?

229
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,761
How's...

230
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,169
How is this even possible?

231
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,886
<i>"LAUREL". The League of Assassins.</i>

232
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,651
They have something called
the Lazarus Pit.

233
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,645
- It can bring someone back from the dead.
- Back, from what? From the...

234
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,564
This isn't back, Laurel. Look at her.

235
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,001
- Look at my baby. I don't...
- Dad, she's alive.

236
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,844
Your daughter is alive.

237
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,610
This isn't my daughter.

238
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,165
Daddy, it is, she's just been gone
for a really long time.

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,081
It's okay.

240
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,011
She'll remember who she is.

241
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,851
We just have to be patient,

242
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,364
and we'll help her find her way, right?

243
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,160
Do you remember me?

244
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,762
I'm Laurel. Your sister?

245
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,807
Look. There's me.

246
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,283
Then, this is you. Do you see that?

247
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,524
Yeah? And who's that?

248
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,691
Is that Daddy?

249
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,171
We're your family. We love you.

250
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,126
Who am I?

251
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,042
She's speaking because she's remembering.

252
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,521
Let me go. Let me go!

253
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,207
Laurel!

254
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,690
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

255
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,687
She just... She needs more time.

256
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,691
I think you better add
"Get an entirely new police force"

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,411
- to your campaign platform.
- It's not the entire force.

258
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,643
But, yeah,
we don't know who's compromised.

259
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,006
Well, except for Captain Lance.

260
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,924
Yeah, well,
Captain Lance is MIA right now.

261
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,162
I think it's safe to assume that
whatever help we're going to get

262
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,209
- is right here, in this room.
- I'm working on something.

263
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,882
Oh, Cisco said we were still working out
some of the kinks.

264
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,731
In the last two months, there's been
a huge spike on gangs stealing

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,401
- drug shipments from other gangs.
- Yeah, but it's not these gangs.

266
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,601
It was these bad cops.

267
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,570
Who steal the drugs to sell them back
to the gangbangers they stole them from.

268
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,091
So these corrupt cops are taking down

269
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,765
- big drug scores.
- Mmm-hmm.

270
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,089
- Let's give them one.
- How?

271
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,522
That depends on how close you are
with your former drug dealer.

272
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,202
Depends which one.

273
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,207
- We're going to need some money.
- Don't you mean more money?

274
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,121
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,281
Queenie.

276
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,646
I haven't seen you in forever.
This your boyfriend?

277
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,131
Bodyguard.

278
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,887
Didn't realize the Queens could afford
that kind of help these days.

279
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,568
Well, I recently came into my inheritance,
and was hoping to throw a party with it.

280
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,642
- So you can help me out?
- To the tune of...

281
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,645
Eighty keys. You know how I like to party.

282
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,408
I might have a hook-up.
But he doesn't take credit cards.

283
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,810
Let me make a call.

284
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,850
I've been trying to get in touch with you.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,809
Uh, yeah, phone's been off. What is it?

286
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,769
You're gonna tell me
you're running for president now?

287
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,848
Your detectives aren't dead
because of gang violence.

288
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,808
- They were killed by cops.
- What are you talking about?

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,604
The SIM card that you gave us,

290
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,604
it led to the killer's armory,
and all the equipment, the weapons,

291
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,330
it was all S.C.P.D. issue.

292
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,082
- Who is it?
- It could be anyone in the department.

293
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,484
These guys have been taking down
drug busts.

294
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,802
So I've had Thea procure
a couple kilos of cocaine.

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,287
Your mayoral campaign
is off to a fantastic start then.

296
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,762
We're keeping the drugs
in a warehouse on Meldrum.

297
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,282
I need you to subtly get the word out.

298
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,361
All right.

299
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,610
Listen... Wait, wait, wait.

300
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,691
- I wanna be there when they show.
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.

301
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,042
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
I really give a damn.

302
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,328
Because, if I got bent cops
in my precinct,

303
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,005
I'm gonna be there to bust 'em.

304
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,210
- The hell happened to you?
- The woman tried to escape.

305
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,844
We chased her,
but she went through a mine field.

306
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,566
- Thought I heard an explosion earlier.
- That one got Richards.

307
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,325
- Son of a bitch.
- I caught her.

308
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,401
Eventually.

309
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,246
Made it memorable.

310
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,563
- What? I'm supposed to kill her, right?
- Her, yeah. Richards, not so much.

311
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,246
- I didn't kill Richards. I told you...
- Yeah, landmine. I know.

312
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,925
You know what's funny?

313
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,004
We've been here months without a problem.

314
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,771
And here you come, and two guys
get wasted by landmines.

315
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,210
What's that supposed to mean?

316
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,046
It means I want to see her.

317
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,605
The woman. I want to see the body.

318
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,921
Okay.

319
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,770
I know this is a trap and all,

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,368
but something about the drugs, the club...

321
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,287
It makes me feel like
I'm back in high school again.

322
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,281
What?

323
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,807
Just thinking about how much I hate
raising a daughter in this city.

324
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,046
Heads up. I'm reading a truck
closing in on your position.

325
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,806
<i>The make matches the profile
for an ESU strike vehicle.</i>

326
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,644
- Copy. We're ready.
- Two minutes out.

327
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,447
Captain Lance.

328
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,642
What, I don't get a code name
like the rest of you?

329
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,283
Detective. Get ready.

330
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,043
Targets on site. Let's go.

331
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,049
We've got multiple tangos! Move!

332
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,441
Move out!

333
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,361
You Okay?

334
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,051
The training, the equipment,
those were cops.

335
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,646
And no, I'm not okay.

336
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,482
You have got to be kidding me.

337
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,481
Uh, no, um...

338
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,644
Not to complain, but you do know
that you just brought a police captain

339
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,245
into our secret lair?

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,006
Don't worry.
I got enough to put you away for 25 years.

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,885
Kidding.

342
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,202
Captain Lance isn't the police
we should be worried about.

343
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,685
Wow! No wonder
there's corruption on the force.

344
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,251
Everyone else has got better resources.

345
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,481
I don't know.

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,251
Those ESU
had some pretty fancy toys tonight,

347
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,040
that definitely weren't
standard police issue.

348
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,607
Well, they were police issue, all right.
But just not standard.

349
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,289
Those were specialized anti-vigilante
task force gear.

350
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,010
I thought the task force was disbanded.

351
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,921
Yeah. I might've reinstated that, uh,
last year.

352
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,563
- How many officers are there?
- Forty or so.

353
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,603
Well, that definitely narrows things down
a bit.

354
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,046
We should check their conduct records.

355
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,964
Maybe that will narrow it down
a little bit more.

356
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,921
Yeah, that's gonna take
a little bit longer than usual.

357
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,205
Well, I can give you unrestricted access
to the department's computer network.

358
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,405
Might speed things up a little.

359
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,125
I'll see what I can dig up
at the precinct.

360
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,925
Looks like eighty keys here.

361
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,203
Idiots baited the mouse trap
with real cheese.

362
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,044
Because they knew
we'd sniff them out otherwise.

363
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,323
Well, it's a good thing we decided
to pack the special gear.

364
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,881
We weren't the only ones showing up
with a little surprise tonight.

365
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,611
- Captain Lance?
- There's no way he didn't peg us as cops.

366
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,602
- We got to take him out.
- We don't kill cops.

367
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,888
Tell that to the two gold shields
we wasted last night.

368
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,326
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

369
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,164
I'm not killing fellow officers
in cold blood.

370
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,091
Our advantage was
the force thought we were gangbangers.

371
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,966
We should put this to a vote.

372
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,806
My vote's nine-millimeters
and the only one that counts.

373
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,926
We are not criminals.

374
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,489
Let's all just try to remember that.

375
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,128
We went this route
because this city is dying,

376
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,085
and we need to be able to provide
for our families.

377
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,804
It still doesn't change the fact
that Lance is a problem.

378
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,651
No. He's not.

379
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,601
He's a solution.

380
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,281
Curtis.

381
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,329
There you are.
Why haven't you been answering my texts?

382
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,166
Your texts were "9-1-1 OMG ASAP"
and five exclamation points.

383
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,681
I do not have time to respond to something
that doesn't contain

384
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,524
at least one actual word.

385
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,690
I need your help
with Mr. Palmer's crash log.

386
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,120
I thought I told you to let that go.

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,886
Look, I've tried brute-forcing
the password, but nothing works.

388
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,328
But there is a sub-kernel
that contains a programmer note.

389
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,010
Oh, my God, this must be
what talking to me is like.

390
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,482
And that programing note suggests that
you know the password.

391
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,531
I mean, which makes sense, right,
you and Mr. Palmer were friends.

392
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,522
- Yeah. I know the password.
- You do?

393
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,404
- So tell it to me so we can just...
- No, I...

394
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,724
I do not want to listen to a recording

395
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,531
of my ex-boyfriend's
final moment before he died.

396
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,244
You and Mr. Palmer were together?

397
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,361
Now, do you understand why
I don't want to hear his voice?

398
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,927
No.

399
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,009
My brother died six years ago.

400
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,685
Pancreatic cancer.

401
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,241
To be able to hear something from him
I'd never heard before?

402
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,764
God, I'd give anything.

403
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,564
Captain Lance. What a pleasure it was
to receive your message.

404
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,564
And for you to initiate contact, well,

405
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,571
it made me feel like our relationship
took an important step forward.

406
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,240
- I need your help.
- I'm sorry. Say that again?

407
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,607
It's for my daughter.

408
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,410
And not the one
that you're holding over me as leverage.

409
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,289
Sara, the one you lost last year.

410
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,081
Yeah, she's back.

411
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,249
This thing called the Lazarus Pit.

412
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,926
Sure you've heard of it.

413
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,646
What, you did your homework on me,

414
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,450
you don't think I did a little
digging around on you?

415
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,370
You used to be a member
of The League of Assassins.

416
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,409
What is it you want, Mr. Lance?

417
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,401
She's my daughter.

418
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,201
She's not right.
She's come back, and she's different.

419
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,289
- She's crazy.
- It's a miracle she came back at all.

420
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,924
It doesn't feel like a miracle, all right?

421
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,083
Now, you know about this stuff.
Is there anything I can do?

422
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,242
- Is there anything that you can do?
- I can give advice.

423
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,091
Father to father.

424
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,927
I can tell you that
if it were my daughter, I'd put her down.

425
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,808
- She's my baby girl.
- No, she isn't.

426
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,481
She may look like your daughter,
but she doesn't possess her soul.

427
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,923
The most loving act you can commit

428
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,284
is to return Sara to her final rest.

429
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,241
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,121
Oh!

431
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,364
Oh, I'm so glad we came back.

432
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,205
- You all right?
- Hmm?

433
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,646
You're doing that, um...

434
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,044
Crinkly thing, with your eyebrows.

435
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,125
Just...
No, just something at work.

436
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,130
It's no big deal. Um, this work, big deal.

437
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,361
Liza Warner.

438
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,166
I pulled her S.C.P.D. personnel file
using my computer at Palmer Tech

439
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,367
since ours is fritzing.

440
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,484
One of the original recruits
to the anti-vigilante task force

441
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,564
- over three years ago.
- Hand-picked by then-Detective Lance.

442
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,725
Do you think she's a suspect?

443
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,402
I think that Sergeant Warner has deposited
over a quarter of a million dollars

444
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,164
into offshore bank accounts
for the last three months.

445
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,806
- Where can we find her?
- I am working on that.

446
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,406
I used the network access
that Captain Lance gave us,

447
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,927
and I turned on every
uniform and squad car camera

448
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,730
on the force during the last 12 hours.

449
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,849
I'm running facial recognition
looking for Warner.

450
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,528
- Do you see something?
- No. Someone.

451
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,041
Pause.

452
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,201
<i>Zoom in.</i>

453
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,243
The man that Lance is talking to...

454
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,850
It's Damien Darhk.

455
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,602
You know I got a heart condition, right?

456
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,366
For years, you've looked at me
with such contempt...

457
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,884
Utter disdain.

458
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,565
So I'm wondering...

459
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,531
Do I have that same look on my face now?

460
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,091
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.

461
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,244
And Damien Darhk.

462
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,921
Okay, it's, it's...

463
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,727
I didn't know if you knew who he was,

464
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,564
or what he's been doing to this city.

465
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,483
But now, I see this look on your face...

466
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,961
You know.

467
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,090
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

468
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,288
Do you have any idea
how many people he's killed?

469
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,726
Yeah, I've got more of an idea than you.

470
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,930
And listen, you of all people,
you don't get to come into my house

471
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,491
and pass judgment on me! All right?

472
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,768
You always held yourself out
as better than me!

473
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,091
More righteous.

474
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,001
And you were.

475
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,321
Until tonight.

476
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,602
Actually, it's been
a little more than two months now.

477
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,444
Me working with Darhk.

478
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,850
It started out benign.

479
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,284
He said he had resources,
he had people, money.

480
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,127
He held himself out as just another guy
who wanted to help this city.

481
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,205
And we needed the help.

482
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,291
You weren't here.

483
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,366
By the time I figured out who he was,
what he was...

484
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,646
- That's when he threatened Laurel.
- Laurel can take care of herself.

485
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,961
You see what she does out there.

486
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,202
- That's what I thought about Sara, too...
- Stop it! Stop it!

487
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,323
Stop hiding behind your daughters!

488
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,171
They would be ashamed
of what you're doing right now.

489
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,681
- You don't know what I'm going through...
- And you know the funny thing?

490
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,047
You were the main reason
behind me running for mayor.

491
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,807
A part of me has always wanted you to see
what kind of man I really am.

492
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,325
I didn't expect to wind up finding out
what kind of man you really are.

493
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,571
What're you gonna do?

494
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,686
I don't know.

495
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,605
So how'd you do it? Kill the woman.
How'd you do it?

496
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,081
I strangled her.

497
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,005
Thought you said you made it,
what was that word, memorable?

498
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,771
She won't forget it.

499
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,082
What? You gonna propose?

500
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,927
You don't sound like a guy
who just committed his first murder.

501
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,283
And I'm guessing
you didn't have too many opportunities

502
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,602
at whatever posh boarding school
you grew up in.

503
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,771
You think I'm lying?

504
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,568
I think if you're not,
then you're a stone cold killer.

505
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,807
Even if you didn't off her,
even if you're messing with me,

506
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,805
which I do not recommend...

507
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,645
I see it in your eyes.

508
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,087
Reiter saw it, too.
It's probably why he recruited you.

509
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,886
Saw what?

510
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,089
You are one dark bastard.

511
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,647
Something very cold inside of you.
And you're terrified of it.

512
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,122
Okay, Conklin, tell me something.

513
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,562
If I'm this dark person,

514
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,083
shouldn't you be afraid of me?

515
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,321
No.

516
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,005
I'm the exact same way.

517
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,449
If you're lying to me,
you're gonna find that out.

518
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,686
- Nice sign.
- Yeah. Arrived this morning.

519
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,810
Are you all right?

520
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,841
Just thinking.

521
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,681
About?

522
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,603
Going to Sentinel games as kids.

523
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,841
- Do you remember Papp Stadium?
- Oh, yeah.

524
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,842
I loved the popcorn.

525
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,168
Every time a Sentinels player
hit a homer,

526
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,606
every single person in that stadium
stood and cheered.

527
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,963
Every single one.

528
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,681
United.

529
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,288
And I wanted to run for mayor, because
I wanted to be the leader of that city.

530
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,360
Wanted?

531
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,281
Thea, I don't know
if that city exists anymore.

532
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,322
I think that it might be beyond saving.

533
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,885
So what are you saying?

534
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,483
That I don't have to run for mayor.

535
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,482
I'm sorry, baby, but you're not her.

536
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,890
You're not her.

537
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,841
Dad.

538
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,091
- Dad, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm doing what I got to do.

539
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,448
You got no idea the terrible things
I would do for both of you.

540
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,604
No. No, you're not gonna kill
your own daughter...

541
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,763
She's not my daughter!

542
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,281
It's Sara.

543
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,801
It's okay.

544
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,645
Oh, God.

545
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,807
What am I doing?

546
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,884
- What am I doing? What am I doing?
- It's okay. Look at me. It's okay.

547
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,929
You're okay. It's okay.

548
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,249
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

549
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,765
Captain Lance?

550
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,084
- Liza. What are you doing here?
- Heard you were looking for me.

551
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,171
- Thought I'd make it easier for you.
- The hell are you talking about?

552
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,289
What...

553
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,686
Dad!

554
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,370
Ever been here before?

555
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,047
It's the S.C.P.D.'s contraband
disposal facility.

556
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,887
Thousands of pounds of
Slam, Vertigo, heroin, all incinerated.

557
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,008
- That's just literally burning money.
- Yep.

558
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,680
And the site requires
a precinct Captain to gain access.

559
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,122
- And that's not happening.
- What was your plan, Quentin?

560
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,165
You have to know this city's dying.

561
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,527
You were just gonna stay at your
desk until there was no city left?

562
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,210
Tell you what I wasn't gonna do,
I wasn't gonna dishonor

563
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,566
the badge, like you have.

564
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,210
I'm no saint,
but at least I'm not a criminal.

565
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,567
Neither am l.

566
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,406
I'm just a desperate cop
who got backed into too tight a corner.

567
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,880
What do we know?

568
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,050
Liza Warner and her posse took Lance
outside of Laurel's apartment.

569
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,402
- We need to find my father.
- I'm working on it.

570
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,728
Just a little hampered.

571
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,730
I think I got something
before the latest glitch.

572
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,243
Captain Lance's ID was just used to access
the S.C.P.D. Contraband Disposal Facility,

573
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,686
<i>three minutes ago.</i>

574
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,210
<i>Thank you, Quentin.</i>

575
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,924
Sorry about all the paperwork you'll have
to fill out when they find you here.

576
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,764
Word of advice?
Put a bullet in my head now,

577
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,445
'cause I am coming after you
with everything.

578
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,842
By the time they find you,
we'll be long gone.

579
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,242
We're leaving this city
like everybody else.

580
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,081
New frequency. Same cry.

581
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,120
Let's get out of here.

582
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,964
<i>Sergeant Warner,
you have failed this city.</i>

583
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,485
Is that all you got?

584
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,326
<i>Nope.</i>

585
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,611
<i>Get</i> out of here.

586
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,364
All I got to do is push
and I'll sever your spinal cord.

587
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,685
But you're not gonna do it, Liza.

588
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,371
You said you're not a criminal.

589
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,206
You kill that man, you are.

590
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,206
I told you I wasn't a criminal.
But I also told you I was desperate.

591
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,206
We all are.

592
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,280
Living in this city,

593
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,691
dealing with what we're dealing with
right now, we're all desperate.

594
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,207
We've all been made to do
desperate things.

595
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,811
Terrible things.

596
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,520
But I've got to believe
that we are not beyond redemption.

597
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,882
I got to believe that
this city can still be saved.

598
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,885
'Cause once we stop believing,

599
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,725
that's when this city really dies
and us, us right along with it.

600
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,681
But, maybe...

601
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,722
Just maybe, we start saving our home

602
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,242
by saving ourselves first.

603
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,927
And that means facing up to our mistakes.
That means facing justice.

604
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,246
You put on that uniform
'cause you believe in justice.

605
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,925
Ask yourself, Warner.

606
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,410
Is that still the case?

607
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,250
Do what you got to do.

608
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,364
I guess you know your Miranda rights.

609
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,770
- You got your own key or something?
- What you said to Warner saved my life.

610
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,444
I didn't know you had such a way
with words.

611
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,290
Well I don't do encores.

612
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,804
You believe what you said?

613
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,802
Yeah. Every word.

614
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,767
Especially the part about facing justice.

615
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,246
When One Police Plaza opens this morning,
I will be there, turning myself in.

616
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,970
Can't have you do that.

617
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,801
We haven't been able
to get close to Darhk.

618
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,961
You have.

619
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,810
I'd like you to stick around.

620
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,131
Stay on the inside.

621
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,001
Well...

622
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,607
Well, that's only a smart plan
if you can trust me.

623
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,007
I trust the man who said
we can't stop believing

624
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,805
we can save this city.

625
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,526
- Like I said, stone cold killer.
- You satisfied?

626
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,051
Get rid of the body.

627
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,682
This cave might be useful for something.

628
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,887
It's okay. You're okay.

629
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,486
How did you...

630
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,724
Where did you learn to do that?

631
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,565
I learned it here.

632
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,563
I haven't always been alone
on this island.

633
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,925
Son of a bitch.

634
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,605
Oh, my God, he's here.

635
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,241
<i>Hi.</i>

636
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,521
How you doing, man?

637
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,611
Oliver Queen. Oh!

638
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,761
Hi, there.

639
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,080
It's, uh, absolutely wonderful
that, that all of you are here.

640
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,762
Just, just wonderful, and surprising.

641
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,685
So? What do you think?

642
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,966
Um, hey, did you, did you hire
all of these people?

643
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,408
No. That's what makes them interns, Ollie.

644
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,284
Where did we get all of these interns?

645
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,285
Easiest way to get a lot of followers
on social media

646
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,886
is to own a very successful club.

647
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,649
All I had to do was tell them
what I've already known for three years.

648
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,121
Oliver Queen is gonna save the city.

649
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,809
- What's this?
- This is your speech.

650
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,721
You're announcing your candidacy
this afternoon.

651
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,605
So you better get your suit out
of mothballs.

652
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,810
Did you write this?

653
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,564
I wrote it down.

654
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,170
I just went with what you told me.

655
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,167
About this city being united.

656
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,801
United.

657
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,090
<i>That's what this city used to be.</i>

658
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,165
<i>It's what it can be,
it's what it must be, again.</i>

659
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,171
<i>Now I know that
I'm not the obvious choice for mayor.</i>

660
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,163
<i>I'm not</i> a <i>politician.</i>

661
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,689
<i>I signed away my family's company.</i>

662
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,527
<i>I didn't even graduate from college,
although in my defense,</i>

663
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,284
<i>I did go to four of them.</i>

664
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,525
<i>I certainly don't have
a traditional background for leadership,</i>

665
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,966
<i>but I can tell you this.</i>

666
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,208
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

667
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,283
<i>I returned home with only one goal.</i>

668
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,605
<i>I wanted to save my city.</i>

669
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,043
<i>And with your help, I can.</i>

670
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,604
<i>With your help, we will restore our home
to the shining beacon we know it can be.</i>

671
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,527
<i>Now how we're gonna get there
isn't a mystery.</i>

672
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,849
<i>We will overcome our challenges
with help from our friends...</i>

673
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,006
<i>Our family.</i>

674
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,721
<i>Our loved ones.</i>

675
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,563
I'm sorry, Felicity. This is my fault.

676
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,249
<i>Those we trust and those we will need to
trust again in order to prevail.</i>

677
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,246
<i>Because the only way that
we are gonna return our home to greatness</i>

678
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,482
<i>is to do so together.</i>

679
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,081
<i>United.</i>

680
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,281
