1
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:14,798
And if you gaze long into an abyss,
the abyss also gazes into you.

2
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:29,458
21 June 1921

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,550
The beginning... and the end.

4
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,588
I think it seems a strange idea

5
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,173
that maybe there's no difference.

6
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:19,052
Sic mundus creatus est.

7
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:23,085
And thus the world is created.

8
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:36,382
Sic

9
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,553
mundus

10
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:40,462
creatus est!

11
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,568
You've stopped believing the prophecy?

12
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,547
I believe in the irony of fate.

13
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,362
Adam says that all things

14
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,689
must happen in the same
manner they always have.

15
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:18,843
We have to bear the cross, no
matter how hard it may seem.

16
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:22,882
In six days this will be paradise
and hell on earth will end.

17
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:26,923
Sometimes I ask myself
whether paradise and hell

18
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,507
are one and the same.

19
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,713
Adam was right.

20
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,255
You've lost your faith.

21
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,707
And is that why he sent you?

22
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:50,803
I've waited for this moment for ages.

23
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,088
Interesting that it should be you.

24
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:07,208
I hope eventually a day will come

25
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,338
where you won't believe
everything Adam tells you.

26
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,505
You should...

27
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,300
ask why he took you in.

28
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:18,875
And why he chose to call you Noah.

29
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,670
27 June 2020 beginning
of the last cycle

30
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:27,172
You and I are perfect for each other.

31
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,710
Never believe anything else.

32
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:54,255
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE 
4 NOVEMBER 10:13 P.M.

33
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,007
JUNE 2020

34
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,172
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

35
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:54,665
I am one of the few survivors of
the apocalypse on 27 June 2020.

36
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:58,672
Almost three months have
passed since the catastrophe.

37
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:02,205
It's unclear what exactly
caused the events in Winden.

38
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,877
But the God Particle...

39
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:09,045
If we can stabilise it, it
might provide a way back.

40
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:14,053
Back to the past.
Maybe we can save them.

41
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,557
All of them.

42
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,958
21 June 2020

43
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:26,587
6 days until the Apocalypse

44
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,141
<i>Morning, sleepyheads!</i>

45
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,616
<i>It's the first week
of the summer holiday.</i>

46
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,502
<i>The weather couldn't be
nicer for a day at the beach.</i>

47
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:34,880
<i>In local news,</i>

48
00:10:34,905 --> 00:10:37,729
<i>more than half a year after
the mysterious disappearance</i>

49
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:41,207
<i>of 4 teenagers, a senior
citizen and a local police officer</i>

50
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,007
<i>from the town of Winden</i>

51
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,427
<i>there are no clues as
to their whereabouts</i>

52
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,862
<i>or what might have happened.</i>

53
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:52,172
<i>A federal police task force will
now assist with the investigation.</i>

54
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,407
How are you today?

55
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:01,103
Still having joint pain?

56
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,412
Nausea?

57
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:07,013
To be honest, your lab
results are worrying me a bit.

58
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,208
I think we should admit you again.

59
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,233
No.

60
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,252
Of course not.

61
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,867
I'm staying at home.

62
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,418
Fine. We'll wait for the
results of the last MRI.

63
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:22,211
We may have to stop the hormone
treatment and switch back to chemo.

64
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,712
COME TO THE BRIDGE.

65
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,824
"He that has eyes to see

66
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,908
and ears to hear

67
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:36,038
may convince himself

68
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,285
that no mortal can keep a secret.

69
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,627
If his lips are silent,

70
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:44,393
he chatters with his fingertips.

71
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:47,563
Betrayal oozes out
of him at every pore."

72
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,448
That was Freud,

73
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:54,377
and I'm Clausen, head of
the task force for Winden.

74
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,423
As of today I'm in charge of the
past year's unsolved missing cases.

75
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,871
This task force's aim is to

76
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,957
reinvestigate the case
from the beginning,

77
00:12:02,978 --> 00:12:05,618
To assess all the
circumstantial evidence

78
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:09,403
and make sense of the
secrets that remain hidden,

79
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,120
undiscovered until we find them.

80
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:16,208
In the coming days some of
you will receive subpoenas

81
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,643
to appear for another
round of questions.

82
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,513
- Yes?
- You keep saying "we".

83
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,758
- What do you mean by that?
- Myself and Mrs. Doppler.

84
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,821
Who is still assigned to these cases.

85
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,137
6 people have been missing for months!

86
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,542
And this is what they send us?

87
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,451
This is what you call a task force?

88
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:37,507
One person? And the woman
who hasn't found anyone.

89
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,838
She hasn't done anything.

90
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,093
10 people

91
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,877
who see an elephant

92
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:54,843
from 10 different angles

93
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:58,032
will give you 10 different descriptions

94
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:01,843
of the size and shape of that elephant.

95
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:05,633
But a single person who
looks at that same elephant

96
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,763
from all 10 different
perspectives instead

97
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,668
will be able to piece together
all of his observations

98
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:16,875
and eventually arrive at the
only reasonable conclusion.

99
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,843
My son is still gone.

100
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:21,644
The next time I need to
find an elephant, though,

101
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,036
I'll be in touch!

102
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,340
That's right.

103
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,893
Does your mother talk at home?

104
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,091
About the investigation,
I mean.

105
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:33,052
Not to us.

106
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,428
So we just sit and wait.

107
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,408
And nothing happens.

108
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:42,017
We've been clueless for 8 months.

109
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:47,417
Sometimes I think it'd just
be better if they were dead.

110
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,055
Hey, don't say that.

111
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:15,478
I better go.

112
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:20,208
- Where are you going?
- Elisabeth's staying at her friend's.

113
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,965
I'll call you later, okay?

114
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,213
Aleksander Tiedmann
died 27.6.2020

115
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:48,587
Justyna Jankowski
died 27.6.2020

116
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,882
Torben Wöller
died 27.6.2020

117
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,725
Michael Kahnwald
born 5.11.1975
died 21.6.2019

118
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:23,835
Martha Nielsen
died 27.6.2020

119
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,060
I tried calling you the last few days.

120
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,417
There's a lot going on.

121
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,708
I wanted to talk.

122
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,887
- I have for a while.
- Don't worry about it.

123
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:36,262
I think it's better this way.

124
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,440
I guess...

125
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,062
that's it, then.

126
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,760
It's because of him.

127
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,858
- Because of Jonas.
- What?

128
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:02,748
What does that have to do with it?

129
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,208
We hardly ever see each other.

130
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:07,062
I don't...

131
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,510
You've really changed.

132
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,148
I...

133
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,460
I've been thinking that
you're hiding something.

134
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,037
I...

135
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:24,705
- I have no idea what's going on with you.
- What do you mean?

136
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:28,857
For fuck's sake, my mum is dying.
That's what's going on. And...

137
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,300
- There are things I just can't tell you.
- And why the hell not?

138
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:33,955
I just can't!

139
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,297
Okay? If you had any idea of
the shit I've been dealing with.

140
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,380
- I mean...
- The shit you've been dealing with?

141
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,340
In case you forgot, my father
and brother are still missing.

142
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,942
My mother is crazy and
doesn't give a shit about me.

143
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:50,482
And you're telling me about how
much shit you've been dealing with?

144
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,520
It's better this way.

145
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,665
THIS EVENING.

146
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,540
Energy creates community.

147
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:44,415
Nuclear power was, is, and always
will be the only viable option.

148
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:47,585
Nothing is more reliable,
cheaper or as safe.

149
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,120
The outside world, however,
demands progress.

150
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,938
In 7 days our plant
will close for good.

151
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:02,665
This will be a life-altering
adjustment for all of us.

152
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:06,813
I would like to thank you
for your loyalty.

153
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:11,007
Without all of you the
Winden plant as we know it

154
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,102
could never have existed.

155
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,963
And so, for the last 6 days,
let us fill this place

156
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:20,068
with the spirit of our community,
as we always have.

157
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:44,645
Everything is ready
for transport on schedule.

158
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:48,063
And the decommissioning?

159
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:50,516
What is at ground
level will be untouched

160
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,406
and become part of the greenfield.

161
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:56,303
Any radiation will be traced back
to the previous use of the pools.

162
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:43,165
Hello?

163
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,435
Who are you?

164
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:55,252
Why are you here?

165
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:59,962
How did you have a key?

166
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,667
It's my key.

167
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,433
What are you saying, your key?

168
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:13,933
I know this is all going to
sound like it doesn't make sense.

169
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:16,778
But hear me out.

170
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,340
Do you remember the yellow bike?

171
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:26,652
The bike you and Dad gave
me for my 8th birthday.

172
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,337
I drove it into a ditch
on the very first day.

173
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,692
I got that cut on my arm, here.

174
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,950
Get out!

175
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:42,797
Here...

176
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,002
Dad was making pancakes.

177
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:54,325
He dropped the pan and
spilled hot oil right there.

178
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:00,007
I disappeared from your
life over half a year ago.

179
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,303
And you found me over 33 years ago.

180
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:07,025
I knew it was you right away.

181
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,420
It was raining that day.

182
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,508
You and Grandpa wanted to
drive me there in the car.

183
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:16,008
You said there was still acid rain
because of Chernobyl.

184
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,998
I was wearing my yellow jacket.

185
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,038
It's me.

186
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,813
It's me, Mum.

187
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,860
Jonas.

188
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,875
How can it be you?

189
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,410
There are no coincidences.

190
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,597
Every path is predetermined.

191
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:15,753
Everything happens
when it is supposed to.

192
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,923
At the right time.

193
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:20,955
At the right place.

194
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,755
As if the world was a carpet

195
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,118
made up of a network
of infinite threads.

196
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,963
Each in its place.

197
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:38,215
But only a handful of people know
where their journey will take them.

198
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,360
You've taken your first step.

199
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,580
Adam will be proud of you.

200
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,285
I had that same feeling.

201
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,188
It will pass.

202
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,872
Adam...

203
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,329
why did he take us in?

204
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:09,929
Certain things are
still hidden from you.

205
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,710
But they will come to light.

206
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,707
Little by little.

207
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:19,277
It's all a matter of timing.

208
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:25,115
How do we know what's
right and what's wrong?

209
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:28,208
What's good

210
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,755
and what's evil?

211
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:33,498
By listening to our inner voice.

212
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,990
And choosing not to follow anyone

213
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:39,438
but ourselves.

214
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,718
Our true character shows
not only in our deeds,

215
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,849
but also in their purpose.

216
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:47,397
I am you.

217
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,250
I am your inner voice.

218
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:53,272
Never forget.

219
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:56,337
Everything's connected.

220
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,655
You,

221
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:00,862
me,

222
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:03,175
the past

223
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:06,762
and the future.

224
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,262
"Any passage into the
dead zone is forbidden.

225
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:17,117
Any attempt will result
in the death penalty.

226
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:19,055
Those are the rules.

227
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,420
We are the future!

228
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,455
Sic mundus creatus est!"

229
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:26,707
Sic mundus creatus est!

230
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,380
"Where were you?"

231
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,567
"There is nothing out there."

232
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:59,451
"Our only hope is in the passage.

233
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:01,197
Those without faith are already dead.

234
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:03,665
The prophecy will be fulfilled.

235
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:06,495
The passage will open
and lead us to paradise."

236
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:09,203
Those without faith are already dead?

237
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,883
They are all dead,
my family, my friends.

238
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:15,163
Everybody dies! In my time, in 6 days.

239
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,080
I don't need your fucking paradise.
I just want to go home.

240
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:24,877
What's behind that wall?

241
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:52,263
Why did Mum keep it all?

242
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:55,168
Great-Grandpa died ages ago.

243
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,544
I think it's because it's the only thing

244
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,904
that reminds her of her family.

245
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:03,813
Some things it's
impossible to let go of.

246
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
It's a shame I never
met Grandpa and Grandma.

247
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:11,713
Does Mum remember them?

248
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:15,985
Your mother was still
little when they died.

249
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,632
Come.

250
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,210
Were you born here?

251
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:53,167
My grandfather was. He
was the one who raised me.

252
00:29:54,672 --> 00:29:56,962
Is your grandfather still alive?

253
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,663
No.

254
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:01,625
Have you considered
it could've been him?

255
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:04,393
- Who? My grandfather?
- No.

256
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:06,463
Your colleague, Ulrich.

257
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:07,747
No.

258
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,670
Why?

259
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:12,275
He called you right
before he disappeared.

260
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:15,831
The call lasted exactly 12 seconds.

261
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,156
Most likely a voicemail recording.

262
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,218
What did he want?

263
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:23,918
Nothing. He had the wrong number.

264
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,550
Did you keep the recording?

265
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:29,185
No.

266
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:32,257
Of course not.

267
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,855
The parents' testimonies
are in this one.

268
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,298
Thank you, Wöller.

269
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:49,513
Sure thing.

270
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:07,125
I had them set up an office for you.

271
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,560
Just down the hall.

272
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:16,007
Expectations lead to disappointment.

273
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:20,705
"Have hope", my mother used
to say, "not expectations.

274
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:24,377
You might just be surprised,
but not disappointed."

275
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:34,758
You expected a different kind
of colleague and got me instead.

276
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:36,138
Coincidence?

277
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,633
I don't believe in them.

278
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,763
I believe things come together
as they're supposed to.

279
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:54,822
Shall we?

280
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:06,857
Mum?

281
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,710
INVESTGATION FILE

282
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,918
STEEL DOOR?

283
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:44,417
It's remarkable
that people don't go crazy

284
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:47,502
knowing the futility
of their own existence.

285
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,380
An endless cycle of life and death.

286
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:57,746
What is the origin
of all this suffering?

287
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,408
Did you show Bartosz?

288
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,920
And he doesn't suspect anything?

289
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,540
He was always naive by nature.

290
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,617
The apocalypse

291
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,100
must come to pass.

292
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:38,687
Do you have doubts?

293
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:45,785
What must one do with a dead
forest so that new trees may grow?

294
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:48,212
One burns it all down.

295
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,163
There's very little time.

296
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,982
You must find

297
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,155
the missing pages.

298
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:05,957
Adam, they're waiting for you.

299
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,230
6 days left.

300
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,542
I'm on my break.

301
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:04,458
Whatever. Blow job is
40 euros, anal is 85.

302
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:07,797
Kinky games are extra.
But first I need to eat.

303
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:13,187
Go on, take them off.

304
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:28,795
You could say that I exist infinitely.

305
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,650
I'm here now,

306
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:35,005
and I exist for every second
between my birth and my death.

307
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,437
But I am always Jonas.

308
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,755
I'm the same as I was,

309
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:41,668
and yet not the same.

310
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,333
Just as you're not the same person

311
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,239
who came through that door
an hour ago.

312
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,427
But where is Jonas?

313
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:51,227
Where is my Jonas?

314
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:56,157
In the future.

315
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:59,112
In the future?

316
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:01,842
Yeah.

317
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:05,213
But he can't get back.

318
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:09,087
I tried to destroy the passage,
but I only managed to close it.

319
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:11,432
That's why he's still there.

320
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,158
So why are you here?

321
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:33,257
To put an end to everything.

322
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:34,968
Once and for all.

323
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:25,417
- That's the man!
- Which man?

324
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:29,545
The man with the watch. That's Noah!

325
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:31,335
Noah?

326
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,463
POLICE

327
00:39:58,547 --> 00:40:02,377
Look out for the tiniest
discrepancies when people talk.

328
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:04,113
Every detail counts.

329
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,168
I've found Noah. Come to the Bunker.

330
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,993
Something wrong?

331
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:17,522
I have to go.

332
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:20,007
I don't have a driver's license.

333
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:22,708
I assume it'd be all right
if I rode with you tomorrow?

334
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:23,797
Yes.

335
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,697
Mum left it open.

336
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:28,932
What's that?

337
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,000
Dad's stuff.

338
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,132
Police documents and maps of the cave.

339
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:40,157
That's why Mum
goes in there every day.

340
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:44,473
I think she's looking for this.

341
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,060
A door.

342
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:55,272
In the cave?

343
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,062
It leads to the plant.

344
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:02,633
Everyone out there knows
something we're not supposed to.

345
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:04,013
Mum, Bartosz,

346
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,708
the police, too.

347
00:42:10,588 --> 00:42:13,438
They all have a secret they're keeping.

348
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:55,032
Are you prepared?

349
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:28,305
Thanks for the coffee.

350
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:46,912
I'm glad to get rid of that thing.

351
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:00,585
Get in touch with Mum, okay?

352
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,630
Bye.

353
00:44:21,755 --> 00:44:22,955
Ciao.

354
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,050
That's Noah.

355
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:13,587
Elisabeth found it. In a book.

356
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:16,355
It was at the store.

357
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,715
She said that was the man
who gave her the watch.

358
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,760
"8 January, 1921.

359
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,168
Sic mundus creatus est."

360
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:31,542
These people,
who are they, Charlotte?

361
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:35,673
- Why does your grandfather have this?
- I don't know.

362
00:46:00,647 --> 00:46:02,117
CALL REJECTED
