1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,000
But you are my only
true blood relative, Oswald.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,720
- That vermin has to go.
- How can we persuade him to go?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,400
How do you get rid of rats?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,240
- Did he drink that?
- Yes.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Why? Why? He's not supposed to.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,880
No!

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,520
Awake at last.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,280
Well, hello, dear.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,760
Someone call Professor Strange!

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,800
We'll see about your clever
little plan, Jim Gordon.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,160
- I can make plans of my own.
- Hello, Officer Pinkney.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,320
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
- Murder weapon was a crowbar.
- Your fingerprints were on it.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,560
I was set up!

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,160
Being convicted for murder
has its downsides.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,640
- It's good to see you, Harv.
- Don't give up hope.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,880
What the hell are you doing here?

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
What's it look like we're doing?

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,840
We're getting you out of here.
Come on, let's go.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,440
I have to clear my name.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,760
To do that,
I have to go back to Gotham.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,800
You little cunts!

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,120
Don't you take that bag!

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,480
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,680
Leave it.

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,480
- That's my money!
- You stole it.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
Now, you got stole, chump.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,560
I catch you, you're dead.
Both of you.

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,160
By the way, you're a terrible crook,

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
letting two kids rob you,

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,520
You really don't deserve
this money.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,360
What the hell are you doing,
you little freak?

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,800
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're both dead.

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,960
Nobody ever try to touch my money!

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm not a thief.
I don't steal for the money.

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
This is research.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,160
I can't understand Gotham
until I understand its criminals.

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,480
Okay, this whole
understanding-criminals thing

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,720
is getting on my nerves.
That was your half you threw out.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,960
I saved enough for burgers.

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,880
<i>Gotham is on high alert today
after former G.C.P.D. detective</i>

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,080
<i>and convicted murderer
James Gordon escaped.</i>

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,800
Detective Bullock,
have you heard the news?

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,360
- Yeah, Ed, I heard.
- So, what do you think he'll do?

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,600
Knowing Jim Gordon,

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,960
I'd say he's not gonna rest
until he finds the son of a bitch

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,200
who framed him for murder.

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,840
Good luck with that.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,560
Bullock.

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,840
This is your one and only chance.
And tell me where he is.

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,280
- Hand to God, Cap, I have no idea.
- Stop it.

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
You're not smart enough to play dumb.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,600
We both know
Jim did not kill Pinkney.

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,080
I know that a court found him guilty.

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,200
He wants to prove
his own innocence? Great.

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,960
I hope he does.
The public, the people of Gotham,

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,400
the ones you and I serve,
they have to know,

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,320
they have to see that we're
impartial. Do you understand?

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,120
The people of Gotham
can eat my socks.

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Hey. Hey! Nice try.
Walk away in a huff?

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,480
Now, I know you know something.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,120
If you're providing aid
and shelter to Jim Gordon,

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,840
anything, a glass of water,

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,560
I will bust you
like a bum I never met.

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,360
Cap, I wish I knew where he was.
But I don't.

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,560
Go.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,320
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
Let's get to work.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,960
And I'm going over and over this
a thousand times in my mind,

71
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,880
{\an5}it all has to be connected.

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,920
The theft at the art museum,
the bombing at the train station,

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,480
{\an5}the I.A. tip-off, Pinkney's murder,

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,680
{\an5}it's all a part
of an elaborate frame.

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,640
{\an5}So he's smart, meticulous.

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,480
{\an5}Got technical skill and access.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,960
{\an5}- An active cop?
- Has to be.

78
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
{\an5}Only way he could have access
to a crowbar

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
{\an5}after it was put into evidence.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,160
{\an5}It doesn't really narrow
the suspect list too much.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,360
{\an5}I mean, come on, Jim, be honest.

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,920
{\an5}You probably got 500 cops
who have beef with you.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
{\an5}Yeah. But enough to frame me
for murder?

84
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,600
{\an5}Maybe ten. You got to admit,

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,760
{\an5}you do have
a little bit of a knack for

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,240
{\an5}making enemies.

87
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,600
My number was 12.
Many Loeb loyalists.

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,120
Who knows, maybe Loeb himself
is behind this.

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,560
{\an5}Before you go down that rabbit hole,

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,400
{\an5}I gotta say something to you
as a friend.

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,800
{\an5}You can still run.

92
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
{\an5}Go to an island, buy a banana boat,

93
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,400
{\an5}grow a beard, find Lee, have a life.

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,720
Look,
I've been working this thing

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,040
{\an5}since you went away,

96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
{\an5}and I'm not saying it's hopeless,
but Barnes is on the hunt.

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,880
{\an5}- You don't have much time.
- Did he threaten you?

98
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,560
Hey, I'm the one who busted you
out of jail, remember?

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,160
- I made my choice.
- All right, let's say I run.

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,360
I find Lee, I somehow
convinced her to take me back.

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,240
What then?
I get her to live as a fugitive?

102
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
{\an5}I have to clear my name.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
{\an5}Otherwise I might as well be in jail.

104
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,400
{\an5}But how? Starting where?

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
Dent once told me

106
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I.A. secretly records and archives

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
all their incoming calls on tape.

108
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,880
Which means the eyewitness
who called into I.A.?

109
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,440
The one they assumed
that was Pinkney?

110
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,480
There could be a tape
with his voice on it.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,560
That's a hell of a long shot,
brother.

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,960
{\an5}And if, okay, just saying if,
a tape like that exists,

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,960
{\an5}it's gonna be locked up tighter
than a duck's ass

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,280
{\an5}in I.A. evidence.

115
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,440
{\an5}It's why it's lucky for you,
Uncle Harvey has connections.

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,200
{\an5}Hey. Ginny.

117
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,560
{\an5}How's my favorite I.A. sugar plum?

118
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Well, why do you think
I'm calling, baby?

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,240
Heard you're getting married.

120
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,480
- She changed her mind.
- Smart girl.

121
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
{\an5}You're an animal, Bullock.

122
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,960
- You know that?
- Ma'am, I do, I do.

123
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,320
- Come on, Bullock.
- Yeah, baby.

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,240
I'll be right there.
Slow down for me for a sec.

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,320
Hey. An hour.
Slip them under the door.

126
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
{\an5}Come on, Bullock.
Ain't got all night.

127
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
{\an5}Don't say a word.

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,840
{\an5}<i>Daddy's coming.</i>

129
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Give me that.

130
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh, what's up, sweetheart?
What are you doing?

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,960
- What are you doing?
- Now, do it. Do it!

132
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Somebody help!

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,200
- Do it!
- Hey!

134
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,920
Get out of here. Go!

135
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Ma'am, are you okay?

136
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,640
- You're welcome.
- Hands up.

137
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
Or I'll blow your head off.

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,360
G.C.P.D. You're under.

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,520
- You're Jim Gordon.
- Listen to me.

140
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,400
This is Barkley,
over at Fifth and Spring.

141
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,960
I got Jim.

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
- Don't kill me.
- I'm innocent, you hear me?

143
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,720
All units,
it's Jim freaking Gordon.

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,880
I need backup now.

145
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,240
Father, I only knew you a short time.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,760
But you came to me when I was alone

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
in this cold, dark world.

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,440
You gave me a family.

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
I will never forget you.

150
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,680
As long as I...

151
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,880
Oh, Father.

152
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
What a bore that was.

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, but the house is ours now,
and we're rich.

154
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
Quiet.

155
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,560
- He loved us all so much.
- Indeed.

156
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
But, Oswald, Oswald,

157
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,600
as painful as this is,
we need to talk practicalities.

158
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,840
Can I call you a cab,
or will you take the bus?

159
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't understand.

160
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,720
Well, you're not returning
to the house with us.

161
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,000
- But where shall I go?
- Anywhere but there.

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,440
Oswald, I'm so happy that you
and your father reconnected.

163
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,560
But he left the house
and the estate to me.

164
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
And I'm simply not comfortable

165
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,200
sleeping under the same roof
as a notorious murderer.

166
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,320
But I'm not like that anymore.

167
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,720
I couldn't hurt a fly,
even if I wanted to.

168
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,680
Please, my father was all that I had.

169
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,880
We shared the same blood.

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,360
And he wanted us to be together.
He told me.

171
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,680
Let me stay. I'll do anything.

172
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
You are his blood.

173
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,120
We do need help around the house.

174
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,280
- Mother.
- Mother.

175
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,640
Why waste good money on servants
when we have Oswald?

176
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll do anything.

177
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Well, you could start by getting rid

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,840
of those disgusting flowers.
I've always detested lilies.

179
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,880
Yes. Of course.

180
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,400
You're not really letting him stay?

181
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,960
He's Elijah's only natural son.

182
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,960
If he found the right lawyer,
he could make things difficult.

183
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,240
Especially, if people look
into how his father died.

184
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,960
- So, we just live with him then?
- Yeah, we keep him close.

185
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,400
And after a suitable
amount of time goes by,

186
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,880
poor Oswald, overcome with grief,
will take his own life.

187
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,680
Till then, we have a free servant.

188
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,160
I could fire the maid.

189
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,120
I murdered my...

190
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
Parents.

191
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
I cut their throats.

192
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,120
I joined
a gang of psychopathic killers.

193
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,480
I tried to kill Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins.

194
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,640
I was a puppet...

195
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,240
Of these demons in my head

196
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,480
and they were forcing me
to do these terrible things.

197
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,400
I wish I could go back
and undo what I've done.

198
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
Only I can't.

199
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,840
I don't feel insane...

200
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Now...

201
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
I just...

202
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,040
I feel sad.

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
Thank you, Barbara.

204
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,320
That was very brave.

205
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,640
What do you suppose
made this helpful change in you?

206
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,320
Maybe I just...

207
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Really needed some sleep.

208
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,240
It's a good act.

209
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,680
So, sure it's an act are you?

210
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,760
- Aren't you?
- I have no idea.

211
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,720
One way or the other,
she intrigues me.

212
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, if you would allow us
to apply rigorous dream therapy,

213
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,080
- we would know for sure...
- No, no, no.

214
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,440
We do have very useful hammer,
Ms. Peabody,

215
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,160
but not all of our patients
are nails.

216
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,080
Thank you.

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,120
What the hell happened last night?

218
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
Stumbled onto a mugging.

219
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,280
And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.

220
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,040
- Where'd you sleep?
- Didn't. Just walked around.

221
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,760
- How's Barnes?
- He's on the warpath.

222
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,080
Governor announced
a 10,000-dollar reward

223
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,000
for anyone who helps catch you.

224
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,760
Ten thousand? You should turn me in.

225
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,960
If he doubled that to 20?
I'll give it some thought.

226
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,000
- Okay, here.
- <i>Internal Affairs.</i>

227
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,880
<i>I, I want to report a crime.</i>

228
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,880
- You recognize that voice?
- Sounds like it's been disguised.

229
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,080
<i>I saw Detective James Gordon
shooting Mayor Theo Galavan.</i>

230
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,120
<i>On the Southside Docks.</i>

231
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,440
<i>The Penguin was beating him
with a bat,</i>

232
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,880
<i>but it was Gordon
that pulled the trigger.</i>

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,400
Is that a bird?

234
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Run it back.

235
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,000
We gotta find somebody
to clean up the tape.

236
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,320
Isolate the sound.
Maybe do something to the voice.

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,640
I gotta get going.

238
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
Barnes is watching me like a hawk.

239
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,200
All right.

240
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
Hey.

241
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
You've done more
than any partner could ask.

242
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,200
From now on, stay away from me.
For your own sake.

243
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
If Loeb was behind this,

244
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,400
you don't wanna be mixed up in it.

245
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,600
What are you gonna do?

246
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
I still have some friends
I can ask for help.

247
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,280
Where you going?

248
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Jim.

249
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,800
Hi, Ed.

250
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
- Please. Please don't hurt me.
- Relax.

251
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,480
I'm not going to hurt you.

252
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,040
- I need your help.
- My help?

253
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,920
I didn't kill Pinkney.
You need to believe me.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,960
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

255
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
I need to find the man who framed me.

256
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,080
Whoever it was,
he covered his tracks well.

257
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,360
But I may have something.

258
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,240
A recording of his first call to I.A.

259
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
I.A. secretly records everyone
who calls in.

260
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
They do?

261
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,480
The sneaky little buggers.

262
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,320
And what did you hear?
If you don't mind me asking.

263
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Not much. He disguised his voice.

264
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,080
But there are other sounds
on the tape.

265
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,200
I figure you've worked with audio.

266
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,760
I was hoping you could help me.

267
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Jim.

268
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,800
My friend.

269
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,160
You've come to the right place.

270
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
Please have a sit.

271
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,720
I will get my stuff.

272
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,080
And make some tea.

273
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,080
Well, let's pray Helga hasn't
signed on anywhere new yet.

274
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,440
It's a family recipe.

275
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm sorry you don't like it.

276
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,360
I'm sure my cooking will improve
over time.

277
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
It's not that bad.

278
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,520
Tomorrow, you'll need
to go to the butcher.

279
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,000
I'd like a nice roast
for Sunday dinner.

280
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,480
Not your slut mother's goulash.

281
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,480
A nice roast. Yes, ma'am.

282
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,040
Oh, and clean up this mess
tonight.

283
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,760
I can't stand
the sight of dirty dishes.

284
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,560
Good shot, Charles.

285
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,200
I must get to these dishes.

286
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,440
But this has been delightful,
really.

287
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,040
Yes, it does sound like a bird.

288
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,040
And he's doing his best
to mask his voice.

289
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,200
It's too bad the quality's so poor.

290
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,520
Well, I'm afraid it's a dead end.

291
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
We should at least clean the tape.

292
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,960
Right.

293
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
We need some more tea.

294
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
So the person who killed Pinkney
and framed you

295
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,440
is the same person
that attacked the art museum

296
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,200
and planted the bomb
in the train station.

297
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,560
Amazing.

298
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,000
And you don't have any leads?

299
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,920
I think that Loeb was behind it.
Payback.

300
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,240
He still has lackeys in the G.C.P.D.

301
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,480
Is that so?

302
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,320
Everything points to a cop.

303
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Or someone who worked
with the police.

304
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,280
Had access.

305
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,520
You all right, Ed?

306
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,000
Right as rain. Just thinking.

307
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,760
Surely, you don't think
that Loeb killed Pinkney himself?

308
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
No.

309
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,320
He had some psychopath do it for him.

310
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,240
Psychopath seems a strong word.

311
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,320
He bludgeoned a man to death
with a crowbar in cold blood.

312
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,320
- He's sick.
- You say that, yet...

313
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,160
You've killed lots of people,
haven't you?

314
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,600
That was in the line of duty.

315
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,040
And a person who would kill
in cold blood is a psychopath.

316
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,200
See, I knew the rumors weren't true.

317
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,000
- What rumors?
- About you killing Galavan.

318
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
You would never do that.

319
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,200
That would make you like
the people that you're hunting.

320
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Sick.

321
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
Diseased.

322
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,400
Thar she blows.

323
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,080
Shut up, you're talking too much.

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Ed.

325
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,400
Did Penguin ever say anything
about that night?

326
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,160
Did Penguin ever tell you anything

327
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
about the night that Galavan died?

328
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,640
No. Remember, I nipped
that friendship in the bud.

329
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,600
And you didn't talk to him
in the G.C.P.D.

330
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,920
when Barnes brought him in?

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,560
Yes. No. I mean, just to say hi.

332
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, tape's finished.
I'm gonna give that a listen.

333
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,320
Let's both listen.

334
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,400
Swell idea.

335
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,600
<i>Internal Affairs.</i>

336
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,200
<i>I, I want to report a crime.</i>

337
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>I saw Detective James Gordon
shooting Mayor Theo Galavan.</i>

338
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,440
<i>On the Southside Docks.</i>

339
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
<i>The Penguin was beating him
with a bat,</i>

340
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,160
<i>but it was Gordon
that pulled the trigger.</i>

341
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,320
It's not a bird.

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,160
It was mechanical.

343
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,760
Without fingers, I point,

344
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,560
without arms, I strike,
without feet, I run.

345
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
What am I?

346
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,800
- You're a clock.
- Correct.

347
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,480
I know it was you, Ed.

348
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,920
- Me?
- You.

349
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,320
Guess what?

350
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
I knew that you knew that I knew.

351
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,440
That's why your chair is wired
to the mains.

352
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,680
Over the pavement and down the alley,

353
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,120
while this wind is cold.

354
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,000
It plays with my toes
and nips my nose,

355
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,920
as over the ground, we go.

356
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,080
I hope you like the outdoors,
Jimbo.

357
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,400
I know just the spot.

358
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Come out, come out wherever you are.

359
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,560
I bet you're wondering,

360
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,360
"Why would Ed do this to me?

361
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,080
Set me up.

362
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,320
Ruin my life."

363
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,680
I'll give you a hint, Jimbo.

364
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,720
K.K.

365
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,480
Kristin Kringle.

366
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,760
Rats.

367
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,040
Hey.

368
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,840
Have you seen my jacket?

369
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
It's freezing outside.

370
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,800
Sorry. I was fixing the sleeve.

371
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,440
- You'd ripped it.
- You know how to sew?

372
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,160
Alfred says it's an important skill
for young bachelors.

373
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Okay.

374
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

375
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,640
- What the...
- Detective Gordon.

376
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,440
Bruce? What are you doing here?

377
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,200
I could ask the same about you.

378
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,000
I found the man who framed me.

379
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
I need a pho.

380
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,080
Great. A dead cop in my crib now.

381
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,160
<i>Don't forget the cherries, Oswald.</i>

382
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,800
Right. Cherries, cherries,
cherries, cherries.

383
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>Oswald.</i>

384
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Oswald.

385
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
My drink?

386
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,040
- I'm sorry there's no cherries.
- No cherries?

387
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,800
The next time I ask for cherries,
there better be cherries.

388
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,080
Yes, Grace. Ma'am. Of course.

389
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
Mother said to remind you
of tomorrow's dinner.

390
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,440
- What's wrong with him?
- Who knows?

391
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,040
- Mother wants a roast.
- And make it good this time.

392
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Yes, I will.

393
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,520
- He's still sleeping.
- Nice thing for him.

394
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,920
Thank you for coming
when I called, Alfred.

395
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
Of course I came. Not a question.

396
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
You're looking thin.

397
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,320
- I'm getting plenty to eat.
- I very much doubt, Master Bruce.

398
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
There're things
that we must discuss.

399
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,000
- I'm not coming back.
- I understand.

400
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,280
- Not yet.
- And we need to talk.

401
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,800
Good morning.

402
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,600
Detective Gordon, should you be up?

403
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm fine. You stitched me up?

404
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,360
Actually, Master Bruce,

405
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,680
he called from Selina Kyle's
when you passed out,

406
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,040
so I thought I'd bring you here.
I saved a space for you.

407
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,800
Master Bruce,
I wanna leave you my coat

408
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,760
and get the detective his clothes
in the laundry room, please.

409
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
I'm glad you're okay.

410
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,280
So I've made breakfast. Take a seat.

411
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,960
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

412
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,280
There we go.

413
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,360
How long has Bruce been living
with Selina Kyle?

414
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,320
Ever since
the Matches Malone debacle.

415
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,280
Turns out
staring into the cold-dead eyes

416
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,640
of the man
that killed your parents,

417
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,920
doesn't bring
the right amount of closure.

418
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,480
Bruce never should've been
in that room.

419
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,960
- I should've gotten to Malone first.
- Yes. You should've done.

420
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,240
But you didn't, did you?

421
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,800
"You can't unfry an egg,"
as my dear old mum used to say.

422
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
So, why don't we leave
Master Bruce's situation alone

423
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,720
and why don't we discuss yours?

424
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
It's a long story.

425
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,680
Right, so you were framed
for the murder

426
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,560
of that other police officer.
You escaped from prison,

427
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,800
you then tracked down
the man who framed you

428
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
and you were promptly shot
in the leg.

429
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,720
Right, so answer me this, Detective.

430
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,360
Do you have any idea

431
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,720
how you're going to get out
of this awful pickle?

432
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Yes, I do.

433
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,960
Come, my dear. Your future awaits.

434
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,120
You're sure?

435
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,040
I run a hospital, not a prison.
You're sane.

436
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,040
It would be unethical and illegal
to keep you confined.

437
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,400
- What if I?
- Hush now.

438
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
Life is full of uncertainty.

439
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,320
And if something does happen,
we're always here.

440
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Off you go.

441
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,840
If you keep releasing lunatics
so liberally,

442
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
you're going to get a bad reputation.

443
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,960
I'm not looking
for a good reputation.

444
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,240
We're releasing Barbara Kean
into the wild

445
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,160
to observe her behavior.
She's a beautiful experiment.

446
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,760
You know what she's going to do,
don't you?

447
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,120
I don't, actually.

448
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,320
But I do know it will be interesting.

449
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,360
Nygma was right about one thing.

450
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,920
I can't just go to the cops.
They'll never believe me.

451
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,040
- I need hard proof.
- Cops, right?

452
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
Jerks.

453
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,760
Nygma said he met Penguin
for the first time in the woods.

454
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,680
It was right around the same time
his girlfriend went missing.

455
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
I think he was burying her.

456
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
Just like he was going to bury me.

457
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,000
Or he wanna find her body.

458
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,920
Tops the old
needle in a haystack, isn't it?

459
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,280
Nygma knows where she is.

460
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,560
What, you think he's gonna,
what, straight tell you?

461
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,080
That's exactly what he's going to do.
But I need help.

462
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,840
Whatever we can do.

463
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,400
Thanks, but I need someone
Barnes knows will betray me.

464
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,960
What?

465
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,560
Who do I talk to
about the reward for Jim Gordon?

466
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,960
Hey. Come here, come here.

467
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,040
- Come here.
- Let go of me.

468
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,320
- I'm here for my reward.
- I'll give you a reward.

469
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,840
Bullock!

470
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,800
- Have you seen Jim Gordon?
- Depends.

471
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,600
- There really a ten grand?
- Depends on your information.

472
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
He's at my place
a couple of hours ago.

473
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,960
- He'd been shot.
- Shot?

474
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,320
- Who shot him?
- Didn't say.

475
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,000
- He wasn't making a lot of sense.
- Is he still there now?

476
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,280
No. He took off. I don't know where.

477
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,920
But he was just looking for a place
to lie low for a while, I guess.

478
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,160
That's not worth 10,000 dollars.

479
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,120
Fine. Before he left,

480
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,760
he said he'd found out
where the Penguin was hiding

481
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,640
- and he's gonna go see him.
- Why would he go see The Penguin?

482
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,160
I don't know. Something about

483
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,680
"Penguin knows
where the body is buried."

484
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,480
- What bodies?
- I don't know.

485
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,280
- Where's The Penguin now?
- No one knows.

486
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,120
- You gonna pay me or what?
- Or what?

487
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,280
Relax, relax.

488
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,480
Maybe Gordon won't even find Penguin.

489
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
You idiot.

490
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,160
He's a detective.
He finds people for a living!

491
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,160
Penguin won't tell him.
He's my friend.

492
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Who am I kidding? You're stupid.
Stupid. Stupid!

493
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,000
Okay, okay.
Okay, calculate it, calculate.

494
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,800
Chances of Gordon finding Penguin?

495
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Let's say 80 percent.

496
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,680
Chances of Penguin telling Gordon?

497
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,120
Also 80 percent.

498
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,440
So that's a 60 percent chance
of Gordon finding Kristin.

499
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,480
That settles it.

500
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,480
Hello, Kristin.

501
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I know,
didn't expect to see me again.

502
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,680
But circumstances.

503
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,840
Now, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to move you.

504
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,840
Jim Gordon. So you did find Penguin.

505
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,360
- And that little bird sang.
- No, I just followed you.

506
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,680
You fed the information
to that little miscreant.

507
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,680
Assuming that I'd hear. Or no.

508
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,960
No, no, no.
Of course, you were in cahoots.

509
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,320
Of course, you're in cahoots.
Well, either way, bravo, Jim.

510
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,240
I'd clap,
but I have your gun in my hand.

511
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,760
How did this happen to you?

512
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,400
How did you become this?

513
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,880
You dummy.

514
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,080
This is who I am.

515
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,400
It was just finally admitting
the truth to myself.

516
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,400
Well, that
and murdering some people.

517
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,960
- I don't believe that.
- You don't believe it why Jim?

518
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,200
Because it would make you
incompetent

519
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,960
to know that I was right
under your nose the whole time?

520
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,320
Or you don't want to admit that
there's a monster in all of us?

521
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Because you, of all people,
should know that!

522
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Because that's what made it
so easy to frame you.

523
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,280
- I was your friend.
- Were you, Jim?

524
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,400
Were you my friend?

525
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,520
Or did you just pity me?
Oh, poor, weird little Ed

526
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,360
with his little silly wordplay
and his little riddles.

527
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,320
You're completely insane.

528
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah. It's probably easier
for you to think that.

529
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,880
How about one last riddle
for old time's sake?

530
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,120
A nightmare for some.

531
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,360
For others, a savior, I come.

532
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
My hands, cold and bleak...

533
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,880
it's the warm hearts they seek.

534
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,160
Death.

535
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Right again.

536
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,480
- Goodbye, Jim.
- Drop the gun!

537
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
Drop it!

538
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,760
Captain Barnes, I'm arresting Jim.

539
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,000
Stop it, Ed. We heard everything.

540
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,040
Now, drop the gun
and get on your knees!

541
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,200
No, this is... I... He's...

542
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,360
Last chance!

543
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,040
Oh, great.

544
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,120
How is it? Not too gamey?

545
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,280
Overcooked.

546
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,720
Try the other joint.

547
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,480
It is much more tender.

548
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
It's the same.

549
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,040
Still, beats my slut mother's
goulash, no?

550
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,080
Where are the children?
Ring the bell again.

551
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
I doubt they'll hear it.

552
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,560
You look different.

553
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,640
And you noticed.

554
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Yes.

555
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm doing my hair a different way.

556
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,320
Charles. Sasha. Where are they?

557
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
I found the sherry decanter, Grace.

558
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,120
The one with poison in it

559
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
that you used to killed my father.

560
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
What on Earth
are you talking about?

561
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,520
You should have thrown it away.

562
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,080
Guess you're a little too mean
to waste good poison?

563
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
- Don't go.
- Charles.

564
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,320
- Sasha, help.
- They won't come.

565
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,440
Where are they?

566
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,640
You thought they tasted the same.
But Sasha...

567
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,280
- No. No. No.
- "Definitely more tender.

568
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,600
- No.
- In my opinion."

569
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,400
No. No!

570
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,960
You said you were innocent.

571
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,120
And you were.

572
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm glad.

573
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,880
- I guess I owe you an apology.
- No.

574
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,200
You were doing your duty.
I can't fault you for that.

575
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,560
Yeah, well, I owe you one.

576
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah,
not necessarily but I'll take it.

577
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,000
Can you do me a favor?

578
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
And take it easy on Bullock.

579
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,440
Thanks.

580
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,680
So, when are you coming back to work?

581
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,440
I'm not coming back. Not yet anyhow.

582
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,680
No?

583
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,240
There's something I have to do first.

584
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,400
Lee Thompkins' number.

585
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,680
She's working for an
M.E. department down South.

586
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,480
I promised Bruce Wayne
I'd solve his parents' murder.

587
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
I have to do that first.

588
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Then I'm free.

589
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,560
The Wayne case is closed, Jim.
The perp is dead.

590
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,840
But who hired him? Why?
I need to find out.

591
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Sometimes we never find out.
It happens.

592
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,760
I need you
to give me the Wayne files.

593
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,720
You take this, and I'll give you
the Wayne files.

594
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,080
Call her.

595
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
I'll go get it.

596
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,360
It was nothing that you did
or didn't do, Alfred.

597
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,880
Why I went away.
I want you to know that.

598
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,000
I do.

599
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,520
Thank you very much.

600
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,880
I'll be going back to the city
as soon as Selina's ready.

601
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,200
She is taking a hot shower.

602
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,920
You didn't know
that Mr. Lucius Fox fixed

603
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,600
your old man's computer
a couple days ago, don't you?

604
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,760
And when were you going
to tell me, Alfred?

605
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,360
Well, I tried telling
you this morning.

606
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,880
I'm telling you again now, am I?

607
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,280
What are you doing?

608
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,720
She could walk in here, have a word.

609
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,400
- I trust her.
- It's not about trust, is it?

610
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,040
Whatever your father was doing,
he did it in secret for a reason.

611
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,440
To protect those he loved.

612
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,280
It quite doesn't matter
about my personal opinion

613
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,440
about that young girl,

614
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,560
but she has been
a bloody good friend to you,

615
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,760
and she's been loyal.
So, you know, you go ahead,

616
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,240
continue your father's work,
I can't stop you.

617
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,840
Man, I've tried, haven't I?
But I will not have you

618
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,640
put that little girl's life
in danger.

619
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,600
It's either the work or it's her.

620
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,760
You can't have both.
Do you understand?

621
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,520
Man, rich people
have great water pressure.

622
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,320
So, Jeeves,

623
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,040
any chance we can get a ride
back to the city?

624
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,200
Right. Well, I'll be in the...

625
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
I'll be in the kitchen, Master Bruce.

626
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,320
Miss.

627
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,320
What's with him?

628
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,560
Bruce, what's going on?

629
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,360
- I'm not going back.
- What?

630
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,920
I'm grateful for everything
that you taught me.

631
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
My place is here.

632
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,800
So, that's it?

633
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,600

and I'm street trash.

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,560
- Selina, it's not like that.
- Yeah, it is.

636

It is.

637
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
It's fine.

638
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,040
Have a great life, Bruce Wayne.
