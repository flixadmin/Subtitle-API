1
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,037
Man: We're going to braavos!

2
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,962
In the old times,
whenever braavos stood in danger,

3
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,507
the titan would step with fire in his eyes.

4
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,470
He'd Wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

5
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,639
He's just a statue.

6
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,856
Don't be afraid. He's
announcing our arrival.

7
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,069
I'm not afraid.

8
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,888
The house of black and white.

9
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,392
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

10
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,442
Here I leave you.

11
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,367
Thank you for bringing me.

12
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,995
Any man of braavos
would have done the same.

13
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,165
Valar morghulis.

14
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,500
Valar dohaeris.

15
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,412
Hello.

16
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,751
Valar morghulis.

17
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,097
Jaqen h'ghar gave me this.

18
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,019
No one here by that name.

19
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,896
Please.

20
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,942
I crossed the narrow sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

21
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,944
You have everywhere else to go.

22
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,737
But wait...

23
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,551
Cersei.

24
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,928
Walder frey.

25
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,514
The mountain.

26
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,183
Meryn trant.

27
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,436
Cersei.

28
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,314
Walder frey.

29
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,234
The mountain.

30
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,529
Meryn trant.

31
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,490
Cersei. Walder frey.

32
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,117
The mountain.

33
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,494
Meryn trant.

34
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,664
Cersei.

35
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,374
Walder frey.

36
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,167
The mountain.

37
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,878
Meryn trant.

38
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,171
Cersei.

39
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,799
Walder frey.

40
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,844
The mountain.

41
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,930
Meryn trant.

42
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,505
Must be good food if it's crowded.

43
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,303
Ale?

44
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,312
Ale?

45
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,989
Before we left,
a maester gave you a raven scroll.

46
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,203
You are becoming an observant young lady.

47
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,997
My mother used to say,
"dark wings, dark words."

48
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,501
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

49
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,504
Excuse me.

50
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,880
Sansa: So, it was good news?

51
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,675
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

52
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,636
I thought you still mourned
the death of my beloved aunt lysa.

53
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,804
Ale?

54
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,514
Sansa: I'll have some.

55
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,852
My lady.

56
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,354
What is it?

57
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,717
Podrick: Sansa stark. Don't look.

58
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,567
You sure?

59
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,152
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

60
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,696
She's sitting with petyr baelish.

61
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,030
Littlefinger?

62
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,657
A bunch of knights with him.

63
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,617
A bunch? What's a bunch, podrick? Six? 20?

64
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,953
Ten, I think. Too many.

65
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,514
My lady, I don't think this is the right...

66
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,374
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

67
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,251
Find more.

68
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,842
Littlefinger: Do you like the taste?

69
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,927
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

70
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,055
Why do men love it so much?

71
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,141
It gives some men courage.

72
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,518
Does it give you courage?

73
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,188
Guard: That's far enough.

74
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,068
Lord baelish, lady sansa.

75
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,404
My name is brienne of tarth.

76
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,698
We've met with renly Baratheon.

77
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,993
What did he say about you?

78
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,037
He said

79
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,873
your onalty came free of charge.

80
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,793
Someone appears to have
paid quite a bit for it since then.

81
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,142
Lady sansa,

82
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,103
before your mother's death,

83
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,731
I was her sworn sword.

84
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,734
I gave my word
I would find you and protect you.

85
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,987
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

86
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,740
and give my life for yours if need be.

87
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,951
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

88
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,038
Please, lady brienne,

89
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,415
no need for such formality.

90
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,584
You were catelyn stark's sworn sword?

91
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,753
- I was.
- Strange.

92
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,397
I knew cat from the time we were children.

93
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,173
She never mentioned you.

94
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,175
It was after renly's murder.

95
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,301
Ah. Yes.

96
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,136
You were accused of killing him.

97
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,764
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

98
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,933
By men who didn't see what happened.

99
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,476
And what did happen?

100
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,274
He was murdered by a shadow.

101
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,985
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

102
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,154
A shadow?

103
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,825
With the face...

104
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,204
Littlefinger: This woman
swore to protect renly.

105
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,622
She failed.

106
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,875
She swore to protect
your mother. She failed.

107
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,045
Why would I want somebody
with your history of failure

108
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,130
guarding lady sansa?

109
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,340
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

110
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,800
Because I am her uncle.

111
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,345
I married her aunt lysa
shortly before my beloved's untimely death.

112
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,431
We're family now, and you are an outsider.

113
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,558
Forgive me, lady brienne,

114
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,144
but experience has made me
wary of outsiders.

115
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,313
Lady sansa, if we can have a word alone...

116
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,608
Please, my lady. If I could explain...

117
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,194
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding
bowing to the king.

118
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,864
Neither of us wanted to be there.

119
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,491
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

120
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,493
And sometimes we do.

121
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,580
You should leave.

122
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,542
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

123
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,586
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

124
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,837
Why don't you stay?

125
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,056
The man asked you to stay...

126
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,353
Hyahl hyahl

127
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,279
Hyahl hyahl

128
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,906
guard: After her!

129
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,202
Brienne1yah! Hah! Podrick: Oh!

130
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,065
Podrick: Stop!
Guard 1: Pm take him!

131
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,235
Podrick!

132
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,695
Guard 2: Hold on to her!

133
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,659
Take her!

134
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,676
Guard 3: Keep moving!

135
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,565
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

136
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,073
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

137
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,035
No, no, no, stop!

138
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,181
I guess that means you're unarmed.

139
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,278
Brienne: Down, podrick! Down!

140
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,747
Podrick.

141
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,915
Yes, my lady?

142
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,168
You can stand now.

143
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,252
Yes, my lady.

144
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,592
Sansa stark?

145
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,511
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

146
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,972
I saw her riding on the east road
with littlefinger.

147
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,098
We'll follow them.

148
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,728
My lady,
if both stark girls refused your service,

149
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,313
maybe you're released from your vow.

150
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,690
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

151
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:18,834
But if they don't want your protection...

152
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,027
Do you think she's safe with littlefinger?

153
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,323
No, my lady.

154
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,116
Get your horse.

155
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,461
A summons from the queen.

156
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,773
Cersei: There are only
two like it in the world.

157
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,193
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to myrcella.

158
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,987
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

159
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:11,244
Our daughter's alone in dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

160
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,496
"It's a threat."

161
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,082
No note?

162
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,210
They blame us for the death
of oberyn and his sister

163
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,422
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

164
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,007
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

165
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,884
- Softer.
- What?

166
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:27,969
Not so loud.

167
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,888
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

168
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,224
The world can't know she's our daughter.

169
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,936
Then don't call her your daughter.

170
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,521
You've never been a father to her.

171
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,166
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

172
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,192
And what has your caution brought?

173
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,738
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

174
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,199
Our only daughter shipped off to dorne.

175
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,746
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from highgarden.

176
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,983
I'm going to make things better.

177
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,467
You've never made anything better.

178
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,053
I'm going to dome
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

179
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,975
You can't just ask prince doran
to give her back.

180
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,393
She's promised to his son.

181
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,396
I'm not going to ask him anything.

182
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

183
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,275
No army.

184
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,878
Do you know where they're keeping her?

185
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,408
- Oberyn mentioned the water gardens.
- I'll find her.

186
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,914
Is there anything else, your grace?

187
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,793
You're going to dorne?

188
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,340
A one-handed man, alone.

189
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,593
I never said I was going alone.

190
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,354
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

191
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,606
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

192
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,360
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

193
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,487
We can have a harp if
you like, but no flutes.

194
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,864
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

195
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,534
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

196
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,786
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

197
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
Don't they?

198
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,333
Don't who?

199
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,378
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

200
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,507
They certainly do, my dear.

201
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,135
It's a fine place, isn't it?

202
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,637
A fine place.

203
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,267
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

204
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,977
You won't.

205
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,020
Pardon?

206
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,064
We won't get to live at stokeworth.

207
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,442
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

208
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,902
She hates me.

209
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,321
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

210
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,283
she pulls my hair when
mother's not looking.

211
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,828
You know what I think?

212
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,038
I think you're a good person.

213
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,124
And your sister is a mean person.

214
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,667
She is.

215
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,588
I've been all over the world,

216
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,715
and if there's one thing I've learned,

217
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,967
it's that meanness comes around.

218
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,803
People like your sister,

219
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,348
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

220
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,392
One way or another.

221
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,188
Who's that?

222
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,152
Jaime fucking Lannister.

223
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,781
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser bronn of the Blackwater.

224
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,493
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

225
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,995
Thank you.

226
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,123
This is my betrothed, lollys.

227
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,876
A pleasure.

228
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,380
Run along, love.

229
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,805
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

230
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,069
When were you planning on getting married?

231
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,393
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

232
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,978
What you're here for.

233
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,982
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

234
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,067
It's very good for you.

235
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,248
- Lollys will be marrying ser Willis bracken.
- Mmm.

236
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,627
We made a deal, your sister and I.

237
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,446
I would have advised against that.

238
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,755
How is this good for me?

239
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,966
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

240
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,468
And when we return,

241
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,097
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

242
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,268
Return from where?

243
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,562
As far south as south goes.

244
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,953
Trystane: My future queen.

245
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,714
You are beautiful.

246
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,766
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

247
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,687
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

248
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,313
Doran: Captain.

249
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,984
Let her pass.

250
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,781
Your brother was murdered,

251
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:45,327
and you sit here in the water gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

252
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,582
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

253
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

254
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,004
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

255
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,065
What will you do about his death?

256
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,592
I will Bury him. I will mourn for him.

257
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,718
And then?

258
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,261
You would have me go to war?

259
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,780
The whole country would have you go to war.

260
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,640
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

261
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,895
The sand snakes are with me.

262
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,646
They have the love of their people.

263
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,444
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

264
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,699
Oberyn is dead,

265
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,578
and this Lannister girl
skips about the water gardens,

266
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,457
eating our food, breathing our air.

267
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,627
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

268
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,755
Let me have her.

269
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,302
Let me send her to
Cersei one finger at a time.

270
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,139
I loved my brother.

271
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,391
And you made him very happy.

272
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,603
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

273
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,066
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

274
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,443
Not here.

275
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,153
Not while I rule.

276
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,657
And how long will that be?

277
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,925
Daario: The unsullied are too conspicuous.

278
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,262
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

279
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,305
Of course you haven't found
any sons of the harpy.

280
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,766
You haven't, have you?

281
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,521
My second sons, on the other hand,

282
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,315
they drink, whore,

283
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,192
fight in the streets,

284
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,694
they blend in.

285
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,154
They overhear things in taverns,

286
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,908
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

287
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,035
break a few fingers,

288
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,829
overhear a few more things.

289
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,124
Before you know it...

290
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,603
No one here.

291
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,272
We go.

292
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,108
In a hurry? You're afraid?

293
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,152
Unsullied fear nothing.

294
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,696
Right.

295
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,114
That's your problem.

296
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,160
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

297
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,537
Someone who's forgotten fear

298
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,582
has forgotten how to hide.

299
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,885
Fear is useful that way.

300
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,329
Sons of the harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

301
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,083
On all of our necks.
Please, your grace, you must kill him.

302
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,459
It would send a message.

303
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,170
I think you should exercise restraint,
your grace.

304
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,149
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

305
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,051
The son of the harpy
has no more valuable information.

306
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,427
How do you know that?

307
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,429
Because I questioned him.

308
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,116
Hizdahr: And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

309
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,141
He is born free.

310
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,536
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

311
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,996
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

312
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,915
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

313
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,940
They pay him.

314
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,109
Great families afraid to do a thing.

315
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,962
They pay poor men to do it for them.

316
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,880
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

317
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,948
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

318
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,367
Barristan: We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

319
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,996
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

320
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,289
Show all the citizens of meereen

321
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,750
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

322
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,918
Teach them a better way.

323
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,421
I do not know the place
from where old ser comes.

324
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,924
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

325
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,010
But here in meereen,

326
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,013
before Daenerys stormborn, they own us.

327
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,390
So we learn much about them,

328
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,600
or we do not live long.

329
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,811
They teach me what they are.

330
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:25,107
Mercy, fair trial, these
mean nothing to them.

331
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,443
All they understand is blood.

332
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,742
Daenerys: Thank you all for your counsel.

333
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,711
Your grace, a word, please, I beg you.

334
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,464
- About what?
- About your father.

335
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,507
- About the mad king.
- The mad king?

336
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,318
You're here to remind
me of my enemies' lies?

337
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,469
Consider me reminded.

338
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,429
Your grace,

339
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,015
I served in his kingsguard.

340
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,600
I was at his side from the first.

341
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,102
Your enemies did not lie.

342
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,230
Go on.

343
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,818
When the people Rose in revolt against him,

344
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,405
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

345
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,784
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

346
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,203
He burned men alive with wildfire

347
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,996
and laughed as they screamed.

348
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,626
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

349
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:30,047
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

350
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,674
I'm not my father.

351
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,511
No, your grace. Thank the gods.

352
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:40,516
But the mad king gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

353
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,394
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

354
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,022
Until the very end.

355
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,864
I will not have the son of the harpy
executed without a fair trial.

356
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,495
Your grace.

357
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,047
There's a bug.

358
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,590
Yes, best be careful.

359
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,468
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

360
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:21,348
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

361
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,770
Besides,

362
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,482
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

363
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,608
You don't like it?

364
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,735
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

365
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,447
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

366
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,491
She ought to offer her cunt.

367
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,743
Best part of her for the best part of me.

368
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,498
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

369
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,209
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to volantis

370
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,295
talking about the futility of everything?

371
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,546
You're right. No point.

372
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,465
The road to volantis?

373
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,510
You said we were going to meereen.
What's in volantis?

374
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,012
The road to meereen.

375
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,557
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to meereen?

376
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,851
I told you. A ruler.

377
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,186
We've already got a ruler.

378
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,731
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

379
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:15,110
Every pile of shit on the side of every
road has someone's banner hanging from it.

380
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,448
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

381
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,491
During your brief tenure as hand.

382
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,077
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

383
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,538
Still, a man of talent.

384
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,081
Managed to kill a lot of people.

385
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,127
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

386
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,383
She wanted me to leave king's landing.

387
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,594
She begged me.

388
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,845
I wouldn't go.

389
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,057
'Cause I liked it.

390
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,726
Power.

391
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,895
Even as a servant.

392
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,022
People follow leaders.

393
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,526
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

394
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,903
I find us repulsive.

395
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,905
And we find them repulsive,

396
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,283
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

397
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,493
to keep them away.

398
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,496
And yet,

399
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,748
no matter what we do,

400
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,253
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

401
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,921
Not for long.

402
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,924
You're right.

403
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,301
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

404
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,596
How many dwarves are there in the world?

405
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,349
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

406
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,854
Not him.

407
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,856
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

408
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,609
Shall I throw them in a cell, your grace?

409
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,093
That won't be necessary, ser meryn.

410
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,197
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

411
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,782
Mistakes will be made.

412
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,677
- Thank you, your grace.
- Thank you, your grace.

413
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,327
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, your grace.

414
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,413
I would take it, if you don't mind.

415
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,707
It could prove useful for my work.

416
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,750
Very good.

417
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,256
Over there will be fine.

418
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,551
You heard the man. Over there.

419
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,705
You're the hand of the king?

420
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,290
No, unde.

421
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,044
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

422
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,171
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

423
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,839
and chooses a hand for himself.

424
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,343
Your grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

425
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,595
as the king's hand
until he becomes old enough...

426
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,138
You're a good man, lord Tyrell,

427
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,861
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

428
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,517
In addition to being master of ships,

429
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,312
the king has appointed you master of coin.

430
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,939
Oh, your grace.

431
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,443
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

432
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:06,198
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

433
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,283
The honor is all mine, your grace.

434
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,620
Your grace, in the past
on several occasions,

435
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,247
a grand maester has served
as the king's hand.

436
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:18,126
The king has named beurn
the new master of whisperers.

437
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,715
Your grace, him? This man?

438
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,010
This embarrassment to the citadel?

439
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:32,099
Your grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

440
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,267
The qualification of
loyalty, grand maester.

441
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,895
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

442
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,481
Far more than many ever have.

443
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,317
I must say, I cannot see...

444
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,738
Uncle kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

445
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,325
it would please the king
if you would serve as his master of war.

446
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,578
No man living better deserves the title.

447
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,831
That is kind of you to say.

448
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,208
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

449
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,644
The king is very busy at this moment.

450
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,087
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

451
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,588
He is learning.

452
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,343
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

453
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,139
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

454
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,267
And to you. And to serve the king.

455
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,228
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

456
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,649
To watch you stack the small council
with sycophants.

457
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,919
Sending your own brother away
so he wouldn't be...

458
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,611
My brother has left the capital to

459
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,905
lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

460
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:29,990
What mission?

461
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,826
That is not your concern as master of war.

462
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:39,541
I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

463
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,170
You are the queen mother, nothing more.

464
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,593
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

465
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,971
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

466
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,056
At casterly rock.

467
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,108
Shireen: Come on, you know this one.

468
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,528
It looks like an animal.

469
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,033
Snake.

470
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,202
Snake.s.

471
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,913
- It's an s.
- Right, very good.

472
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,039
Huh!

473
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,043
Did you know that the youngest
lord commander in history, osric stark,

474
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,669
was elected at the age of 10?

475
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,590
I know s.

476
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,300
You'll learn, I promise.

477
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,470
I taught ser davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

478
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,680
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

479
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,391
Very patient.

480
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,269
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

481
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,622
the faster you'll be able to read.

482
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,440
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

483
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:50,487
I'm sure you and ostrich stark
have a lot to talk about.

484
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,242
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

485
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,785
- Three.
- Three?

486
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,286
Who taught you, your mother?

487
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,123
No, old maester cressen did.

488
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,667
I had a lot of time to practice.

489
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,919
My mother kept me inside because...

490
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:12,384
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

491
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,386
Greyscale.

492
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,263
What do you call it north of the wall?

493
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,765
I don't know.

494
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,892
But two of my sisters had it.

495
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,727
They both died.

496
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,979
How did they cure you?

497
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,065
I don't remember. I was a baby.

498
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,234
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

499
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,486
Whatever they did, it went away.

500
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,990
What happened to your sisters?

501
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:42,163
My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

502
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,457
None of us were allowed to go near them.

503
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,003
But we heard them, especially at night.

504
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,716
They started to sound not like themselves.

505
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,218
Did you ever see them?

506
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,722
Only once at the end.

507
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,516
They were covered with it.

508
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,021
Their faces, their arms.

509
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,814
They acted like animals.

510
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,527
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

511
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,988
What did he do with them in the woods?

512
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,871
- Mother.
- Leave us.

513
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,792
Your grace.

514
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,296
You need to stay away from that girl.

515
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,714
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

516
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,967
Her name is gilly. She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

517
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,346
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

518
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,182
He executed their king for treason.

519
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,101
They could strike at
him by striking at you.

520
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,062
Gilly wouldn't do that.

521
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,857
You have no idea what people will do.

522
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,902
All your books and you still don't know.

523
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,702
Stannis: I ordered mance rayder
burned at the stake.

524
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,038
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

525
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,457
You showed mercy to mance rayder.

526
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,126
A king's word is law.

527
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,130
Perhaps you should ask ser davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

528
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,886
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

529
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,888
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

530
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,807
With respect, your grace,

531
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,352
the free folk will never follow you
no matter what you do.

532
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,406
You're the man who burned their king alive.

533
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,690
Who, then?

534
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,275
You?

535
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,947
Only one of their own.

536
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,283
Do you know this wretched girl,

537
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,369
lyanna mormont?

538
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,371
The lord commander's niece.

539
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,874
Lady of bear island and a child of 10.

540
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,504
I asked her to commit her house
to my cause. That's her response.

541
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,590
Jon: "Bear island knows no king
but the king in the north,

542
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,884
"whose name is stark."

543
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,678
That amuses you?

544
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,640
I apologize, your grace.

545
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:10,812
Northerners can be
a bit like the free folk.

546
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,647
Loyal to their own.

547
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,857
Stannis: I know.

548
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,361
My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly
about how difficult it was to control them.

549
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,699
Even with your father's help.

550
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,414
Tonight, the night's watch
elects a new lord commander.

551
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,207
Ser alliser Thorne is going to win.

552
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,793
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

553
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,421
He thinks you're a traitor.

554
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,424
What's your life going to be like here
at the wall with Thorne in command?

555
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,884
Unpleasant, I expect.

556
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,011
Your bravery made him look weak.

557
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,847
He'll punish you for it.

558
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,640
I don't punish men for bravery.

559
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,642
I reward them.

560
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,853
I don't doubt it, your grace.

561
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,773
But I'm a brother of the night's watch.

562
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,941
I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

563
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,330
I don't know what I have left to give you.

564
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,821
You can give me the north.

565
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,365
I can't.

566
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,037
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard, a snow.

567
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,332
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

568
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,502
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon stark,

569
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,420
lord of winterfell.

570
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,470
He'll make you a stark
with the stroke of a pen?

571
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,139
It's the first thing I
ever remember wanting.

572
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,893
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

573
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,230
and just like that, I would never be
the bastard of winterfell again.

574
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,607
You deserve this. You do.

575
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,318
I couldn't be happier for you.

576
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,612
I'm going to refuse him.

577
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,076
But you'd be lord of winterfell.

578
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,495
I swore a vow to the night's watch.

579
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,290
If I don't take my own word seriously,
what sort of lord of winterfell would I be?

580
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,799
Alliser: Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

581
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:14,269
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

582
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,188
before we cast our tokens

583
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:22,986
for the 998th lord commander
of the night's watch?

584
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,825
Seralliser Thorne is not just a knight,
he's a man of true nobility.

585
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,370
He was acting commander
when the wall came under attack

586
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,213
and led us to victory
against the wildlings.

587
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,349
Black brothers: Hear, hear.

588
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,725
Janos: He's a veteran of 100 battles

589
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,961
and has been a defender of the watch
and the wall almost all of his life.

590
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,462
Black brother: Aye.

591
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,131
He's the only true choice.

592
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,358
Black brother: Yes!

593
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,221
Ser denys mallisterjoined
the watch as a boy

594
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,683
and has served loyally,
longer than any other ranger.

595
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,436
Through 10 winters he served.

596
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,981
As commander of the shadow tower,
he kept the wildlings away.

597
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,733
We could do no better.

598
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,824
Aemon: If there is no one else,
we will begin the voting.

599
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:15,330
The triangular tokens
count for ser alliser Thorne.

600
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,334
The square tokens for ser denys mallister.

601
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,229
- Each brother will...
- Maester aemon.

602
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,840
Aemon: Samwell tarly. Go on.

603
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,636
Janos: Sam the slayer.

604
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,431
Another wildling lover
just like his friend Jon snow.

605
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,142
How's your lady love, slayer?

606
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,186
Her name is gilly.

607
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,146
Brother slynt knows her quite well.

608
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,483
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the wall.

609
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,610
Lies!

610
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,864
A wildling girl, a baby, and lord janos.

611
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,035
I found him there after the battle was over
in a puddle of his own making.

612
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:03,586
Whilst lord janos was hiding
with the women and children,

613
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,712
Jon snow was leading.

614
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,341
Ser alliser fought bravely, it is true.

615
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,177
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

616
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,890
He took charge of the wall's defense.
He killed the magnar of the thenns.

617
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,184
He went north to deal with mance rayder

618
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,229
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

619
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,109
Before that,

620
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,655
he led the mission to
avenge lord commander mormont.

621
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,034
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

622
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,663
He saw something in Jon
and now we've all seen it, too.

623
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,082
He may be young,

624
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,294
but he's the commander we turned to
when the night was darkest.

625
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,639
I can't argue with any of that.

626
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,101
But who does Jon snow want to command?

627
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,186
Night's watch,

628
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,273
or the wildlings?

629
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:09,318
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl,

630
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,320
he spoke with mance rayder many times.

631
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:15,158
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

632
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,326
if Stannis' army hadn't come along?

633
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,956
We all saw him put the king-beyond-the-wall
out of his misery.

634
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,960
Do you want to choose a man
who has fought the wildlings all his life,

635
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,212
or a man who makes love to them?

636
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,805
It is time.

637
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,772
It appears to be a tie, maester.

638
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:51,587
Jon snow!
Jon snow! Jon snow! Jon snow!

639
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,787
You. You.

640
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,749
What have you got there?

641
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,089
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

642
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,094
Turn around and go.

643
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,013
That's a nice little sword.

644
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,348
Worth 100 pigeons, a sword like that.

645
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,644
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

646
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,442
Thug: Come on. Quickly, go! Go!

647
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,207
Who are you?

648
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,292
Why were they scared of you?

649
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,461
You lost this.

650
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,641
You said there was no jaqen h'ghar here.

651
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,476
There isn't.

652
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,811
A man is not jaqen h'ghar.

653
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,982
Arya: Well, who are you, then?

654
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,568
No one.

655
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,488
And that is who a girl must become.

656
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,913
She doesn't belong here.

657
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,709
And no matter how many of you traitors
call her "mhysa",

658
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,295
she will never be your mother.

659
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,185
Daenerys: Why?

660
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,522
For you, mhysa.

661
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,776
You wanted the harpy dead,

662
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,071
but your hands were tied.

663
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,241
I set you free, as you did all of us.

664
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,411
He was our prisoner, awaiting trial.

665
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,246
You had no right.

666
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,417
He would rather rip your city apart
than see slaves lifted from the dirt.

667
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,128
There are no more slaves.

668
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,756
There are no more masters.

669
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,091
Then who lives in the pyramids?

670
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,763
Who wears gold masks
and murders your children?

671
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,643
When grey worm came to us,

672
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,396
I was the first to take
up the knife for you.

673
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,151
I remember the look on my father's face
as I struck down his master,

674
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,364
who had traded his infant son for a dog.

675
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,661
My father died in the fighting.

676
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,917
If we allow the sons of the harpy
to return us to chains,

677
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,713
he never lived.

678
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,637
The harpy's life was not yours to take.

679
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,766
Once, the masters were the law-

680
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,226
and now you are the law.

681
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,144
The law is the law.

682
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,609
Take him.

683
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:36,622
Crowd: Mhysa! Mhysa!

684
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,500
Mhysa! Mhysa!

685
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,187
Mhysa! Mhysa!

686
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,982
Mhysa!

687
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,757
She should have cut off the traitor's head
in the great pyramid and been done with it.

688
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,904
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

689
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,202
Crowd: Mhysa! Mhysa!

690
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,372
You opened your gates to me

691
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,085
because I promised you freedom and justice.

692
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,468
One cannot exist without the other.

693
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:48,569
-Brother! Brother!

694
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,869
Mhysa, please!

695
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:58,579
Forgive me.

696
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:07,254
A citizen of meereen was awaiting
trial and this man murdered him.

697
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,257
The punishment is death.

698
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:17,056
-Mercy, mercy

699
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:34,782
Mhysa.

700
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,027
Mhysa!

701
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,344
I'll stand guard outside your door tonight,
