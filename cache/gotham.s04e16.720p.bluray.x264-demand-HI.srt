You know what I was thinking
when I jumped in that car

631
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,393
and I was flicking
through those channels?

632
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,072
I was thinking,
"I can do this crazy thing

"'cause if it goes sideways,
Jim Gordon will save me."

it's like it's a lie now, Harvey.

Feet of clay are heavy to carry around.

I judged you. For a long time.

640
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,812
I shouldn't have done that.

641
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:55,151
What you know about me, Jim,
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,572
There are no heroes here.

- I saw Jerome Valeska tonight.

649
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,931
- He killed his uncle.
- What?

650
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,353
<i>He was looking for the name
of a school, St. Ignatius.</i>

651
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,067
- Why?
- I'm on my way to find out.

<i>No, wherever you are, stay put.</i>

Valeska is my problem
as much as anyone's.

<i>- I'm going after him.</i>
- Damn it, Bruce.

Stay the hell away from that madman.

656
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,243
I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.
