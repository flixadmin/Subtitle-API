1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,600
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,480
Fascists. Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,000
The ones in tuxedos.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,320
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,920
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licenses.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
And unofficially
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,920
I can undermine them.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
Still looking for trouble big enough
to kill you. If you don't want

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,680
to help me carry the bucket,
then I wouldn't blame you.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,640
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,200
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,560
You're a brave man.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,360
Every war hero I ever met,

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,000
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,920
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby... It will be you.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,960
You need to see a doctor.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,480
We've got to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,280
SHE COUGHS
Hello?

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
Tommy, she has a temperature of 101
and nothing is working.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,920
Just get here now.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,760
This programme contains
strong language from the start.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,800
BREATHING DEEPLY

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,320
Out of the way! Out of the way!

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
No...no. Where's the doctor?
Can you get the doctor?

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,040
I need to speak a doctor. Mr Shelby.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,680
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,720
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,080
There are procedures
that must be followed.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Please, hand over the child. OK.
Lizzie?

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,400
It's going to be all right.

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,120
Right, you take her. You be gentle.

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,680
Look after her.

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,480
That's my daughter, you hear me?

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,040
I need to be with her.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,240
I need to be with my daughter!

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,480
Tom.

41
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,080
OK. Come on. They are X-raying Ruby,
they have to X-ray us

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,640
because we might have it as well.
Fuck us, Lizzie.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,920
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
Who brought this on?

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,800
We brought on this curse.

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,800
Stop, Tommy.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,280
Fucking stop!

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
They wouldn't let me pass.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
They wouldn't let me pass.

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,600
They did it on purpose,
to punish me.

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,880
Tommy, stop it, please.

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,840
All right.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,600
HE EXHALES SHARPLY
All right.

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,480
My husband is very sorry.

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,960
OK.

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,840
My husband is very sorry
and he is calm now.

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,880
He is recovering from addiction.
Sometimes...

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,000
Sometimes...

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,720
..he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,960
It's just the crate I'm kicking.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,000
Lizzie. Yeah?

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
Tell me what I have to do.

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,880
This way, sir. Sorry.

65
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,200
Thank you.

DEVICE WHIRS

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,480
Mr Shelby, you will need to
keep still for a moment.

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,640
DOOR SHUTS

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,720
To see what's inside.

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,080
Wait till you see.

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,480
God.

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
God knows what's inside.

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,160
God help her.

74
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,600
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

75
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,320
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,320
They've caught it quite early.

77
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
They'll do more tests.

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,560
They do this thing,
pulmonary something,

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,360
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,120
Sometimes the lung cures itself.

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,400
And if that doesn't work,
they use gold.

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,520
What?

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
Gold? Gold salts.

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,240
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,040
when you cut the ribbon to open
the institution.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,320
I can't remember,
I wasn't listening.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,280
Yeah, well.

88
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,280
Gold salts.

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,640
Salt with 37% gold.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Did they say what...?

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,360
Did they say what the chances are?

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,840
No. They don't say. Hm.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
But she's small.

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,760
And with TB that's not good
because the disease is big and fast.

96
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,800
SHE SOBS

97
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,240
SOBBING CONTINUES

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,280
I'm so sorry, my darling.

99
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
But I will deal with it.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
I will make it go away.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
I will strike a bargain.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
DOOR OPENS

103
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,160
You should be wearing a mask.

104
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
I am.

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,080
You can try gold,
I will try something else.

Ada. Listen to me.

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,040
I need you to be me in London.

110
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
No, it's important.

111
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,960
I know you want nothing to do
with my business,

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,440
but Ruby is very sick.

113
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
I need five days of your time.

So she dresses well.

117
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,960
Go to the door and take her coat.
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,360
Uh...and make a note of the label.

119
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
Of course, ma'am.

120

Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

126
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,440
I thought you were all called
Shelby. Ah, I'm a widow.

127
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,160
My husband didn't have the
good grace to die. He lingers yet.

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,320
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

129
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,560
They do a lot of good work on behalf
of the poor.

130
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
The poor who are only poor because

131
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,400
they spent so much of their income
on Guinness. Please.

132
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
I think the causes of poverty are
a little more complex than that.

133
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
Yes. I believe it is to do
with genetics.

134
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,480
Huh. Beautiful vase.

135
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,400
My grandfather stole it from
a brothel in Cairo.

136
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Egyptian. The 18th Dynasty, I think.

137
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,960
How do you know so much about
Egyptian vases?

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I collect antiques. Hm.

139
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,240
A tribe of Gypsies settles on
a clearing in a factory town.

140
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,000
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

141
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,080
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

142
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,800
the other a collector of antiques.

143
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,520
It is quite extraordinary.

144
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
A result of genetics, I think.

145
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,920
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,680
If this was 1919, you would have
come through my front door carrying

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
a revolver and a Molotov cocktail

148
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
and would happily have blown off
my head.

149
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,200
Hm, isn't it wonderful how time
changes everything?

150
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,080
Where is the American?
He'll be here later.

151
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,920
Where is Mosley? He heard Thomas
wasn't coming so he decided to sulk.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,160
You know how men are.
Where is Thomas?

153
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
His daughter is sick.

154
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,280
Does he not employ a Governess?

155
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,400
It's a class thing, a genetic thing.

156
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,920
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Even the business of changing
the world.

158
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,000
I thought today was purely social.

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,160
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

160
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,920
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

161
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,960
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

162
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,640
The men here just bounce up and down
in their saddles in a rising trot,

163
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
never even galloping.

164
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

165
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
That's why I put it out for you
to look at.

166
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,400
According to recent interpretations,

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,680
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

168
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,280
approaching death.

169
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,640
So, yes, I suppose it resembles
Thomas.

170
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,680
Tell me, why is he so emotionally
mutilated?

171
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,160
Oh. Because he is a character in
a novel, of course.

172
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,240
One of those novels ladies like you
like to read. All about wild men.

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,760
Oh, I don't read novels,

174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,080
I read only pornography
and politics.

175
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,400
In the absence of the men, shouldn't
we ladies be engaging in small talk?

176
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Very well. Small talk.

177
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,400
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men.

178
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,400
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

179
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,920
Mm, Tommy was right.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,480
He says that everything is a circle.

181
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,040
A lady in Eaton Square, as coarse
and honest as an Aston whore.

182
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,080
I just realised I haven't even
offered you a drink.

183
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,360
BOTTLE CLINKS

184
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,320
Ada. Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,880
I want you to know something.

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,400
When the time comes for
the great cleansing,

187
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,720
I myself will personally argue
the case that

188
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,400
the Jews must be dealt with, but
that the Gypsies should be spared.

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,880
Huh.

190
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,560
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

191
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,600
Huh.

192
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,720
DISTANT DOGS BARK

193
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Who the fuck are you?

194
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,800
I am the owner of this Colt pistol
and the bullets within it.

195
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,360
And I am in a hurry.

196
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,000
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

197
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm looking for Esme Shelby-Lee.

198
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,480
Never heard of her.

199
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,760
TRANSLATION:

200
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,840
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty Didicoi.

201
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,880
He was a Peaky Blinder. Yeah?

202
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,360
Well, I'm the elder and more
terrible.

203
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

204
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Where is she?

205
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,760
WIND WHISTLES

206
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Put your gun away, Thomas,
there's children around.

207
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,960
You only found me
cos I let you find me.

208
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,240
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

209
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,880
If any of these men is your man,
please tell him I want no trouble.

210
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,160
I don't have a man.

211
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,960
What use is a man?

212
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
A horse pulls the wagon.
A dog keeps me safe.

213
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,080
A cat keeps me warm at night.

214
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,520
And if anybody's going to give you
trouble, Tommy Shelby. It'll be me.

215
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
What do you want?

216
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,520
Tell them to leave.

217
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,880
What, you think I'm in charge here?

218
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,360
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

219
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,280
TRANSLATION:

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
Didicoi's too grand to put his arse
on the grass these days?

221
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,800
I have a daughter, Esme.

222
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,680
Her name is Ruby.

223
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,640
She's fallen ill suddenly.

224
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,280
She's very sick.

225
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,680
And I can tell by saying her name
and looking in your eyes

226
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,040
that I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

227
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
Wasted petrol on what?

228
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,400
Ah...

229
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,800
Tommy Shelby, OBE MP.

230
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,520
Running round the mountains in

231
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,640
pursuit of a Gypsy curse,
is that it?

232
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,800
I thought you had Polly deal with
the spirits. Polly is dead.

233
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,520
Bullet or a blade?

234
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,480
Still speaks to me in my dreams.

235
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,640
It was her who told me
to come find you.

236
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
Polly.

237
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,000
That name like the ringing of
the school bell.

238
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,480
Come and do as you're told.

239
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,240
Oh, fuck!

240
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,440
I am so glad I'm not in your camp
any more.

241
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,320
Made of bricks and bars.

242
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
My daughter is dying, Esme.

243
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
Some people go to France.
To Lourdes.

244
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,120
I hear they sell trinkets.

245
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,720
I need more than fucking trinkets.

246
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,000
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

247
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm sorry for troubling you.

248
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,440
CLOCK TICKS

249
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,640
DOOR OPENS

250
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,440
The butler says our American friend
is parking the car.

251
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,280
He also says, in answer to
your inquiry, Diana,

252
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,560
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

253
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,080
That's a very expensive label.
Yes, it is.

254
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
But the perfume
I can smell on you is very cheap.

255
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,960
HE CLEARS THROAT

256
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,960
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

257
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,680
It is a family emergency,
apparently.

258
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,920
We only have Ada. The sister.

259
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, would the sister like
some more Champagne?

260
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,920
Oh, the sister is allowed to speak?

261
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,960
She thinks this lunch is
purely social.

262
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,360
SHE CHUCKLES

263
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,440
The sister is here because there's
sickness in the family.

264
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,040
Thomas wanted someone from
the Shelby organisation

265
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,520
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

266
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,240
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

267
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,920
Ooh. What invitation?

268
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,680
The invitation can wait.

269
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,760
And please remember, in this moment,
in this room,

270
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,160
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

271
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,160
because we have the information
and the incentives

272
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,560
that will make Mr Nelson do
what you require him to do.

273
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,240
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

274
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,680
because, although I'm reluctant,
I am actually quite good at this.

275
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,720
And yes, I will have Champagne.

276
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,240
DISTANT GIGGLING

277
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,880
Ah. Take care of this.

278
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,600
OK, so before these dull
introductions begin,

279
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,680
I just have to tell you something
that my niece Gina just told me.

280
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,640
Oh, Jack. She said the Shelby family
are all witches

281
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,800
and sorcerers who speak freely
with the dead.

282
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,400
So who here's a Shelby?

283
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
SHE CLEARS THROAT

284
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
Is it true?

285
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,760
Gina. Hello, Ada.

286
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,680
Michael sends his regards.

287
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,440
You're the sister.

288
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes, it seems I am indeed
the sister.

289
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,680
I did some research.

290
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,160
You were a Communist once,
but diamonds and lipstick now.

291
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,680
Actually, I'm a Socialist.

292
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,520
She is Mr Shelby's
political adviser.

293
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

294
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,640
and its dominions. Indeed I am.

295
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,240
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

296
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,280
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

297
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,760
SHE CHUCKLES

298
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
It is her sharp mind that
I am in love with.

299
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,200
Men bore me.
Ada, do you have a man?

300
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,400
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

301
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,760
Between this sparkling conversation,
could I get a drink of some kind?

302
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,600
So this little kid Gina,
she runs out,

303
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,480
she marries a gangster,

304
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,320
and now here we all are.

305
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,560
Oh, Jack, please, you are so blunt.

306
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,320
Yes, it's wonderful.

307
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,800
A man who is not careful
with his words.

308
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm not careful.

309
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,120
Just say it first then clear up
the broken glass with my bare hands.

310
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
There you are.

311
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't seem to have
a drink either.

312
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,400
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

313
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,840
Thomas drinks Irish.

314
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,160
Where the hell is he? Irish.

315
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
He's been unavoidably detained.

316
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,080
Nothing is unavoidable.
His daughter is unwell.

317
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,760
He doesn't have a wife?

318
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,400
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

319
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,120
Ada here is the smart one
of the family.

320
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,440
I learnt that when you were young
you lost a brother

321
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,240
and a sister to consumption?

322
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,360
No ice?

323
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,400
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

324
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,240
And, you see, Thomas has very little
faith in current medical practice

325
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,200
regarding tuberculosis.
Man, he has that right.

326
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,400
He's gone off in search
of alternative approaches

327
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
to curing the disease.

328
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,800
Experimental work that he hopes
will save the life of his daughter.

329
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,760
In his shoes I would do
the same thing.

330
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
Your brother intrigues me.

331
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
Yes, he often has that effect
on people.

332
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,040
Yes, and my future husband has that
effect on 20 million people in this

333
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,560
country who attend his rallies
and listen to his broadcasts.

334
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,520
It's amazing what English
upper class women can do

335
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,680
with just skin, bone and arrogance.

336
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,760
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

337
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,440
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

338
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,320
A meeting where the real business
will be done.

339
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,000
And where you can meet like minds
from Ireland who would also like

340
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,920
to discuss the future of Europe.

341
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,560
But as you say, this lunch is
purely social.

342
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,840
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don't have Champagne.

343
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,360
Michael told me the sister
had gone straight.

344
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,920
Yes, but her brother is the sun,
and the rest just orbit around him.

345
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,040
Gina tells me lots of things,
but I want to hear it from you, Ada.

346
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,800
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

347
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,440
ENGINE SPUTTERS

348
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,560
Fuck!

349
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,160
TAPPING ON WINDOW

350
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,800
You used to have eyes in
the back of your head.

351
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,880
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

352
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
I have other lines of inquiry,
give me the spark plug. Gimme the...

353
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,200
Gimme the fucking spark plug.

354
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,520
Give you the spark, give you hope?
Is that what you want?

355
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,400
TRANSLATION:

356
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,880
Something you should see.

357
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,360
Someone dead,
someone grieving.

358
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,480
A lot of hate against you.

359
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,600
You were wise to come to me, Thomas.

360
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
Open up the bonnet, would you?

361
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,920
What hate?

362
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,120
What hate, what grieving?

363
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,600
I can't explain where it is
you have to go.

364
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,920
So I'll take you there.

365
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,520
I hope the suspension is good.

366
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
We're going to a wild old place.

367
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,040
ENGINE STARTS

368
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,440
Mrs Thorne, Mr Shelby isn't here.

369
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,480
I know. I am.

370
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,400
Do you know where he's gone?

371
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,680
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

372
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,880
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

373
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,440
Just bring me the keys.

374
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,080
All of the keys.

375
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,640
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

376
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
Whisky.

377
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,880
Mr Shelby doesn't allow whisky
in the building any more.

378
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,760
Then have someone
go and fetch some.

379
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,320
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

380
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

381
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Fuck.

382
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

383
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
For the next five days, I'm not
the boss's sister, I'm the boss.

384
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,360
Where is Arthur?
We locked him in the cash safe.

385
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,080
When he gets the yamps really bad
he tells us to lock him in the safe,

386
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,720
to stop him from slipping down
to China Town.

387
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,000
What are the yamps?

388
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,280
When you lose your head.
When you can't control yourself.

389
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Young people say it.

390
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,960
And Arthur gets the yamps a lot?

391
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,720
A lot is twice a day.
Arthur gets them three times a day.

392
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,000
It smells in here.

393
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,680
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

394
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,320
On your feet.

395
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Sit down.

396
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,000
Nice perfume.

397
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,360
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

398
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,680
I believe I'm suited to this life.

399
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm not so sure about you.

400
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,160
I was given to understand that you
are no longer part of the company.

401
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,160
Hm.

402
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
You speak well.

403
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,680
I was going to be an accountant

404
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,600
but everybody said I would be wasted
counting money,

405
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,320
instead of stealing it.

406
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
What's the name of that perfume?

407
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,640
I've got a girlfriend
with a birthday.

408
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,880
I want you to go to Liverpool.

409
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,280
Then I will go to Liverpool.

410
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
We have opium in storage at
the Salthouse docks.

411
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
Word got out among the dock workers.

412
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,880
They started stealing cupfuls,
now it's by the bucket.

413
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,720
By the bucket? The audacity of it.

414
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,680
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

415
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,440
by a union convenor
called Haydn Stagg.

416
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,120
In the envelope you'll find details
of where to find him

417
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,080
and what to do to him when you do.

418
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,360
Is there a black star in
the envelope?

419
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,000
I decided not.

420
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,040
You decided?

421
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,560
The name of the perfume is
know your fucking place, soldier.

422
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,760
PHONE RINGS

423
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,400
I decided he'll just take a beating.

424
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,640
And also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

425
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,120
Arthur, ten days clean,

426
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,880
and we're going to take him into
a warehouse full of fucking opium?

427
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,040
It can be your job
to look after him.

428
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,760
Why take him at all?

429
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,320
It's his reputation you're taking.

430
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,720
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

431
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,080
No-one would dare fuck with
Arthur Shelby.

432
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,200
But they would fuck with me?

433
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,840
Yes. He is Arthur Shelby.

434
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,680
You're Isiah...who?

435
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm just Isiah,
who is keen to learn, Ada.

436
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
Keep him clean.

437
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,400
Deal with Haydn Stagg,
bring Arthur back in one piece.

438
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,280
And in return, I won't tell Tommy
that you're laying private bets

439
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,640
on races that we've fixed.

440
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,880
Just trying to make
a few extra pennies,

441
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,800
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

442
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,280
Mm, lucky girl.

443
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,280
DOOR CLOSES

444
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,920
TRAIN RUMBLES

445
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
DOOR OPENS

446
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,880
TRAIN RUMBLES, BOTTLES CLINK

447
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,120
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

448
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,880
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

449
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,160
No.

450
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,240
I need to stay myself
and be strong.

451
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,480
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

452
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,880
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

453
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,800
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

454
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Tommy says it's just in one lung.

455
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,400
No. They now think it's in both.

456
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,840
It's moving quickly.

457
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,440
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

458
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,840
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

459
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,600
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

460
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,880
Half the people I tell
look like you just did

461
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,440
because they know someome
who died on the gold treatment.

462
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,400
The person I knew was old.

463
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,320
Old and young, the same.

464
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,160
Have you given up, Lizzie?

465
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,480
No.

466
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm being strong.

467
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,400
At her bedside, on my own.

468
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,800
While Tommy is up in the mountains
to be among the gypsies.

469
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,720
In truth it's a blessing
he's not around at the hospital,

470
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,200
because all he wants to do
is fight people

471
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,080
and blame himself,

472
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,920
and I've never felt
so ashamed of him,

473
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,360
Christ, because right now
I need a normal man.

474
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,840
And it's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

475
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,640
and watching her disappear.

476
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,920
BOTTLES RATTLE AND CLINK

477
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,120
Do you know when he's back, Ada?

478
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,400
He gave me instructions,
not information.

479
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,680
Can you get a message to him?

480
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
He'll be out of reach.

481
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,200
Ada, I thought you might
know things.

482
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,360
I've been away from all this.

483
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,240
You're still Gypsy.

484
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,240
Yeah, well. The mystery leaves you.

485
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,800
What mystery? Lizzie, is there
anything practical that I can do?

486
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,760
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

487
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,160
What's Esme got to do with this?

488
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,640
I thought you might know.

489
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,840
Esme's a Lee.

490
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,480
What does that mean?

491
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,640
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

492
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,080
Where do they live?

493
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,680
They're gypsies,
they live where they like.

494
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,240
Fuck. Fuck, Ada.

495
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,640
Tribes in the mountains.

496
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,600
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

497
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,320
they know what causes it,

498
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
but oh, no, my husband,
he knows better.

499
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,760
Not a normal man, your brother.

500
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,480
He's up in the mountains
with fucking horse thieves

501
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,640
and sorcerers while I'm here
on my own.

502
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,960
Not a normal man.

503
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,360
DOOR CLOSES

504
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
PHONE RINGS

505
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,640
It's OK, Arthur.
I'll look after you.

506
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,920
Yeah.

507
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,400
And Ada said it would be OK
if I recruited my cousins.

508
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,000
Off the streets of Alum Rock,
and looking for the big time.

509
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,560
What do you say, Arthur?

510
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,720
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

511
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,800
I think he means you're in.

512
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,360
Let's go.

513
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,360
Can you still ride bareback?

514
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
ENGINE STOPS

515
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,920
WIND WHISTLES

516
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,640
ROPE SLICES

517
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,160
HORSE WHINNIES

518
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,000
We're a long way from anywhere,
Esme.

519
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,000
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

520
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,640
I'll use that rope
to fucking hang you.

521
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,800
Right, hold up,
Hold on, hold on.

522
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,680
Listen, you know what
you've got to do, right?

523
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,600
You've got your orders,
I'm depending on you.

524
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,160
Do you hear me?

525
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,920
Let me tell you something.

526
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,360
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before...

527
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,240
..they're Peaky Blinder.

528
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,920
Peaky Blinder
still looks like this.

529
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,680
After.

530
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,880
# Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar!

531
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,200
# Said the puppy to the snake

532
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,760
# I've got a real big mirror
of a smile

533
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,160
# And I hold it to the fakes

534
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,520
# Hard boot slammed to the ground

535
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,720
# So I see what shakes. #

536
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,480
We are here to meet
a gentleman called Haydn Stagg.

537
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,560
A gentleman?

538
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,840
Mr Stagg?

539
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
That scoundrel.

540
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,600
Never there when you need him.

541
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,720
Who needs him?

542
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,160
We do.

543
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,960
Where is he?

544
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,880
Last I saw he was up to his balls
in a lady called Maria.

545
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,040
THEY LAUGH

546
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,680
We have no time for tradition

547
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,480
or the rules of the sporting life.

548
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,360
Because, among the Peaky Blinders,

549
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,960
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

550
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,760
he pays a fine.

551
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,480
My name's Haydn Stagg.

552
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,520
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

553
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,680
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

554
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,920
GUNSHOT

555
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,400
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

556
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,520
No.

557
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,480
We're here about
other business.

558
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,920
We like to call it
Black Star business.

559
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,480
The Black Star a pub, is it?

560
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

561
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,880
The last pub
you ever fucking drink in.

562
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
The Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star

563
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,440
and all your troubles are done.

564
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,080
But the pub you drink in,
Mr Stagg,

565
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,160
is called The Dolphin, right?

566
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,200
Every night you're in there.

567
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,160
Not to drink -

568
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,480
you're there divvying up
the days takings, in't ya?

569
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,960
And there's a woman there.

570
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,000
She sings out, "Opium for sale!"

571
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,280
Sit down, boys.

572
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,520
The rules say the King puts his head
on the block and the game is up.

573
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,520
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

574
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,280
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

575
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,800
Therefore...

576
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,840
..punishment...

577
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,040
..is a visit
to the Black Star pub.

578
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,440
But, out of kindness of my heart,

579
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,200
your sentence has been commuted.

580
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,800
Praise the fucking Lord!

581
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
And our lovely Ada, eh?

582
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,440
Instead...

583
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,440
..instead, Mr Haydn Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

584
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,840
Well, before I take this beating...

585
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,000
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

586
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,480
Well, comrade, beneath your sleeves
lies the truth.

587
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,840
The marks on your arm.

588
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,160
Yeah.

589
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,200
Stories about you
come up the canal.

590
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,800
Where once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.

591
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,840
Let's just fucking do it, Arthur.

592
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,920
For me it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

593
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

594
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,400
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

595
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,680
There's a warehouse full of it is
just across the yard, there,

596
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,080
where the boys play football.

597
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,840
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

598
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
and it floats in the air.

599
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,480
But I'm strong, comrade.

600
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,600
Arthur. Let's just fucking do it.

601
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,560
Liar. It's me that's due a beating.

602
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,080
But it's me who feels sorry
for you, Mr Shelby.

603
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,680
Because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

604
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,680
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

605
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,040
And sometimes you want to cut
a doorway in your arm

606
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,240
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

607
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Yeah.

608
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,920
Fuck you, man.

609
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
I was once where you are now,
Arthur.

610
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,680
If you're going to do it, do it.

611
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,200
But look at me
as the man you can be.

612
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,920
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

613
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,840
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

614
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,280
Your loved ones...

615
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,000
..your wife, your kids.

616
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,960
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

617
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,080
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

618
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,520
Only you.

619
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,480
Don't count the days.

620
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,280
Futile.

621
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,040
You get to 100, then you wake up
and it's fucking one again.

622
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,720
Don't build mountains.

623
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,120
Walk like it's a flat plain.

624
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,320
Easy step by easy step.

625
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,280
Arthur, just give me the fucking
word and I'll fucking do it.

626
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,080
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

627
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,880
Arthur, I'm not going to ask you
fucking twice.

628
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,800
Isiah, leave him alone.

629
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,360
No...No fucking way.

630
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,120
I said you can stand down.

631
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
Let's go, come on.

632
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,240
Come on, all of ya. Go on. Go on.

633
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,240
Gypsy graveyard?

634
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,640
You can still read the signs.

635
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,800
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

636
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,960
Just tell me whose grave it is.

637
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,800
You'll see.

638
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,000
Who knows what you'll see?

639
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,200
Do you ever go to John's grave?

640
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,920
Things are really bad.

641
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,040
When what's really bad?

642
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,960
I've done bad things, Esme.

643
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,800
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

644
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,640
I would like to make amends.

645
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,520
You want to lift every curse
anyone has ever put on you?

646
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,400
That's a lot of lifting.

647
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,160
My own curse is in there somewhere.

648
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,800
I should have done more
to protect John.

649
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,000
You think in this holy place

650
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,960
the spirits are listening to you
being kind?

651
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,560
Believe it or not, Esme,
I am discovering kindness.

652
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,440
I'm learning it from my children.

653
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,000
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

654
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,400
Lost it long ago.

655
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,840
I only use the crate it came in.

656
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,840
I know why you're here.

657
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,320
I'm in a hurry, Esme.

658
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,800
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

659
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,240
Well, soon you'll be in
the right place to do it.

660
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,120
The village disappeared.
The church fell down.

661
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,880
Only us still use the graveyard.

662
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,120
Do you recall a sapphire?

663
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,200
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

664
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,720
Ten years ago.

665
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,840
She took the stone back
to her camp.

666
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,760
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

667
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,200
She gave the sapphire to her sister.

668
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,000
Evadne Barwell.

669
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,840
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

670
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,960
A little girl.

671
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,520
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

672
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,600
She died that night.

673
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,000
Seven years old.

674
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,440
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

675
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,400
No-one's ever gone to look
for it.

676
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,440
I'm guessing it'll be the girl's
mother who laid the curse.

677
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,280
Only women can lay curses.

678
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,240
Perhaps she waited until
your little girl was seven,

679
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,120
so you'd know how it feels.

680
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,040
Do you have whisky? No.

681
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,600
Tommy.

682
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,680
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

683
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,120
It's science.

684
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,040
Science is winning everything
these days.

685
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,040
Even against the angels.

686
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,560
I can leave you, if you want.

687
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,360
Your horse will know his way back.

688
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,560
But I think there should be some
reward for what I have shown you.

689
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,360
Some consideration.
You can afford it, Mr Shelby OBE.

690
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,800
I will find her.

691
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,120
I will find this fucking
Evadne Barwell,

692
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,480
I will fucking find her,

693
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,640
and I will give her money
to take back this curse.

694
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,880
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

695
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,000
And the Barwells roam from
the border to the sea.

696
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,120
I will give her £10,000.
More. Anything.

697
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,520
You will put out word, Esme.

698
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,240
You will put out word. I will
put out word, and I will find her.

699
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,880
And instead of this poor
wooden cross... Tommy!

700
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,920
..I will build a monument
to this little girl.

701
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,320
Her mother can decide how big.

702
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,000
It can be as big as fucking
Nelson's Column.

703
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,360
That and £10,000.

704
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,680
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

705
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,120
Ruby will be well.

706
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,200
She will be well!

707
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,360
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done.

708
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,880
Now that I'm without whisky
I can hear the spirits clearly,

709
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,360
and they're saying Ruby
will be well, if I make amends.

710
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,720
That is the conversation.

711
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,640
If you want my help, I will help
you, Thomas, if you also pay me.

712
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,040
Pay me and I will help you
to find her.

713
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,160
I will pay you.
But I don't want money.

714
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,760
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

715
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,160
and nothing is certain
and money loses value.

716
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,880
Instead of money, give me gold.

717
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,400
Gold. Yes, I will give you gold.

718
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,840
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

719
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,600
I will give you gold.

720
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,800
And you will help me find
this woman.

721
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,440
And she will spare my daughter.

722
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,040
CRASH OF THUNDER

723
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,480
VEHICLE APPROACHES

724
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Lizzie! Where the fuck were you?

725
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,320
Where were you?

726
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,040
Where the fuck were you?

727
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,080
She's gone, Tommy.

728
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,080
She's gone.

729
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,320
Just now. At 5.17.

730
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,520
You weren't fucking here, were you?

731
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,960
Were you?

732
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,800
It was before then, and she
was here, and then she was gone,

733
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,040
and now she's gone to where
they've put the dead.

734
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,000
They've put her with
the dead people.

735
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,560
She was asking, just now, for you.

736
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,200
But went...

737
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,360
..at 5.17.

738
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,080
I told her that you loved...

739
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,000
I gave her your kiss goodbye.
