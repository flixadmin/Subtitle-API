Only... if you want me to.

[Aleksander] What do you want?
I've already told you everything.

I would like you to take a look at this.

Mr. Wöller.

What is it?

175
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:45,505
It's a copy of the documents
from the registration at Marburg.

176
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:49,796
The data from your last personal ID
before you moved out here.

177
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:55,796
- I don't see how this is relevant at all.
- Nothing catches your eye?

178
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,296
No. Should there be something?

179
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:08,088
You're 5' 6", I bet. Maximum.

180
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,213
But the document says 5' 8".

181
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,671
So... I'm wondering where it is.

Where is what?

[whispering] The two inches missing.

This is ridiculous.

You're under arrest.

And somehow...

Mads and Helge, too.

No one came forward.

It's not that straightforward.

Right at this moment
he's in a psychiatric institution.

He won't talk.

In '86.

320
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:30,421
Quite similar to the case
with Mads Nielsen.

321

No trace.

322

Nothing.

00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,963
His name was also Aleksander.

Mm...

327
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,046
A regular name.

328
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:58,880
To be precise, there are
over 700 Aleksander Köhlers in Germany.

329
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:04,421
So it wasn't easy to track down
each and every Aleksander Köhler.

330
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,463
Especially...

someone who chose to take
the last name of their wife.

332
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,338
Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.

333
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,755
After my parents separated,
I took my mother's last name.

334
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,671
From Köhler

335
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,213
