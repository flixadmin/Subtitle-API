1
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,954
I'm so sorry, my queen.

2
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,540
He was a good man.

3
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,042
"Barristan the Bold" they called him.

4
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,671
He crossed a continent to serve me.

5
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,215
He was a loyal friend.

6
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,219
And he died in an alley,

7
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,764
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

8
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,727
We could pull back
to the pyramid district,

9
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,606
secure it, and use it as a base
from which to operate.

10
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,985
Then we clean the city out,

11
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,280
neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,

12
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,824
until the rats
have nowhere left to hide.

13
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,496
I prefer your earlier suggestion.

14
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,000
Round up the leaders
of each of Meereen's great families

15
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,001
and bring them to me.

16
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,131
But I'm the leader of my family.

17
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,554
No, Your Grace.
I had nothing to do with this.

18
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,389
Your Grace!

19
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,542
Don't want to overfeed them.

20
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,048
Tomorrow perhaps.

21
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,754
"And though Daenerys
maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay,

22
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,049
forces rise against her
from within and without."

23
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,303
"She refuses to leave until the freedom
of the former slaves is secure."

24
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,182
She sounds like quite a woman.

25
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,560
And she's alone, under siege,

26
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,980
no family to guide her or protect her.

27
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,235
Her last relation thousands of miles away,

28
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,988
useless, dying.

29
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,076
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

30
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,163
A Targaryen alone in the world…

31
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,625
is a terrible thing.

32
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,421
Maester Aemon.

33
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,340
Lord Commander.

34
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,677
Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.

35
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,777
How are you feeling?

36
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,907
Oh, like a hundred-year-old man
slowly freezing to death.

37
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,830
I need your advice.

38
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,210
There's something I want to do,
something I have to do.

39
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,254
But it'll divide the Night's Watch.

40
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,134
Bitterly. Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.

41
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,264
Half the men hate you already,
Lord Commander. Do it.

42
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,768
-But you don't know what it is.
-That doesn't matter.

43
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,520
You do.

44
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,569
You will find little joy in your command.

45
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,155
But with luck,

46
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,700
you will find the strength to do
what needs to be done.

47
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,663
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

48
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,125
Winter is almost upon us.

49
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,419
Kill the boy,

50
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,423
and let the man be born.

51
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,726
Where are the rest of the free folk now?

52
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,811
Where have they gone?

53
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,859
Who leads them?

54
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,237
They followed Mance.

55
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,240
They won't follow anyone else.

56
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,577
What about you?

57
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,873
Hard to lead when you're in chains.

58
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,672
-What if I unchained you?
-Why would you do that?

59
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,592
Because you are not my enemy.

60
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,387
And I'm not yours.

61
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,431
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

62
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,768
For eight thousand years the Night's Watch
have sworn an oath to be the shield

63
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,061
that guards the realms of men.

64
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,233
And for eight thousand years
we've fallen short of that oath.

65
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,568
You belong to the realms of men.

66
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,737
All of you.

67
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,865
And now everything is going to change?

68
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,076
-It is.
-Why now?

69
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,494
Because now,

70
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,122
I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

71
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,624
What would you have me do,

72
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,419
Lord Commander?

73
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,172
I'd have you go north of the Wall.

74
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,217
Gather the remaining free folk
wherever they are,

75
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,552
and bring them back here.

76
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,179
I'll open the gates for them
and let them through.

77
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,183
I'll find them lands to settle
south of the Wall.

78
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,937
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

79
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,772
I don't want them to kneel for me.

80
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,401
I want them to fight with me
when the time comes.

81
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,154
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

82
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:58,408
is the day my people cut my guts
from my belly and make me eat them.

83
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,410
And how many of your people can't fight?

84
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,248
The women, the children,
the old, the sick, what happens to them?

85
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,625
You're condemning them to death.

86
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,880
Worse than death because you're too proud
to make peace.

87
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,801
Or maybe you're not proud.

88
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,805
Maybe you're just a coward.

89
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,815
Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

90
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,050
Your people need a leader.

91
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,261
And they need to get south of the Wall
before it's too late.

92
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,764
We don't have much time
and they have less.

93
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,183
The walkers are coming
and they'll hit your people first.

94
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,854
I'm not asking you to make peace
to save your skin.

95
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,650
Make peace to save your people.

96
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,077
Most of them are at Hardhome.

97
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,497
-You know where that is?
-Up on Storrold's Point.

98
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,333
I can give you ten horses
and nine other men.

99
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,420
-You can get there in a week.
-We'll need ships.

100
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,549
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

101
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,387
All right, then.

102
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,391
You're coming with me.

103
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,311
You're the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

104
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
They need to hear it from you.

105
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,275
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

106
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,318
won't be torched in the middle of the sea.

107
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,362
You come with me…

108
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,115
or I don't go.

109
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,293
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

110
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,213
Men, women, and children will die
by the thousands if we do nothing.

111
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,799
Let them die.
We got our own to worry about.

112
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,593
Less enemies for us.

113
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,512
Fewer.

114
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,055
What?

115
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,515
Nothing.

116
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,478
Look, well,
there is good farmland in the Gift.

117
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,771
Land that no one uses now.

118
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,773
A dozen abandoned villages.

119
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,026
And why do you think
the farmers abandoned those villages?

120
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,029
Because the wildlings
raided them for years.

121
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,074
Cut them down
just like they did this boy's people.

122
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,451
Aye!

123
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,039
We've been fighting them
for thousands of years.

124
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,249
They've slaughtered villages.

125
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,086
-They've slaughtered our brothers.
-And we've slaughtered theirs.

126
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,299
I will follow you anywhere,

127
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,468
you know that.

128
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,971
-But they killed Grenn.
-Yes.

129
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,474
-And they killed Pyp.
-Aye.

130
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,935
They killed 50 of our brothers.

131
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,770
I can't forget that.

132
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,772
I can't forgive it.

133
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,732
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

134
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,319
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

135
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,780
We can learn to live with the wildlings

136
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,698
or we can add them
to the army of the dead.

137
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,203
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

138
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,149
Thank you.

139
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,818
Olly.

140
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,072
If you have something
you want to say to me,

141
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,575
say it.

142
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,583
It's all right.

143
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,587
You don't mean it, do you?

144
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,757
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

145
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,093
You're just doing it to trick them.

146
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,388
-It's not a trick.
-They burned my village.

147
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,058
They put an arrow through
my father's head right in front of me.

148
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,228
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

149
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,530
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

150
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,868
I know this is hard for you.

151
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,288
But winter is coming.

152
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,625
We know what's coming with it.

153
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,086
We can't face it alone.

154
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,470
Will there be anything else you need,
Lord Commander?

155
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,224
No.

156
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,968
She's far away from the Lannisters.

157
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,680
This is her home.

158
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,893
Maybe Lady Sansa's better off here.

159
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,649
Better off with the Boltons
who murdered her mother and brother?

160
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,536
Sansa's in danger
even if she doesn't realize it.

161
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,093
Thank you.

162
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,055
You've lived here a long time?

163
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,475
Aye.

164
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,186
Did you know Lord Eddard?

165
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,356
I knew him…

166
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,776
and his father before him.

167
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,989
The Starks are gone now.

168
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,699
Not all of them.

169
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,785
I know who's inside that castle.

170
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,620
Everyone knows.

171
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,706
The Boltons.

172
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,666
I'm not talking about the Boltons.

173
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,753
I need to get a message to her.

174
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,172
To Sansa Stark.

175
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,842
Who are you?

176
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,511
Someone who swore to keep her safe.

177
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,555
Swore to who?

178
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:18,973
Her mother.

179
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,976
Her mother's dead.

180
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,103
That doesn't release me from an oath.

181
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,567
I served Lady Catelyn.

182
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,153
I serve her still.

183
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:35,948
Who do you serve?

184
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,165
Come back here.

185
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,506
-Myranda.
-I saw you staring at her.

186
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,341
I'm going to marry her.

187
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,260
That will involve looking at her
from time to time.

188
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,724
You said you'd marry me.

189
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,477
And I meant it.

190
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,979
When I was a bastard named Snow.

191
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,023
But I'm a Bolton now.

192
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,443
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

193
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,530
I'm furthering a dynasty.

194
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,243
Do you think she's pretty?

195
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,955
Of course I do. I'm not blind.

196
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,470
You think she's pretty, too.

197
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,184
I'm looking forward to our wedding night.

198
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,563
But don't worry,
I'll have plenty of time for you.

199
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,107
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

200
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,614
You're the kennel master's daughter.

201
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,577
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

202
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:10,501
You're mine.

203
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,504
You're not going anywhere.

204
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,549
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

205
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,302
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

206
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,058
You're not going to bore me,
are you, Myranda?

207
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:45,953
Never.

208
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,193
Beg pardon, my lady.
I've come to refill the wash basin.

209
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,402
Oh, I don't need…

210
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,367
You still have friends in the North.
If you're ever in trouble,

211
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:28,204
light a candle in the highest window
of the broken tower.

212
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,374
-But who--
-You're not alone.

213
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,038
I like your dress.

214
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,667
Who made it for you?

215
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,461
I made it myself.

216
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,046
Really?

217
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,175
Who… who are you?

218
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,679
I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.

219
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,183
May I?

220
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,066
Oh, wonderful.

221
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,193
The stitching.

222
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,697
-Who taught you?
-My mother.

223
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:50,911
-I'm sorry for what happened to her.
-Thank you.

224
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,749
It's good that she taught you.

225
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,709
It was a gift.

226
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,005
Now every time you wear
something you made,

227
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,049
you can remember her.

228
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,259
I'd rather have a mother.

229
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,678
I know. It's not the same.

230
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,766
Still, it's good to remember.

231
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,018
Remember the way things were.

232
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,272
I almost forgot.

233
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,650
There's something else…

234
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,986
to help you remember.

235
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,831
Down there at the end.

236
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,876
What is it?

237
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,003
That would spoil the surprise.

238
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,548
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

239
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,468
You won't believe it when you see it.

240
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,657
Theon?

241
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,294
You shouldn't be here.

242
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,610
You smell particularly ripe this evening.

243
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,780
Pour me some wine.

244
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,432
Do you have something to tell me?

245
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,603
-No, my lord.
-Reek.

246
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,817
She saw me.

247
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,903
Who?

248
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,030
Sansa. Lady Sansa.

249
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,366
She came to the kennels.

250
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,246
-She saw you?
-Yes. I'm sorry, master.

251
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,040
-Forgive me. I didn't think--
-Come here.

252
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,887
You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek.
Get on your knees.

253
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,110
Give me your hand.

254
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,384
I forgive you.

255
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,732
I trust you find your chamber suitable,
my lady.

256
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,068
-Yes, thank you, my lord.
-Allow me.

257
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,033
Mother.

258
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,784
Thank you, Ramsay.

259
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:55,758
My lady, we are all a family,
we northerners.

260
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,303
Our blood ties go back thousands of years.

261
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,598
So I'd like to drink to our wedding.

262
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:07,144
May our happiness spread
from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.

263
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,272
-To your wedding.
-To your wedding.

264
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,908
It must be difficult for you
being in a strange place.

265
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,327
This isn't a strange place.
This is my home.

266
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,496
It's the people who are strange.

267
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,670
You're right. Very strange.

268
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,509
More wine, please.

269
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,851
I heard you two had been reunited.

270
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,562
A fitting place for it.

271
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:57,569
I like to imagine that the last time
you spoke was in this very room.

272
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,535
Are you still angry with him after he…

273
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,960
What he did? Don't worry.

274
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,254
The North remembers.

275
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,590
I punished him for it.

276
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,218
He's not ironborn anymore.

277
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,056
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man.

278
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,644
A new person, anyway.

279
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,813
Aren't you, Reek?

280
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,523
Yes, master.

281
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,652
-That's his new name. Reek.
-Why are you doing this?

282
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,073
Because Reek has something to say to you.

283
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:45,784
Don't you, Reek?

284
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,296
An apology.

285
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,305
Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did.

286
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,809
Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

287
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,233
I'm sorry.

288
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,320
Look at her, Reek.

289
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,907
An apology doesn't mean anything

290
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,867
if you're not looking the person
in the eye.

291
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,335
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry about what?

292
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,421
For killing your brothers.

293
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,101
There, over and done with.

294
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,729
Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.

295
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,899
That was getting very tense.

296
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,652
Whew.

297
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,490
You know what, my lady?

298
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,203
What with him
having murdered your brothers

299
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,580
and the rest of your family gone…

300
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:21,046
Reek here is the nearest thing
to living kin that you have left.

301
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,049
Reek.

302
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,760
You will give away the bride.

303
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,599
Someone has to. What better person?

304
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,521
-Good? Good?
-Yes, yes, very good.

305
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,523
Wonderful.

306
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,860
Walda and I have some good news as well,

307
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,280
since we're all together.

308
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,620
We're going to have a baby.

309
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,295
I'm very happy for you.

310
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:05,632
From the way she's carrying,
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

311
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,025
How can you be sure?

312
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,778
-Sure of what?
-That she's pregnant.

313
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,739
I mean…

314
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,074
how can you tell?

315
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,161
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

316
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,964
So, how did you manage it?

317
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,343
-Manage what?
-Getting her pregnant.

318
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,679
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

319
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:57,100
Of course, but how did you find it?

320
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,769
You disgraced yourself at dinner

321
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,230
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

322
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,357
And if it's a boy?

323
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,489
-You're worried about your position.
-My position is quite clear.

324
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,366
I'm your son…

325
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,827
until a better alternative comes along.

326
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,172
You've never asked me about your mother.

327
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,512
Why would I?

328
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,848
She had me, she died.

329
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:39,685
And here we are.

330
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,688
She was a peasant girl.

331
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,609
Pretty in a common sort of way.
She was the miller's wife.

332
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,571
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent.

333
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,824
So I had him hanged,

334
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,702
and I took her beneath the tree
where he was swaying.

335
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,331
She fought me the whole time.
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

336
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,044
A year later she came to my gates
with a squalling baby in her arms.

337
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,380
A baby she claimed was mine.

338
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,342
I nearly had her whipped
and the child thrown in the river.

339
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:22,102
But then I looked at you
and I saw then what I see now.

340
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,438
You are my son.

341
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,661
Stannis Baratheon
has an army at Castle Black.

342
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,913
But he won't stay for long.

343
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,041
He wants the Iron Throne,

344
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,837
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

345
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,215
He means to take the North.

346
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,595
But the North is ours.

347
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,805
It's yours and mine.

348
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,892
Will you help me defeat him?

349
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,687
Yes.

350
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,906
Is this every book there is?

351
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:18,992
Every book there is?

352
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,787
In the world.

353
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:26,583
Well, no. There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

354
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,254
-This library is rather small, actually.
-Where you grew up, were there more books?

355
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,757
My father's not the most literate man.

356
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,555
They say the Citadel
has the largest library in the world.

357
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,556
Where's that?

358
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,601
The Citadel?

359
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,145
In Oldtown.

360
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,156
-I'm sorry I don't know things.
-Oh, Gilly, look at me.

361
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,452
You know how to do
a hundred things I can never do.

362
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,871
You can build a fire with wet wood.

363
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,792
-You can cook. You can stitch a wound.
-I can wash the linens.

364
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,961
-I can sweep the floor.
-Well--

365
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,380
Why does the Citadel
have the biggest library?

366
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,216
It's where they train the maesters.

367
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,218
Like Maester Aemon?

368
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,512
I wanted to be one when I was young.

369
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,477
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

370
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,691
Far more adventure up here anyway.

371
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,403
I wouldn't have met you.

372
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,619
Ah, Your Grace.

373
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:53,795
You're Samwell Tarly?

374
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,965
I am, Your Grace.

375
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,342
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

376
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,806
Defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

377
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,518
Only battle Robert ever lost.

378
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,980
I told him he shouldn't go
so far west so soon,

379
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,023
but he never listened.

380
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,277
Fine soldier, your father.

381
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,238
You don't look like a soldier.

382
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,575
But I'm told you killed a white walker.

383
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,370
-I did, Your Grace.
-How?

384
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,831
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

385
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,751
-Dragonglass?
-What the maesters call obsidian.

386
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,961
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

387
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,006
-Why would obsidian kill a walker?
-I don't know.

388
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,842
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

389
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,136
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

390
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,514
is that the children of the forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

391
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,018
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

392
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,940
I've seen it, Your Grace.

393
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,358
Seen what?

394
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,234
The army of the dead.

395
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,614
-And when they come--
-We have to know how to fight them.

396
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,037
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

397
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,390
It's time.

398
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,642
Uh, Your Grace.

399
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,228
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

400
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,023
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

401
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,484
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
We can't wait that long.

402
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,446
We have the advantage,
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

403
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,825
But every day we wait,
the odds shift in Bolton's favor.

404
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,535
This could turn to winter at any moment.

405
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,997
We have to act now.
Give the order. We march at sunrise.

406
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,959
I'll choose a dozen men to stay
and guard the queen and the princess.

407
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,585
No need. They're coming with us.

408
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,132
It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace.

409
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,883
-Won't they be safer--
-Here?

410
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,305
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

411
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,516
No, they march with us.

412
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,229
As you wish, Your Grace.

413
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,799
Do you think Father will let me go down
into the crypt?

414
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,800
Beg your pardon?

415
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,053
At Winterfell.

416
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,138
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

417
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,348
Bran the Builder and King Dorren and--

418
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,726
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

419
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,063
-And then we have to take the castle.
-Is there going to be a battle?

420
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,857
Aye, princess,
but you won't be anywhere near--

421
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,776
That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos.

422
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,195
You'll scare the child.

423
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,322
Yes, my queen.

424
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,994
-I'm not scared.
-Well, I am.

425
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,372
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

426
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,374
I promise.

427
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,481
I hope you know what you're doing
with these wildlings.

428
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,566
I need those ships.

429
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,027
You'll get them back.

430
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,238
I swear it.

431
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,533
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

432
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,327
And thank you.

433
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,024
Mount up!

434
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:26,776
Colors!

435
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,952
Oh, no.

436
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,538
You're still too weak.

437
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,426
Ser Barristan?

438
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,870
Are you ashamed?

439
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,124
You were ambushed, outnumbered.

440
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,920
-There was no way you could have known.
-This is not why.

441
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,300
Wounded in war,

442
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,095
there is no shame for this.

443
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,389
I am ashamed

444
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:24,435
because when the knife go in
and I fall to the ground,

445
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,563
I am afraid.

446
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,820
-All men fear death.
-No, not death.

447
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,408
I fear

448
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:44,330
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

449
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,828
Now you have given the Masters
what they deserve.

450
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,497
If I give everyone what they deserve,
I'll have no one left to rule.

451
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,419
Ser Barristan counseled mercy
when I took this city right up

452
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,545
to the morning he died.

453
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,882
Daario Naharis thinks
I should kill the former Masters

454
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,800
and let the rest of the city
fend for itself.

455
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,636
What do you think?

456
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,351
Your Grace, I think that I am not fit
to have an opinion on these matters.

457
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,187
You are as fit as anyone I know.

458
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,607
You know why I'm here.

459
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,152
And you know who will suffer
the most if this all falls apart.

460
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,654
So what do you think?

461
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,744
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

462
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,289
I have seen you listen to your counselors.

463
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,836
I have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking

464
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,547
and weigh the choices they put before you.

465
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,552
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors…

466
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,307
because there was a better choice.

467
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,143
One that only you could see.

468
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,788
My queen, please do not do this.

469
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,082
What about"valar morghulis"?

470
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,543
I did not want to die a coward.

471
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,134
Apparently I do not want to die at all.

472
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,471
It takes courage to admit fear.

473
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,891
And to admit a mistake.

474
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,104
I came here to tell you that I was wrong.

475
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,693
I was wrong and you were right.

476
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,071
About tradition.

477
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,909
About bringing the people
of this city together.

478
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,832
I will reopen the fighting pits.

479
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,293
To free men only.

480
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,755
Slavery will never return to Meereen,
not while I live.

481
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:41,257
Yes, my queen.

482
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,056
And in order to forge a lasting bond
with the Meereenese people,

483
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,976
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

484
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,023
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

485
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,761
Don't worry.

486
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,515
I'll be fine.
Nothing broken, I don't think.

487
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,435
Where are we now?

488
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,270
Not the Rhoyne.

489
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:48,366
Long, sullen silences
and an occasional punch in the face.

490
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,953
The Mormont way.

491
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,125
Let's start over.

492
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,380
I apologize for before.

493
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,132
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

494
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,094
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

495
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,477
We're going to be spending a lot of time
together on the way to Meereen.

496
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,478
We are.

497
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:24,026
What would make our time together
truly enjoyable would be some wine.

498
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,529
No wine.

499
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,618
I am a person who drinks.

500
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,374
People who drink need to keep drinking.
Otherwise, they're not…

501
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:47,592
I know where we are.

502
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,802
You're taking us through Valyria.

503
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:51,887
I am.

504
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,765
-Have you sailed this route before?
-No.

505
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,727
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir

506
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,812
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

507
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:01,939
I think you'll be plenty.

508
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,026
You know what they say.

509
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,237
The Doom still rules Valyria.

510
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,616
What about the demons and the flames?

511
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,327
Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

512
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,120
No.

513
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,664
But pirates are.

514
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,255
The Smoking Sea.

515
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:31,802
How many centuries before we learn
how to build cities like this again?

516
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,640
For thousands of years the Valyrians were

517
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:39,060
the best in the world
at almost everything.

518
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:40,936
And then…

519
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
And then they weren't.

520
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,900
And then they weren't.

521
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,783
"They held each other close
and turned their backs upon the end."

522
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,746
"The hills that split asunder
and the black that ate the skies."

523
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:03,417
"The flames that shot so high and hot
that even dragons burned,

524
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,505
would never be the final sights
that fell upon their eyes."

525
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:15,054
"A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned…"

526
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:19,809
"The city of a thousand years,
and all that men had learned."

527
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:25,690
"The Doom consumed it all alike,
and neither of them turned."

528
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,152
I would clap.

529
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,202
I suppose this is it, then.

530
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,789
This is what remains.

531
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:22,913
What was that?

532
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,756
Stone Men!

533
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,507
Don't let them touch you!

534
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,275
Get behind!

535
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,071
Mormont, cut me free!

536
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,199
Mormont!

537
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,590
Mormont!

538
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,134
Mormont!

539
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,505
Tyrion?

540
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:59,593
Tyrion.

541
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,263
Tyrion.

542
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,140
Tyrion.

543
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,352
You're all right.

544
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:20,239
You're heavier than you look.

545
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,994
Did any of them touch you?

546
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:29,874
You?

547
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,214
I've seen greyscale before,

548
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,842
but nothing like that.

549
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,386
I suppose that's why they send them there.

550
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,892
It'd be kinder to put daggers
in their hearts and be done with it.

551
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,316
Thank you for saving me.

552
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,030
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving

553
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,823
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

554
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,747
So what now?

555
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:13,584
We walk up the coast.
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

556
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:15,628
Maybe another boat.

557
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,129
Without luck?

558
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,924
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

559
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,845
I'll get some wood for a fire.

560
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,306
Try to get some rest, huh?

561
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,143
That's the best idea you've had all day.
