1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,208
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,249
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,461
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,171
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,298
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,139
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,138
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats</i>

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,894
<i>and I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,442
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,525
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,823
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,992
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,161
Why would anyone want to create metas?

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,825
What's happened to me?

15
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,201
Clearly, this guy is a bus meta.

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,281
You can stretch these cells...

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,742
- Like Silly Putty.
- ...like Silly Putty.

18
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,825
I'm Silly Putty?

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,536
Let my team and I train you.

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,371
What made you look into Mayor Bellows?

21
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,707
It was a client. Last name, DeVoe.

22
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,463
You do what Amunet says,
for as long as she tells you.

23
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,133
Tell Amunet I'm done.

24
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,056
Joe, I'm pregnant.

25
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,144
Hey, you guys wanna see
something really cool?

26
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,976
Um... Sure, go for it.

27
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,311
Stretch, Ralph.

28
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,645
Stretch.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,486
- That is pretty cool.
- Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,278
Okay, look, are you sure
we can't find this DeVoe guy?

31
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,113
I mean, we were warned.
We had a heads-up

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,666
that someday someone named DeVoe
would be one of my greatest foes.

33
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,958
The other thing to think about is,
do you know how many people there are,

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,581
- in this state alone, with the name DeVoe?
- No.

35
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,917
Thousands. And we still don't
have an age.

36
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,964
<i>Unless one of your
greatest foes is</i>

37
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,635
the three-month-old William DeVoe
who lives four blocks from here.

38
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,970
I don't think
one of my greatest enemies is a baby.

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,976
- Evil killer baby.
- It could happen.

40
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,344
You're right.

41
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,887
Hey.

42
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,223
- Felicity.
- Hey.

43
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,186
- How did you get in here?
- I literally walked in here.

44
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,364
You have no security, you have no
alarms, you have nothing on your door.

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,033
You guys might wanna consider something.
Anything, at all.

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,111
- You came prepared.
- Team Arrow to Team Bride.

47
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,866
You know, I'm very excited
for that bachelorette party.

48
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,791
Getting inebriated with same genders
to celebrate an archaic institution?

49
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,117
Priceless.

50
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,953
I mean, you only get married once, so...

51
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,415
Well, actually, pretty much
everyone gets divorced these days.

52
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,465
Fifty-five percent to be exact.
I mean, that's just statistics.

53
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,010
But not... Not you and Iris.

54
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,133
That would just...
That would never happen to you guys.

55
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,883
<i>Whose feet are those?</i>

56
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,592
That's Ralph Dibny.

57
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,476
I'm gonna go meet up with the ladies.

58
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,850
That...

59
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,035
Well, here you are. Okay.

60
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,119
Are you ready for the ladies' night
to end all ladies' nights?

61
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,503
And by that she means a quiet, low-key
dinner at a very classy restaurant.

62
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,218
Yeah. That's exactly what I mean.
Super low-key, super quiet.

63
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,886
Do you want a pink or
a blue feather boa?

64
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,510
Actually, Iris, if it's okay,
I don't think I'm gonna make it tonight.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,057
I'm just not feeling up to it.

66
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,975
What? Are you feeling okay?

67
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,598
No, I'm fine. I just...

68
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,851
Sometimes life catches up
with you, you know?

69
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,140
That's 'cause you're not
wearing a tiara.

70
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,475
Put on the tiara,
everything'll change... Oh!

71
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,772
- Wearing a tiara. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

72
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,987
Caitlin, please. Come on,
we work together every day.

73
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,360
We never get to do a dinner,
just us girls. You have to come.

74
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,282
She's right. Just one dinner. Please.

75
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,614
Wouldn't miss it.

76
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,620
This is so insane. I can't believe
you're gonna be a mom again.

77
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,000
I know. Well, you've always

78
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,297
wanted a sibling.

79
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,000
And seven <i>Dr. Who's</i> later,
you totally came through.

80
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,136
- You're a <i>Dr. Who</i> fan, Joanie?
- Well, ever since he became a lady, I am.

81
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,505
Hashtag feminism.

82
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,641
Bachelor party! Girls, get out.

83
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,926
<i>Oh, that's our cue.</i>

84
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,146
Hey, Barry, congrats on getting hitched.

85
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,981
Thank you.
I didn't realize you were in town.

86
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,228
Well, I just stopped by for the weekend.

87
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,230
- Awesome. Good to see you.
- You too.

88
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,361
Have a great time. Don't get too crazy.
No drinking.

89
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,860
Mmm-mmm.
No, Iris promised me a totally chill night

90
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,865
that even my pregnant booty can handle.

91
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,365
You should come with us, sweetie.
You know, I'm sure Iris wouldn't mind.

92
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,709
Uh, no, it's okay. I actually have plans.
But I will drop you off.

93
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,546
- Okay. Have fun. Later, guys.
- Bye.

94
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,375
Okay. I'll get the lights.
Harry'll get the brandy.

95
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,965
Hey, Harry, before you pour the brandy,
make sure you warm the glasses.

96
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,388
- What?
- For real?

97
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,714
It's cool.

98
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,633
<i>Okay.</i>

99
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,552
Barry Allen,

100
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,599
are you ready to have your mind blown?

101
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,265
<i>Meet Barry Allen.</i>

102
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,191
<i>Before he met Iris West,</i>

103
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,816
<i>before he became an inter-dimensional
time-traveling speedster,</i>

104
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,490
he was an adorable baby
boy with Ewok-level chub.

105
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,280
<i>Oh, those cheeks!</i>

106
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,487
Cisco, this is great,
but where did you get these videos?

107
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,072
Hey, man, I'm a ninja. Watch this part.

108
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,958
Ah, I forgot that you two got married!

109
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,171
You two were so young.

110
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,500
Damn, I was so young.

111
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,834
Mmm-hmm.

112
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,178
Gentlemen, I have arrived.

113
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,554
- Ralph.
- Dibny.

114
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,139
Wasn't expecting you.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,516
You said, "See you later."

116
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,472
I assumed this was a superhero hangout

117
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,979
and this was a test for my
highly-attuned detective abilities

118
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,561
which, for the record, nailed it.

119
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,235
- Okay, or...
- You weren't invited.

120
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,820
- Wow, this house is...
- Bitching?

121
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,448
No. Small. It looks much bigger
from the street.

122
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,037
- What's all this crap?
- This is my bachelor party.

123
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,451
Oh, dear God. You're serious.

124
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,912
This weiner fest is your bachelor party.

125
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,086
This weiner fest is about to indulge
in some very fine cigars

126
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,258
and a very nice steak dinner at The Oak.

127
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,009
Okay! Stop. You're going to pay
$50 for a steak dinner?

128
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,808
I know a place where you get
all-you-can-eat steak

129
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,102
and chicken for $4.99.

130
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,979
And they even throw in napkins.

131
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,063
- Come on, ladies.
- No, really, Ralph.

132
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,269
- We're gonna stay here. We're gonna...
- No, Slim Jim.

133
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,980
I insist. You can thank me later.

134
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,442
- Hey, that was meant to be enjoyed!
- I enjoyed it.

135
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,538
Cisco, don't worry. Where we're going,
the drinks flow freely and the view is...

136
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,581
Oh! Spectacular.

137
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,630
- So fancy.
- Yeah, a toast,

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,086
to the future Mrs. Allen.

139
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,882
- West-Allen.
- West-Allen.

140
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,968
Although your life with Barry
may be fast-paced,

141
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,425
I hope you guys take the time
to enjoy the special moments.

142
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,727
Thank you, guys, for coming.
It really means a lot.

143
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,224
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

144
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,224
Well, all right. Who wants my champagne?

145
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,438
Craziest thing I get to do tonight
is order two desserts.

146
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,068
- I'll take it.
- That's right.

147
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,817
Iris told me you're pregnant.
How's that going?

148
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,356
<i>Yeah. It's good.</i>

149
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,743
I mean, it wasn't exactly part of my plan.
But, I just could not be happier.

150
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,786
I know exactly what you mean.

151
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,327
<i>Oh, yeah. How is everything
with Oliver and William?</i>

152
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,703
It's an adjustment...

153
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,339
Do I hear wedding bells ringing
in your future?

154
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,008
Oh, no, the last time we did anything
that resembled a wedding,

155
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,676
Oliver got shot with an arrow. So...

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,383
- Uh, did you girls order a stripper?
- Why didn't you tell me?

157
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,012
- I would've brought all my singles.
- No, I...

158
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,227
Girl, you into some freaky stuff.

159
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,812
Amunet wants you.

160
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,517
Uh... Caitlin, do you know him?

161
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,896
- You need to come with me.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

162
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,275
Please tell me that
this is just part of his act?

163
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,157
Yeah, if it is, it's taking too long.
Take it off.

164
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,876
Gross! I meant take off your pants,
not your eye.

165
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,914
Oh, my God!

166
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,229
Stay back, baby mama, we got this.

167
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,862
Holy...

168
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,030
Please don't do this.

169
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,166
It didn't have to be this way.

170
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:26,954
What?

171
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,844
I was hoping to see you again.

172
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,348
Really? So I could give you another scar?

173
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,478
Ugh! I hate pink.

174
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,831
Doesn't it just take your breath away?

175
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,255
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
that is Jade.</i>

176
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,424
Gentleman, I welcome you
to The Golden Booty.

177
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,006
There ain't nothing golden
about any of this.

178
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,966
I came through for you, right man?
What do you think?

179
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,387
I think I should have
brought some hand sanitizers.

180
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,676
I always come prepared.

181
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,303
Yes!

182
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,138
Ralph, this isn't really my speed.

183
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,894
Speed jokes?
You're better than that, Allen.

184
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,941
- I wasn't...
- Hey, Ralphy.

185
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,316
Uh, Disney, you're a regular
in this joint?

186
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,694
So much more than that.

187
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,277
The girls might not be bottomless,

188
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,113
but for yours truly,
the french fries always are.

189
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,080
Golden Booty policy,

190
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,081
you know, out of respect for the ladies,
no touching, no pictures, no video,

191
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,621
- and no cell phones.
- What?

192
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,464
<i>Next, on the main stage...</i>

193
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,250
I need a drink.

194
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,549
God, I wish I could have a drink.

195
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,131
Bro, you really think
I'd let you down like that?

196
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,262
Your special concoction.

197
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,598
Guaranteed to give you
that gentle pleasant buzz,

198
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,513
all night long.

199
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,851
What if we need the Flash?

200
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,979
I volunteer to be designated superhero.

201
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,853
Go for it, Barry, you deserve it.

202
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,063
Oh!

203
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,239
- To Barry and Iris.
- To Barry and Iris.

204
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,001
- They're not picking up.
- What the hell just happened?

205
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,662
Who was that Medusa man?

206
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,543
You know that is not
a Cisco-approved name.

207
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,044
Don't worry about who that was.

208
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,346
Caitlin's taste in clothes is matched
only by her taste in men.

209
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,421
Both terrible.

210
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,891
Wait. How are you, you?
I thought Caitlin was cured.

211
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,971
Caitlin shouldn't be
keeping secrets from her friend.

212
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,310
You are friends, right?

213
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,484
Yeah. Of course we are.

214
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,736
Your "friend"
was going out-of-town tonight.

215
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,146
What? Why?

216
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,732
Because she got herself into
something she couldn't handle.

217
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,990
Where are you going?

218
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,110
To find Norvock's boss. And to kill her.

219
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,745
And you need a change of clothes
for that, because...

220
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,284
Whoa! Whoa! Okay, apparently someone
doesn't have boundary issues.

221
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,661
Okay girls,
can I talk to you in the Cortex?

222
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,666
Can we take it back for a minute?

223
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,465
Since when did her superpowers
make her a super villain?

224
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,004
She's not a villain, okay?

225
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,923
I remember being kidnapped
by her last year.

226
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,049
- What?
- Okay, yes, but that,

227
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,096
is because she was being manipulated
by Savitar.

228
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,345
And in the end, we wouldn't have been
able to stop him without her.

229
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,974
Look, I know that
there is some good in there.

230
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,682
I get it. Technically, Caitlin is
underneath all of that somewhere

231
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,858
but she is still dangerous.

232
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,981
And she is also our friend, okay?

233
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,937
I'm not just gonna abandon our teammate.

234
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,361
Fine. I'm coming with you.

235
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,238
No, Cecile, you're pregnant.

236
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,287
And your father will kill me if you get
killed at your own bachelorette party.

237
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,238
That is some crazy logic
and that means I'm in, too.

238
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,121
- Oh, great, happy bachelorette.
- What are you all talking about?

239
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,378
Oh, nothing. You know, just talking
about how cool it is to kill people.

240
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,671
And such. No pun intended.

241
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,291
It's been real, ladies.

242
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,299
I'm gonna use the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellite to track her cold signature.

243
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,764
Great, I'm going to try
and call for back-up again.

244
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,967
And I'll remember that it's Caitlin
under there.

245
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,646
- You gotta stop doing that.
- I'm just getting change for a five.

246
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,850
What? Did you think I was stealing?

247
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,858
It's not about your sticky fingers, Ralph,

248
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,315
it's about your stretchy arm
outwardly displayed.

249
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,196
Oh, so I should be more like
Captain Discreet over there?

250
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,868
I'm the Flash!

251
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,491
I may have slightly miscalculated
his bachelor elixir.

252
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,575
I got this one.

253
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,827
That's good stuff.

254
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,836
- Hey buddy, how are you feeling?
- Hey. I feel good.

255
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,001
Oh, you're gonna need to walk this off.

256
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,929
Or run it off! Because I'm the Flash!

257
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,549
Let's get you back to the table.

258
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,772
Barry, what did you just do?

259
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,900
I just went and got peanuts from the bar.

260
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,440
- You didn't even move.
- Or did I?

261
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,192
- Drink up. So I was talking to...
- I'm good.

262
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,819
It's cranberry juice, buttercup.

263
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,196
So I was talking to Charity,
not her real name,

264
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,655
she tells me that the dancers here
make more in a month than an average...

265
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,616
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Less talky, more dancy!

266
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,534
<i>...dancer, it's Jasmine.</i>

267
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,542
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

268
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,182
Oh, hell no.

269
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,217
Hey, she looks like Cecile's daughter!

270
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,266
Oh!

271
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,118
I'm sorry. I thought touching without
permission is what you wanted.

272
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,379
I'd let me pass, unless you want to know

273
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,174
what it feels like when
the liquid in your eyeballs crystallizes.

274
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,003
<i>Darling, you're here! Let her in.</i>

275
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,885
<i>Let her in. Let her in.</i>

276
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,262
Amunet, next time
you want to talk, come yourself.

277
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,348
Don't send that eye-hole to attack me.

278
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,307
Did you start a fight?

279
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,979
Honestly, Norvock, it's why
you're my third favorite henchman.

280
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,235
I mean, what do I always say?

281
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,524
"Never start a fight you can't finish."

282
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,908
Hmm?

283
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,201
And that, my dear,
is why you're my favorite.

284
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,626
- You listen.
- Well, apparently you don't.

285
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,541
- I'm out, Amunet.
- "Out"?

286
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,459
Out of what?

287
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,591
Out of options? Out of your mind?

288
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,554
Out of the closet? There's just so many
outs for the lady in blue.

289
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,139
You're asking me to dance?

290
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,142
You should know by now
I don't "ask" for anything.

291
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,890
I tell and I take.

292
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,765
Now, come along.

293
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,901
I want to show you something
that could make us both very rich.

294
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,034
Do you think they're gonna able
to tell that we don't exactly fit in here?

295
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,329
Well, it was your idea to wear boas, so...

296
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,491
- Have we heard from the guys yet?
- No.

297
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,328
Look, ladies, okay?
We're on our own. Okay?

298
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,923
- How about a little love?
- No, no, no. No, no love.

299
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,712
Engaged. Okay, bye.

300
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,295
Is it just me, or does it seem like

301
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,473
everybody here already bought
what that guy is selling?

302
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,220
Uh... Ladies, stay here, okay?

303
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,770
I think I know where Frost is.

304
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,729
You got a pet. Congratulations.

305
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,397
I call him the Weeper.
I love naming metas.

306
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,856
I know someone else like that.

307
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,735
Three weeks ago,
this young man became a meta-human.

308
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,539
And I acquired my new favorite product
to sell in my network.

309
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,248
Did you notice?

310
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,285
Love,

311
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,625
is, quite literally, in the air.

312
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,957
Do you know why?

313
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,384
Oh.

314
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,521
Pure.

315
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,400
His tears are a drug?

316
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,615
His tears, my dear,

317
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,281
are a gold mine.

318
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,783
One taste and Central City

319
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,784
will be hooked.

320
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,048
Then why do you need me?

321
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,670
Really? Well, if I'm going to be selling
something quite valuable,

322
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,971
I'm going to need protection.

323
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,049
That's what you've got
good old snake-eye for.

324
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,936
A deal like this

325
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,899
requires a lady's touch.

326
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,643
In your case, strength.

327
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,520
And I'll cut you in for 10%.

328
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,984
Fifteen percent, and I throw in
not killing you right now

329
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,239
for your misguided rebellion.

330
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,868
And that's only because
I've got forgiveness in my kidneys. Right?

331
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,537
I think you meant your "heart."

332
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,744
No. There's no
beat-beat in this chest, sister.

333
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,380
As much fun as it is to play
"I'm the bigger badass," I'm bored.

334
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,216
And like I said, I'm done.

335
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:39,306
Do you know what everyone's mistake
in business is?

336
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,300
<i>Hmm?</i>

337
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,055
Not realizing who has
the power in the room.

338
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,865
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

339
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,572
Ladies, let's put the meta abilities down.

340
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,948
I'm sorry, who is this chick?

341
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,457
Oh, this chick is trying
to stop a meta-fight

342
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,833
from destroying your very enchanting club.

343
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,789
Let's go.

344
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,010
Frost, let's go.

345
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,975
- Should I stop her?
- No.

346
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,149
Let her think she can walk away.

347
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,987
You're lucky she didn't kill you, West.

348
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,664
- Who was that?
- That, was Amunet Black.

349
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,787
Of the underground market?

350
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,243
I'm guessing
this chick has a criminal record?

351
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,546
Yeah. She's been linked to the meta-human
black market selling stolen technology,

352
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,339
but we've never been
able to nail her down.

353
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,382
- And how do you know her?
- Through Caitlin.

354
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,211
Six months ago, Caitlin thought
she had everything under control.

355
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,422
You can't keep a good bad side down
for long, am I right?

356
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,715
She felt me becoming much stronger.

357
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,143
She found out that Amunet had some tech
that would let her stay in charge.

358
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,018
She got desperate,
so she decided to use it.

359
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,641
- But it came with a price tag.
- Which was?

360
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,560
Being her muscle.

361
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,736
Did you kill anyone?

362
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,275
Some people lost their fingers
and their toes, but...

363
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,444
No. No one died.

364
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,529
How are you here, now?

365
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,198
While Caitlin sleeps, I'm awake.

366
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,828
Oh, my God.
You're like the Incredible Hulk!

367
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,411
That's...
I said that with too much chutzpah.

368
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,245
Dialing it back.

369
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,423
Look what are Amunet's plans
for the Weeper?

370
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,166
Not my problem.

371
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,752
Look, he was on that bus.
We helped create him. We need to save him.

372
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,343
No. I need to leave and escape Amunet.

373
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,468
And you're just going to run away?

374
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,096
Listen, there's a reason
the CCPD has not caught her,

375
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,519
and that you idiots just realized
there is a major crime lord

376
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,562
living under your noses
for the past three years.

377
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,644
She's too powerful. We can't stop her.

378
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,732
Guys, we have a responsibility
to the Weeper and to this city.

379
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,069
What do you suggest we do?

380
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,024
We need to rescue him before Amunet
does whatever she's planning, okay?

381
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,025
Cecile, you need to
gather information on Amunet,

382
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,157
and Felicity, you need to
pull up the blueprint to the club.

383
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,654
We got this.

384
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,572
We're strong women.

385
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,157
Yeah.

386
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,409
Hashtag feminism.

387
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,248
Hashtag feminism.

388
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,537
Hashtag feminism.

389
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,792
This isn't what you think, Joe.

390
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,003
Good, because I thought I saw you dancing
on that stage in a gold-sequined bikini.

391
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,555
No. I'm writing a book
on the female experience.

392
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,840
I'd buy that book.

393
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,264
Why does your female experience
include you dancing at The Golden Booty?

394
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,067
Because we live in a society
that's dictated by the male gaze.

395
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,520
I want to control
the narrative of feminism. Okay?

396
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,447
I wanna show the world
that a powerful, strong woman,

397
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,243
she can wear anything.
Be it a bikini or a pantsuit.

398
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,739
Or nothing! Feminism!

399
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,206
That's not how feminism works.
Will you cut it out?

400
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,658
Joanie's practically his daughter.

401
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,628
Hey. Sad Flash,

402
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,204
why the face?

403
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,672
Nothing, I just...

404
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,592
I just love chicken wings so much.

405
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,218
Where are you gonna go?

406
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,354
I know a guy who can breach me
to another Earth.

407
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,900
Start over, escape Amunet,
be who I wanna be.

408
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,863
And that's Killer Frost, right?

409
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,024
Don't be cute, West. You can't stop me.

410
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,610
I wasn't planning on it.

411
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,120
Look, I know you could kill me.

412
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,331
Just like you could have
killed Amunet tonight,

413
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,329
or Cisco six months ago.

414
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,118
But you didn't.

415
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,004
There is a part of you that is good
and decent.

416
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,426
You just don't know how to accept it.

417
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,805
You think you know me now?

418
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,764
No, but I do know what Caitlin looks like
when she's scared.

419
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,267
And you have that same
look in your eyes right now.

420
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,940
You're just as afraid of being Caitlin
as Caitlin is of being Killer Frost.

421
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,490
If you still wanna have a hand
for Barry to put a ring on,

422
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,651
I suggest you move it.

423
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:21,998
There's a strong, powerful woman
that we both love and fear,

424
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,585
and her name is your mother.

425
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,672
- Does she know you work here?
- Of course not.

426
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,004
She would just jump to all
the same conclusions that you are.

427
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,760
Joanie, your mother and I
just want you to be happy.

428
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,176
But I think you need to ask yourself
why you're keeping this a secret from her.

429
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,262
<i>Joe?</i>

430
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,688
Why didn't Rose make room for Jack
on the door?

431
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,273
There was plenty of room for both of them.

432
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,736
Uh, Cisco, when does this gift of yours
stop giving?

433
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,696
Man, I don't know.

434
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,368
I thought we'd be watching
home movies right now.

435
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,036
Again, you are welcome.

436
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,451
You steal $20 from me, Ralphy?

437
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,371
When? I mean, no.

438
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,247
Yeah, he did. I saw it.

439
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,833
I've been waiting a long time
for this Dibs.

440
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,372
Oh!

441
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,883
You monster!

442
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,689
Everybody, stop! I'm a cop!

443
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,313
I'm the Flash!

444
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:30,857
You're late.

445
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,906
I'm right on time.

446
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,871
What, were you expecting a different meta?

447
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,370
Nobody walks away from me, Frost.

448
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:45,394
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

449
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,608
Did you really think
I was going to let you

450
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,564
just breach into the sunset?

451
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,609
You owe me your life.

452
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,507
And I always take what I'm owed.

453
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,305
Hands over your head, ma'am.

454
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,273
Is there any part
of the way that I'm dressed

455
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,601
that leads you to believe
I want to be called "ma'am"?

456
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,356
Hmm?

457
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,078
Ugh.

458
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,490
Blood.

459
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,584
Kill you later, Caity.

460
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,516
Let me help you.

461
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,227
Please.

462
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,148
Okay.

463
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,944
It's already knotted.
You just have to pull it tight.

464
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,197
Thanks.

465
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,037
Yeah.

466
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,829
What happened?

467
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,914
You don't remember?

468
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,257
When she's in control,
I don't remember much of what happens.

469
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,421
Did she...

470
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,723
I hurt anyone?

471
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,434
Just that snake-eyed scumbag.

472
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,100
Didn't kill him though.

473
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,394
So, the cure, it...

474
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,017
Didn't work.

475
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,610
Not all the way.

476
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,191
Which is why you wanted to leave tonight?

477
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,569
And why it took you
six months to come back?

478
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,900
When Cisco said he was gonna get Barry

479
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,826
back from the Speed Force,
I thought that

480
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,164
maybe I could come back and make up
for some of the pain that I caused.

481
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,367
But she's getting stronger.

482
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,961
I never should have come back.

483
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,336
That's not true, Caitlin.
You can always come back to your friends.

484
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,001
Why didn't you tell any of us?

485
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,136
I didn't know who to talk to.

486
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,295
You could have talked to me.

487
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,593
I'm your friend, Caitlin.

488
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,799
Work friend.

489
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,103
I mean, it's not like you and I have
become besties over the last few years.

490
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,931
Yeah, I guess we haven't.

491
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,577
Hey. Jerry, buddy.

492
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,738
We gonna get that phone call or what?

493
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,873
Hey, come on, man.

494
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,952
I know you can hear me.
I'm right here. Hello.

495
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,207
Okay. Great.

496
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,752
You just know everybody, don't you?

497
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,425
Yeah, I've been here a few times.

498
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,883
You know, I could wiggle through
these bars and get us out of here.

499
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,556
I may make my finger into a key.
That'd be pretty sweet.

500
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,888
Lot of pressure put on
the index finger though.

501
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,387
Iron versus flesh.

502
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,264
- What do you think?
- I think you should stop talking,

503
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,348
immediately.

504
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,318
I don't ever have to drink again.

505
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,531
Words uttered by everybody
who's ever had too many. Here.

506
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,331
This was a bust, huh?

507
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,375
It's a bachelor party.

508
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,035
Happens.

509
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,705
What's up with you?

510
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,584
All night, you've seemed preoccupied.

511
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,837
I'm worried.

512
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,213
About what?

513
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,266
Being a dad again. I'm almost 50, Barr.

514
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,433
Mmm-hmm.

515
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,265
I saw that video Cisco made of
you and Iris when you were kids and it...

516
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,478
Hit me like a ton of bricks.

517
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,477
I was...

518
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,446
I was young the first time I did this.

519
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,657
And then seeing Joanie.

520
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,658
<i>It's hard raising humans, Barr.</i>

521
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,946
You'll be fine.

522
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,248
I barely get enough sleep as it is,

523
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,371
worrying about you three.

524
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,250
Especially with Wally being gone.

525
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,623
Add to that a crazy baby schedule.

526
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,837
Feeding, crying...

527
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,089
I'm honestly scared to death.

528
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,802
Joe, when you raised Iris, you were alone.

529
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,847
When you took me in, you were alone.

530
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,229
And you know,
when Wally showed up, you were alone.

531
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,936
You did all that, by yourself.

532
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,267
Single parent.

533
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,227
No one could have done a better job.
No one.

534
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,939
Now you've got a partner.

535
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,115
You've got family.

536
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,400
You've always been there for us
when we've needed you,

537
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,282
and now it's just our turn
to do that for you.

538
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,285
And we will.

539
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,249
I know you will.

540
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,541
I'll take those three.

541
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,295
Four.

542
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,974
These tears are more than just water.

543
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,567
When ingested, the dark matter inside it
alters the brain function

544
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,522
like that of a psychoactive drug.

545
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,152
So it's like what, an opioid?

546
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,075
It's like a love drug.

547
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,153
- From tears?
- If this spreads,

548
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,330
Central City's gonna have a massive
drug problem on its hands.

549
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,157
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, well, we need to stop

550
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,039
Amunet and save the Weeper
before that happens.

551
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,661
How do we find her?

552
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,372
I don't know. She's smart.
Off the grid.

553
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,883
Always on the move, never leaves a trail.

554
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,959
Okay, what about her powers?

555
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,045
The metal that she controls.
Do you know what it is?

556
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,005
It's some kind of alnico alloy.

557
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,633
Do you think you could
use our satellites to track it?

558
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,263
You mean run a geological scan of the city

559
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,766
for small-scale signatures
of aluminum, nickel and cobalt?

560
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,604
Girl, please.

561
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,893
There. She's headed to Lawrence Hills.

562
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,522
That's all industrial out there.
That's steel mills, docks, warehouses.

563
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,151
- Okay, we need to stop her.
- Okay.

564
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,533
<i>Guys, I can't go with you.</i>

565
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,828
If I lose control,
I could become a liability.

566
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,706
I'm sorry, Iris, I can't go.

567
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,704
You don't have to.

568
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,201
We got this.

569
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,870
Okay.

570
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,728
Ladies, what's your status?

571
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,316
We're in position.

572
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,191
I think you'll be pleased.

573
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,331
- This is him?
- Hmm.

574
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,010
Good boy.

575
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,050
Sample.

576
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,651
I'll take him.

577
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,276
- On my count, we move.
- Okay.

578
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,782
<i>One, two...</i>

579
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,029
Three.

580
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,963
I remember you.

581
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,885
You are the chick from the bar, hmm?

582
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,092
Oh, no.

583
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,639
<i>Hey, Amunet.</i>

584
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,363
This is between you and me.

585
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,863
Let my friends go,
and I'll come back and work for you.

586
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,576
It's too late for that, Caity.

587
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:44,290
Do you know why no one has ever
testified against me over the years?

588
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,956
Well, it's because they're not alive to.

589
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,750
Sorry.

590
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,421
Take care of them.

591
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,971
No!

592
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,313
Well, hello, Chilly.

593
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:13,898
We got to get out of here.

594
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,739
And I thought I wasn't going to be
able to kill anyone today.

595
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,081
Kill them!

596
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,550
I don't think this is gonna
hold much longer.

597
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,716
Well, this is a steel factory,
and you move steel plates with...

598
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,799
Magnets.

599
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,718
Really, really big magnets.

600
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,264
Cecile, turn the crane on.

601
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,023
What? How?

602
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,567
It should be in the schematics.
Just highlight it and turn it on.

603
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,311
Okay, I'm...

604
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,712
You and I could have been gods.

605
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,339
I used to work with a god.

606
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,791
Over it.

607
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,252
Cecile, now!

608
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,021
Not so scary without your bling, now,
are you, sister?

609
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,066
Stop!

610
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,745
Caitlin, stop.

611
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,030
I'm not Caitlin.

612
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,453
And I'll never be free unless she dies.

613
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,000
No, it's the opposite.

614
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,952
You are free right now.

615
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,789
But if you do this,
you will always be a killer.

616
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,671
Killer Frost, Caitlin,
you don't have to be one or the other.

617
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,877
You get to decide who you are.

618
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,302
Get out of here.

619
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,596
You've ruined this for me today.

620
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,401
And one day soon, I promise you,
I will ruin something for you.

621
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,942
Hold on.

622
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,778
It's okay, okay? We're gonna help you.

623
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,034
- Get away from me.
- Wait...

624
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,701
The police are on their way.

625
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,913
We did it, guys. We really did it.

626
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,836
Actually, it's "girls."

627
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,729
I'm gonna have a headache now
until my wedding day.

628
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,804
Worth it.

629
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,765
Agree to never speak about what
happened tonight?

630
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,142
- Agreed.
- If I have to.

631
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,730
What?

632
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,947
Hey, I saw you called 17 times.
Everything okay?

633
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,824
Yeah, everything is fine.
How was your night?

634
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,319
Good.

635
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,116
- Quiet.
- Uneventful.

636
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,041
- Yours?
- Yeah. Not much happened.

637
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,710
You know what,
we actually had a few scrapes.

638
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,290
Honestly, so did we.

639
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,497
Tears were involved.

640
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,293
Yeah. Us, too.

641
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,876
More crying, then puking.

642
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,762
Lost access to the happiest
place on Earth.

643
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,641
Pretty sure nothing could have
made tonight any worse.

644
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,512
I'm so tired.

645
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,143
I'm so tired.
Can we just do this tomorrow, please?

646
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,603
Oh, Chicks with white hair. Hot!

647
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,521
Why is Killer Frost here?

648
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,897
Guys...

649
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,822
She has something
that she wants to tell you.

650
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,120
<i>And you all should listen.</i>

651
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,176
Aww... It's just Caitlin.

652
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,675
I can explain everything.

653
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,265
Hey, Joe.

654
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,100
Hey.

655
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,566
When you got arrested, I figured
you'd be okay, 'cause you're a cop,

656
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,737
but still...

657
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,490
Yeah, we're all fine.

658
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,527
How was the rest of your night?

659
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,158
It was fine.

660
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,910
Joe, I'm gonna do what I want.

661
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,335
I know, you're an adult.
I was not trying to tell you what to do.

662
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,587
But if I'm being honest,

663
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,672
I know that I took it too far tonight.

664
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,467
Then, what about your feminist research?

665
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,886
I still believe everything I was saying.

666
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,262
But after we talked, I realized
that's not why I'm working there.

667
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,432
So I'm gonna quit.

668
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,561
Are you gonna tell Mom?

669
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,014
<i>That's not my secret to tell.</i>

670
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,978
But your mom loves you.

671
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,519
And she'll always listen,
if you let her.

672
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,822
Just got my first craving.

673
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,984
Hi, you two.

674
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,110
How was your night?

675
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,746
It was fine. Nothing happened.

676
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,822
- You?
- Oh...

677
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,708
Same. Super chill.

678
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,997
I'm gonna head to bed. But do you wanna
do breakfast in the morning and just talk?

679
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,548
- Yeah, sweetie, I'd like that. Okay.
- Okay.

680
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,504
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

681
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,181
- I gotta tell you something.
- Mmm?

682
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,221
This kid of ours,

683
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,181
definitely not a vegetarian.

684
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,225
"This kid of ours."

685
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,559
Cecile, I gotta tell you,

686
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,860
I never thought I'd even have
a second chance at love, and here you are.

687
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,481
You're my everything.

688
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,451
To top that miracle,
we're having this baby.

689
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,575
It's exciting.

690
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,374
Is it okay to say that
I'm scared?

691
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,459
I'm so glad that you told me that.

692
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,704
'Cause I am terrified.

693
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,297
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

694
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,251
I thought that I'd finally
hit this groove in my life,

695
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,802
in my career, and with you, and now,

696
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,806
this changes everything.

697
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,350
The last thing I thought at our age
we'd be having a baby.

698
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,426
I know!

699
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,598
It's scary. But I figure

700
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,606
pretty much all we gotta do is love this
baby as much as we love each other.

701
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,155
- That's a lot of love.
- Yeah.

702
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,699
So much for quiet and classy, right?

703
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,247
Not exactly the bachelorette party
you had in mind.

704
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,370
Well, saving the city wasn't a bad way
to spend the night.

705
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,829
But the best part of the night was
spending it with the ladies of Team Flash.

706
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,630
It was. When we weren't
almost getting killed.

707
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,383
- Yeah, we should do it more often.
- We should.

708
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,133
The "hanging out" part, not
the "almost getting killed" part.

709
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,258
I'd like that.

710
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,888
Actually, I wanted to ask you a favor
about the wedding.

711
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,802
Oh. You want a custom ice sculpture?

712
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,679
No.

713
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,854
Um...

714
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,901
I wanted to know if you wanted to
be my maid of honor.

715
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,187
- Me?
- Yeah.

716
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,069
We're more than work friends,
and we've been through a lot together.

717
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,822
Weddings are all about
new beginnings, right?

718
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,905
So, what do you say?
You wanna stand up for me?

719
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,616
I do.

720
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,376
I guess that's your line though, right?

721
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,416
Thank you.

722
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,629
- I'm so excited!
- I know. I'm excited, too.

723
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,930
- Do I have a bridesmaid's dress?
- Of course.

724
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,919
<i>I went through
a lot of trouble</i>

725
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,915
creating you.

726
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,756
I can't have you running away.

727
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,387
Not until you've completed the task
for which you were born.

728
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:27,411
