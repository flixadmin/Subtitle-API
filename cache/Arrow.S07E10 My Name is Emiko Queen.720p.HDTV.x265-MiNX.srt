1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,436
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,431
Ms. Mayor, as of today, Mr. Queen

3
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:07,137
is officially working for the SCPD.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,358
You sure you're good with this?

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,952
Hiding the truth from
Oliver and Felicity? No.

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,816
We need your help.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,609
This is a plan to
level all of Star City.

8
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:20,942
These are the bomb schematics we found

9
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:21,945
in Felicity's hideout.

10
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,154
We have got to go to the cops.

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,721
The SCPD are a joke.

12
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,883
We go to The Glades.

13
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,925
I guess it's time to pay my dad a visit.

15
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:19,335
The world is not a fair place.

16
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:23,256
Innocent people die
while the guilty go free.

17
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:26,822
The system is broken, filled
with corruption, greed,

18
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,103
and apathy.

19
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:31,531
The people who are supposed
to protect us are failing us.

20
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,871
Criminals continue to walk the streets

21
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:46,029
because no one is willing to stop them.

22
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,698
The world may not be fair,

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,001
but everyone deserves justice

24
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:53,295
and someone looking out for them.

25
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,012
And in other news from city hall,

26
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:29,256
today marks the dawn of
a new era for Star City,

27
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:32,501
an unprecedented
partnership between the SCPD

28
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,846
and the recently unmasked Oliver Queen,

29
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,514
now a deputized member
of the police force.

30
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,964
You expecting someone?

31
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,011
If anyone from my organization caught me

32
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,207
talking to you, it's
lights out for Marco.

33
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,990
This will calm your nerves.

34
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,811
It certainly does.

35
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,771
Did you find William Glenmorgan?

36
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:03,273
Not exactly.

37
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,700
We've used glenmorgan
for a few sensitive jobs.

38
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,152
So have the Bratva, the Irish,

39
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,820
and anyone else rich enough to pay him,

40
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,464
but no one has seen his face.

41
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,927
So how do you hire him?

42
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,219
Through the online black market,

43
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,859
but he's very careful.

44
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,906
Glenmorgan might not
even be his real name.

45
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,296
Word is he's in town contracting

46
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,973
for Talis Global.

47
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:27,186
That will get you into
the talis server room.

48
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,629
You'll have to find your
own way into the building.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,486
Hey.

50
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,095
What'd this guy do to you anyway?

51
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:37,116
I'm not paying you to ask me questions.

52
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,807
Freeze!

53
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,250
I said, freeze!

54
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,179
Get on the ground.

55
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:05,301
Show yourself. Nobody has to get hurt.

56
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:10,415
I need your help.

57
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:12,001
Holy crap.

58
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,882
I got you. I got you.

59
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,407
Game time, rookie. You ready?

60
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,410
It's not my first crime scene, Dinah.

61
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,719
No, but it's your first
one as an SCPD deputy,

62
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,864
so try not to screw it up, huh?

63
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:32,342
Kidding.

64
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,660
The new Green Arrow
has been dropping felons

65
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,829
at my doorstep almost every night,

66
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,738
but this is something
different... a B & E.

67
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,073
Uh-huh.

68
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,251
It doesn't look like it ended well.

69
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:47,131
Don't touch that.

70
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,008
This is a crime scene,

71
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,891
and at a crime scene, we
follow proper procedure...

72
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,598
A concept that is clearly alien to you.

73
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:55,841
My apologies.

74
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:57,999
I'll take that, please.

75
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,202
Yes, captain.

76
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:05,375
So not everyone is excited

77
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:07,193
about our new partnership, I see.

78
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:09,111
It's gonna take some
time for them to get used

79
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:11,311
to the Green Arrow wearing a badge.

80
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:13,430
But, hey, this is the
best lead we've had

81
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,317
on finding out who's under that hood.

82
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,523
It shouldn't take too long

83
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:17,695
to analyze the blood.

84
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:19,556
By not long, you mean at least a week.

85
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,315
My crime lab is buried
under mountains of evidence.

86
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:24,585
There's another option.

87
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:28,266
Dinah, why is the SCPD
working with the Green Arrow

88
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:31,860
if you are not going
to use my resources?

89
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:35,113
Please.

90
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,309
Okay.

91
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:43,163
Thank you.

92
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,763
Careful. It's gonna be sore.

93
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,410
Not bad.

94
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,614
Well, the Navy didn't teach
me heart surgery or anything,

95
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:06,344
but I can handle a few stitches.

96
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:08,438
- Thank you.
- No problem.

97
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:13,001
So you want to tell me
what happened out there?

98
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,857
Okay. How about your name?

99
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,018
I appreciate the help,

100
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,648
but I'm not looking to make new friends.

101
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,146
- Looks like you could use some.
- I work alone.

102
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,457
But you came to my place.

103
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,651
And I'm starting to regret

104
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,779
not taking my chances at the hospital.

105
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:34,154
Well, I guess stubbornness
comes with the suit.

106
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,735
Look, you're doing a
lot of good out there,

107
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,160
and you obviously care about The Glades.

108
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,329
Let me help you.

109
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,056
You have no idea what I care about.

110
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:44,890
If Oliver Queen knew anything,

111
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:47,301
it's that you can't save the city alone.

112
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:50,355
I'm not Oliver Queen.

113
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:58,290
Zoe, you're supposed to be at
the mayor's fundraising breakfast.

114
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,639
He knows I hate those things.

115
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:01,837
It still doesn't look good

116
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,002
when his chief of staff shows up late.

117
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,628
He loves schmoozing donors.

118
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,132
20 bucks says he didn't even notice.

119
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,501
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,

120
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:13,266
esteemed donors and beneficiaries.

121
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,154
It's my honor to introduce the man

122
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:17,173
who single-handedly
cleaned up The Glades...

123
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:21,160
My friend and your mayor, Rene Ramirez.

124
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,205
Thank you, Keven.

125
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:26,516
And thank you all for coming out today.

126
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,189
Many years ago,

127
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:32,930
we came together for a common purpose...

128
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:36,526
To improve The Glades
when no one else would.

129
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,436
And look at us now.

130
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:41,055
The Glades have never been stronger,

131
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:44,609
but our work's far from over.

132
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:49,781
And I promise you if I'm reelected,

133
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:52,751
I will keep fighting to make sure

134
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:58,197
The Glades remains the
greatest place on earth.

135
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,071
Afternoon, Mr. Diaz.

136
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:17,258
I have to say, the
accommodations here...

137
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,094
A lot more comfortable than Slabside.

138
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:21,822
You can thank me by telling me

139
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:23,815
everything you know about

140
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,434
the terrorist financier known as Dante.

141
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,654
Three days you keep on
asking me the same thing,

142
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,231
and I keep on telling
you I don't know anything.

143
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,149
Then why did he help pay your debt

144
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,435
to the Longbow Hunters?

145
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:41,124
You must be really desperate
to be reaching out to me.

146
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:45,169
Is that your husband on
the other side of the glass?

147
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,201
How you doing, Johnny Boy?

148
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:49,457
Keep stonewalling, Mr. Diaz,

149
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,601
and watch how fast those accommodations

150
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,331
you're enjoying disappear.

151
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,551
You'll see just how
uncomfortable a place

152
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,904
A.R.G.U.S. can be.

153
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:58,924
Or we can send you back to Slabside,

154
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,926
let you rot there.

155
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:03,613
Let me be...

156
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,616
Real clear.

157
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,437
For the cheap seats,

158
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,373
screw you.

159
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,627
I want my lawyer.

160
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:23,611
You belong to A.R.G.U.S. now.

161
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:25,233
No one knows you're here,

162
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:26,785
and no one ever will.

163
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:29,121
So I suggest you cooperate.

164
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,307
I got nothing more to say.

165
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,134
DNA match... Oliver Queen.

166
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,983
Whoo! DNA signature confirmed.

167
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:48,284
I knew you were here before
you even walked in the door!

168
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,350
How's that?

169
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:50,851
- That's good work.
- Thank you.

170
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:52,144
Aren't you a working man now?

171
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,629
Shouldn't you be at the SCPD?

172
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,439
Uh, they need a little
help from Team Arrow...

173
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,672
Specifically you.

174
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:59,360
- Cool.
- You need to analyze this DNA.

175
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:01,337
It belongs to the new Green Arrow.

176
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,339
Some husbands bring
their wives home flowers,

177
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:05,366
and mine brings me
blood from a crime scene.

178
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,493
They say romance is dead. Ha ha!

179
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:10,329
Any idea on who it could be?

180
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,164
Nope.

181
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,208
Oh, you're no fun.

182
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,140
You don't think it could be Roy, do you?

183
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,131
Oh. We are not even on
the same continent as Roy.

184
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:24,118
Yeah. Well, let's find
out who our mystery man is,

185
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,361
shall we?

186
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,348
Ooh!

187
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:37,398
Well, shame on us for being so sexist.

188
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,567
Our mystery man is actually a woman.

189
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,402
Really?

190
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:42,504
Yeah.

191
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,959
Hey.

192
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,837
Can you sit down?

193
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:53,872
Why?

194
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:57,523
'Cause the, um... Well, before you ask,

195
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:59,222
I mean, no, it's not, it's not Thea...

196
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,238
The DNA match is on your father's side.

197
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,424
I'm sorry. Say again?

198
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:06,381
The vigilante is your sister.

199
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:35,914
No!

200
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,125
Get in! Get in, boss.

201
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:40,122
Go! Go! Go!

202
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,852
What the hell are you doing?

203
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,678
You mean besides saving your ass?

204
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,114
I knew that sniper was there.

205
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:52,857
I told you, I don't need your help.

206
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,266
Well, it looked like you
were gonna kill that guy.

207
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:55,677
I was gonna take him alive

208
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,160
to get some answers.

209
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,229
Talis Global is no joke.

210
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,921
They recruit Navy
seals, mercs, assassins,

211
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:04,276
not the kind of folks you
want to mess with alone.

212
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:05,606
This is my mission.

213
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,033
It's personal, so stay out of it.

214
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,649
The next time you get in my way,

215
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,565
I'm putting an arrow through you.

216
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:21,972
No hits on the state birth index,

217
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,365
no hospital records.

218
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,952
As far as the government is concerned,

219
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,961
your mystery sister doesn't even exist.

220
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:29,076
Well, my father was always very good at

221
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,723
burying his secrets.

222
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:33,017
Yeah.

223
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,346
Hey, you okay?

224
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:39,764
You know, this has to be a shock,

225
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,567
not as big as a shock as maybe

226
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,911
becoming the Flash and then
fighting alongside Batwoman,

227
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:46,597
but still a shock.

228
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,248
I have come to terms with the fact that

229
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,435
my father kept things from us.

230
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:53,228
Yeah.

231
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,731
Hey, maybe you should reach out to her.

232
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,399
I feel like if she wanted to talk to me,

233
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,159
she would've come and talked to me.

234
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:00,777
Oliver, she's running
around town dressed like you.

235
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,964
I mean, I'm no therapist,
but I'm pretty sure

236
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,738
the technical term for
that is cry for help.

237
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,332
She has to have a reason.

238
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,950
Yeah.

239
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:10,454
I don't feel comfortable
just barging into her life,

240
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,546
not without knowing more.

241
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:15,339
I need answers.

242
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:17,628
Well, luckily for you, your wife is

243
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,630
very talented at
finding invisible people.

244
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,965
Some even call her a genius.

245
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,992
So one thing we know about
your father is that he loved

246
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,953
a good old-fashioned paper trail.

247
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:29,264
He used an offshore account to handle

248
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,643
some of his more sensitive
financial transactions.

249
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,788
Yup, recurring payments to M & H storage

250
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,364
in Orchid Bay, and the good news is

251
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,690
the account is still active.

252
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,485
We need whatever's in that storage unit.

253
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,001
We need it here immediately.

254
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:45,488
Okay. Copy that. And...

255
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,239
One more thing.

256
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:50,617
Just one more?

257
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,211
The account is not
registered to your father.

258
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,910
It's registered to your mom.

259
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:32,327
There he is...

260
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,555
The man himself.

261
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,710
You think you're gonna be the one

262
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:41,156
to get me to talk?

263
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,176
Let me make one thing clear, Ricardo.

264
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:47,157
You will tell us exactly
what we need to know.

265
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,436
A little good cop...

266
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:53,941
Heh... bad cop.

267
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,035
I've beaten that game before.

268
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,557
I'm not here to play any games with you.

269
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:03,041
I'm here to offer you a deal.

270
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:06,295
John, what are you doing?

271
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,365
Deputy Director Bell.

272
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,075
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,744
The Pentagon sent me to help deal

274
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:16,130
with the situation brewing in Kahndaq.

275
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,914
Imagine my surprise when I heard

276
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,980
a rumor that you had taken Ricardo Diaz

277
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,551
into A.R.G.U.S. custody.

278
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,896
Clearly not just a rumor.

279
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,773
What kind of deal?

280
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,244
It's simple, really.

281
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:35,485
You give us Dante, you go free.

282
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,743
Are you serious?

283
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,371
Those are the terms.

284
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:48,103
Mr. Diggle, a word.

285
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,300
You think about it.

286
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,258
Ricardo Diaz was just arrested.

287
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,760
Now you two want to set him free?

288
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,279
What the hell is going on here?

289
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,305
My apologies for not
looping you in sooner, sir.

290
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:17,098
Director Michaels and
I were in the process

291
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,899
of reinstating the ghost initiative.

292
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:23,092
And Mr. Diaz here was our
first potential recruit.

293
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,364
What's that?

294
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:26,200
A defunct A.R.G.U.S.
program that employed

295
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:29,110
expendable criminals
for covert operations.

296
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,537
It was scrubbed

297
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,288
shortly after my predecessor died.

298
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,291
And you think it's a good
idea to bring it back?

299
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:40,455
Are you questioning my decision,

300
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:43,166
Deputy Director?

301
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,220
Of course not, Madam Director.

302
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:49,723
That kind of radical,
out-of-the-box approach is

303
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:53,060
exactly the shot in the
arm A.R.G.U.S. needs.

304
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,128
I'm sure the Pentagon
will be very excited

305
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:56,564
to hear about this.

306
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,058
Nice work, agent.

307
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:14,698
Looking stronger in the ring, peanut.

308
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,400
Just got to work on your
right cross a little more.

309
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:29,670
_

310
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,145
Guess the new Green Arrow needs

311
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:32,722
Wild Dog's help after all.

312
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:35,269
I'll be fine, Dad. Go.

313
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:36,812
All right.

314
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:46,333
Thank you. Okay. See you soon. Okay.

315
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:47,510
Okay.

316
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,284
How you feeling?

317
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,196
Must have been a nasty bug

318
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,879
for you to miss 3 days of work.

319
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:56,573
It was, but I'm better now.

320
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:58,700
Good. Because the education initiative

321
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,131
is coming to a vote next week,

322
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:02,122
and councilman Roberts still
needs some hand-holding, so...

323
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,748
Actually, dad, there's something else

324
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,081
I need to talk to you about.

325
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,458
Mm-hmm.

326
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:09,198
Someone's planning an
attack on Star City.

327
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,994
Zoe, please tell me you
haven't been talking to Dinah.

328
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:17,093
They're planning to
set off multiple bombs.

329
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:19,262
And we need to find out where.

330
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,974
I want you to give the SCPD access

331
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:24,109
to the Archer Program.

332
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,079
You want me to use our security system,

333
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:30,324
the very thing that keeps us safe,

334
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,609
to help Star City?

335
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,402
You're out of your mind.

336
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:37,226
You're the mayor. You
have a responsibility...

337
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:40,593
Don't you dare talk to me
about my responsibility!

338
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,389
When The Glades needed help,

339
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,005
no one came to our rescue.

340
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,747
Dad, if this bomb goes off,

341
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,125
thousands of people could die.

342
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,011
How could you turn your back on that?

343
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,972
The Archer Program wiped
out crime in The Glades

344
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,117
and helped it thrive.

345
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,810
You do remember what happened

346
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:09,604
when it fell in the wrong hands once.

347
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,198
And we barely recovered.

348
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,208
Oh. So I'm the wrong hands?

349
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,686
You know that's not what I meant.

350
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,820
You know what I know is,

351
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:19,965
is that you used to stand
up for anyone in need.

352
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,520
It didn't matter which
part of town they were from.

353
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,137
You were a hero.

354
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,972
What happened to you?

355
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:49,569
I want to know why.

356
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,980
You're gonna have to be more specific.

357
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,546
Why do you want to help me?

358
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,859
'Cause we're the same.

359
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:57,485
I doubt that.

360
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:00,172
You said your mission is personal.

361
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,416
So is mine.

362
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:04,492
I watched as my wife got shot to death

363
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:07,179
by a drug dealer from these streets.

364
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:10,665
And for a long time, all I saw was red.

365
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,429
Then I met Oliver Queen and their team,

366
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:14,123
and they helped me channel my anger

367
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:16,430
into a fight for a better life.

368
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:18,098
I just want to pay that forward.

369
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,216
That can't be all.

370
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:22,886
Okay.

371
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,991
Ever since Oliver went to prison...

372
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,203
I've been alone.

373
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,366
My friends, my team...

374
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:37,430
They... they moved on, found
another way to be heroes.

375
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,893
And I've been running
around the city helping you.

376
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:43,799
You can trust me.

377
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:51,530
Follow me.

378
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:03,884
If I knew there were this many boxes,

379
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,528
I wouldn't have had them all
delivered to our living room.

380
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:08,555
This feels like a waste of time.

381
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:10,143
Hey, you call this a waste of time?

382
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,768
I don't know. You were pretty good.

383
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,356
You clearly weren't too happy
about Thea being born, though.

384
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,490
Yeah. But she grew on me.

385
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,252
What's that?

386
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:23,464
This is a letter to Walter Steele...

387
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,742
From my dad.

388
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,973
I always forget that Walter
and your dad were friends

389
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,507
before Walter and your mother, you know?

390
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,476
What does it say?

391
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,258
"Dear Walter,

392
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:46,803
as you know, I haven't always made

393
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,263
the best choices,

394
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:51,415
and if you're reading this letter,

395
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:53,185
it means I'm gone."

396
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,604
"I need your help to
right one last wrong."

397
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:08,282
"There's a woman...

398
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,952
Kazumi Adachi.

399
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,788
I loved her.

400
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,383
We had a daughter.

401
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:19,311
And I treated them both unfairly.

402
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:21,388
I abandoned them.

403
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,007
I'm not proud of what I did,

404
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:26,059
but I'm trying to make it right.

405
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,803
You're the only one I trust with this.

406
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:31,865
Please take care of Emiko."

407
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,016
Are you okay?

408
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,749
No.

409
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:42,181
I don't know what to think.

410
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,508
Emiko and her mother were

411
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,892
supposed to be taken care of

412
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,204
in the event of my father's passing.

413
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:53,831
It clearly didn't happen.

414
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,352
The secret identity
of your unknown sibling

415
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,504
has been locked in a
storage unit for years.

416
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,525
Your mother made sure of it.

417
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:07,604
God. You must have so many questions.

418
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,575
This answers most of them.

419
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:15,032
I mean, it'd be one
thing if my father had...

420
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:16,854
An affair.

421
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,065
He had a second family.

422
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:22,747
He... he had a woman

423
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,070
that he wanted cared for,

424
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:27,531
he had a child that he wanted protected.

425
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,654
That he loved.

426
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:30,523
How am I supposed to believe that he's

427
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:33,370
ever loved anybody but himself?

428
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,390
How... how could he abandon them

429
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,748
in the first place?

430
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:39,417
I don't think Moira gave
him much of a choice.

431
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,897
I worked...

432
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,641
So long and hard

433
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,759
to redeem my family's name

434
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,831
after the terrible things

435
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,641
that they've done,

436
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:54,651
but abandoning someone

437
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:57,320
and a little girl?

438
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,916
It's unforgiveable.

439
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,344
What do you want to do?

440
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,956
You put all this together alone?

441
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:22,437
People can't let you down
if you don't let them in.

442
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,297
Spoken like someone who
knows what that feels like.

443
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:42,940
My father gave this to my mother

444
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,459
the last time he saw her.

445
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,562
When I was a little kid,

446
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:50,113
we used this quilt to build play forts.

447
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:53,604
We'd play so long that sometimes,

448
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,971
we'd just fall asleep there.

449
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,124
And before we closed our eyes,

450
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,985
we always hoped for the same thing...

451
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:07,840
That we'd wake up in
the morning, go upstairs,

452
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:09,967
and my father would be waiting for us.

453
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,728
I'm guessing he never was.

454
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,347
Mom and I struggled, but we got by.

455
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:16,974
We had each other no matter what.

456
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:21,643
But last year, there was
a fire in the apartment.

457
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,976
And the fire department
was nowhere to be found

458
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:25,358
because who gives a damn

459
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,135
about some tenement in The Glades?

460
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:29,946
By the time they finally arrived,

461
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:31,186
there were no survivors.

462
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,572
Your mom was in there.

463
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,834
It wasn't the fire that killed her.

464
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,971
He did.

465
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,000
She was dead before
the fire even started.

466
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,456
He put a bullet in her head,

467
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:47,733
a very specific kind of bullet.

468
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,962
You tracked a bullet?

469
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,220
Why would he kill your mom?

470
00:26:54,222 --> 00:26:56,031
That's what I've been
trying to figure out.

471
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,376
I know these guys.

472
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,113
The arms dealer who provided the rifle

473
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:01,533
and the arsonist who tried
to destroy all the evidence.

474
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:08,628
Your mission is about revenge.

475
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:11,028
It's about justice,

476
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,090
which has always been in
short supply in The Glades.

477
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:18,010
William Glenmorgan is my last stop.

478
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,846
And you need help taking him down.

479
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,223
I need to finish this.

480
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,731
Let's go get that son of a bitch.

481
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:47,082
You lost your edge.

482
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,917
What the hell do you want?

483
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,752
I want your access codes to Archer.

484
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,829
So you have been talking to Zoe.

485
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:55,423
If you've gotten her mixed
up in your Canary Business...

486
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,074
She's not a kid anymore,

487
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:00,178
and that's not why I'm here.

488
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,380
We found this in Felicity's
base of operations.

489
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:12,607
She's a criminal.

490
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,444
Criminals like to blow stuff up.

491
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,236
Felicity's dead, Rene.

492
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:18,971
She was murdered.

493
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:20,770
And we think the person
who killed her was

494
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:22,141
behind this plan.

495
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,642
Like I told Zoe,

496
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:26,270
whatever happens in Star
City isn't my problem.

497
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,772
Well, the old Rene would've
made it his problem.

498
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,315
Jeez. Do you have any idea

499
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,486
how much you've hurt your daughter?

500
00:28:33,488 --> 00:28:35,446
She used to idolize you.

501
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,156
At least as Mayor,

502
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:39,909
I'm actually getting things done,

503
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:42,794
not wasting my time
running around the city

504
00:28:42,797 --> 00:28:45,214
with a hockey mask,
pretending that it mattered.

505
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,333
It did matter!

506
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:49,102
And it still matters.

507
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:56,509
We made a promise to
always keep fighting,

508
00:28:56,511 --> 00:29:00,846
to be there for each
other no matter what...

509
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:03,158
All of us...

510
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,747
You, me, Roy, Diggle,
Oliver, and Felicity.

511
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,585
We owe her this.

512
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:19,365
The next time you come back here,

513
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,134
I will have you arrested.

514
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:25,922
And you stay the hell
away from my daughter.

515
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,833
For Zoe's sake, I do
not want to hurt you,

516
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,094
but I'm not leaving
here without those codes.

517
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:33,521
The last time we fought each other,

518
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,323
it didn't end so well for you.

519
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,199
Hey.

520
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,867
- You are still upset.
- Damn right.

521
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,655
You had no right to make that call.

522
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:49,251
You're right. It is
way above my pay grade,

523
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,563
but it worked out for us.

524
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:52,398
Is that your version of an apology?

525
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,900
Hey, Lyla, you have to admit,

526
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:56,336
I actually did help.

527
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,904
I'm the one who shut
down the ghost initiative.

528
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:00,715
And I swore never to reinstate it.

529
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,958
You knew that.

530
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,626
I know that, but you would have

531
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:06,022
absolute oversight and
zero accountability.

532
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,706
This is the perfect
cover for our operation.

533
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,251
Lyla, we had to do something
to get Diaz to play ball.

534
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:14,211
Which you did

535
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,813
by undermining my authority
and forcing my hand.

536
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,092
And here I thought I
was the one in danger

537
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:21,736
of becoming Amanda Waller.

538
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:29,602
Glenmorgan is holed up in his compound

539
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:30,894
outside Star City.

540
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,393
I spotted at least 10 bodyguards.

541
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:34,949
So the killer's surrounded
by even more killers. Great.

542
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:37,085
And he's got a bleeding
edge security system.

543
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,653
Bypassing security system's
is gonna be a piece of cake.

544
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:41,572
You guys have cake?

545
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,664
I mean, I don't want cake, but if
you got a cake, I would have a piece.

546
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:44,742
But if you don't have
it, don't worry about it.

547
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:46,410
You don't have it, right?
Okay. Anyway, it's... yeah, hi.

548
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,847
This is Curtis.

549
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,913
Curtis, this is... you still
haven't told me your name.

550
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:53,658
Emiko.

551
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,845
I'm a huge fan of your work.

552
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:57,605
This was not the deal.

553
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:00,464
I know, but you agreed to
letting people help you,

554
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,393
and if we're going to get to Glenmorgan,

555
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:03,784
we need a guy in a chair.

556
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:06,105
Person in a chair.

557
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:07,448
Fine.

558
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,186
Does this mean what I think it means?

559
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,749
Suit up.

560
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,790
It does mean what I think it means. Heh!

561
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:31,183
Surveillance feed coming through now.

562
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:34,019
Oh, yeah. That's a lot of
bad-looking dudes with guns.

563
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,305
I see why you guys needed me for backup.

564
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:41,979
Can you disable the alarms?

565
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:43,062
I can do you one better.

566
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:44,788
I can knock out the
whole system... cameras,

567
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,124
motion sensors, the whole shebang.

568
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,816
But it's up to you guys to deal with

569
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,443
that army of terminators yourself.

570
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:51,778
I wouldn't have it any other way.

571
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,449
And here we go.

572
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,716
We got a situation out here, boss.

573
00:32:03,718 --> 00:32:06,189
Then why are you talking to me about it?

574
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:07,599
Deal with it.

575
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:08,762
Let's move.

576
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,316
Ow!

577
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:23,331
Teamwork makes the dream work.

578
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:31,276
Go ahead. You go get him.

579
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,028
I'll take care of them.

580
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:38,800
If you want something done right...

581
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,737
Kill 'em yourself.

582
00:32:45,685 --> 00:32:48,594
Whoever you are, you
just made a big mistake.

583
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,729
I dare you to do that again.

584
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:14,298
You come into my house to kill me?

585
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:16,923
You'd better have a damn good reason.

586
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:23,721
Kazumi Adachi.

587
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:25,881
You shot and killed her
last year in The Glades.

588
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,874
I've killed a lot of people.

589
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,251
Tell me why you did it.

590
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:30,528
I didn't.

591
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,230
Guns aren't really my thing.

592
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,737
Liar! The bullet that
killed her was yours.

593
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,802
It wasn't. Someone must have set me up.

594
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:39,979
I've been on a covert
mission in Santa Prisca

595
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:41,739
for the last two years.

596
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:45,726
I just got back into
the country last month.

597
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,820
I swear.

598
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:49,872
It wasn't me.

599
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:58,574
You did it. You got him.

600
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:01,000
Glenmorgan didn't kill her.

601
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:02,148
What?

602
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:03,594
I failed my mission.

603
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,597
I failed my mother.

604
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:21,248
You must really hate that book.

605
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,209
Go home to your daughter.

606
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:28,672
I did. She told me to come here.

607
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,364
I'm sorry things didn't go

608
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,550
the way you hoped for last night.

609
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,196
Glenmorgan's alibi checks out.

610
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,889
He really was in Santa Prisca

611
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:39,224
the night my mother was murdered.

612
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:42,445
I spent months working
through that list,

613
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,521
thinking I was getting
closer to answers.

614
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:46,497
Now I'm back to square one.

615
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,192
The bullet's still a lead.

616
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:52,288
Someone purposely sent
me down the wrong path.

617
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,549
I'm gonna find out why.

618
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,241
Yeah. We are.

619
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:58,911
You're not alone in this anymore.

620
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,871
I'm still not looking for a team.

621
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:02,223
Okay, fine.

622
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,302
Then how about a partner?

623
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,752
You'd be breaking the law.

624
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,921
Hmm, never stopped me before.

625
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,060
What about your daughter?

626
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:12,351
Again, her idea.

627
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:24,245
Archer access codes as promised.

628
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,566
How long will this take?

629
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:31,669
William wrote us a
targeted search algorithm.

630
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
If you got the codes, that means my dad

631
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:38,283
decided to help us.

632
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:41,003
Not exactly.

633
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,305
I forced him to.

634
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,140
I thought seeing you
would make him remember

635
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,584
who he used to be.

636
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:48,770
Hey.

637
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,923
Your dad may have lost his way,

638
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:56,802
but deep down, I still
believe he's good.

639
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,194
Don't give up on him yet.

640
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,284
We're in.

641
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,872
This is the feed from yesterday,

642
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,984
but we now have unfettered access

643
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,799
to the Archer Program's
entire security interface.

644
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,216
Let's find those bombs.

645
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,070
Yesterday was a bigger
success than we anticipated.

646
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:31,941
You had them eating out of your hand.

647
00:36:31,944 --> 00:36:33,253
A shoo-in for reelection.

648
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:35,483
That's not why I called you in.

649
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,193
Last night, one of the Canaries

650
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,394
paid me a visit.

651
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,655
She has the plans.

652
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,995
Maybe there's another way
for us to achieve our goal.

653
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:46,160
The Glades is the future.
We've always agreed on that.

654
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,853
My mission to build up The Glades

655
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:50,189
never included wiping
out the rest of the city.

656
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,333
Well, Star City's a cancer.

657
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,194
The only way to get rid of
a cancer is to destroy it.

658
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:56,820
The Canary also said

659
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:58,862
Felicity Smoak was murdered.

660
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:01,539
You wouldn't happen to know

661
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:03,702
anything about that, would you?

662
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:10,459
Ms. smoak was becoming a liability.

663
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,353
She had to be dealt with.

664
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,920
Is that a problem?

665
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,599
Of course not.

666
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,226
Good. I would hate to think

667
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:22,572
that you're getting
cold feet, Mr. Mayor.

668
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:40,798
Psst.

669
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,386
You okay?

670
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,351
Dumb question?

671
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:51,704
No.

672
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,643
You know, even after
everything that I've learned

673
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,387
about my father...

674
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:07,241
I just never expected
anything like this.

675
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:12,405
He ruined Emiko's life.

676
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:17,627
Just abandoned her.

677
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,840
Well, you don't have to.

678
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,910
You said you didn't want
to barge into her life

679
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,287
without knowing more about her,

680
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,727
and now you do, so
what's holding you back?

681
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,008
I just think that
I'll make things worse.

682
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,803
Oliver, you became the Green Arrow

683
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:37,296
to right your father's wrongs.

684
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:39,849
What your parents did
to Emiko and her mother

685
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:41,526
is beyond wrong.

686
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:46,710
You are a better man

687
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:49,231
than your father ever was.

688
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,455
Don't make the mistakes that he did.

689
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,876
Reach out to your sister.

690
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,090
Make things right.

691
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:11,496
When I agreed to this deal,

692
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:13,474
no one said anything

693
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,435
about sticking a bomb
in the back of my head.

694
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,721
Didn't we?

695
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:22,299
Do it.

696
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:30,055
Tracking is activated,

697
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:32,095
and the subcortical incendiary is armed.

698
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,663
So this is your failsafe.

699
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,317
You are, which is why we need

700
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,578
to take every precaution
to keep you in line,

701
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,721
because the second you step out of it...

702
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,866
Boom.

703
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,871
You'd better hope so, lady,

704
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:57,042
'cause if it doesn't...

705
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:00,438
I'm coming for you.

706
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:30,703
People say that revenge
corrupts the soul...

707
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:41,651
That if you go down that
path, you'll never come back.

708
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:53,432
But sometimes, embracing the darkness is

709
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:56,601
the only way to get justice.

710
00:40:56,603 --> 00:41:00,388
My name is Emiko Queen.

711
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,442
I will get justice for my mother,

712
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:05,795
and no one will stand in my way.

713
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:16,092
Hello, Emiko.

714
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:22,926
