1
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,051
Where you gonna go?

2
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,006
South.

3
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,521
What you gonna do?

4
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,801
Get warm.

5
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,249
I was with you at Hardhome.

6
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,289
We saw what's out there.

7
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,651
We know it's coming here.

8
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,241
How can you leave us now?

9
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,889
I did everything I could.
You know...

10
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,086
You swore a vow.

11
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,811
Aye, I pledged my life to the
Night's Watch. I gave my life.

12
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,211
For all nights to come.

13
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,931
They killed me, Edd, my own brothers!

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,685
You want me to stay here after that?

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,331
Riders approaching!

16
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,731
Open the gate!

17
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,561
This is good soup.

18
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,725
Do you remember those kidney pies
Old Nan used to make?

19
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,370
With the peas and onions?

20
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,243
We never should have left Winterfell.

21
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,925
Don't you wish we could go back
to the day we left?

22
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,481
I want to scream at myself,
don't go, you idiot.

23
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,891
How could we know?

24
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,801
I spent a lot of time
thinking about what an ass I was to you.

25
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,923
I wish I could change everything.

26
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,166
We were children.

27
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,810
I was awful, just admit it.

28
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,527
You were occasionally awful.

29
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,364
I'm sure I can't have been great fun.

30
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,364
Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

31
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,169
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

32
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,287
- Forgive me.
- All right.

33
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,323
All right, I forgive you.

34
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,763
You'd think after thousands of years,

35
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,207
the Night's Watch would have learned
how to make a good ale.

36
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,806
Where will you go?

37
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,125
Where will we go?

38
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,962
If I don't watch over you, Father's
ghost will come back and murder me.

39
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,164
Where will we go?

40
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,720
I can't stay here,
not after what happened.

41
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,802
There's only one place we can go.

42
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,961
Home.

43
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,369
Well, should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

44
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,005
We'll take it back from them.

45
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,646
I don't have an army.

46
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,806
How many wildlings did you save?

47
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,450
They didn't come here to serve me.

48
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,171
They owe you their lives.

49
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,050
You think they'll be safe here if Roose
Bolton remains Warden of the North?

50
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,726
- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

51
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,801
It's ours.

52
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,008
And Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.

53
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,801
Wherever they are, it belongs to our
family. We have to fight for it.

54
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,769
I'm tired of fighting.

55
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,049
It's all I've done since I left home.

56
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,884
I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.

57
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,725
I've killed wildlings.
I've killed men that I admire.

58
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,168
I hanged a boy younger than Bran.

59
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,171
I fought

60
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,689
and I lost.

61
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,283
If we don't take back the North,
we'll never be safe.

62
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,209
I want you to help me.

63
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,167
But I'll do it myself if I have to.

64
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,131
My lady.

65
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,205
Ser Davos.

66
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,322
Will you stay here at Castle Black?

67
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,007
I will do as Jon Snow commands.

68
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,169
You serve Jon Snow now?

69
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,602
He's the Prince That Was Promised.

70
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,124
Forgive me, my lady,
I had thought that was Stannis.

71
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,130
What happened down there?

72
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,727
There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

73
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,401
And Shireen?

74
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,090
What happened to the princess?

75
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,764
I saw what happened.

76
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,846
I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

77
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,651
- My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.
- We've met before.

78
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,523
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

79
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,809
Before Renly was assassinated
with blood magic.

80
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,330
That's in the past now.

81
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,730
Yes, it's in the past.

82
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,484
It doesn't mean I forget.

83
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,366
Or forgive.

84
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,611
He admitted it, you know.

85
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,046
Who did?

86
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,246
Stannis.

87
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,122
Just before I executed him.

88
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,089
The Defender of the Vale!

89
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,366
Uncle Petyr!

90
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,764
My lord.

91
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Come and see.

92
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,762
I missed your name day. Go on.

93
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,125
A falcon!

94
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,651
A gyrfalcon.

95
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,370
Greatest and rarest of birds.

96
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,242
Last time I saw you, Baelish,

97
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,291
you told me you were taking Sansa Stark
home with you to the Fingers.

98
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,441
Indeed I was.

99
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,090
And yet, not long ago,

100
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,449
we received reports that she has been
married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

101
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,206
On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon
by a large force of Bolton men.

102
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,843
Seemed to know exactly
when we were traveling

103
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,445
and exactly
whom we were transporting.

104
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,249
Do you take me for a fool?

105
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,684
Tell me, Lord Royce,

106
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,763
how many people knew
of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?

107
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,361
I shared my intentions with you
and no one else.

108
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,487
Slander a man in his own home,

109
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,370
you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

110
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,406
Your home is the Vale.

111
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,086
The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

112
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,606
And only his judgment concerns me.

113
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,691
Should we throw him
through the Moon Door?

114
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,926
My lord.

115
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,928
My lord, I have always
been faithful to House Arryn.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,924
To your father, to your mother,
and now to you.

117
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,520
Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?

118
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,167
Lord Royce has served the Vale well.

119
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,683
He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

120
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,570
If we could trust his absolute loyalty,

121
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,847
he would make a capable commander
in the wars to come.

122
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,241
You can trust
my absolute loyalty, my lord.

123
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,846
I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

124
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,407
Fine.

125
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,242
I bring good news.

126
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,800
My friends in the North tell me
Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

127
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,169
I expect she's headed to Castle Black
where her brother serves as Lord Commander.

128
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,402
But she won't be safe there.

129
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,323
Not with the Boltons after her.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,206
She's my cousin.

131
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,201
We should help her.

132
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,805
That was my instinct as well.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,445
Our lord has spoken.

134
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,321
Gather the Knights of the Vale.

135
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,841
The time has come to join the fray.

136
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,885
You invite
the enemy into our city.

137
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,961
I did.

138
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,526
As a clever man once told me,

139
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,764
we make peace with our enemies,
not our friends.

140
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,811
I don't make peace with the queen's
enemies. I kill the queen's enemies.

141
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,445
Yes, that's the military approach.

142
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,204
And how has that worked here
in Meereen?

143
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,483
I represent the diplomatic approach.

144
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,928
Our queen tried to make peace with
the Masters, and they tried to murder her.

145
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,005
We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

146
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,487
Trust me.

147
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,321
My own recent experience with slavery has
taught me the horrors of that institution.

148
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,890
How many days were you a slave?

149
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,730
Long enough to know.

150
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,927
Not long enough to understand.

151
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,401
I bought this dwarf for
a single gold honor.

152
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,241
And somehow, you've risen to
the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

153
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,643
It's most impressive.

154
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,326
And now you speak for
the Good Masters of Astapor.

155
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,528
Here's to reversals of fortune.

156
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,170
We came here to meet the queen,

157
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,846
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

158
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,763
Let's make this simple, shall we?

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,721
Tell me what you want.

160
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,765
We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.

161
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,640
Take your dragons
and your mercenaries and go.

162
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,530
Queen Daenerys
won't stay in Meereen forever.

163
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,170
Her path takes her westward.

164
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,686
When we last met,
I offered her ships,

165
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,445
so she could return to Westeros
where she belongs.

166
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,521
She refused them.

167
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
She refused them
because hundreds of thousands

168
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,727
of men, women and children
still lived in chains.

169
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,326
As they have since the dawn of time.

170
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Not anymore.

171
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,568
Oh, you think you're a free man now?

172
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,529
You still follow orders.

173
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,889
Just because your master has silver hair
and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.

174
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,849
Friends, friends. Friends.

175
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,730
Please.

176
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,364
There have always been those with
wealth and power and those with nothing.

177
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,091
That is the way of the world. I'm not
here to change the way of the world.

178
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,766
Slavery is the way of our world.

179
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,561
You don't need slaves to make money.

180
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,211
There haven't been slaves in Westeros
for hundreds of years,

181
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,288
and I grew up richer than any of you.

182
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,371
But our queen recognizes
that she erred

183
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,082
by abolishing slavery without
providing a new system to replace it.

184
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,321
So, here is the queen's proposal.

185
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,808
Slavery will never return to Meereen,

186
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,451
but she will give
the other cities of Slaver's Bay

187
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,409
time to adjust to the new order.

188
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,925
What does that mean?

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,321
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,

190
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,847
we will give you seven years
to end the practice.

191
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,722
Slaveholders will be compensated for
their losses, of course, at fair prices.

192
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,169
In exchange, you will cut off your support
for the Sons of the Harpy.

193
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,844
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.

194
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,844
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

195
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,161
I do hope you accept, my friends.

196
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,202
You will not receive a better offer.

197
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,444
Let us sail on the tide of freedom

198
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,091
instead of being drowned by it.

199
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,049
And as a parting gift
to our honored guests.

200
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,082
Give freedom a chance.

201
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,960
See if it doesn't taste every bit as good
as what came before.

202
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,368
My friends!

203
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,688
Large sorry...

204
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,570
you wait so fat time.

205
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,482
Perhaps I should translate for you.

206
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,164
We speak the Common Tongue.

207
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,801
Excellent.

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,929
- You met with the slavers today.
- I did.

209
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,321
Our brothers and sisters died
fighting these scum.

210
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,324
Now you invite them to our city
and drink wine with them?

211
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,766
I imagine this room was built

212
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,808
so the rulers could intimidate
the ruled.

213
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,961
But I am not your ruler.

214
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,127
I'm not the Breaker of Chains.

215
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,407
I'm not the Unburnt.

216
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,689
And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

217
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,885
You are a stranger here.

218
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,811
So why do you represent Meereen
in these talks with our enemies?

219
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,804
Because our queen chose me
as her advisor.

220
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,404
Until she returns from her travels...

221
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,050
When does she return?

222
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,726
Soon. You have my word.

223
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,962
We don't know you.
We don't trust you.

224
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
We know Torgo Nudho.

225
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,560
We fight with him against the Masters.
We trust him.

226
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,809
And that is exactly why
Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.

227
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,081
As commander of the Unsullied,
he knows how to defeat the slavers.

228
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,964
And he knows when it is time
to make peace.

229
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,487
You have made peace with the slavers?

230
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,445
We offered terms.

231
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,522
And you, Grey Worm?

232
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,443
You want to drink wine with these men?

233
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,481
The men who tore us from our mothers' arms
and sold us at auction like cattle?

234
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,887
I am a soldier, not a politician.

235
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,247
But if there is a chance for peace...

236
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,926
a just peace...

237
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,805
we should take it.

238
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,091
Missandei.

239
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,365
You know what these men are.
How can you trust them?

240
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,811
I do not trust them.
I will never trust them.

241
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,763
But as a wise man once said,

242
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,329
we make peace with our
enemies, not our friends.

243
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,803
Do not use me for your lies.

244
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,291
Those men respect you.

245
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,762
They respect me because they know who I am.
They know I am loyal.

246
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,966
As do I.

247
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,125
I am loyal to my queen, not you.
If you betray her work, you are my enemy.

248
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,283
I am not betraying her work.
I am trying to save her city.

249
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,641
You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

250
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,926
For a short time.

251
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,651
Seven years is not a
short time for a slave.

252
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,487
You're right.

253
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,961
Slavery is a horror
that should be ended at once.

254
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,691
War is a horror that
should be ended at once.

255
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,489
I can't do both today.

256
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,085
You are wrong to trust these men.

257
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,128
I don't trust the Masters.

258
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,611
I trust their self-interest.

259
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,651
They're trustworthy if they're convinced that
working with me is in their self-interest.

260
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,564
You don't know them.
You don't understand them.

261
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,369
We are not human in their eyes.

262
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,683
They look at me and see a weapon.

263
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,888
They look at her and see a whore.

264
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,930
They look at me
and they see a misshapen little beast.

265
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,048
Their contempt is their weakness.

266
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,249
They'll underestimate us every time,
and we will use that to our advantage.

267
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,407
You will not use them.

268
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,801
They will use you.

269
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,405
That is what they do.

270
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,407
You all right?

271
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,329
Why don't you sit and catch
your breath?

272
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,681
I'm fine.

273
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,088
I don't think you could ride the dragon.
Twenty years ago maybe.

274
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
What?

275
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,251
Our queen. She's wild, you know.

276
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,488
Don't let her size fool you.

277
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,847
It's hard enough for me,
and I'm a young man.

278
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,921
You...

279
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,287
I don't think your heart could take it.

280
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,881
Must make you angry
that our queen chose me.

281
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,570
Makes me sad.

282
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,291
You'll disappoint her before long.
She'll move on.

283
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,725
We'll all disappoint her before long.

284
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,401
We need each other right now.
After we're done needing each other...

285
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,131
Oh, I don't want to fight
you, Jorah the Andal.

286
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,850
What do I have to gain?

287
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,685
If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

288
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,684
If I lose, I'm the shit
who was killed by an old man.

289
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,649
You didn't get much discipline
as a child, did you?

290
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,561
None.

291
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,730
The road running through the Horse Gate,
they call that the godsway.

292
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,201
Eastern Market, Western Market.

293
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,441
When Khal Drogo died,

294
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,490
she was supposed to come here
and join the Dosh Khaleen,

295
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,528
the widows of the dead khals.

296
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,689
That's where they'll have taken her.

297
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,009
The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

298
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
What are you doing?

299
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,451
It's forbidden to carry weapons
in the sacred city.

300
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,603
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city
and steal their khaleesi?

301
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,728
If they spot us and we're unarmed,

302
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,371
we'll say we're traders
heading for the Western Market.

303
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,566
But if they see weapons...

304
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,849
You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.

305
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,561
There's 100,000 of them down there.
We can't fight our way out.

306
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,405
We wait till dark,
and then we'll find her.

307
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,369
I'm very attached to this knife.

308
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,687
Don't worry. It didn't touch you.

309
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,367
You know what happens?

310
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,004
I know what happens.

311
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,761
I'll do it myself.

312
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,323
I should have been born a Dothraki.

313
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,280
Come on.

314
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,571
My friends...

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,641
We wandered off from the
Western Market and got lost.

316
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,883
Could you show us the way back?

317
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,166
What do you sell?

318
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,366
Wine.

319
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,764
Come down to my stall tomorrow,

320
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,526
I'll give you
a cask of the Arbor's finest.

321
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,683
You're not merchants.

322
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,125
Get the others.

323
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,170
Told you,
I'm very attached to this knife.

324
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,330
You all right?

325
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,687
If they find a body
with a stab wound,

326
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,808
the whole city
will be looking for us.

327
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,843
Some of them don't think Dothraki
should breed with foreigners.

328
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,087
They are stupid old women. They don't realize
that we have always diluted our blood.

329
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,128
This one is Lhazareen.

330
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,443
Her Khal found her hiding in a well
after he burned her village.

331
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,643
How old were you?

332
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,284
Twelve.

333
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,970
A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter.
How did he show his happiness?

334
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,647
He broke my ribs.

335
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,008
We are not queens here, but the khals
depend on us for our wisdom.

336
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,324
Our lives have meaning.

337
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,245
That is more than most have.

338
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,089
When the khals meet
for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night,

339
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,322
I hope they let you live
out your days with us.

340
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,849
The other possibilities
are not so pleasant.

341
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,684
I need to make water.

342
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,571
You can't run from Dothraki.

343
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,330
You know this.

344
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,011
I will never run from Dothraki.

345
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,086
Go, show her.

346
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,683
I needed fresh air.

347
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,685
The old women stink.

348
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,645
They do stink.

349
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,001
You must have been very young
when your Khal died.

350
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,366
Sixteen.

351
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,641
Too bad he didn't die sooner.

352
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,648
Yes, too bad.

353
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,166
Is it true you have three dragons?

354
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,643
And they breathe fire?

355
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,881
They do.

356
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,727
Would you like to see them one day?

357
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,203
I am Dosh Khaleen.

358
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,047
I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise
as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.

359
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,648
- No, don't hurt her.
- She'll give us away.

360
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,767
We have to go now.

361
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,967
We will never get out
of Vaes Dothrak alive.

362
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,241
All we can do is try.

363
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,847
No.

364
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,169
We can do more than that.

365
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,924
And you're going to help me.

366
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,046
And you...

367
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,204
Have faith in me, Khaleesi.

368
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,243
Do not betray me.

369
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,161
If I were to let you leave right now,
where would you go?

370
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,720
What would you seek out?

371
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,365
I'd go to my brother,

372
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,730
my husband, my family.

373
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,365
Of course,

374
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,128
but for you, that means
seeking out money, finery, power.

375
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,971
Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

376
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,849
I'm not maligning you.

377
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,161
I sought those things out too.

378
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,088
To the exclusion of all else.

379
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,769
My father was a cobbler.

380
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,128
He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

381
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,522
He was a simple man
and he made simple shoes.

382
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,002
But I found that the more work
I put into my shoes,

383
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,610
the more people wanted them.

384
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,170
You know, fine leather,
ornamentation, detailing,

385
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,806
and time.

386
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,330
Time, most of all.

387
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,131
Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.

388
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,929
Quality takes time.

389
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,047
Yes.

390
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,728
I imagine you've worn a year
of someone's life on your back.

391
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,721
The highborn liked to
cover their feet with my time,

392
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,121
and they paid well for the privilege.

393
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,250
I used their money
to buy a taste of their lives for myself.

394
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,804
Each time I indulged, I felt myself
ascending to something better.

395
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,646
And one day, you walked through a graveyard
and realized it was all for nothing,

396
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,485
and set out on the path to righteousness.

397
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,040
Book of the Stranger, verse 25.

398
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,609
You know The Seven-Pointed Star.

399
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,331
Septa Unella reads it to me.
At me.

400
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,200
Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

401
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,321
You're close.

402
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,887
But it wasn't a graveyard.

403
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,530
It was a feast.

404
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,571
I bought old fine wine
and young pretty girls,

405
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,931
and invited my friends
to come and share it all.

406
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,441
We passed around the wine,
passed around the women,

407
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,046
and soon we fell into a stupor.

408
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,289
I woke before dawn.

409
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,211
I could barely stand.

410
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,281
Everyone else was asleep
on the couches or on the floor,

411
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,406
lying in heaps next
to their fine clothes.

412
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,647
The truth of their bodies laid bare.

413
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,210
I could smell them

414
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,331
beneath the incense and the perfume,

415
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,081
and the fine food
that had already started to turn.

416
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,651
And I saw it with perfect clarity.

417
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,521
I saw what my sins were.

418
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,810
The gold I had, the wine I drank,
the women I used,

419
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,169
my ceaseless struggle
to maintain my position.

420
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,888
It was all part of a story.

421
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,450
A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

422
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,405
A collection of lies
that would disappear in the light.

423
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,490
The people I was trying
to climb away from,

424
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,569
the beggars in the street,
the poor,

425
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,325
they were closer to the
truth than I ever was.

426
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,010
So, what did you do?

427
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,883
I left to go and find them.

428
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,687
I didn't even put on my shoes.

429
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,808
I walked out the door

430
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,530
and never went back.

431
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,248
Come, let's go and see him.

432
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,727
- Who?
- Your brother.

433
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,041
Loras.

434
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,365
Loras.

435
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,369
Listen to me.

436
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,283
You need to stay strong.

437
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,571
I can't stay strong.

438
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,046
- I never was strong.
- You are strong.

439
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,011
You are the future of our house,
the future of our family.

440
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,411
I don't care about that.

441
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,446
Have you told them that?
That you don't care?

442
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,451
I just want it to stop.

443
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,445
Help me.

444
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,284
They want me to help you.

445
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,602
They want me to help tear you down.

446
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,444
That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

447
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,967
And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

448
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,769
Let them win.

449
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,285
Just make it stop.

450
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,401
Please.

451
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,281
All right.

452
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,891
And now, how to avert disaster
with our current predicament.

453
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,928
This High Sparrow.

454
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,970
I have dealt with fanatics
of every description, Your Grace.

455
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,761
Not setting them off,
that's the most important thing.

456
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,764
You are beset with enemies,
both within and without.

457
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,251
What are you doing here?

458
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,882
I am advising the king
on our current predicament.

459
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,362
- Leave.
- I am a member of the Small Council.

460
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,243
- The king...
- Is this a Small Council meeting?

461
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,526
Obviously not.

462
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,888
I'm here to lend my wisdom
and my support.

463
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,362
Thank you for your counsel,
Grand Maester.

464
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,647
That will be all for now.

465
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Your Grace.

466
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,886
Since I've missed the past
several Small Council meetings,

467
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,361
I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

468
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,805
I've been thinking
about the High Sparrow.

469
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,405
As have we all, unfortunately.

470
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,084
We need to be careful
in dealing with such a man.

471
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,160
To prevent things from
escalating any further.

472
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,288
We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

473
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,566
He has Margaery.

474
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
We can't put her at risk.
He's dangerous.

475
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,250
Look at me.

476
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,683
What did they do to me?

477
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,569
To the king's own mother?

478
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,041
It's all right.

479
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,402
It's done. It's in the past.

480
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,766
And of course,
Margaery's safety is paramount.

481
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,686
You don't like Margaery, do you?

482
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,524
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

483
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,963
Margaery is the queen.

484
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,443
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

485
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,444
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

486
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,966
The High Sparrow
has no respect for kings or queens.

487
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,804
No respect for anything
in this world.

488
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,724
He has no use for
the things of this world.

489
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,566
He wants to knock them down,
and replace them with what?

490
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,688
With fantasies.

491
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,569
With beggars in the street.

492
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,926
With nothing.

493
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,921
Mother.

494
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,730
There's something I want to tell you.

495
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,483
Something the High Sparrow told me.

496
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,010
You've spoken with him?

497
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,721
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out...

498
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,167
It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly,

499
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,164
given his constant
prattling about the truth.

500
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,803
I am your mother.

501
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,842
You can always trust me.

502
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,443
The Small Council meeting
has been postponed on the king's orders.

503
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,091
I would have thought
we were perfectly clear the first time.

504
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,161
You're not welcome.

505
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,844
You once spoke of your
respect for our father

506
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,009
because he understood
the necessity of working with one's rivals.

507
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,041
My dear, you have been stripped
of your dignity and authority,

508
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,806
publically shamed
and confined to the Red Keep.

509
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,291
What's left to work with?

510
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,806
Cersei is the mother of the king.

511
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,848
She has the king's ear and his trust.

512
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,809
And the king has been speaking regularly
with the High Sparrow

513
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,167
about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

514
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,368
The High Sparrow seized power
knowing full well

515
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,569
we'd bicker amongst ourselves
instead of seizing it back.

516
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,608
Here we are. Well done to us.

517
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,767
Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms
rests in his dirty peasant hands.

518
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,003
In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.

519
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,282
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

520
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,007
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins
before the good people of the city.

521
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,887
Oh, no.

522
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,684
That cannot happen.

523
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,325
That will not happen.

524
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,971
I agree.

525
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,686
You've got
the second largest army in Westeros.

526
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,040
You'll bring them into the city,

527
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,046
stop Queen Margaery's humiliation
before it starts,

528
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,691
and take her back into Crown custody.

529
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,005
The king has ordered me to take no action
against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant

530
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,565
out of fear for the queen's safety.

531
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,563
You will take no action at all.

532
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,246
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

533
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,284
Were you expressly forbidden
from standing down?

534
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,886
No, but if the king should call...

535
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,930
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

536
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,886
When the High Sparrow is in custody,
or dead, preferably,

537
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,691
and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

538
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,922
do you think
the king will be angry at the outcome?

539
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,806
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

540
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,000
You hate what they've done
to your son.

541
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,801
Do you want Lancel back?
Or have you given him up for good?

542
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,844
Of course I want him back.

543
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,327
Then stand aside

544
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,681
and let the people that took him
from you be destroyed.

545
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,169
If it doesn't go as planned, the
Sparrows have many friends in this city.

546
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,091
We'll have civil war.
Many will die.

547
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,367
Many will die no matter what we do.

548
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,889
Better them than us.

549
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,001
They told me you were home,
and I didn't believe it.

550
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,844
Theon Greyjoy? I said.

551
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,206
He's dead.

552
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,528
He's been dead a long time.

553
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,848
He let you go?

554
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,046
I escaped.

555
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,689
I can't hear you.

556
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,205
I escaped.

557
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,366
Look at me.

558
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,401
Look at me.

559
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,525
Men died trying to rescue you.

560
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,886
Good men.

561
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,761
My men.

562
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,930
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,771
You were my brother.

564
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,001
You were a spoiled little cunt,
but you were my brother,

565
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,004
and I risked everything for you.

566
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,082
- And you betrayed me.
- I know.

567
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,322
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- Stop saying that.

568
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,810
He broke me.

569
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,409
He broke me into 1,000 pieces.

570
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,811
- I know.
- You don't know.

571
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,724
He sent us one of those pieces.

572
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,370
That's why I came for you.

573
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,011
Why did you come here?

574
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,360
Where else could I go?

575
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,046
You heard father was dead
and you thought you'd claim the crown?

576
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,322
No. No, I only heard he
died after we docked.

577
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,165
You happen to show up on Pyke
right before the Kingsmoot?

578
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,685
I didn't know.

579
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,969
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king?

580
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,929
After what you've done?

581
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,968
I don't want to be king.

582
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,650
What do you want?

583
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,050
I should have listened to you.
You're the only...

584
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,646
That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

585
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,961
Look at me!

586
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,050
Tell me what you want.

587
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,007
You should rule the Iron Islands.

588
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,449
Let me help you.

589
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,289
They've cleaned you up nicely.

590
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,971
You know who I am?

591
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,047
A lord.

592
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,167
Yes.

593
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,526
A lord.

594
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,810
You've seen my banners?

595
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,610
The flayed man.

596
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,364
Does that worry you at all?

597
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,801
You eat them after?

598
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
No.

599
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,883
Then I've seen worse.

600
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,169
You served the Starks?

601
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,366
Aye.

602
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,762
They put me in chains
and put a sword at my throat,

603
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,126
so I served them.

604
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,885
The Starks have been gone
for a long time,

605
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,451
but you kept protecting Rickon.

606
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,569
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

607
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,329
I served his family a long time.
Didn't get no wages.

608
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,284
Way I see it, I'm owed.

609
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,369
Be that as it may,

610
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,647
Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.

611
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,571
He's mine.

612
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,484
So, what use could I possibly
have for you?

613
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,402
I can give you what you want.

614
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,642
And you're sure
you know what that is?

615
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,641
Same thing men always want.

616
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,724
And when they really want it,

617
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,962
they give it a bath first.

618
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,522
You're a good talker.

619
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,481
I like that.

620
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,963
You're a much better talker
than Theon Greyjoy.

621
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,244
That so?

622
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,687
I had to work hard to get him talking.

623
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,681
But he talked.

624
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,010
They all do.

625
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,691
He told me everything.

626
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,760
All about the Stark boys,

627
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,161
who helped them escape

628
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,526
and how she did it.

629
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,445
Open the gate!

630
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,209
Sorry about the food.

631
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,370
It's not what we're known for.

632
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,807
That's all right.
There are more important things.

633
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,650
A letter for you, Lord Commander.

634
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,283
I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

635
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,001
To the traitor and bastard,
Jon Snow.

636
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,244
You allowed thousands of wildlings
past the Wall.

637
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,881
You have betrayed your own kind.
You have betrayed the North.

638
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,883
Winterfell is mine, bastard.

639
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,325
Come and see.

640
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,562
Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

641
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,768
His direwolf's skin is on my floor.
Come and see.

642
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,001
I want my bride back.

643
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,807
Send her to me, bastard, and I will not
trouble you or your wildling lovers.

644
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,886
Keep her from me,
and I will ride north

645
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,567
and slaughter every wildling man, woman
and babe living under your protection.

646
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,844
You will watch as I skin them living.
You...

647
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,965
Go on.

648
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,770
It's just more of the same.

649
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,202
You will watch as
my soldiers take turns raping your sister.

650
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,561
You will watch as my dogs devour
your wild little brother.

651
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,843
Then I will spoon your eyes
from their sockets

652
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,649
and let my dogs do the rest.

653
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,085
Come and see.

654
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,290
Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

655
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,766
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

656
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,491
His father's dead.

657
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,526
Ramsay killed him.

658
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,726
And now he has Rickon.

659
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,801
We don't know that.

660
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,081
Yes, we do.

661
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,926
How many men does he have
in his army?

662
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,880
I heard him say 5,000 once
when he was talking about Stannis' attack.

663
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,291
How many do you have?

664
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,124
That can march and fight?

665
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,080
Two thousand.

666
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,085
The rest are children and old people.

667
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,010
You're the son of the last true
Warden of the North.

668
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,482
Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

669
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,129
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

670
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,283
We have to go back to Winterfell
and save them both.

671
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,365
It is forbidden
to spill blood in the sacred city.

672
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,762
It is forbidden
to carry weapons in the sacred city.

673
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,649
So we don't spill blood!

674
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,485
Well, there's always a little blood.

675
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,803
Someone crushed his head with a rock.

676
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,087
Aggo belonged to my khalasar.

677
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,043
He served me well.

678
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,527
He got his head smashed in by a rock.

679
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,647
Fuck Aggo.

680
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,648
Bring in Drogo's widow.

681
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,002
Who cares about her?
She's a midget.

682
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,844
I like her.

683
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,763
She's paler than milk.

684
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,446
I'd like to know what a
khaleesi tastes like.

685
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,521
Good.

686
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,125
You can suck my dick.

687
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,765
She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.

688
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,281
The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her.

689
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,250
They're offering ten thousand horses
in exchange.

690
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,606
What's worth more,

691
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,326
one pink little girl or
ten thousand horses?

692
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,768
Fuck the Wise Masters
in their perfumed asses.

693
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,366
I'll take their horses for myself.

694
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,611
Don't you want to know
what I think?

695
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,442
You'd rather be sold into slavery?

696
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,123
Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko
here what you taste like?

697
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,605
No.

698
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,489
I don't want either of those things.

699
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,324
We don't care what you want.

700
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,528
This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

701
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,204
You have no voice here,

702
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,442
unless you are Dosh Khaleen.

703
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,251
Which you are not,
until we decide you are.

704
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,121
I know where I am.
I have been here before.

705
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,001
This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced
my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.

706
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,003
And what happened?

707
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,481
You trusted a sorceress, like a fool.

708
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,207
Your baby is dead because of you.

709
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,601
And so is Khal Drogo.

710
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,485
This is where Drogo promised to take his
khalasar west to where the world ends.

711
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,360
To ride wooden horses across the Black
Salt Sea as no khal has done before.

712
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,368
He promised to kill the men in their iron
suits and tear down their stone houses.

713
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,203
He swore to me
before the Mother of Mountains.

714
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,521
And you were dumb enough
to believe him.

715
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,720
And here, now, what great matters
do the Great Khals discuss?

716
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,002
Which little villages you'll raid,

717
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,210
how many girls you'll get to fuck, how
many horses you'll demand in tribute.

718
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,521
You are small men.

719
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,123
None of you are fit to lead
the Dothraki.

720
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,046
But I am.

721
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,521
So I will.

722
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,965
All right.

723
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,568
No Dosh Khaleen for you.

724
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,602
Instead we'll take turns fucking you.

725
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,526
And then we'll let our
bloodriders fuck you.

726
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,043
And if there's anything left of you,

727
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,644
we'll give our horses a turn.

728
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,768
You crazy cunt.

729
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,807
Did you really think
we would serve you?

730
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,089
You're not going to serve.

731
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,929
You're going to die.
