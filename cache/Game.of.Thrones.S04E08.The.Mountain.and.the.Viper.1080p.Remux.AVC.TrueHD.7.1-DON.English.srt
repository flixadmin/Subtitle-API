(FLIES BUZZING)

170
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,644
I'm Kenning,

171
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,230
commander of this garrison.

172
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,400
And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?

173
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,152
Yes.

174
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,073
And why should I believe that?

175
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,991
I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.

176
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,244
His third and last living son.

177
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,080
I am your prince.

178
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,290
I swear it by the Drowned God.

179
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,584
What is dead may never die.

180
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,586
MEN: What is dead may never die.

181
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,214
And if you were my prince,

182
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,257
why are you marching with a Bolton army?

183
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,344
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.

184
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,348
He sent me to treat with you in good faith
as your fellow ironborn.

185
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,141
And what does Lord Bolton want?

186
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,396
You are fading from sickness,

187
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,900
you are badly outnumbered,
and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

188
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,152
Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men

189
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:47,948
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

190
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,994
Do this, and he will be just and fair with you
as he has been with me.

191
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,208
The Boltons will give you
safe passage to the Stony Shore.

192
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,627
He wants us to surrender?

193
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,713
My own father, your king,

194
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,633
surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.

195
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,136
I watched him bend the knee.

196
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,345
There was no shame there.

197
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,390
He fought with honour, as did you.

(SPITS)

202

"No shame." "Fought with honour."

203
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,325
Only a whipped dog would speak this way.

204
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,037
Or a woman.

Are you a woman, boy?

207
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,334
You don't know...

208
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,336
The ironborn will not surrender.

209
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,255
(MUMBLING) My name is Reek...

210
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,634
You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy,

211
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,678
or whoever the fuck you are.

212
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,513
(QUIETLY) Reek.

213
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,932
- What in the hell are you muttering?
- Reek.

214
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,811
Reek.

215
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,695
If we yield, we live?

216
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,448
- Is that what it says on this paper here?
- Yes.

217
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,117
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

218
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,246
You're going home.

219
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,630
RAMSAY: You didn't really think
I'd let them go, did you?

220
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,508
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

221
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,636
Sad, but true.

222
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,721
Traditions are important.

223
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,641
Where are we without our history? Eh?

224
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,809
Yes, my lord.

225
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,687
Will we go home now?

226
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,273
I believe we will.

227
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,317
To our new home.

ROYCE: You have foreign blood,
don't you, Baelish?

229
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,084
A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.

230
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:08,838
I suppose all of our ancestors
came from somewhere else originally.

231
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,425
ROYCE: Our forebears settled the Vale
thousands of years ago.

232
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,511
We've fought off invaders ever since.

233
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,182
The beauty of the Vale is matched
only by the nobility of its great families.

234
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,520
Lady Arryn often told me that
you were her rock, Lord Royce.

235
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,731
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.

236
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,150
But I didn't need to hear from her.

237
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,027
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

238
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,239
You've been licking
Tywin Lannister's boots so long,

239
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,116
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord...

240
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:40,412
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

241
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,790
Always been a grubby job.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

242
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,960
But when I heard you were lurking here,

243
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,672
- fawning over the Lady Arryn...
- Lady Arryn invited me.

244
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,383
She and I have been close since childhood.

245
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,052
Yes, we all know how close you were.

246
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,888
Lady Arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

247
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,598
Her death is our affair.

248
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,435
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

249
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,480
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

250
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,732
But suicide?

251
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,068
She adored that boy of hers.

252
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,654
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

253
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,824
ROYCE: Strange that within days
of your arrival,

254
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,868
you've married Lady Arryn

255
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,162
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

256
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,040
She was always prone to melancholy.

257
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,126
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

258
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,919
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

259
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,088
A niece of yours, I believe.

260
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,718
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

261
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,094
I assure you, she would be of no help.

262
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,971
We'd like to speak with her.

263
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,060
- Let me fetch her.
- ANYA: No need.

264
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,979
We prefer to
hear her testimony unadulterated.

265
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:58,782
(DOOR CLOSES)

266
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,533
Come closer, child.

267
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,537
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

268
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,375
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

269
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,709
Your name is Alayne?

270
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:15,048
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.

271
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,549
- My lady...
- I wasn't asking you.

272
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,675
He can stay.

273
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,719
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

274
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,804
Tell us what you saw.

275
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,477
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

276
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,020
I have to tell the truth.

277
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,319
I'll tell you everything.

278
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:40,198
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

279
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,328
My name is not Alayne.

280
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,704
It's Sansa Stark,

281
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,749
eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

282
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,419
Lord Royce,
we met when you came to Winterfell.

283
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,089
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar
to the Wall.

284
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,007
Sansa Stark?

285
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,262
You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?

286
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,181
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

287
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,019
All to protect me.

288
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,314
Since my father was executed,

289
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,443
I have been a hostage in King's Landing.

290
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,822
A plaything for Joffrey to torture
or Queen Cersei to torment.

291
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,117
They beat me, they humiliated me,

292
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,369
they married me to the Imp.

293
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,539
I had no friends in King's Landing,

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,793
except one.

295
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,302
He saved me.

296
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,638
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

297
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,061
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie
with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

298
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,483
But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.

299
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,942
Even the Vale.

300
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:01,488
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

301
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,239
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

302
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,451
ROYCE: Your father grew up
right here in these halls.

303
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,620
We hunted together many times.

304
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,205
He was a fine man.

305
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,125
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

306
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,590
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

307
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,258
She was a troubled woman.

308
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,221
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.

309
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,474
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

310
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,269
a boy of eight
carrying everything he owned in a little sack.

311
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:38,525
She confessed to me
she never loved Lord Arryn.

312
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,028
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

313
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,199
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with Lord Baelish,

314
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,118
she was so happy. For a time.

315
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,748
My aunt was a jealous lady.

316
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:59,546
She was terrified that
Lord Baelish didn't love her any more.

317
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,549
That he would abandon her
for a younger woman.

318
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,971
And then,

319
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,015
one day she saw him kiss me.

320
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,350
Lady Sansa.

321
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,853
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce,
nothing more.

322
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,316
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.

323
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,610
He's always been so kind to me.

324
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,738
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

325
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:26,864
All because of him.

326
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,993
But my aunt turned on me.

327
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,121
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

328
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,416
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

329
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:40,545
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

330
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,838
She said she didn't want to live any more.

331
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,007
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.

332
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,925
He tried to reason with her,

333
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,429
promised her
she was the only one he had ever loved,

334
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,057
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

335
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,521
(SHUSHING)

336
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,316
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

337
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,240
It's not your fault.

338
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,674
ROYCE: You could see it in the way
she raised that boy.

339
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,677
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

340
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,764
ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

341
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,807
Apologies, my lady.

342
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,144
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

343
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,023
You want justice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

344
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,316
I want the same.

345
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:48,029
ANYA: Not much justice to be
meted out in suicide, is there?

346
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,406
LITTLEFINGER: For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

347
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,659
Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale

348
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:56,162
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

349
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,666
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

350
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:03,002
And since then, Arryn and Royce,
Corbray, Waynwood,

351
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,214
all the great houses of the Vale
watched from the corner.

352
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,716
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

353
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,386
Are you questioning our courage?

354
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,013
I want to know which side you're on.

355
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,974
Do you support the Lannisters, the house
that executed your friend Ned Stark?

356
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,727
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

357
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,939
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support, and Lysa refused.

358
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,108
By staying out of the fray,

359
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,237
you've allowed Tywin Lannister
to destroy his rivals on every compass point.

360
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,780
Who stands against him now?

361
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,408
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?

362
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,243
Robb Stark is dead.

363
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,829
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

364
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,288
Lord of the Vale.

365
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,624
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

366
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,002
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

367
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,046
More often they die young.

368
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,716
I adored Lysa with all my heart,

369
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,886
but she loved her son so much
she became overprotective.

370
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,598
He needs to learn how to swing a sword,
how to ride a horse.

371
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,102
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes.

372
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:05,273
Time for him to tour the Vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

373
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,651
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

374
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,829
(GRUNTING)

375
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,839
BOY: Ser Barristan.

376
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,674
Yes?

377
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,011
Who sent you?

378
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,049
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

379
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,885
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

380
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,512
No.

381
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,689
What's this?

382
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,901
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

383
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,584
You spied on her.

384
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,255
Who gave you this?

385
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:54,340
Does it matter?

386
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:08,479
- Have you told her?
- I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,

387
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,690
rather than go behind your back.

388
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,611
Let me speak with her in private.

389
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,864
You'll never be alone with her again.

390
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,986
Why did the usurper pardon you?

391
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,699
If we could speak alone.

392
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,869
No, speak to me here.

393
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,787
Explain it to me.

394
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,999
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?

395
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,169
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.

396
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,129
He wants to divide us.

397
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,632
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

398
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,593
The pardon was signed the year we met.

399
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,721
Why were you pardoned?

400
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,098
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

401
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,603
It is not forged.

402
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,605
Why, then?

403
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,398
I sent letters to Varys,

404
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,360
the spymaster of King's Landing.

405
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,070
What was the content of these letters?

406
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,572
- Information.
- What information?

407
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:45,242
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

408
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,078
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.

409
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,288
When you were married.

410
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,207
When your brother died.

411
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,626
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

412
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,461
- I...
- Yes or no?

413
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,629
- Khaleesi.
- Don't call me that.

414
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,799
Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?

415
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:03,970
Yes.

416
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,518
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

417
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,311
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

418
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,438
Because you knew it was poisoned.

419
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,649
I suspected.

420
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,401
You betrayed me

421
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,320
from the first.

422
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,239
Forgive me.

423
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,616
I never meant...

424
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,452
Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

425
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,580
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

426
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,749
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you,

427
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,377
- fought for you, killed for you.
- ...and you want me to forgive you?

428
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,506
I have loved you.

429
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,258
Love?

430
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,553
Love? How can you say that to me?

431
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,514
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

432
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,684
But you,
I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

433
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,897
Go back to your masters in King's Landing.
Collect your pardon, if you can.

434
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,236
Daenerys, please.

435
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,199
Don't ever presume to touch me again
or speak my name.

436
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,119
You have until dusk to collect your things
and leave this city.

437
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:13,581
If you're found in Meereen past break of day,

438
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,125
I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay.

439
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,755
Go.

440
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,799
Now.

441
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,481
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

442
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,024
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

443
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,783
Walk with me.

444
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,285
Has there been any word from Locke?

445
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,787
No.

446
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,707
Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy.

447
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,710
None of the northern lords have seen them.

448
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,463
Dead most likely.

449
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,385
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.

450
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,264
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

451
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,560
Tell me what you see.

452
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:04,483
Moors, fields, hills.

453
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,236
Tell me what you see.

454
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,909
Nothing.

455
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,912
Not nothing. The North.

456
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,915
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

457
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,460
400 miles that way.

458
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,713
300 miles that way.

459
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:29,633
The North is larger than
the other six kingdoms combined.

460
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,052
And I am the Warden of the North.

461
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,346
The North is mine.

462
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,267
Now tell me, what is your name?

463
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,064
Ramsay Snow.

464
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,442
No, not Ramsay Snow.

465
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,111
Open it.

466
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,489
From this day until your last day,

467
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,533
you are Ramsay Bolton,

468

son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

I swear I will uphold your name
and your tradition.

472
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:14,011
I will be worthy of you, Father,

473
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,846
I promise.

474
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:37,618
Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

476
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,564
Yes?

(DOOR CLOSES)

478
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,998
First time I saw you, you were just a child.

479
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,084
A girl from the North
come to the capital for the first time.

480
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,753
You're not a child any longer.

481
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,093
Why did you help me?

482
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:40,431
They would have thrown you through
the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

483
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,891
That's not an answer.

484
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,230
If they'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

485
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,734
I don't know.

486
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,736
Neither do I.

487
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:59,033
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

And you think you know me?

489
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,375
- I know what you want.
- Do you?

490
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:26,018
ARYA: I thought it'd make me happy,

491
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,103
but it doesn't. Not really.

492
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,897
HOUND: Nothing makes you happy.

493
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,690
- ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

494
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,400
ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

495
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:37,071
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,

496
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,197
is that it?

497
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,990
ARYA: At least I could have
been there to watch.

498
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:42,701
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

499
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:46,163
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

500
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,959
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

501
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,879
I wasn't the damn wine-taster.

502
00:36:55,506 --> 00:37:00,344
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

503
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,179
Poison's a woman's weapon.

504
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,139
Men kill with steel.

505
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:08,394
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

506
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,355
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone
if I had to.

507
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,439
(LAUGHS)

508
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,776
I'd pay good money to see that.

509
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,694
(GROANS)

510
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,781
You should have let me burn it.

511
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,450
It's a fleabite.

512
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,579
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

513
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,999
HOUND: Well, we won't have to walk
too much further.

514
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,668
You really think my aunt will pay for me?

515
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,253
Aye.

516
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,088
I've never even met her.

517
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,341
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

518
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,053
Family, honour, all that horseshit.

519
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,181
It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.

520
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,475
I'm not a lady.

521
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,186
KNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

522
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,065
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

523
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,942
And his

524
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,529
travelling companion, Arya Stark,

525
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:03,699
niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.

526
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,493
Then I offer my condolences.

527
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,454
Lady Arryn died.

528
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,209
Three days ago.

529
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,715
(LAUGHING)

530
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,848
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

531
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,481
I've never left home before,
Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

532
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:36,815
You shouldn't be.

533
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:40,068
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie,
Mother said.

534
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,154
It's not safe outside.

535
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,697
It wasn't safe for her inside.

536
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,701
People die at their dinner tables.

537
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,578
They die in their beds.

538
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,165
They die squatting over their chamber pots.

539
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,417
Everybody dies sooner or later.

540
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,586
Don't worry about your death.

541
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,797
Worry about your life.

542
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,927
Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.

543
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,388
That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.

544
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,766
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

545
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,122
Shall we go?

546
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,962
(GULPING)

547
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,007
Wine always helps.

548
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,594
I thank you for it.

549
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,515
Trial by combat.

550
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,936
Deciding a man's guilt or innocence

551
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,813
in the eyes of the gods

552
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,149
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

553
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,819
Tells you something about the gods.

554
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,406
How much longer?

555
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,992
Soon.

556
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,705
Do you think Oberyn has a chance?

557
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,793
The Red Viper of Dorne.

558
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,129
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

559
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,589
I've never seen him fight.

560
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:26,383
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

561
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,928
- Oberyn believes in himself.
- That's putting it mildly.

562
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,015
What's the punishment for regicide?

563
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,976
Drawing and quartering? Hanging?

564
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,437
- Breaking at the wheel?
- Beheading.

565
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,105
Seems rather ordinary.

566
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,441
And he was my nephew as well,
so what is that?

567
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:46,320
Fratricide is brothers and filicide is sons.

568
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,738
(URINATING)

569
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,032
Nepoticide. That's the one.

570
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,704
Matricide, patricide,

571
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,540
infanticide, suicide.

572
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,085
There's no kind of killing
that doesn't have its own word.

573
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,797
- Cousins.
- You're right.

574
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,133
There is no word for cousin-killing.

575
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,968
Well done.

576
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,304
Do you remember Cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

577
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,849
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him
on his head and left him simple.

578
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,517
Simple?

579
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:21,021
Used to sit all day in the garden
crushing beetles with a rock.

580
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,399
(BOTH GRUNTING)

581
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,820
- (CHUCKLES) Nothing made him happier.
- Nothing made you happier.

582
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,447
You'd think being tormented from birth

583
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,741
would have given you
some affinity for the afflicted.

584
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,284
On the contrary.

585
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:35,952
Laughing at another person's misery

586
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,871
was the only thing that
made me feel like everyone else.

587
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,167
- The joke wore thin, though.
- For you. You drifted away.

588
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,418
I had other interests.

589
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,462
Yes, other interests.

590
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,759
- But I stayed with Orson.
- Why?

591
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,053
I was curious.

592
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,431
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?

593
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,142
First thing I did was ask him.

594
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,312
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

595
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,523
He gave me an answer.

596
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,442
"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em."

597
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,819
(GRUNTING)

598
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,822
I wasn't deterred.

599
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,407
I was the smartest person I knew.

600
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,784
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

601
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,078
that lay at the heart of a moron.

602
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,164
So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

603
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,250
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

604
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,794
Turns out, far too much
has been written about great men

605
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,213
and not nearly enough about morons.

606
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,632
Doesn't seem right.

607
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:34,553
In any case, I found nothing that
illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction

608
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,431
or the reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

609
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:40,016
So I went back to the source.

610
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,935
I may not have been able to speak with Orson,

611
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,730
but I could observe him, watch him

612
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,898
the way men watch animals

613
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:49,776
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behaviour.

614
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,406
And as I watched,

615
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,033
I became more and more sure of it.

616
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,369
There was something happening there.

617
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:02,414
His face was like the page of a book

618
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,499
written in a language I didn't understand.

619
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,335
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

620
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,672
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

621
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,425
I began to spend
inordinate amounts of time watching him.

622
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,429
I would eat my lunch in the garden,

623
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,181
chewing my mutton to the music of...

624
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,474
(GRUNTING)

625
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,227
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

626
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,354
Father droned on about the family legacy,

627
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,315
and I thought about Orson's beetles.

628
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:31,109
I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.

629
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,111
Did I hear dragon wings? No.

630
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,279
I heard...

631
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,947
(GRUNTING)

632
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,785
And I still couldn't figure out
why he was doing it.

633
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,371
And I had to know, because it was horrible

634
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,707
that all these beetles should be
dying for no reason.

635
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,292
Every day around the world,

636
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:51,087
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

637
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,632
Who gives a dusty fuck about
a bunch of beetles?

638
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:57,219
I know. But still it filled me with dread.

639
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,971
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

640
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,890
How many countless living, crawling things

641
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,893
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

642
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,813
In my dreams I found myself

643
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,898
standing on a beach made of beetle husks

644
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,400
stretching as far as the eye could see.

645
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:17,072
I woke up crying,
weeping for their shattered little bodies.

646
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,865
I tried to stop Orson once.

647
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:20,116
He was twice your size.
