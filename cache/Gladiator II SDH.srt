I cannot endure.

I remember well when you first

A lonely boy from the desert. Guileless.

154

Afraid.

155
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,126
You embraced everything we taught you.

156
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,508
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

157
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,096
[chuckles] When I die,

158
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,973

in the next world.

00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,731
I am done.

169
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,442
Eama! Eama!

170
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,241
[woman] You must go alone now, Hanno.

Never let them find you.

[woman's breath trembling]

173
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,420

General Acacius.

183

I have taken Numidia in your names

184
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,594
that your dominion may eclipse that
of every emperor that came before you.

185
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,512
Crown him with laurels, brother.

there will be games in the Colosseum.

191
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:14,788
I require no games in my honor.

192
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:19,293
Serving the Senate and the people of Rome

193
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,086
is honor enough for me.

194
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,255
You are too modest, Acacius.

195
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,134
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

196
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,055
The glory is yours, not mine.

197
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,558
I only ask for some respite from war

198
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,019
to spend time with my wife.

199
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,521
Your wife, yes. [sniffs]

200
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,315
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

201
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,608
[sword scraping]

202
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,943
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

203
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,904
There are victories yet still to come.

204
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,866
Persia.

205
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,243
India.

206
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,495
[chuckles]

207
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,998
Both... must be conquered.

208
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,919
Rome has so many subjects.

209
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,463
She must feed them.

210
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,966
They can eat war. [laughs]

211
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,972
Your triumphs will be celebrated

212
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,226
as a tribute to the greatness

213
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,311
of the Roman people.

214
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:29,780
- [men shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

215
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:42,793
[man] Go to hell!

216
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,921
[people jeering]

217
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,601
[piercing animal shrieks]

218
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,687
[men shouting]

219
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,399
[announcer] Macrinus of Thysdrus,

220
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,693
- master of gladiators!
- [horn playing fanfare]

221
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,154
[crowd roars]

222
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,406
[animal screeching nearby]

223
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,002
[animal snarling]

224
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,132
- [screeching continues]
- [loud thumping]

225
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,092
Stay close.

226
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,470
- [snarling, thumping continue]
- [chains rattling]

227
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,138
[door thudding]

228
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,562
[crowd roaring]

229
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,358
[shouting, jeering]

230
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,196
[announcer] Aediles
and the town councilors,

231
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,491
distinguished guests,

232
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,577
citizens of Antium...

233
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,662
[jeering continues]

234
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,541
...behold the fate

235
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,504
of the conquered enemies of Rome:

236
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,635
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

237
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,388
Jugurtha!

238
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,224
[loud thudding]

239
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,017
- [snarling]
- [teeth snapping]

240
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,498
[man shouting, indistinct]

241
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,086
- [blows]
- [baboon shrieks]

242
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:53,924
[screeches]

243
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,303
[yells]

244
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,813
- [screeches]
- [Hanno yells]

245
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,029
[growling]

246
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,034
[guttural hooting]

247
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,634
[screeching in agony]

248
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,970
This one is interesting.

249
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,305
[all cheering]

250
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,807
[grunts]

251
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,143
[spits]

252
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,231
[yelling]

253
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,287
[baboon choking]

254
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,206
I'll buy him.

255
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,500
[crowd chanting]

256
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,356
- [horse approaching]
- Halt! Who goes there?

257
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,150
General.

258
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,383
[woman murmuring softly]

259
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,229
My lady.

260
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,864
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

261
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,993
Thank the Army. They protected me.

262
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,912
Mm.

263
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,623
Let me feed you.

264
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,466
[indistinct chatter]

265
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,553
- [men grunting]
- [weapons clashing]

266
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,360
[trainer] Go.

267
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,446
To the wall.

268
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,125
[trainer] The arena is a sacred temple.

269
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,377
For the bravest of you,

270
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,671
the road to glory runs through the arena.

271
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:24,384
The arena turns slaves into gladiators
and gladiators into free men.

272
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,226
You have worms.

273
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,609
I know this one. He eats monkeys.

274
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,986
[men laughing]

275
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,866
[indistinct chatter]

276
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,042
[trainer] Go. Sit. Eat.

277
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,558
[groans softly]

278
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,112
[man hoots quietly]

279
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,824
[men hooting]

280
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,869
[men mimicking baboons]

281
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,001
[hooting continues, louder]

282
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:48,969
[chuckles]

283
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:58,728
You.

284
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,690
[trainer] Hanno, get up.

285
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:12,576
What is your native language?
I speak them all.

286
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:19,374
You don't answer
because you can't or because you won't?

287
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,752
Mm, all right.

288
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:26,673
Violence... is the universal language.

289
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,426
Viggo, put him through his paces.

290
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:33,346
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

291
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,983
[grunts]

292
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,611
[Hanno groans]

293
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,579
[Hanno exhales heavily]

294
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,588
[both grunting]

295
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,812
[groans heavily]

296
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,648
[chuckling]

297
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,412
[explosive grunt]

298
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,334
[Macrinus] Enough!

299
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:48,338
[panting]

300
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,048
Very good.

301
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:52,926
Very good.

302
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,346
Hose him down.

303
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,559
Bring him to me.

304
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,314
[grunts]

305
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,859
Ah!

306
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,531
A strong jaw.

307
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,826
Good arms.

308
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,286
[sniffs]

309
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,662
Better smell.

310
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,664
[chuckles lightly]

311
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,208
You will do well.

312
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,252
It is an art,

313
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,796
choosing gladiators.

314
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,924
Some choose entertainers.

315
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,719
Some choose brute force.

316
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,262
I choose rage.

317
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,556
[Macrinus chuckles]

318
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:42,767
Crowd loves blood.

319
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,145
And they love those who love blood
as much as they do.

320
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,605
And you, my friend, rage

321
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,567
pours out of you like...

322
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,570
like milk...

323
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,531
from a whore's tit.

324
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,326
You will be quite the fighter.

325
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,410
Not for you.

326
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,121
You're right, you do not fight for me.

327
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,582
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

328
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:06,833
The choice is yours.

329
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,127
But whose head could I give you

330
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:13,590
that would satisfy this fury?

331
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,592
The entire Roman Army's.

332
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,677
[hearty laugh]

333
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,221
Too much.

334
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,931
Mm.

335
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,100
The general will do.

336
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,060
General?

337
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,438
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

338
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,360
Use your rage in my service,

339
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:37,238
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

340
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,534
Serve me and I will serve you. Deny me...

341
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:45,497
and you will die.

342
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,374
[thunder rumbles in distance]

343
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,251
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

344
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,087
rather than fight their wars.

345
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,130
I've made my choice.

346
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,051
I can live with it.

347
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:05,100
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

348
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,229
Leta?

349
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,691
You may go to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

350
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,534
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

351
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,285
on that beach at Numidia...

352
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,456
Lucilla.

353
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,046
No more.

354
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:38,842
I will not waste

355
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:43,179
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

356
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,935
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

357
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,939
When will your troops arrive?

358
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,151
They land at Ostia in ten days.

359
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,446
How many of them
will be loyal to you alone?

360
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,199
All of them.

361
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,163
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

362
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:13,460
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

363
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,463
[sighs]

364
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:20,842
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

365
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,553
[chuckles softly]

366
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,766
[whimpers]

367
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:33,771
[excited chatter]

368
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,654
[laughing]

369
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,158
[man] Enjoy yourself, everyone,

370
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,327
to excess!

371
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,954
Thank you. Thank you.

372
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:54,000
[castrato singing to lively music]

373
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:04,135
Oh!

374
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:07,972
[laughs] Please, drink.

375
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,892
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

376
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,896
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

377
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,149
- I'm just here for the games.
- Ah, well,

378
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,859
you won't be disappointed.

379
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,154
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

380
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,490
Men like me, Thraex? Men like us.

381
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:29,410
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've tasted it first.

382
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:30,787
[both laughing]

383
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,220
What is my purpose here?

384
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,680
You'll find out soon enough.

385
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,520
What's this we hear
about you being interested

386
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:59,357
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

387
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,943
Me? No, I'm, uh...

388
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,696
I don't even know how to use an abacus.

389
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:06,281
But I do understand that

390
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:11,619
it's customary for your guests
to make wagers at these affairs?

391
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,871
How large a sum did you have in mind?

392
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,041
A thousand gold denarii?

393
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,376
Two.

394
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:21,546
Two?

395
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,758
- Denarii.
- [chuckles]

396
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,054
[sighs deeply]

397
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,098
[knife scraping]

398
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,402
Stand back! Stand back!

399
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,572
My emperors.

400
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:51,743
Lords, ladies and gentlemen, and senators.

401
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,078
For your entertainment,

402
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,165
the art of combat!

403
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,208
[crowd murmurs, clapping]

404
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,002
[Thraex] May I present

405
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,921
the barbarian versus,

406
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,425
from my own stable, the mighty Vichek!

407
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:09,469
[applause, cheers]

408
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,185
- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

409
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,274
[Thraex] Three rounds, hand to hand.

410
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,525
Swords!

411
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:28,279
We want swords. A fight to the death.

412
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:32,659
No quarter to be offered... or given.

413
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:34,786
- Fight now!
- [swords scraping]

414
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,376
Brother,

415
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,337
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

416
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,797
[Vichek yells, grunts]

417
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,341
[excited murmuring]

418
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,134
[both yell, grunt]

419
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:00,853
[cackling]

420
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:03,356
[both yelling]

421
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,079
[Vichek panting]

422
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:21,791
[yells]

423
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:27,046
[sword clattering]

424
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,966
[scattered cheers, applause]

425
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,098
[Hanno groans]

426
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:47,400
[scattered cheers]

427
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:49,110
[applause]

428
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,155
[Geta] Remarkable!

429
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:54,615
[giggling]

430
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,200
Remarkable!

431
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,412
- Thraex, he looked expensive.
- [dry chuckle]

432
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,957
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

433
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,293
Remarkable.

434
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:11,382
From where do you hail?

435
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,389
Speak.

436
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:25,104
- I said speak.
- He is from the colonies, Your Majesty.

437
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:27,482
His native tongue is all he understands.

438
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,991
"The gates of hell are open night and day.

439
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:43,581
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

440
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,669
[laughing] But...

441
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,256
to come back from hell

442
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,842
and view the cheerful skies,

443
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:59,430
in this the task and mighty labor lies."

444
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,100
[panting]

445
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,313
Virgil, Your Majesty.

446
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:09,482
[Caracalla] Poetry!

447
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:11,526
[laughter]

448
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,446
- Very clever, Macrinus.
- Thank you.

449
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:19,116
I've grown so bored, but you surprise me.

450
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:22,245
To amuse you is my only wish.

451
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,080
We are amused, we are amused.

452
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,416
We are amused.

453
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:31,712
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

454
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:34,423
perform in the arena.

455
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,385
As do I, Your Majesties.

456
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:39,220
Thank you.

457
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:40,721
Viggo?

458
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,516
[Viggo] Come with me.

459
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:04,120
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

460
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:08,416
The lines you recited.

461
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,627
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

462
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:14,797
- A good verse travels far.
- Mm.

463
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,841
Who taught you poetry?

464
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,093
A captured Roman officer.

465
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:22,763
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

466
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:24,348
to pass the time.

467
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:26,601
And what became of this prisoner?

468
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,102
Oh, we ate him.

469
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,563
As barbarians do.

470
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:33,024
[chuckling] As barbarians do.

471
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,317
And where were you born?

472
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:39,697
Why does my past matter if it is my future
to die for you in the arena?

473
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,581
Tell me what use have I for Roman money.

474
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,377
A gladiator

475
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:57,048
- can buy his own freedom.
- Mmm.

476
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:58,925
- His liberty.
- [chuckles]

477
00:45:59,884 --> 00:46:01,636
The Roman dream.

478
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,932
No, the slave dreams not of freedom
but of a slave to call his own.

479
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,559
Cicero.

480
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,146
Is that what you were raised on, Macrinus?

481
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,400
What did you have to do for Roman money?

482
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:19,278
You promised me a head.

483
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:22,156
Earn your keep
and you can have anyone's head.

484
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:32,750
[stone scraping]

485
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,502
[door unlatches, opens]

486
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:43,010
[thunder rumbling]

487
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,640
[Lucilla] Father,

488
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,768
protect us and guide us.

489
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,033
Senators.

490
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:07,868
My lady.

491
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,461
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

492
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,297
Better times will come.

493
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,010
And why are we here?

494
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:25,928
[Acacius] To take back the city.

495
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:31,350
And restore Rome to where she should be.

496
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,687
An exciting venture.

497
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,357
- When?
- On the final day of the games.

498
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,360
My army waits for my command at Ostia.

499
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:44,905
Five thousand soldiers loyal to me...

500
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:48,951
will enter Rome and then the Colosseum,

501
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:52,496
where they will arrest the emperors
for their crimes against the Senate

502
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:54,915
and their people.

503
00:47:55,916 --> 00:48:00,212
Uh, this plan is ambitious and risky.

504
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:03,758
Rome will be yours to administer and to--

505
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:08,512
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power to the Senate,

506
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:12,058
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

507
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,978
The people have not seen hope

508
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,397
for many years.

509
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:22,151
But with time... and guidance...

510
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:27,198
[sighs sharply] Lucilla,
you are the daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

511
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:29,283
He had my loyalty.

512
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,995
And so do you.

513
00:48:35,331 --> 00:48:36,749
Senator Thraex?

514
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,879
Politics follows power, my lady.

515
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:46,050
Take back what is rightfully yours...

516
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:49,095
and the Senate will support you.

517
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:51,388
Thank you.

518
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:08,906
Food! Food!

519
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,204
When I was told of this place,

520
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,207
they never mentioned the stink.

521
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,418
That would be Hanno.

522
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,672
[laughter]

523
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:27,591
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

524
00:49:27,675 --> 00:49:29,051
[laughing]

525
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:35,808
And what's that up there? A wolf?

526
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:40,020
The twins there, they were outcasts.

527
00:49:40,938 --> 00:49:42,606
Left in the hills to die.

528
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:47,695
That wolf found them
and she suckled them on her milk.

529
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,365
Raised by an animal. It's in their blood.

530
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:53,450
How do you know this place?

531
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:57,454
I know the chaos they brought.

532
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:01,500
This city infects everything it touches.

533
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,669
I never dreamt it would be so big.

534
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,504
Don't fall for it.

535
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,548
This city is diseased.

536
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,010
[peasants] Food! Food!

537
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:15,931
[children chattering]

538
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:20,311
[elephant trumpeting]

539
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:22,396
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

540
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,203
[man] You! Barbarian scum!

541
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,789
- [grunts]
- [people yelling]

542
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,127
[woman] Help me. Please, help me!

543
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,298
[all pleading]

544
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,386
[horses whinnying]

545
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:04,313
[crows squawking]

546
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:23,165
- Ah!
- Thraex.

547
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:28,087
About our wager.

548
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,922
Ah. The barbarian.

549
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,924
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

550
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:35,344
I was merely going to suggest
that perhaps your luck might change.

551
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,763
Shall we say double or quits?

552
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:43,519
- Ah.
- Ah.

553
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,521
[both laughing]

554
00:51:50,234 --> 00:51:52,486
[people shouting, indistinct]

555
00:51:55,823 --> 00:51:57,157
[man] Get back!

556
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:12,965
Fresh meat.

557
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,887
Line up! Line up!

558
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:35,112
[faint crowd cheering]

559
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,908
[cheering continues, louder]

560
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,087
Play! Play!

561
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,133
[playing simple fanfare]

562
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:09,605
Emperor Caracalla.

563
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:11,774
Emperor Geta.

564
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:15,194
Citizens of Rome!

565
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:16,862
[crowd cheering]

566
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,990
These sacred games

567
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:23,327
are held to honor the victory of Rome

568
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,497
over the barbarians of Numidia.

569
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,706
[crowd booing]

570
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,292
Go! Go!

571
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:36,715
[announcer] And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

572
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:39,009
General Justus Acacius!

573
00:53:39,093 --> 00:53:41,762
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Long live Acacius!

574
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:43,222
[announcer] And with him

575
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:48,102
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

576
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:49,812
[crowd cheering]

577
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:53,357
- [woman, faintly] Lucilla!
- [man] Mother of Rome!

578
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:55,651
Acacius.

579
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,361
General.

580
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:04,993
[crowd roars]

581
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:08,414
[chanting] Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

582
00:54:08,497 --> 00:54:13,502
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

583
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:15,546
Speak to them.

584
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,673
[man faintly] Speak to us!

585
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,223
[cheering ebbs]

586
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:27,975
I am not an orator

587
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,686
or a politician.

588
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,605
I am a soldier.

589
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:40,821
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

590
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:43,824
And even once in this arena.

591
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:47,077
So if you ask anything of the gods...

592
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:51,373
ask for that same bravery.

593
00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:55,794
Because Rome needs it now.

594
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:58,881
[applause, cheers swelling]

595
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,801
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

596
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:06,054
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

597
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:10,100
[chanting continues]

598
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:21,236
[announcer] From the South Gate,

599
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:26,325
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

600
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:40,923
From the stables

601
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:44,593
of Emperors Caracalla and Geta themselves,

602
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:47,262
the undefeated champion:

603
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:51,016
Glyceo the Destroyer!

604
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:52,851
[crowd roars]

605
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:58,565
Hold.

606
00:55:58,649 --> 00:56:00,484
[growling]

607
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,907
[grunting]

608
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:14,164
[roaring cheers]

609
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,878
[rhino roaring]

610
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,215
[Hanno] Hold.

611
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,134
Hail Caesars!

612
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:31,223
[crowd chanting] Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

613
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,267
[chanting continues]

614
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,399
[rhino roars]

615
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:46,071
Hold together and when it charges,
break for the wall.

616
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:46,989
[man] Why should I?

617
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:52,119
[Hanno] Hold!

618
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,454
Hold!

619
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:55,747
Break!

620
00:56:56,498 --> 00:56:57,749
Cowards!

621
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:01,295
[yells]

622
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:03,922
[groaning]

623
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:08,343
- [yells]
- [axe clattering]

624
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,763
[huffing]

625
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:13,890
To the wall!

626
00:57:15,017 --> 00:57:16,184
[grunts heavily]

627
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,479
[rhino groaning loudly]

628
00:57:19,563 --> 00:57:20,981
[grunts]

629
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:28,196
- Come on!
- [roars]

630
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:34,328
[grunts]

631
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:36,830
[screaming]

632
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:39,958
[cheering]

633
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:41,418
[giggling]

634
00:58:17,913 --> 00:58:20,123
[guttural roaring]

635
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:43,897
[rhino bellowing]

636
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,192
[excited cheering]

637
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:50,153
[rhino groaning]

638
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,245
[gasps]

639
00:59:00,122 --> 00:59:01,540
[both grunting]

640
00:59:08,964 --> 00:59:09,881
[roaring]

641
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:13,135
Brother, it's that poet, is it not?

642
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:15,971
I can't remember.

643
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:17,723
That night was a blur.

644
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:21,810
"The gates of hell are open night and day.

645
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:24,980
Smooth the desc--" I forget.

646
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:26,815
"Smooth the descent..."

647
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:29,651
"Smooth is the descent,

648
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:31,903
easy is the way."

649
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:40,662
Shield!

650
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:09,775
[yelling]

651
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:20,327
[crowd chanting] Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

652
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:23,371
Blood.

653
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:27,542
Lucilla,

654
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:29,586
shall we show mercy?

655
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:31,254
Mercy.

656
01:00:33,465 --> 01:00:35,425
[chanting continues]

657
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:48,063
No mercy!

658
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,607
Your life has been spared by the gods--

659
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,694
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

660
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:02,035
[both grunting]

661
01:01:04,496 --> 01:01:05,622
[attacking yell]

662
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:06,665
[grunts]

663
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:09,125
[crowd roaring]

664
01:01:10,836 --> 01:01:14,256
[chanting] Kill! Kill! Kill!

665
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:17,467
Kill! Kill! Kill!

666
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:25,100
[yelling]

667
01:01:28,979 --> 01:01:33,942

[cheering intensifies]

669

[rhino groaning]

670
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:04,723
The road to freedom
doesn't run through the arena.

671
01:02:05,557 --> 01:02:07,058
It leads to this.

672
01:02:11,605 --> 01:02:13,023
Go to your cells.

673
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:17,319
[all cheering, clapping]

674
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:20,906
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

675
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:24,618
[panting]

676
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:35,879
[dog whimpers]

677
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,174
Come on, let's go.

678
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:55,649
"Gates of hell are open night and day.

679
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,360
[voice wavering] Smooth is the descent...

680
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:00,320
[crying]...easy is the way."

681
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:06,868
[boy] <i>There, there, there, there.</i>

682
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:08,203
<i>And I've got you.</i>

683
01:03:08,286 --> 01:03:10,956
<i>I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!</i>

684
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:32,560
Scatto and Argento.

685
01:03:34,813 --> 01:03:37,482
[people cheer, echoing]

686
01:03:40,944 --> 01:03:42,654
[gasping softly]

687
01:03:46,324 --> 01:03:47,659
Lucius is safe?

688
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,553
[Lucilla] Lucius!

689
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:18,440
[horse whinnies]

690
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:20,316
[Lucilla] Lucius,

691
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:24,195
you're the sole heir to the throne now.

692
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:28,825
There are men who want to kill you
so they can take power.

693
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:33,788
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

694
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:36,458
Mother, why can't you come with me?

695
01:04:37,584 --> 01:04:40,045
[crying] I... I have to stay here
for your sake.

696
01:04:40,128 --> 01:04:42,130
[sniffles] And for the sake of Rome.

697
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:43,840
Remember who you are.

698
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,634
And that I love you.

699
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:48,720
I love you.

700
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:50,680
[man] Come.

701
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:55,310
Give me your leg.

702
01:04:57,187 --> 01:04:58,938
Go. Go!

703
01:04:59,022 --> 01:05:00,356
[horse whinnies]

704
01:05:05,612 --> 01:05:07,072
[doctor] So...

705
01:05:08,448 --> 01:05:09,699
[Hanno grunts]

706
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:11,826
What's your name?

707
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:14,579
[exhales]

708
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:17,248
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

709
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:22,003
Because... more men die of infected wounds

710
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:24,589
than out there, in the arena.

711
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:28,885
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and...

712
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,679
[exclaims softly]...it is going to hurt.

713
01:05:31,763 --> 01:05:32,889
Mm.

714
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:36,017
This is Devil's Breath and opium.

715
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,186
It's for the pain.

716
01:05:39,187 --> 01:05:40,855
You should breathe in.

717
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:43,108
[inhales sharply, grunts]

718
01:05:43,191 --> 01:05:45,151
[deep inhale]

719
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:48,404
[Ravi] I've been here so long now,

720
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:50,949
I don't even notice anymore.

721
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:53,743
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

722
01:05:54,953 --> 01:05:57,580
- Where'd you learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

723
01:05:57,664 --> 01:05:59,290
You've got a heavy hand.

724
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,210
I used to be a gladiator myself.

725
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:03,461
Ah.

726
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:05,880
- And would you have bested me?
- [Ravi chuckles]

727
01:06:05,964 --> 01:06:07,423
In your prime, of course.

728
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,344
In your current state,
I could best you now.

729
01:06:11,427 --> 01:06:13,012
[laughs]

730
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:16,349
Luckily for you, I have put down my sword.

731
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:18,643
- So now I spend my days...
- [groaning]

732
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:21,312
...saving lives instead of taking them.

733
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:22,730
[inhales, grunts]

734
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:25,275
And why such a change so late in life?

735
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:28,403
What we do in life

736
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:30,321
echoes in eternity.

737
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,824
[panting softly]

738
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:36,244
I feel like I know those words.

739
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:38,872
[Ravi chuckles] I can't take credit.

740
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:41,541
It's written on one of the tombs.

741
01:06:41,624 --> 01:06:43,459
Over the bones of a gladiator.

742
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:45,837
- [sharp grunt of pain]
- [Macrinus] My champion!

743
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,006
I smell Devil's Breath!

744
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:50,341
[laughing]

745
01:06:50,425 --> 01:06:53,761
My... champion.

746
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,472
Did you hear that crowd?

747
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:01,686
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

748
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:05,857
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

749
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,777
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

750
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:12,155
<i>thymos.</i>

751
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:13,531
Smoke.

752
01:07:14,282 --> 01:07:15,617
Rage.

753
01:07:16,618 --> 01:07:18,661
That rage is your gift.

754
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,206
Like the great Achilles.

755
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,917
Never let it go.

756
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:27,587
It will carry you to greatness,

757
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,422
my champion.

758
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:40,683
[horses whinny, snort]

759
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,151
Thank you

760
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,237
for inviting me.

761
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:55,073
This is truly an honor.

762
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:02,121
I hear you are the talk of the court.

763
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:03,456
[kissing hand]

764
01:08:04,415 --> 01:08:05,416
Yes.

765
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:07,752
We've met before.

766
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:10,505
- Have we?
- Long ago.

767
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,591
Where?

768
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:17,303
I was in the service of your father's army
on his African campaign.

769
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,932
You served with my father?

770
01:08:21,516 --> 01:08:23,184
[groaning]

771
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:25,770
Mm.

772
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,523
I had the privilege

773
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,150
of reading his "Meditations."

774
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:32,443
Mm.

775
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:37,365
"The best revenge

776
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,744
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

777
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,624
I hear you've been arming half the legions

778
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:51,754
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

779
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:56,009
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

780
01:08:56,092 --> 01:08:58,177
I do it for the love of the sport.

781
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:01,222
And where did you find these gladiators?

782
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:04,976
They're usually prisoners of war.

783
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:08,563
Or vagrants. Why do you ask?

784
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:12,233
A man can choose to fight...

785
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:15,153
and stay alive.

786
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:17,864
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

787
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:23,161
Who is this?

788
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:25,580
That is my father as a youth.

789
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,084
[Macrinus] <i>She had a child?</i>

790
01:09:30,168 --> 01:09:31,919
Mm. [swallows]

791
01:09:32,003 --> 01:09:34,422
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

792
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:36,299
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

793
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:38,468
- But who would care?
- Lucilla would care.

794
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:41,179
- More wine!
- More wine!

795
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:46,017
He was of the royal bloodline, after all.

796
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:49,103
And his father?

797
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:53,107
[senator] Ostensibly, Lucius Verus.

798
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:55,818
See, it was an arranged marriage.

799
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:56,986
She was 14.

800
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:00,448
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

801
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:01,908
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

802
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:03,201
[both laugh]

803
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:07,789
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

804
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:12,001
And by rumor,
the real father... was Commodus.

805
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:15,463
- Brotherly love, you see?
- Yeah.

806
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:17,215
If he died,

807
01:10:18,216 --> 01:10:20,676
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

808
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,097
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

809
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:26,265
Um, well, let's work it out.

810
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:29,769
- He was about 12 when he died?
- Yes.

811
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:34,107
So that would make him...

812
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,986
[heavy door rumbling]

813
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,534
[squeaking]

814
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,960
[hoofbeats thudding]

815
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:10,601
My lady.

816
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:12,103
Gracchus.

817
01:11:13,271 --> 01:11:15,106
- Please come.
- Thank you.

818
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:35,293
Gladiator...

819
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:37,795
do you know me?

820
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:47,555
Do you have a family?

821
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:53,311
A wife. Arishat.

822
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:56,022
Arishat.

823
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:59,609
She was killed
under your husband's command.

824
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:04,530
[sighing] Rome drowns in its own blood.

825
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:06,908
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

826
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,078
There is much you do not understand.

827
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,920
Lucius.

828
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:21,214
I do not know who you think I am.

829
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:22,673
[Lucilla's breath trembles]

830
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:25,426
My name is Hanno,

831
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,929
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

832
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,600
[sniffles]

833
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:36,687
[crying] I'm so sorry.

834
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:38,898
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

835
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,900
not to grieve him.

836
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,735
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

837
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:44,779
That boy is dead.

838
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:49,283
You may think I have little worth.

839
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:52,954
You may think I betrayed you.

840
01:12:54,956 --> 01:12:56,707
But I need you to know...

841
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,128
if you will not have your mother's love,

842
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:04,048
then take your father's strength.

843
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:06,634
You need it.

844
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:13,140
His name was Maximus Decimus Meridius.

845
01:13:14,559 --> 01:13:16,060
And I see him in you.

846
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:17,478
Get out.

847
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:22,066
[Gracchus] My lady, we must go at once!

848
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:24,277
[Lucilla sobs]

849
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,196
Lucius, you were loved

850
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:30,491
by myself and by your father.

851
01:13:31,325 --> 01:13:32,285
[sniffles]

852
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:33,911
Your name was on his lips--

853
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:35,746
Get out!

854
01:13:40,668 --> 01:13:42,003
[panting]

855
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:43,921
[door shuts]

856
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,640
[Lucilla exhales]

857
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:03,691
Lucius is alive.

858
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:07,903
Are you certain?

859
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:09,238
Yes.

860
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,532
I know my son.

861
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:16,454
I spoke to him tonight.

862
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:22,918
He may be lost to me for what I did,

863
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:25,880
but he lives.

864
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:29,717
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

865
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,385
Most fighters won't survive.

866
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:32,803
Acacius,

867
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:35,681
you must help him.

868
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:38,392
- Help him?
- [crying] Yes.

869
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:43,397
I failed him then.

870
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:45,483
I know I did.

871
01:14:47,318 --> 01:14:49,403
I cannot fail him now.

872
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:53,532
The army is in Ostia.

873
01:14:53,616 --> 01:14:56,410
If we wait a few days...

874
01:14:56,494 --> 01:14:58,496
He could be dead by then.

875
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:01,916
Acacius,

876
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:05,586
I would willingly give my life for Rome,

877
01:15:06,796 --> 01:15:09,173
but I will not give my son's.

878
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:16,847
[Viggo] And one.

879
01:15:18,516 --> 01:15:19,517
And two.

880
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:23,104
- And one.
- [all groaning with effort]

881
01:15:23,187 --> 01:15:26,023
Together. Timing, timing, timing!

882
01:15:27,358 --> 01:15:30,361
And one. And two.

883
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,071
And one.

884
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:34,990
Pause, pause!

885
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:39,161
We won't get far like this.

886
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:40,746
[all laughing]

887
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,249
Just him. You go.

888
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:44,333
Go!

889
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:48,587
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

890
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:51,841
Ready?

891
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:53,134
One!

892
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:55,010
And two!

893
01:15:55,094 --> 01:15:57,138
Timing, timing!

894
01:15:57,847 --> 01:15:59,223
Come on, more!

895
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:01,559
[grunts]

896
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:05,563
[Viggo] More!

897
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:15,865
[Lucius groans loudly]

898
01:16:18,993 --> 01:16:20,745
[heavy grunt]

899
01:16:22,997 --> 01:16:24,206
Leave him.

900
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,292
[indistinct chatter]

901
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,211
[huffs, grunts]

902
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:40,723
[cork pops]

903
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,188
[stammering] It's just vinegar, my friend.

904
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,272
[pained groan]

905
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,983
There will be no more opium for you.

906
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:56,030
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

907
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:59,450
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it in this one.

908
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:05,664
Are you a free man, Ravi?

909
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:07,541
[dry chuckle] "Free."

910
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:11,670
I am. Mm.

911
01:17:11,754 --> 01:17:13,339
I laid down my sword

912
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:15,424
and I swore never to pick it up again.

913
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,092
And yet you choose this hell?

914
01:17:17,176 --> 01:17:18,803
Mm-hm.

915
01:17:18,886 --> 01:17:20,179
What was your home before?

916
01:17:21,472 --> 01:17:22,890
Varanasi.

917
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,391
And why don't you go back?

918
01:17:25,351 --> 01:17:26,811
I wish I could.

919
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:28,562
- [breath hissing]
- But... Eh-eh-eh.

920
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:33,192
- I met a woman. [laughs]
- Ah.

921
01:17:34,068 --> 01:17:35,903
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

922
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:40,533
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

923
01:17:40,616 --> 01:17:42,451
So now...

924
01:17:42,535 --> 01:17:45,496
our sons, they speak only Latin.

925
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,998
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

926
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:49,458
[chuckles lightly]

927
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:52,002
We are Romans now.

928
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,006
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

929
01:17:57,216 --> 01:18:00,052
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

930
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:06,767
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

931
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:10,855
or it would vanish.

932
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:12,773
[whispering] So,

933
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:14,984
what was this dream?

934
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:19,613
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

935
01:18:20,614 --> 01:18:22,449
A Rome of the Senate.

936
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:25,619
A Rome of hope.

937
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:33,127
Your grandfather,
he sounds like a dangerous man.

938
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,378
Hm.

939
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:38,549
The odds are against you.

940
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:40,759
[light chuckle]

941
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:43,637
The odds are always against me.

942
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:45,848
Don't worry, old man.

943
01:18:45,931 --> 01:18:47,766
- Eh?
- [both laughing]

944
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,643
[muttering]

945
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:53,355
- You should get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

946
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,901
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

947
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:07,828
[gates rumbling open]

948
01:19:07,912 --> 01:19:10,581
- [crowd cheering]
- [drums thudding]

949
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,960
This is about survival.

950
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:17,463
Survive!

951
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:21,342
[announcer] In the name of Poseidon,

952
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:25,596
we celebrate the glory of naval war.

953
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,431
[Lucius] They have archers.

954
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:29,975
Be ready. Listen for my commands.

955
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:32,811
Stay together and pull as one, yes?

956
01:19:32,895 --> 01:19:33,771
[all] Yes!

957
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:36,148
- Yes?
- Yes!

958
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:40,653
[hull creaking]

959
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,783
[announcer] Today we relive

960
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:49,411
the Battle of Salamis!

961
01:19:49,495 --> 01:19:50,537
[crowd cheering]

962
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:55,209
The Trojans versus the Persians!

963
01:19:59,797 --> 01:20:01,340
- Oars out!
- [all] Oars!

964
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:04,259
And... pull!

965
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:05,928
[all grunting explosively]

966
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:25,906
- Archers!
- [men yelling]

967
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,865
Archers!

968
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:30,035
Pull!

969
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,713
Pull!

970
01:20:40,796 --> 01:20:43,382
- [all grunting]
- [screams]

971
01:20:43,465 --> 01:20:44,425
Pull!

972
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:47,511
[grunts, screams]

973
01:20:53,017 --> 01:20:54,601
[muffled screaming]

974
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:57,646
[all yelling]

975
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:00,065
Pull! To my time!

976
01:21:00,858 --> 01:21:02,109
And... now!

977
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:07,156
Left side! Ready, and

978
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:09,199
ship oars now!

979
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:11,326
Oars in! Oars in!

980
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,204
Get down!

981
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,082
[screams]

982
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:19,918
[straining]

983
01:21:22,421 --> 01:21:24,506
[crowd cheering]

984
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:33,891
And pull! And pull!

985
01:21:33,974 --> 01:21:36,560
[men grunting rhythmically]

986
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:38,854
[man] Don't stop!

987
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:41,023
[grunting]

988
01:21:41,106 --> 01:21:42,357
Pull!

989
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:43,984
[men shout in unison]

990
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,320
And right!

991
01:21:51,992 --> 01:21:53,452
Ready to ram!

992
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:55,579
[Romans shouting, indistinct]

993
01:21:55,662 --> 01:21:58,207
And brace! Brace!

994
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,084
[all yelling]

995
01:22:06,215 --> 01:22:07,591
[all shouting]

996
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:15,349
[cheering]

997
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:25,150
[all grunting]

998
01:22:30,072 --> 01:22:31,198
[gasping]

999
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:39,581
[soldier] Everyone regroup!

1000
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:45,587
[screaming]

1001
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:47,506
[fighting grunts]

1002
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:13,949
[grunts]

1003
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:15,826
[crowd exclaiming]

1004
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,870
Praetorians!

1005
01:23:19,246 --> 01:23:21,748
[crowd chanting] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1006
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:22,791
Move, move.

1007
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:25,294
[chanting continues]

1008
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:32,885
[announcer] In the name of the emperors...

1009
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:37,514
the victor is Hanno!

1010
01:23:40,225 --> 01:23:42,436
[all chanting in support]

1011
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:51,111
Who did this?

1012
01:23:53,906 --> 01:23:56,074
Who did this?!

1013
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,410
- It was me!
- I did it!

1014
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:00,913
- [men] I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

1015
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,586
Geta will want retribution for all of you.

1016
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,506
Did you learn to shoot in the same place
you learned to recite poetry?

1017
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:14,218
Be glad it wasn't me,
or that arrow would have found you.

1018
01:24:14,301 --> 01:24:16,345
[men laughing]

1019
01:24:18,055 --> 01:24:20,140
[indistinct chatter]

1020
01:24:20,224 --> 01:24:22,559
[faint music playing]

1021
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:31,443
Be seated.

1022
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:35,364
I have news for you.

1023
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,328
He's here, sir.

1024
01:24:42,287 --> 01:24:44,414
[door opens]

1025
01:24:44,498 --> 01:24:46,458
[Macrinus] Oh, still here.

1026
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:48,585
[Thraex laughs nervously]

1027
01:24:48,669 --> 01:24:50,087
Macrinus.

1028
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:52,256
- [Macrinus chuckles]
- Welcome.

1029
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,050
Yes, I'm listening.

1030
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,886
You know this is my house now.

1031
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:02,516
Your debt to me is over 10,000 denarii.
You know that.

1032
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,435
[chuckles, stammers]
I have other things. Uh...

1033
01:25:05,519 --> 01:25:07,312
Cattle. Art!

1034
01:25:07,396 --> 01:25:09,022
Truth, then.

1035
01:25:09,106 --> 01:25:10,691
What do you... want?

1036
01:25:10,774 --> 01:25:12,776
Truth. That's what I want.

1037
01:25:13,527 --> 01:25:17,990
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

1038
01:25:19,116 --> 01:25:21,118
You have the senators' trust.

1039
01:25:21,994 --> 01:25:24,204
You have Lucilla's trust.

1040
01:25:24,288 --> 01:25:26,957
More importantly, you have my trust.

1041
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:33,005
You wish my... loyalty?

1042
01:25:33,088 --> 01:25:34,715
I own...

1043
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:38,051
your house.

1044
01:25:38,135 --> 01:25:40,345
I want your loyalty.

1045
01:25:44,516 --> 01:25:45,892
I...

1046
01:25:47,144 --> 01:25:48,937
Tell me. I have heard...

1047
01:25:49,021 --> 01:25:51,648
of a plot...

1048
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:54,568
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

1049
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:57,821
But the plan has been delayed, uh...

1050
01:25:57,904 --> 01:26:01,074
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

1051
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:02,576
- Tonight.
- Mm.

1052
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:05,746
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

1053
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:09,207
Pack.

1054
01:26:12,878 --> 01:26:14,379
Quickly.

1055
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:43,492
- [pounding on gate]
- [man] Open up!

1056
01:26:43,575 --> 01:26:45,619
[rats squeaking]

1057
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:00,258
[mastiffs growling]

1058
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:05,597
[man] Open for the emperors' guard!

1059
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,224
[pounding on door]

1060
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,415
[heavy knocking]

1061
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:36,503
My Lady, come with us.

1062
01:27:47,347 --> 01:27:48,974
[all grunting with impact]

1063
01:28:21,882 --> 01:28:26,803
Thanks to the civic virtue
of men like Thraex and Macrinus,

1064
01:28:28,138 --> 01:28:29,806
your insurrection

1065
01:28:30,557 --> 01:28:32,476
has been revealed.

1066
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:35,687
The honor,

1067
01:28:36,813 --> 01:28:40,609
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

1068
01:28:43,153 --> 01:28:45,405
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

1069
01:28:46,323 --> 01:28:47,616
Please, Emperor Geta.

1070
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,785
Torture me if you want,

1071
01:28:51,745 --> 01:28:53,121
but do not lecture me.

1072
01:28:53,205 --> 01:28:56,625
Your name will be forgotten!

1073
01:28:57,751 --> 01:29:00,754
Lost... to history.

1074
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:04,174
You are damned, General.

1075
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,967
[laughing]

1076
01:29:06,885 --> 01:29:08,803
- [Geta] You laugh.
- You damn me?

1077
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:11,431
I don't care.

1078
01:29:11,515 --> 01:29:15,310
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

1079
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:17,103
[Caracalla] Why wait?

1080
01:29:17,187 --> 01:29:20,398
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

1081
01:29:20,482 --> 01:29:23,109
Let them be. Come! Come!

1082
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,695
His death must be public.

1083
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:27,280
Public? [grunts]

1084
01:29:27,364 --> 01:29:30,242
Hang his entrails from the city gates!

1085
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:31,868
And crucify her!

1086
01:29:32,619 --> 01:29:34,120
Crucify her!

1087
01:29:34,204 --> 01:29:36,122
Take them away!

1088
01:29:36,206 --> 01:29:39,543
- [Caracalla yells]
- [Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

1089
01:29:52,722 --> 01:29:53,848
Thank you, Macrinus.

1090
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:01,523
Come on.

1091
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:06,861
In these last days,

1092
01:30:06,945 --> 01:30:10,198
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

1093
01:30:10,282 --> 01:30:12,492
but as a true friend.

1094
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:14,244
Thank you.

1095
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:16,997
Thank you so much. But as a friend,

1096
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,915
I must counsel caution.

1097
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:21,918
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

1098
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:27,257
Crucifixion is for thieves.

1099
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,425
Christians.

1100
01:30:29,593 --> 01:30:32,596
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor. He must die.

1101
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:33,930
I agree.

1102
01:30:34,014 --> 01:30:39,853
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

1103
01:30:46,276 --> 01:30:47,861
Let the gods decide.

1104
01:30:50,697 --> 01:30:54,701
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

1105
01:30:56,286 --> 01:30:58,246
This time, for the first time,

1106
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,789
I was crossing it.

1107
01:31:00,624 --> 01:31:02,292
[Ravi] Hm.

1108
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,878
Well, you know, where I come from,

1109
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:07,964
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

1110
01:31:08,048 --> 01:31:11,051
Represents... salvation.

1111
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:14,137
Where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

1112
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,055
[chuckles]

1113
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:24,981
But as I saw it, I was not afraid.

1114
01:31:26,733 --> 01:31:28,401
For...

1115
01:31:28,485 --> 01:31:31,321
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

1116
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:34,699
There. [sniffs]

1117
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:46,503
Who is this man?

1118
01:31:47,879 --> 01:31:49,297
Scratched out?

1119
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,258
Maximus.

1120
01:31:55,053 --> 01:31:57,013
I saw him fight once.

1121
01:31:58,098 --> 01:31:59,683
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

1122
01:31:59,766 --> 01:32:02,727
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

1123
01:32:02,811 --> 01:32:07,107
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

1124
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:08,983
Spoke of him.

1125
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:11,486
What he did.

1126
01:32:11,986 --> 01:32:13,863
I met him once.

1127
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:17,200
He was kind.

1128
01:32:19,536 --> 01:32:21,371
He bowed to no one.

1129
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,543
Come with me.

1130
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:29,629
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

1131
01:32:48,732 --> 01:32:52,944
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

1132
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:57,407
"What we do in life echoes in eternity."

1133
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:17,010
This is Argento.

1134
01:33:17,093 --> 01:33:18,595
This is Scatto.

1135
01:33:25,769 --> 01:33:28,688
[cheering, applause]

1136
01:33:32,233 --> 01:33:34,319
[drums thudding]

1137
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:44,954
[metal clanking]

1138
01:33:54,047 --> 01:33:56,049
[horns playing fanfare]

1139
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:00,637
Cheers.

1140
01:34:01,346 --> 01:34:02,722
And stop.

1141
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:08,478
For his treason against the lives

1142
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:13,274
of the emperors and the Roman state,

1143
01:34:13,358 --> 01:34:16,069
General Justus Acacius,

1144
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:20,490
an enemy of the people!

1145
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:23,076
[all chanting] Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

1146
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:25,495
- [man] We love you, Acacius!
- You are a hero!

1147
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:29,916
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

1148
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:33,211
[chanting continues]

1149
01:34:36,923 --> 01:34:39,175
[crowd roaring]

1150
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:56,150
[crowd jeering loudly]

1151
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:04,033
- [Acacius] <i>Vae victis.</i>
- [soldiers] General.

1152
01:35:04,117 --> 01:35:06,578
[all shouting, grunting]

1153
01:35:10,498 --> 01:35:11,875
[pained yell]

1154
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:14,002
[grunts]

1155
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:23,928
[crowd cheering]

1156
01:35:24,012 --> 01:35:25,972
[panting heavily]

1157
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:28,016
[scattered shouts] Acacius!

1158
01:35:29,225 --> 01:35:33,438
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

1159
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:36,983
[all continue chanting]

1160
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:43,406
[announcer]
From the vanquished city of Numidia,

1161
01:35:44,616 --> 01:35:49,871
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

1162
01:35:49,954 --> 01:35:52,457
Go now. <i>Vae victis.</i>

1163
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:59,672
[crowd chanting] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1164
01:35:59,756 --> 01:36:02,091
- Hanno!
- [crowd cheering]

1165
01:36:02,175 --> 01:36:04,969
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

1166
01:36:05,053 --> 01:36:06,763
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

1167
01:36:06,846 --> 01:36:10,141
[announcer] The Roman traitor or

1168
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:12,518
the barbarian hero.

1169
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:15,063
Let the gods decide.

1170
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:16,814
Lucius... wait.

1171
01:36:18,316 --> 01:36:19,567
Wait! Wait!

1172
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:21,861
[both grunting heavily]

1173
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:29,452
[overlapping cheers and jeers]

1174
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:32,246
I am a vessel.

1175
01:36:33,623 --> 01:36:35,833
Fill me with vengeance

1176
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:39,045
and vanquish the betrayer.

1177
01:36:42,006 --> 01:36:45,218
[attacking grunts]

1178
01:36:56,896 --> 01:36:59,148
- We love you, Acacius!
- Move it!

1179
01:37:03,277 --> 01:37:04,946
Pick it up!

1180
01:37:05,029 --> 01:37:07,407
[woman] Bravo, Hanno!

1181
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,950
[man] We love you, Acacius!

1182
01:37:09,033 --> 01:37:11,160
- [man 2] What are you waiting for?
- [man 3] You will die!

1183
01:37:11,244 --> 01:37:14,205
[cheering and booing]

1184
01:37:18,543 --> 01:37:20,253
[crowd whooping]

1185
01:37:23,339 --> 01:37:24,966
[both grunting heavily]

1186
01:37:27,927 --> 01:37:30,346
[crowd groaning]

1187
01:37:38,646 --> 01:37:40,398
[pained grunting]

1188
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:42,066
[panting]

1189
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:43,401
[Acacius] I know who you are.

1190
01:37:45,236 --> 01:37:47,238
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1191
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:56,164
[crowd groaning]

1192
01:37:58,124 --> 01:38:00,501
[crowd exclaiming]

1193
01:38:00,585 --> 01:38:02,545
Acacius has raised his hand!

1194
01:38:03,588 --> 01:38:05,923
He has surrendered.

1195
01:38:06,007 --> 01:38:08,342
[all muttering]

1196
01:38:13,473 --> 01:38:15,433
Let the gods decide.

1197
01:38:23,775 --> 01:38:25,985
[monkey screeching]

1198
01:38:33,034 --> 01:38:35,870
The gods have rendered their judgment.

1199
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,541
Do what you must.

1200
01:38:41,626 --> 01:38:44,003
But on my death, you have to know...

1201
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,799
I love your mother, Lucilla.

1202
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,635
And your father...

1203
01:38:53,429 --> 01:38:54,430
Maximus.

1204
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:57,934
I would have died for him.

1205
01:38:58,017 --> 01:38:59,894
Kill him!

1206
01:38:59,977 --> 01:39:02,647
[man] Let him live! Please!

1207
01:39:03,272 --> 01:39:06,818
[crowd chanting] Live! Live! Live! Live!

1208
01:39:13,825 --> 01:39:15,493
Kill him!

1209
01:39:17,495 --> 01:39:18,454
- [grunts]
- [Geta] Kill him!

1210
01:39:18,538 --> 01:39:19,789
Archers!

1211
01:39:19,872 --> 01:39:21,707
- No!
- [Geta] Kill him!

1212
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:24,335
[crowd chanting] Acacius! Acacius!

1213
01:39:24,418 --> 01:39:26,129
[Caracalla] Kill him!

1214
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:27,630
Kill him!

1215
01:39:27,713 --> 01:39:29,173
Kill him! Kill him!

1216
01:39:29,257 --> 01:39:31,259
[crowd continues chanting]

1217
01:39:31,342 --> 01:39:32,635
[sobbing] Acacius!

1218
01:39:35,596 --> 01:39:36,848
[arrow whistling]

1219
01:39:36,931 --> 01:39:38,015
[crowd exclaiming]

1220
01:39:38,099 --> 01:39:40,101
[grunting]

1221
01:39:42,812 --> 01:39:43,771
[Lucilla] No!

1222
01:39:44,438 --> 01:39:45,940
No!

1223
01:39:46,023 --> 01:39:47,608
Acacius!

1224
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:51,404
Damn you!

1225
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,031
[breath heaving]

1226
01:39:54,115 --> 01:39:55,950
Death will be too good for you!

1227
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:04,667
Is this how Rome treats its heroes?

1228
01:40:08,713 --> 01:40:10,173
Tell me!

1229
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:16,888
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

1230
01:40:16,971 --> 01:40:22,018
The gods have spoken!

1231
01:40:22,101 --> 01:40:24,645
[crowd booing loudly]

1232
01:40:26,856 --> 01:40:29,483
[shouting, jeering]

1233
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:39,577
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1234
01:40:44,165 --> 01:40:46,709
[crowd booing]

1235
01:40:55,051 --> 01:40:58,054
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

1236
01:40:59,388 --> 01:41:03,309
[crowd booing loudly]

1237
01:41:06,437 --> 01:41:09,607
[crowd] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1238
01:41:17,031 --> 01:41:19,283
[all jeering]

1239
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:21,702
[soldier] Stay back! Stay back!

1240
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:51,190
[booing and jeers, echoing]

1241
01:41:57,071 --> 01:41:58,239
[crowd noise fades]

1242
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:09,875
[thunder rolling]

1243
01:42:09,959 --> 01:42:14,338
[Lucius, faintly] Arishat!

1244
01:42:17,091 --> 01:42:18,884
[door opens]

1245
01:42:31,939 --> 01:42:33,441
We had a bargain.

1246
01:42:37,111 --> 01:42:40,406
I gave him to you. You let him live.

1247
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:42,158
And you got what you wanted.

1248
01:42:42,241 --> 01:42:44,869
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

1249
01:42:44,952 --> 01:42:47,788
You bought a gladiator, not a slave.

1250
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,292
My will is my own.

1251
01:42:53,544 --> 01:42:54,962
Ah...

1252
01:42:55,046 --> 01:42:56,922
How blue is your blood?

1253
01:42:57,798 --> 01:43:00,384
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

1254
01:43:00,468 --> 01:43:02,678
beats in that chest. [chuckles]

1255
01:43:08,392 --> 01:43:11,270
The greatest temple Rome ever built.

1256
01:43:11,354 --> 01:43:12,897
The Colosseum.

1257
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:15,316
Because this is what they believe in.

1258
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:16,609
Power.

1259
01:43:16,692 --> 01:43:19,820
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

1260
01:43:19,904 --> 01:43:21,739
- There has to be something else.
- There is nothing else.

1261
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:24,617
- There has to be another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

1262
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,745
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

1263
01:43:27,828 --> 01:43:29,747
The dream of Rome?

1264
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,332
It's an old man's fantasy.

1265
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:34,502
Who are you?

1266
01:43:37,588 --> 01:43:40,591
What was your name
before you traded it for a Roman one?

1267
01:43:41,675 --> 01:43:43,094
You'll never know.

1268
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:47,515
I have a destiny.

1269
01:43:51,018 --> 01:43:53,354
The gods delivered you to me.

1270
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:57,900
You will be my instrument.

1271
01:43:57,983 --> 01:44:01,487
I will never be your instrument,
in this life or the next.

1272
01:44:09,787 --> 01:44:12,957
- [door opening]
- That will not be my destiny.

1273
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,669
But I will see your end.

1274
01:44:16,752 --> 01:44:19,255
[people shouting, yelling in distance]

1275
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:37,606
[monkey chittering]

1276
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:39,567
What else could I do?

1277
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,444
He and his bitch were plotting to kill us.

1278
01:44:41,527 --> 01:44:44,196
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

1279
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:46,323
The Praetorians will put down this crowd.

1280
01:44:46,407 --> 01:44:48,159
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

1281
01:44:48,242 --> 01:44:50,661
- Filthy ape!
- [monkey squeaking in fear]

1282
01:44:54,331 --> 01:44:56,041
[Macrinus] Perhaps you should, uh,

1283
01:44:57,168 --> 01:45:01,505
take Dondus elsewhere to comfort him?

1284
01:45:11,098 --> 01:45:13,350
Forgive my brother's outburst.

1285
01:45:15,269 --> 01:45:18,272
The disease that infects his loins
has spread to his brain.

1286
01:45:18,939 --> 01:45:21,942
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

1287
01:45:23,611 --> 01:45:25,488
[all yelling, shouting]

1288
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:33,537
[Dondus hooting]

1289
01:45:38,334 --> 01:45:41,462
[singsong] I see you.

1290
01:45:41,545 --> 01:45:43,547
I see you.

1291
01:45:44,965 --> 01:45:47,176
Caracalla, Caracalla!

1292
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:48,886
Come on, stand up.

1293
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:51,055
Get up, get up. Not you.

1294
01:45:51,138 --> 01:45:52,890
All right, there you go.

1295
01:45:54,642 --> 01:45:56,977
Now, listen to me.

1296
01:45:57,061 --> 01:45:58,646
What's the matter?

1297
01:45:58,729 --> 01:46:01,398
[panting] Nothing's ever mine.

1298
01:46:01,482 --> 01:46:03,817
Everything is ours, always.

1299
01:46:03,901 --> 01:46:07,071
Even in the womb... [stammering]...he tried...

1300
01:46:07,947 --> 01:46:11,283
to cut my umbilicus

1301
01:46:11,367 --> 01:46:13,202
so that I couldn't have any more air.

1302
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:15,579
- You remember that, do you?
- Certainly.

1303
01:46:15,663 --> 01:46:17,998
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

1304
01:46:18,082 --> 01:46:20,334
My conscience compels me.

1305
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:21,877
What?

1306
01:46:21,961 --> 01:46:23,170
Sit.

1307
01:46:23,254 --> 01:46:24,588
Your brother

1308
01:46:25,506 --> 01:46:27,007
means to blame you

1309
01:46:28,008 --> 01:46:30,427
in front of the entire Senate...

1310
01:46:30,511 --> 01:46:31,887
But I did not do it!

1311
01:46:31,971 --> 01:46:33,556
...for what's happening in the streets.

1312
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:36,016
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

1313
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,935
No testimony can be more damning

1314
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:41,480
than one brother against another.

1315
01:46:41,564 --> 01:46:44,233
That's a lie! He always lies!

1316
01:46:44,316 --> 01:46:46,777
He can be very persuasive.

1317
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,572
So? What will they do to me?

1318
01:46:49,655 --> 01:46:52,449
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

1319
01:46:52,533 --> 01:46:54,535
What will they do to Dondus?

1320
01:46:57,705 --> 01:47:00,541
What will they do

1321
01:47:00,624 --> 01:47:02,001
to Dondus?

1322
01:47:02,084 --> 01:47:04,295
[Dondus chittering softly]

1323
01:47:04,378 --> 01:47:05,629
It's your decision.

1324
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,683
[people shouting angrily]

1325
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:33,949
[angry shouts continue]

1326
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,335
Brother.

1327
01:47:48,005 --> 01:47:49,798
Put down the blade.

1328
01:47:49,882 --> 01:47:51,008
You lie.

1329
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:52,885
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

1330
01:47:52,968 --> 01:47:53,927
- Give it--
- [grunts]

1331
01:47:54,011 --> 01:47:55,596
[chuckles]

1332
01:47:56,597 --> 01:47:57,765
[Geta exclaiming]

1333
01:47:57,848 --> 01:48:00,100
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

1334
01:48:00,184 --> 01:48:02,603
- Lie!
- Listen to me. Break the spell.

1335
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:04,688
- Lie!
- Break the spell!

1336
01:48:04,772 --> 01:48:07,941
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

1337
01:48:08,609 --> 01:48:10,611
Come back. Help me.

1338
01:48:20,162 --> 01:48:21,705
[blade plunges]

1339
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,291
[faint, indistinct chatter]

1340
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:26,085
[keys jingling]

1341
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,635
Lucius.

1342
01:48:41,225 --> 01:48:43,394
[hinges creaking]

1343
01:48:56,407 --> 01:48:59,034
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

1344
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:01,078
[Lucius chuckles dryly]

1345
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:02,913
And yet here we are.

1346
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:06,375
Everything has brought us full circle.

1347
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,545
You sent me away and yet fate

1348
01:49:09,628 --> 01:49:12,089
brought me back
to the very ground where he died.

1349
01:49:15,134 --> 01:49:16,093
[Lucilla] This ring...

1350
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:19,680
belonged to my father.

1351
01:49:23,767 --> 01:49:26,854
He gave it to your father, Maximus,

1352
01:49:26,937 --> 01:49:28,772
as a token of trust.

1353
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:33,152
I gave it to Acacius for his valor.

1354
01:49:37,698 --> 01:49:39,867
This ring belonged to my wife.

1355
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:44,329
I shall wear it next to yours.

1356
01:49:58,635 --> 01:50:01,054
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1357
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:05,184
I could not see the man.

1358
01:50:05,267 --> 01:50:06,560
[sniffles]

1359
01:50:07,394 --> 01:50:09,229
He was a soldier of Rome.

1360
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:12,566
There was a plan.

1361
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:17,321
He was readying troops at Ostia
under the command of Darius Sextus.

1362
01:50:18,489 --> 01:50:21,492
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1363
01:50:23,577 --> 01:50:27,915
Acacius. Maximus. Marcus Aurelius.

1364
01:50:29,082 --> 01:50:30,709
They lived and died for Rome.

1365
01:50:32,169 --> 01:50:33,587
We all do.

1366
01:50:35,672 --> 01:50:37,257
Is it true they intend to kill you?

1367
01:50:39,218 --> 01:50:40,928
[chuckles lightly]

1368
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:43,222
One man or another
has had a sword against my neck

1369
01:50:43,305 --> 01:50:45,432
since the day my father died.

1370
01:50:48,685 --> 01:50:50,646
But now that I've found you,

1371
01:50:51,522 --> 01:50:53,273
it doesn't matter.

1372
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:56,068
I am not afraid.

1373
01:50:56,151 --> 01:50:59,571
I've become well versed
in losing the things that I love.

1374
01:51:02,449 --> 01:51:05,577
But now that I've found you,
I have no desire to lose you again.

1375
01:51:05,661 --> 01:51:07,079
[exhales shakily]

1376
01:51:08,664 --> 01:51:10,833
- You stand like him.
- Mm.

1377
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:12,960
Alert.

1378
01:51:13,877 --> 01:51:14,962
Proud.

1379
01:51:17,214 --> 01:51:19,049
I do not have his strength.

1380
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:22,803
I wish that were true.

1381
01:51:24,221 --> 01:51:27,391
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

1382
01:51:27,474 --> 01:51:28,976
[keys jingling]

1383
01:51:32,521 --> 01:51:34,731
[door unlocks]

1384
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:37,234
Go now.

1385
01:51:42,155 --> 01:51:44,074
[Lucilla sighs]

1386
01:51:45,576 --> 01:51:46,702
Strength and honor.

1387
01:51:49,246 --> 01:51:50,873
Strength and honor.

1388
01:52:01,633 --> 01:52:03,468
[thunder rumbling faintly]

1389
01:52:03,552 --> 01:52:04,970
[Caracalla] As Emperor,

1390
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:07,347
I have convened

1391
01:52:08,348 --> 01:52:11,602
the Senate to appoint my First Consul

1392
01:52:11,685 --> 01:52:15,022
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

1393
01:52:15,105 --> 01:52:18,317
and civic functions of the Empire.

1394
01:52:22,195 --> 01:52:23,530
I name...

1395
01:52:24,698 --> 01:52:27,159
Citizen Dondus!

1396
01:52:27,242 --> 01:52:29,036
[Senate murmuring]

1397
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,538
[Dondus chittering]

1398
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:35,751
[Caracalla] Hail Dondus!

1399
01:52:39,212 --> 01:52:40,672
Hail Dondus!

1400
01:52:42,716 --> 01:52:45,427
- [clearing throat] Hail Dondus.
- Hail Dondus!

1401
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:47,971
[all] Hail Dondus!

1402
01:52:52,225 --> 01:52:54,061
As Second Consul...

1403
01:52:56,021 --> 01:52:57,481
I name...

1404
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,151
Citizen...

1405
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:04,321
Macrinus!

1406
01:53:07,282 --> 01:53:08,992
Hail Macrinus!

1407
01:53:09,076 --> 01:53:10,577
Hail Macrinus!

1408
01:53:10,661 --> 01:53:12,537
[all] Hail Macrinus!

1409
01:53:13,914 --> 01:53:17,000
There will be
a triumphal parade to celebrate.

1410
01:53:17,084 --> 01:53:18,585
There will be games

1411
01:53:19,378 --> 01:53:21,380
and mass executions.

1412
01:53:21,463 --> 01:53:23,840
[chittering]

1413
01:53:24,508 --> 01:53:27,177
Long live the Empire!

1414
01:53:28,762 --> 01:53:31,765
- [Macrinus] Long live the Empire!
- [all] Long live the Empire!

1415
01:53:35,185 --> 01:53:36,895
[applause subsides]

1416
01:53:38,689 --> 01:53:39,856
Sit down.

1417
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:45,946
I happen to have...

1418
01:53:49,533 --> 01:53:53,203
with good fortune and not a little skill...

1419
01:53:54,955 --> 01:53:58,083
the remaining emperor's ear.

1420
01:54:00,252 --> 01:54:02,921
[all gasping, murmuring]

1421
01:54:05,298 --> 01:54:07,551
I can speak logic to it...

1422
01:54:12,347 --> 01:54:14,808
and tame the madness in the street. But...

1423
01:54:17,811 --> 01:54:19,396
to restore order...

1424
01:54:21,481 --> 01:54:23,316
I must have power...

1425
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:29,072
and command

1426
01:54:29,823 --> 01:54:31,742
over the Praetorian Army.

1427
01:54:37,664 --> 01:54:39,374
Ballot...

1428
01:54:41,585 --> 01:54:42,919
or hand?

1429
01:54:45,088 --> 01:54:47,591
- Aye!
- [all] Aye!

1430
01:54:50,927 --> 01:54:52,512
Your humble servant.

1431
01:54:56,683 --> 01:54:58,185
Put your hands down.

1432
01:55:00,896 --> 01:55:02,355
You can sit down.

1433
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:17,537
[Macrinus] <i>Rome must fall.</i>

1434
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:22,292
I need only give it a push.

1435
01:55:25,378 --> 01:55:27,547
[Lucilla] And after Rome falls...

1436
01:55:28,507 --> 01:55:30,884
[dry chuckle]...what then?

1437
01:55:33,053 --> 01:55:35,055
You are your father's child.

1438
01:55:37,057 --> 01:55:39,684
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

1439
01:55:40,644 --> 01:55:41,853
It was a fiction.

1440
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:45,065
"The best revenge is

1441
01:55:45,148 --> 01:55:49,027
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1442
01:55:49,111 --> 01:55:54,116
I have made myself unlike your father.

1443
01:55:54,199 --> 01:55:57,744
He spoke of dreams, I speak of truth.

1444
01:55:57,828 --> 01:56:00,247
And the only truth in my Rome

1445
01:56:01,832 --> 01:56:03,834
is the law of the strongest.

1446
01:56:06,169 --> 01:56:07,504
I was owned

1447
01:56:09,005 --> 01:56:10,507
by an emperor.

1448
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:15,595
Now I control an empire.

1449
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,933
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

1450
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:29,734
Do you recognize your father's mark on me?

1451
01:56:34,573 --> 01:56:35,866
If there is anything

1452
01:56:36,616 --> 01:56:37,951
you need...

1453
01:56:39,703 --> 01:56:41,371
in these last hours,

1454
01:56:42,372 --> 01:56:44,040
we will provide.

1455
01:56:49,754 --> 01:56:52,465
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

1456
01:56:54,384 --> 01:56:57,387
Tomorrow there will be games.

1457
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:59,055
And at them...

1458
01:56:59,973 --> 01:57:01,641
I will prevail.

1459
01:57:07,314 --> 01:57:08,982
[door clangs shut]

1460
01:57:09,065 --> 01:57:10,734
[keys jingling]

1461
01:57:15,322 --> 01:57:16,781
Ravi!

1462
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:25,665
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

1463
01:57:25,749 --> 01:57:27,500
What is in Ostia?

1464
01:57:27,584 --> 01:57:29,002
There is an army.

1465
01:57:31,254 --> 01:57:32,964
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

1466
01:57:33,048 --> 01:57:35,175
in the service of something greater.

1467
01:57:38,094 --> 01:57:39,512
Ride to Ostia.

1468
01:57:40,764 --> 01:57:42,891
Take this ring to General Darius Sextus.

1469
01:57:42,974 --> 01:57:44,351
Are you listening?

1470
01:57:45,018 --> 01:57:46,853
Darius Sextus.

1471
01:57:47,771 --> 01:57:49,773
He will know it as Acacius's ring.

1472
01:57:52,734 --> 01:57:54,861
[clears throat] And, uh,

1473
01:57:55,779 --> 01:57:57,113
who shall I say has

1474
01:57:57,822 --> 01:57:59,491
sent me with this ring?

1475
01:58:02,869 --> 01:58:05,205
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1476
01:58:06,456 --> 01:58:07,958
The Prince of Rome.

1477
01:58:09,209 --> 01:58:13,046
Tell him I am summoning the army
to the defense of a new Republic.

1478
01:58:16,258 --> 01:58:17,676
[inhales]

1479
01:58:21,721 --> 01:58:23,556
- Should I trust you?
- Yes.

1480
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:25,100
- Should I?
- Yes.

1481
01:58:32,023 --> 01:58:34,693
Ravi! I need your keys.

1482
01:58:40,824 --> 01:58:42,492
Thank you.

1483
01:59:20,363 --> 01:59:22,782
Stop! Come back!

1484
01:59:35,295 --> 01:59:37,339
[panting]

1485
01:59:44,512 --> 01:59:45,680
[inhales sharply]

1486
01:59:53,563 --> 01:59:54,689
Who gave you this?

1487
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:57,817
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1488
01:59:59,069 --> 02:00:00,278
The Prince of Rome.

1489
02:00:21,758 --> 02:00:23,760
[horses snort, whinnying]

1490
02:00:28,848 --> 02:00:31,226
[crowd cheering in distance]

1491
02:00:53,456 --> 02:00:55,667
[whispering] Must we kill Lucilla?

1492
02:00:58,128 --> 02:01:01,881
[quietly] Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1493
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:04,801
Ever.

1494
02:01:07,887 --> 02:01:09,973
[horns playing fanfare]

1495
02:01:15,687 --> 02:01:18,314
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1496
02:01:18,398 --> 02:01:20,984
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1497
02:01:21,067 --> 02:01:24,070
I shall deliver them Caracalla's head
and the people shall acclaim me.

1498
02:01:24,154 --> 02:01:27,740
That, my friend, is politics.

1499
02:01:30,577 --> 02:01:32,412
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1500
02:01:47,677 --> 02:01:49,804
Today will be your last fight, champion.

1501
02:01:50,889 --> 02:01:52,515
And our master has bestowed on you...

1502
02:01:54,893 --> 02:01:57,270
the wooden sword of freedom.

1503
02:02:01,274 --> 02:02:03,318
But you have to earn it first.

1504
02:02:03,401 --> 02:02:05,737
Today, you're gonna defend your mother.

1505
02:02:12,452 --> 02:02:14,662
- [soldier shouting]
- [grunting]

1506
02:02:14,746 --> 02:02:16,956
[all yelling]

1507
02:02:25,465 --> 02:02:28,593
[grunting explosively]

1508
02:02:28,676 --> 02:02:31,513
Wood or steel, a point is still a point!

1509
02:02:34,015 --> 02:02:35,725
[arrows whistling]

1510
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:00,291
[Lucius] Wait for me.

1511
02:03:19,143 --> 02:03:20,895
In honor

1512
02:03:20,979 --> 02:03:25,316
of the acclamation of Emperor Caracalla,

1513
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:31,364
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1514
02:03:31,447 --> 02:03:35,994
and as punishment for her conspiracy
against the empire,

1515
02:03:36,077 --> 02:03:40,582
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1516
02:03:40,665 --> 02:03:44,502
and for fomenting military mutiny
along with her husband,

1517
02:03:44,586 --> 02:03:48,256
the queen will face divine justice

1518
02:03:48,339 --> 02:03:52,427
at the hands of the Praetorian Guard.

1519
02:03:56,681 --> 02:03:59,100
[crowd cheering faintly]

1520
02:04:16,909 --> 02:04:18,411
I am not a general.

1521
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:23,625
But we are all soldiers.

1522
02:04:25,627 --> 02:04:27,420
And up until now,

1523
02:04:27,962 --> 02:04:31,799
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1524
02:04:31,883 --> 02:04:33,718
What will you have us do?

1525
02:04:35,053 --> 02:04:38,431
Well, you can return to your cells
if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1526
02:04:38,514 --> 02:04:40,808
- [all laughing]
- Or...

1527
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,895
you can join me.

1528
02:04:45,188 --> 02:04:47,899
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1529
02:04:47,982 --> 02:04:48,983
[all] Aye!

1530
02:04:49,734 --> 02:04:53,529
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1531
02:04:55,239 --> 02:04:56,741
In this Rome

1532
02:04:57,659 --> 02:04:59,827
I no longer believe that exists.

1533
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:01,913
We must find it!

1534
02:05:01,996 --> 02:05:04,082
[all murmuring in agreement]

1535
02:05:04,165 --> 02:05:05,833
[Lucius] And know this:

1536
02:05:07,168 --> 02:05:10,922
Where death is, we are not.

1537
02:05:12,924 --> 02:05:14,842
Where we are,

1538
02:05:15,593 --> 02:05:17,303
death is not!

1539
02:05:20,348 --> 02:05:21,599
By my sword.

1540
02:05:23,518 --> 02:05:25,269
Strength and honor.

1541
02:05:25,353 --> 02:05:27,313
[all] Strength and honor!

1542
02:05:27,397 --> 02:05:29,065
Strength and honor!

1543
02:05:29,148 --> 02:05:30,983
Strength and honor!

1544
02:05:40,576 --> 02:05:43,204
[indistinct shouting]

1545
02:05:43,287 --> 02:05:45,123
[growling]

1546
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:52,547
[snarling]

1547
02:05:55,717 --> 02:05:57,844
Let it not be said

1548
02:05:57,927 --> 02:06:01,055
that the emperor is not merciful.

1549
02:06:01,889 --> 02:06:06,644
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1550
02:06:06,728 --> 02:06:10,523
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1551
02:06:10,606 --> 02:06:12,775
[crowd jeering]

1552
02:06:20,491 --> 02:06:24,495
The champion, Hanno!

1553
02:06:24,579 --> 02:06:26,581
[crowd roars]

1554
02:06:28,332 --> 02:06:31,836
[people chanting] Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1555
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:53,357
[all booing]

1556
02:07:24,931 --> 02:07:26,808
[all shouting]

1557
02:07:35,525 --> 02:07:37,401
[grunting]

1558
02:07:37,485 --> 02:07:39,195
Yes!

1559
02:07:43,407 --> 02:07:45,243
Summon the cavalry. Put this down at once.

1560
02:07:46,786 --> 02:07:49,163
This is war! Real war!

1561
02:07:54,126 --> 02:07:57,505
The army of Acacius is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1562
02:08:00,174 --> 02:08:01,634
We can still outflank them.

1563
02:08:01,717 --> 02:08:04,053
They have only 5,000 troops, no more.

1564
02:08:05,429 --> 02:08:06,931
How many are we?

1565
02:08:07,014 --> 02:08:08,391
Six thousand. Perhaps more.

1566
02:08:08,474 --> 02:08:10,142
Ride to the gate and hold them.

1567
02:08:10,226 --> 02:08:12,144
[aggressive grunting]

1568
02:08:20,194 --> 02:08:21,612
[cheering]

1569
02:08:35,585 --> 02:08:36,961
[screams]

1570
02:08:37,044 --> 02:08:39,130
[yelps, whimpering]

1571
02:08:45,136 --> 02:08:46,178
[screams]

1572
02:08:46,262 --> 02:08:48,764
[all shouting angrily]

1573
02:08:52,685 --> 02:08:53,978
[screams]

1574
02:08:56,314 --> 02:08:58,065
- [arrow whistles]
- [grunts]

1575
02:09:01,903 --> 02:09:02,945
Filthy scum!

1576
02:09:16,834 --> 02:09:18,336
[Lucilla] Lucius!

1577
02:09:20,129 --> 02:09:21,172
Give me the bow.

1578
02:09:24,592 --> 02:09:26,177
[bow creaking]

1579
02:09:30,806 --> 02:09:32,892
[both gasp]

1580
02:09:44,987 --> 02:09:47,531
Go, my son. Lucius--

1581
02:09:47,615 --> 02:09:48,699
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1582
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:50,284
Horse!

1583
02:09:50,368 --> 02:09:52,495
[people shouting, clamoring]

1584
02:09:57,583 --> 02:09:59,585
[yelling furiously]

1585
02:10:12,223 --> 02:10:14,100
[indistinct shouts]

1586
02:10:15,226 --> 02:10:17,144
[feet marching]

1587
02:10:17,228 --> 02:10:19,689
[man shouting cadence]

1588
02:11:23,002 --> 02:11:25,129
Will nothing kill this barbarian?

1589
02:11:25,212 --> 02:11:27,757
My name is Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1590
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,217
[Macrinus] A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1591
02:11:30,301 --> 02:11:33,054
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1592
02:11:33,137 --> 02:11:34,972
Are you such a man as this?

1593
02:11:35,056 --> 02:11:36,515
[Lucius] I don't fight for power.

1594
02:11:37,308 --> 02:11:40,936
I fight to free Rome from men like you
and to return it to them.

1595
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:43,856
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

1596
02:11:43,939 --> 02:11:46,901
They sent me... to fulfill that task.

1597
02:11:46,984 --> 02:11:50,571
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1598
02:11:50,654 --> 02:11:51,655
Huh?

1599
02:11:52,823 --> 02:11:55,117
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1600
02:11:55,201 --> 02:11:57,119
[aggressive yell]

1601
02:12:03,125 --> 02:12:05,169
[horses bellowing]

1602
02:12:15,554 --> 02:12:18,182
[both grunting]

1603
02:12:19,809 --> 02:12:21,268
[swords clashing]

1604
02:12:21,352 --> 02:12:22,937
[both yelling]

1605
02:12:31,112 --> 02:12:33,322
- Hah!
- [screams]

1606
02:12:34,406 --> 02:12:35,282
[grunts]

1607
02:12:51,423 --> 02:12:53,092
[blade clanging against breastplate]

1608
02:13:00,057 --> 02:13:03,144
[metallic clangs echoing]

1609
02:13:03,853 --> 02:13:05,229
[Lucilla] Strength and honor,

1610
02:13:05,312 --> 02:13:06,814
my son.

1611
02:13:09,191 --> 02:13:10,234
[grunts]

1612
02:13:23,789 --> 02:13:24,957
[yelling]

1613
02:13:26,876 --> 02:13:27,960
[groans in pain]

1614
02:13:55,404 --> 02:13:56,780
[panting]

1615
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:58,657
[pained groan]

1616
02:14:40,199 --> 02:14:41,909
You look to me to speak.

1617
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:47,915
I know not what to say other than
we have all known too much death.

1618
02:14:49,166 --> 02:14:52,670
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1619
02:14:56,632 --> 02:14:59,176
My grandfather, Marcus Aurelius,

1620
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:02,096
talked of a dream that would be Rome.

1621
02:15:03,138 --> 02:15:05,015
A dream that my father,

1622
02:15:06,267 --> 02:15:08,435
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1623
02:15:09,186 --> 02:15:10,688
died for.

1624
02:15:11,939 --> 02:15:13,524
An ideal.

1625
02:15:16,277 --> 02:15:20,072
A city for the many
and a refuge for those in need.

1626
02:15:20,739 --> 02:15:23,200
A home worth fighting for.

1627
02:15:24,326 --> 02:15:28,622
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1628
02:15:30,708 --> 02:15:32,543
That dream is lost.

1629
02:15:38,507 --> 02:15:40,134
But dare we...

1630
02:15:41,677 --> 02:15:44,305
rebuild that dream together?

1631
02:15:56,233 --> 02:15:57,985
What say you?

1632
02:16:04,366 --> 02:16:06,201
Aye!

1633
02:16:07,369 --> 02:16:08,662
Aye!

1634
02:16:09,413 --> 02:16:10,664
Aye!

1635
02:16:10,748 --> 02:16:15,085
[all] Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1636
02:16:17,421 --> 02:16:20,799
[all chanting]

1637
02:17:19,817 --> 02:17:20,984
Mother.

1638
02:18:13,579 --> 02:18:15,747
Speak to me, Father.

1639
02:27:47,861 --> 02:27:48,862
