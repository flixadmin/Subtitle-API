Giving up. Smart.

No, actually, I wanna talk.
No fighting.

Meet me at the tavern where they

soldiers don't go

It's part of the discipline

a ruckus in Sarajevo.

307

310
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,808
Okay, so by aberrations
you mean like

315
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't think I can do this.
