00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:03,222
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,497
I'm not going to shoot.

4
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,511
- Yi-kyung, it's me.
- Step away from the girl!

5
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,307
Come over here.

6
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,058
Now!

7
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,269
Next time then.

8
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,795
Yi-kyung.

9
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,506
I'm not going in there.

10
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,841
And I don't need your help.

11
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,052
You didn't see anything.

12
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,053
Wait.

13
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,972
Wait a second.
I have to ask you something.

14
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,265
Wait!

15
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,642
Oh, God, wait. No.

16
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,646
Don't go. It's dangerous.

17
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,929
I told you I'll kill you
if you get in my way, didn't I?

18
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,169
My boy...

19
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,090
My beautiful boy.

20
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,175
Oh, God.

21
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,388
Mom, are you still hurting?

22
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,434
No, honey. No more hurting, my boy.

23
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,186
Right.

24
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,938
You're hurting

25
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,773
too much, Mom.

26
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,109
That's why I'm sad.

27
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,277
Right.

28
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,363
Uh, but I...

29
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,783
I'm all better now.

30
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,286
I don't cough up blood anymore,

31
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,121
and my insides no longer hurt.

32
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,333
Ah, here. I even got my teeth back.

33
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,586
I'm all better now.

34
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,466
Right, but, uh...

35
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,260
I have to help you, Mom.

36
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,306
No, I... I can do it.

37
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,851
Ju... Jun-il...

38
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,521
I can do it if you won't be sick anymore!

39
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,357
I... I...

40
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,318
got you your medicine.

41
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,820
HERBICIDE

42
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,197
Jun-il, this is...

43
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,492
That's right. You have to die, Mom.
So you won't hurt anymore.

44
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,745
What's gotten into you?

45
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,413
I'm all better now.

46
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,082
You say you got better,

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,001
and then you're not better anymore.

48
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,129
And then better, and then better no more.

49
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,674
And better.

50
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,467
It's always like that.

51
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,182
Jun-il, what's wrong with you?

52
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,559
I told you, I'm all better now.

53
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,143
Mama.

54
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,064
You have to die, okay?

55
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,902
I can do it
because I'm a good boy.

56
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,656
Jun-il, stop this right now.

57
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,035
Drink.

58
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,706
Jun... Jun-il, I...

59
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,084
Just drink it and be quiet.

60
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,853
Mom.

61
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,106
Mom?

62
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,237
Are you dead?

63
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,450
So you're no longer hurting, right?

64
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,258
It's, uh,

65
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,052
all over now.

66
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,637
Good job.

67
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,534
Why won't you die?

68
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,704
Why won't you die?

69
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,664
Why... why won't you just die?

70
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,793
You'll only keep hurting if you don't die!

71
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,503
Die!

72
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,213
Die!

73
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,799
Die right now!

74
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,343
Die!

75
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,179
Die!

76
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,641
Die!

77
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,729
Jun-il.

78
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,526
It must've been hard for you.

79
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,447
I'm so sorry.

80
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,243
Oh, damn it!

81
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,122
Goddamn it!

82
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,237
You won't find her so late at night.

83
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,697
She's already...

84
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,908
Let go!

85
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,618
Let go of me!

86
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,661
I said let go, you...

87
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,330
Let...

88
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,207
Let go of me right now!

89
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,129
I finally met her.

90
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,381
I can't let her go like this. I can't.

91
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,467
So just stop.

92
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,762
I swear I'll kill you
if you ever follow me again.

93
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,941
Wait a second.

94
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,185
Let go.

95
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,479
No way.

96
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,648
Let go or we'll both die.

97
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,857
Hold on tight!

98
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,776
I'll pull you up on three.

99
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,082
I'll push you off the wall. Hold on tight.

100
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,822
There's something at the bottom.
Be careful.

101
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,327
On three, I'll let you go, okay?

102
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,870
Stay close to the wall and push.

103
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,749
One, two, three.

104
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,225
It's Oh Jun-il's doing.

105
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,028
I was just gonna give him
a little stimulus,

106
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,145
but I had no idea
he would explode like this.

107
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,273
The blood sample I got from him
showed signs of monsterization,

108
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,442
but he had no symptoms.

109
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,903
He showed all of the signs,

110
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,698
but he had no nosebleeds
and auditory hallucinations.

111
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,243
I should've taken this step by step.

112
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,871
The specimen was so hard to come by,
I got ahead of myself like an idiot!

113
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,081
That's enough.

114
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,714
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

115
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,797
Huh?

116
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,808
Oh Jun-il came to see his mother.

117
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,146
After giving into monsterization,
the symptomatic individual

118
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,772
killed her son and went berserk.

119
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,627
The doctor who witnessed the scene
called in for help,

120
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,570
and the Crow Platoon subdued the monster.

121
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,696
Isn't that right?

122
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,587
It's like you didn't hear a thing I said.

123
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,993
Are you deaf or something?

124
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,495
You want me to go over it again?

125
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,749
Jun-il became a monster
without showing any of the symptoms.

126
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,666
So what?

127
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,710
So, he's a fringe case,
unlike any we've seen.

128
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,631
Monsterization is already
beyond our understanding.

129
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,596
When you dragged me out here,

130
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,766
and built me a fancy research facility,

131
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,393
I thought you might have
some grand design.

132
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,103
So what? It was all just an act?

133
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,398
You're only half correct.

134
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,485
So what have you been planning?

135
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,530
Let me in on the bigger picture here.

136
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,909
Why do you think I kept you alive, huh?

137
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,788
Because you represent hope.

138
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,791
Hope that humanity
hasn't thrown in the towel yet.

139
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,252
Hope that we may overcome this someday.

140
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,463
- Far from the truth.
- The truth is not what matters.

141
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,924
What matters is what people believe.

142
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,762
Don't shake their faith.

143
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,605
You don't want everything
to crumble, do you?

144
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,937
Oh, fuck. Shit.

145
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,426
Get in.

146
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,346
I came out to find him.

147
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,558
Aren't you coming?

148
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,310
I'm not going anywhere until I find him.

149
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
Then why did you go there?

150
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,775
Why did you go where there are people?

151
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,142
Don't.

152
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,716
Has it already been over a month?

153
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,510
Just hang in there.

154
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
We're almost there.

155
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,806
Mom?

156
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,518
Mom?

157
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,396
Did you sleep here?

158
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,357
I can tell from your face
you didn't sleep well.

159
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,070
What are your hands for?

160
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,405
Are they just for makeup?

161
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,824
Why didn't you knock?
What are you doing here?

162
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,907
I just...

163
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,411
I was just worried. I'm looking for you.

164
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,789
You can enter my room, but not here, okay?

165
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,750
That's a warning.

166
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,877
I'm serious.

167
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,713
Mm-hmm.

168
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,550
Go.

169
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,801
It's time for roll call.

170
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,891
<i>The banishment of the infectee's
schedule today had been canceled.</i>

171
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>The infectee was monsterized last night,
and the Crow Platoon subdued her.</i>

172
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,940
<i>Please do not be alarmed
and prepare for roll call.</i>

173
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,276
<i>That'll be all.</i>

174
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,331
So, did you get her?

175
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,708
What?

176
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,379
- Yeah.
- Oh.

177
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:32,009
Seriously. We can all sleep safe and sound
all thanks to the platoon and all.

178
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,346
Is this really something
to get so psyched about?

179
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,307
Huh?

180
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,185
A person died.

181
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,062
Oh.

182
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,565
Uh, it was a monster, not a...
not a person, though.

183
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,110
It's a fine line.

184
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,529
If this wound heals,
you'll end up becoming one of them.

185
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,658
Hey, let's go.

186
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,159
Right.

187
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,337
Shit.

188
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,565
Have you heard anything about this?
What was that all about?

189
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,423
No idea.

190
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,347
Maybe the guys on night shift
had a hand in it.

191
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,111
I doubt they would have kept it from us
if that was the case.

192
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,615
They love bragging about fresh kills.

193
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,680
Hey, if Sergeant Tak said it happened,
it happened.

194
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,244
It's not like he would make stuff up.

195
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,767
He could.

196
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,850
Hey.

197
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,062
Watch what you say, man.

198
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,856
Can't you see that we're being kept
out of the loop here, man?

199
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,652
I don't trust anyone
other than Sergeant Kim right now.

200
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,695
Well, now, you really hurt
my feelings, you prick.

201
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,322
- Come confess your sins.
- Huh?

202
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,617
Nothing beats a good old confession

203
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,060
when you feel like talking
behind someone's back, after all.

204
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,139
What happened here?

205
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,184
We were supposed to let her go
this morning.

206
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,314
We were going to let her go
as soon as she saw Jun-il!

207
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,611
We don't exactly live in a world
where promises are kept.

208
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,823
The hell?

209
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,200
What happened?

210
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,996
What happened here? Damn it.

211
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,291
See this here?

212
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,209
This is Jun-il.

213
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,254
If I told you, would you believe me?

214
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,009
You said it yourself. You called me
the last person to be trusted.

215
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,097
You really do have
great insight, you know.

216
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,727
But why are you getting
so worked up over this?

217
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,729
You weren't even
all that close to her, no?

218
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,812
Right?

219
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,274
Huh?

220
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,152
Who am I even talking to?

221
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,824
<i>What, a girl?</i>

222
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,908
Yeah.

223
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,368
Know anything about her?

224
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
No.

225
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,955
Are you sure?

226
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,845
There's no way Yong-seok wouldn't have
told me, if that was the case.

227
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,008
Anyways, this means that
he didn't desert us just to run away.

228
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,635
In which case, we should go get him.

229
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,886
I'll get the boys.

230
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,473
- It hasn't been approved.
- Huh?

231
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,101
What do you mean?

232
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,456
I'm going to have a word
with Sergeant Tak.

233
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
Hey, Seo-jin.

234
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,814
What?

235
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,193
Don't tell me that you agree with him.

236
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,879
Of course not, we need to find Yong-seok.

237
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,029
So what's this about?

238
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,286
The Platoon only acts for the public good.

239
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,247
Yong-seok didn't go missing.

240
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,582
He went AWOL from the unit all on his own.

241
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,419
As things stand, Yong-seok's case
is nothing more than a personal miss out.

242
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,712
So what, we just ditch him?

243
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,881
You said he'd be here.

244
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,759
You said we can return to find him, huh?

245
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,842
Hey!

246
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,096
I only returned because I believed
what you told me.

247
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,579
Had I known you'd pull this crap...

248
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,284
I would've stayed behind to look for him.

249
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,561
We could end up losing the rest of our men
if we go out in our current state.

250
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,439
And don't forget that Yong-seok
has the radio and the transmitter.

251
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,944
Let's talk about finding him
once we get a signal.

252
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,571
You're a goddamn coward.

253
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,950
How are you any different
from Sergeant Tak, hm?

254
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
Fucking hell...

255
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,333
Out of my way.

256
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,088
Sergeant Kim.

257
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,008
Park Chan-yeong is missing, sir.

258
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,553
That, and we ran into a problem
while calculating the roll call tally.

259
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,848
There must be an exit we don't know of.

260
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,372
Round up a group of survivors
and do a full sweep of the stadium.

261
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,983
Block off the exit once you find it.

262
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,066
Yes, sir.

263
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,160
Do Sang-jin, An Dong-gi, Lee Eun-yu,

264
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,870
and Park Chan-yeong are missing, sir.

265
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,205
Did they miss the roll call?

266
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,624
Yes, all four of them have gone missing.

267
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,378
Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi held a grudge
for the expedition ban.

268
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,630
Lee Eun-yu likely left
because she fell on hard times.

269
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,258
Since the main gate wasn't opened,

270
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,052
there should be another exit.

271
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,404
Once we find it, we'll block it off.

272
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,263
I see. Do just that.

273
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,717
Find the exit, cooperate with Chief Ji
to block it off.

274
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,644
- Make sure to keep an eye on them.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,940
Are you just going to let
that bastard Chan-yeong be?

276
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,318
We can take disciplinary action
once he's back.

277
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,571
What's Min up to?

278
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,782
He won't leave the barracks, sir.

279
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,621
Round up the men
and look for an exit first.

280
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
Yes, sir.

281
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,711
You're Sergeant First Class Kim, right?

282
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,800
Please, sir...

283
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,260
find Yong-seok.

284
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,671
Have you found it?

285
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,840
We're still looking.

286
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,239
Then what business do you have here?

287
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,347
Hmm, three people
left the stadium yesterday.

288
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,143
Do you know where they might've gone
and why they escaped?

289
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,311
Are you accusing me of something?

290
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,479
I don't know.

291
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,605
I have no reason to.

292
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,278
You said there was no other exit
aside from the main gate.

293
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,199
And now we're looking
for that nonexistent exit.

294
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,703
Master Sergeant Tak.

295
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,749
How many hours a day
do you monitor the cameras?

296
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,879
It seems you want to know anything
and everything that goes on around here,

297
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,840
but this desire to know everything
all on your own,

298
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,050
well, that's how dictatorships begin.

299
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,345
Not that you haven't gotten
started on that already.

300
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,811
Tell me, is there a word
for hoarding knowledge for oneself

301
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,229
while keeping others in the dark?

302
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,607
Putting everyone in danger?

303
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,904
I know you're an important figure
in this place, Chief.

304
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,988
However,

305
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,074
you can't just do
whatever you like, you know.

306
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,327
Are you threatening me?

307
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,996
Nope. Just requesting cooperation.

308
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,211
So, just let me know
if you ever decide to change your mind.

309
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,710
She's probably dead, right?

310
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,294
Who is?

311
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,756
The girl from that family.

312
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,719
Mm-hmm.

313
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,932
Aah, I'm talking about Lee Eun-yu.

314
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,476
Oh, well, you'll never know.

315
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,936
She's as tough as nails.

316
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,897
Ah, Jesus Christ,
they're causing us so much trouble.

317
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,400
Just pretend you're looking.

318
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,860
If the Crow Platoon can't find it,
how are we going to?

319
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,070
That reminds me.

320
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,937
I heard the Crow Platoon's
youngest member went missing.

321
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,867
Come to think of it.

322
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,287
It looked like, um,
they both knew each other.

323
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,413
Is that right?

324
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,581
Oh, well, then.

325
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,666
Now that you mention it,

326
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,960
there was something
about the way he looked at her.

327
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,879
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh. Could it be love?

328
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,883
Damn, crazy you can elope
in a world that's gone to crap.

329
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,011
And why would they need to do that, huh?

330
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,306
No one said dating is forbidden
once you're in the Crow Platoon.

331
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,642
Yeah, you're right.

332
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,285
Guess that rules out the eloping theory.

333
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,688
Of course they didn't elope!

334
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,818
Another day of my life having to put up
with stupid-ass nonsense like this.

335
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,321
I mean, why would you ship
Chan-yeong and that crazy bitch?

336
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,075
Uh, well, their disappearances
did coincide...

337
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,243
Ugh, just stop!

338
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,079
If I ever catch you
spouting that nonsense again,

339
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,373
I swear, you'll regret it.

340
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Shit.

341
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,671
They so eloped.

342
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,090
They were running from that one.

343
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,634
All right. Knock it off.

344
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,388
Mom?

345
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,558
Mom!

346
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,604
Mom!

347
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,773
Ugh! Mom, where did Lee Eun-yu go?

348
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,899
Jesus!

349
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,443
Ugh!

350
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,593
Damn, this is how they did it
in the movies.

351
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,478
- What are you doing?
- Huh? What?

352
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,646
Mom, you're here?

353
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,149
I heard a noise, so I thought
something might have happened to you.

354
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,068
I told you not to come here.

355
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,279
Oh, I forgot that.

356
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,702
I'm just upset about Park Chan-yeong
and Lee Eun-yu is all.

357
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,370
Sorry.

358
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,084
I've coddled you for far too long.

359
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,213
I also let you use my name
to hold it over others, but no longer.

360
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,507
You don't know when to stop.

361
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,968
- Mom...
- Go.

362
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,762
Go.

363
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,306
Uh-uh.

364
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,976
Leave!

365
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,279
Mom?

366
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,991
Mom, I'm sorry.

367
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,577
Mom, I made a mistake.
I won't do it again.

368
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,370
Mom, please don't abandon me.

369
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,039
Please, Mom, please don't abandon me! Mom!

370
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,671
Shit.

371
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,930
Damn it, why'd you have to follow me?

372
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,767
I had to find out what you were hiding.

373
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,059
Since...

374
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,105
it could have put the stadium at risk.

375
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,149
Why risk your life to protect the stadium?

376
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,193
We just happen to be stuck there
out of necessity.

377
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,196
- Is it really that important to you?
- There's nowhere else to return to.

378
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,531
To the survivors,

379
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,242
the stadium is all they've got.

380
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,286
And protecting it
is the Crow Platoon's duty.

381
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,369
Whatever.

382
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,039
No skin off my back.

383
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,482
- You're the one asking for it.
- You also risked your life.

384
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,628
We're not so different, you and I.

385
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,177
Let me see.

386
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Lift it up.

387
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,453
I'm never gonna tell you.

388
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,246
I know.

389
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,416
You believe hiding
is the right thing to do.

390
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,377
So hide it.

391
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,421
And for the finding out,

392
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,423
I can work on that.

393
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,503
The day Mr. Kim died...

394
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,464
What you saw that day...

395
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,759
Was it really a monster?

396
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,096
It wasn't human.

397
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,392
That's okay.

398
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,770
I'm still okay with that.

399
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,859
At first, I thought that

400
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,695
the monster had gotten you and Mr. Kim.

401
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,697
But no.

402
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,533
{\an8}As it turned out,
Mr. Kim was the only one dead.

403
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,578
{\an8}And you survived.

404
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,045
Yeah, maybe so.

405
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,508
There's definitely something out there
protecting me.

406
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,260
Who is it?

407
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,054
I don't know.

408
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,389
They won't ever show themselves.

409
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,687
I just want to believe
it's a certain person, that's all.

410
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,856
And who would that be?

411
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,820
I just...

412
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,532
I just want to see him
one more time, that's all.

413
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,538
But considering the lengths
to which he's going to avoid me,

414
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,626
I wonder if I should just let it go.

415
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,173
I'm sure he's got a good reason to do so.

416
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:56,557
But for me, I'm really,
really okay with it.

417
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,019
Just one more time.

418
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,646
No.

419
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,856
You'll meet him again.

420
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,025
You will.

421
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,128
Who was that?

422
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,089
Is there someone out there?

423
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,924
What if it's a monster?

424
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,343
As if a monster would throw down a rope.

425
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,948
Here, I've got you.

426
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,160
All right. One, two, three.

427
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,329
On my shoulder.

428
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,879
Help me up.

429
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,346
You're not going to leave me, are you?

430
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,014
Promise me.

431
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,016
What?

432
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,688
That you'll never chase after me, or...
or ask me questions.

433
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,024
I can't promise that.

434
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,610
This isn't up for debate.

435
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,278
I can't make a promise I can't keep.

436
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,291
Fine, damn it. Have it your way.

437
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,834
Grab on.

438
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,280
Whoa!

439
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,875
Huh?

440
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,003
Hey.

441
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,255
Wait a minute.

442
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,006
Something's here.

443
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,553
Get up here! Hurry! Hurry!

444
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,879
What is it?

445
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,965
It's gasoline.

446
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,427
Move!

447
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,285
You're still alive?

448
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,375
Aren't those the moles from the stadium?

449
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,418
You remember me, right?

450
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,255
We shared a ride
on the bus to the shelter.

451
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,049
Of course, I do.

452
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,467
I almost died because of you.

453
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,178
Go back to where you live,
and stop poking your head

454
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,596
where it doesn't belong.

455
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Hey, Dad.

456
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,143
Can't we ditch the foxy bitch
and raise the other one?

457
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,438
You want to take him and raise him?

458
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,607
- Uh-huh.
- What are you doing?

459
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,277
It's not like you can walk with that leg.

460
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,905
I don't want more mouths to feed.
You kids be on your way now.

461
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,448
She seems to have different ideas.

462
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,963
What are you doing?

463
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,716
I got no reason to trust you.
Why would I free you?

464
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,842
Oh?

465
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,595
Put that down while I'm asking nicely.

466
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,805
This?

467
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,098
You want this back?

468
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,143
Hmm? I'll trade you for it.

469
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,311
I want this guy.

470
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,187
Do you have rocks in your head?

471
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,522
Don't you understand English?

472
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,250
I told you to take him
and raise him all you'd like!

473
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,274
Hey.

474
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,361
You're gonna have to pay
for ruining my trap.

475
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,905
Jesus Christ, you've got to be kidding me.

476
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,949
I'll let you out tomorrow, and once I do,

477
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,035
feel free to never come back.

478
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,746
- Ha-ni.
- Hmm?

479
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,706
Let's go now.

480
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,625
I'm coming, boss.

481
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,753
- I'm coming.
- Untie me right now.

482
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,004
Untie me!

483
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,089
Hey!

484
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,178
Open the door right now! I'm leaving!

485
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,723
What difference does it make
whether I leave today or tomorrow, huh?

486
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,806
Damn it!

487
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,813
Hey.

488
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,525
What?

489
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,321
Did you really mean what you said?

490
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,031
What you just told her.

491
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,325
To take me and raise me.

492
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,915
Just stop.

493
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,753
I'm losing it right now.
I'm definitely losing it.

494
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,678
RUBBING ALCOHOL

495
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,597
It's not like I can make a difference now.

496
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,767
I'll only feel worse if I think about it.

497
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,602
But, uh...

498
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,605
Jun-il's monsterization...

499
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,402
It progressed way too quickly.

500
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,196
He didn't show any symptoms.

501
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,448
Ah, shit.

502
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,743
Stop thinking about it.

503
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,913
Let's just...

504
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,458
Don't think about it.

505
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,628
Let's just not think about anything.

506
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,275
Could that scar have been what caused it?

507
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,471
Shit!

508
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:34,974
{\an8}Wait.

509
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,537
GIRL, MOM, FLOWERS, TREE, STIMULATION

510
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,894
Let's see now. Damn it. Damn it.

511
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,982
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

512
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,525
<i>Uh, a kid.</i>

513
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,776
Jun-il...

514
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,987
<i>Flowers...</i>

515
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,280
Just what did you see?

516
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,574
<i>And... trees.</i>

517
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,995
{\an8}- Was it human?
<i>- There was a kid. A girl.</i>

518
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,455
{\an8}<i>- She was a girl.</i>
- A monster?

519
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,915
<i>Uh, she... she pushed me.</i>

520
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,918
Could it...

521
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,854
Mom?

522
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,192
Are you okay?

523
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
I'm okay.

524
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,410
Are you still afraid of me?

525
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,209
Because I hurt you back then?

526
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,925
Get inside.

527
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,096
No, I didn't do anything wrong.

528
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,597
I did it to protect you.

529
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,765
Protect? Really?

530
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,183
You?

531
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,268
Lies.

532
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,852
It's all lies.

533
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,605
You're no different from those people.

534
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,818
You...

535
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,029
ran into people again?

536
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,617
Did you use those hands...

537
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,037
turn them into monsters again?

538
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,918
<i>So what if I did?</i>

539
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,212
They became nicer.

540
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,174
It happened again.

541
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,969
You did it again.

542
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,931
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it again?

543
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,101
That's why I locked you up,
for your own sake!

544
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,312
I did it so you couldn't do something
like that again!

545
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,521
Let go of me!

546
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,734
No!

547
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,694
Let go!

548
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,893
Don't come out, no matter what.

549
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,480
Hey!

550
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,863
Is the little monster dead, huh?

551
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,364
No, of course she's not.

552
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,824
What's gotten into you, man? Hey.

553
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,492
Hey!

554
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:49,932
Mom...

555
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,943
No!

556
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,993
Don't kill it!

557
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,128
No! Stop!

558
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,471
Why would you do that?

559
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,433
- It was a monster.
- Are you gonna do that to me?

560
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,434
Of course not.

561
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,394
- Why would I...
- That's what you think of me.

562
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,688
Because I'm a monster.

563
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,360
I'm not like you,
no matter what you think.

564
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,321
I know how you feel.

565
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,451
That's not true.

566
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,578
I gave birth to you,
why would you be a monster?

567
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,162
Yeah?

568
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,790
"You were a mistake."

569
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,501
"You're a monster."

570
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,047
"I'm afraid of you."

571
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,302
What are you talking about?

572
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,012
"I just wish you'd disappear."

573
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,075
- I'm not...
- "I can't abandon you myself,

574
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,392
so you abandon me."

575
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,145
"Please just disappear
off to some place. Please."

576
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,814
That's not true.

577
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,858
That's what
you've been thinking all along.

578
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,223
What are you doing?
Are you gonna follow my brother?

579
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,267
Is he your brother,
your dad, or your boss?

580
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:45,976
Pick a lane.

581
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,605
He's my savior. Let's leave it at that.

582
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,857
So?

583
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,527
Are you coming or aren't you?

584
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,390
You're awake now.

585
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,105
What about the girl that came with me?

586
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,189
I don't know.

587
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,318
She left a little while ago.

588
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,284
Where's my gun, ma'am?

589
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,494
- Why do you ask?
- I should head back now.

590
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,664
If you...

591
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,209
begin walking around on it too quickly,

592
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,879
you could lose your leg.

593
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,943
I'm familiar with this kind of injury.

594
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,051
It's not that bad.

595
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,055
Do you take me for an idiot?

596
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,139
What?

597
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,020
I feed you, I give you a place to sleep,

598
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,230
I care for your wound,
and this is how you repay me,

599
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,315
leaving just like that?

600
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,025
That is very rude.

601
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,492
Is that how morals work in your country?

602
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,954
We're from the same country, though.

603
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,038
Oh.

604
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,667
I'm from outer space.

605
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,047
Oh, okay.

606
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,762
I really appreciate your help.

607
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,013
I'll pay you back.

608
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,515
But I really have to go.

609
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,560
Fine, have it your way.

610
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,228
Then...

611
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,606
have something before you go.

612
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,031
Eat up.

613
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,367
What's...

614
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,912
What's this made of?

615
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,956
We're not exactly The Ritz.

616
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,875
You should feel grateful to be fed.

617
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,835
It doesn't exactly look like food.

618
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,921
Are you worried I could've poisoned it?

619
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,680
Mmm.

620
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,932
See?

621
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,979
You'd better not ask for seconds.

622
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,190
Okay, thank you very much.

623
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,825
Oh, God.

624
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,120
All right, all right, all right.

625
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,584
What took so long?

626
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,628
Stop slacking off, okay?

627
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,380
Don't you see all of this?

628
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,008
I'm over here
doing all the hard work for you.

629
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,097
Must be nice,
not to have a care in the world.

630
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,640
Aren't you worried about her?

631
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,809
That girl you came here with?

632
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,314
Of course you're not.
You know, you've got a heart of stone.

633
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,982
Oh, come on!

634
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,903
Why would I worry about someone
who's gone off for her own survival?

635
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,571
She's as good as dead to me.

636
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,574
I don't know everything about you,

637
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:13,078
but I heard you were only able to join
because of your ties to that girl.

638
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,496
So you should be thankful.

639
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,957
Keep acting so heartless, and...

640
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,794
you'll end up a monster.

641
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,590
Grateful, my ass.

642
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,302
Oh, shit. Look at this.

643
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,346
We're in trouble. We really are.

644
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,682
This won't keep us alive for long.

645
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,566
And those pricks from the Crow Platoon
aren't really doing much lately.

646
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,687
Hey, watch your mouth.

647
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,732
You motherfuckers.

648
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,283
Hey, you.

649
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,204
You know your predecessors?

650
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,290
They got fired for running their mouths.

651
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,929
Uh... uh...

652
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,100
You-you're not supposed to just...
to take it like that.

653
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,894
We risked our goddamn lives
to bring these back!

654
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,442
You people don't get a say in any of this.

655
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,525
Yes, sir.

656
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,745
- Are you at it again?
- Look the other way.

657
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,080
Yeah, sure, I will.

658
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,058
But if those people report it
to Sergeant Tak...

659
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,601
Fucking hell!
Let them snitch for all I care!

660
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,228
Then I'll also be able
to get the hell out of here!

661
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,004
Come on, sir. Someone's going to hear you.

662
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,047
It's bad enough that people are calling
desertion our platoon's latest fad.

663
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,134
Which fucker said that?

664
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,721
Like Yong-seok's the same
as that useless private.

665
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,599
Sons of bitches.

666
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,018
You all owe your lives to us.

667
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,314
Ungrateful cocksuckers,
bitching behind our backs.

668
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,651
Sergeant Kim has been looking
for you all day.

669
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,777
He can fuck himself.

670
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,007
It's not like being here
is gonna win me any medal or something.

671
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:17,410
We're all gonna fuck about aimlessly
until we die meaningless deaths.

672
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,494
Fuck.

673
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,374
This one's going to last a while.

674
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,274
Aren't you going to search for him?

675
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,529
How did you get in here?

676
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,409
Why aren't you trying to find him?

677
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,869
You know what he said?

678
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,287
He's a Crow Platoon member,

679
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,748
and that you're like family to him.

680
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,420
You let him out of here.

681
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,131
You should've stopped him.

682
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,218
You knew the risks involved.

683
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,304
Why let him go?

684
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,307
I heard you're sick.

685
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,893
What was it you needed?

686
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,144
Just why in God's name...

687
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,899
...did he leave without a word?

688
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,027
I need new medicine.

689
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,530
I know the disease is terminal,

690
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,156
but I wanted to live longer.

691
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,034
That's why I let him go.

692
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,995
I told him not to,

693
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,454
but he wouldn't listen.

694
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,665
He insisted on it.

695
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,917
He did it for my sake.

696
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,001
Is that so wrong?

697
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,045
So bring him back.

698
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,673
He needs you, so go do it!

699
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,801
What is it you want?

700
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,013
Is it Yong-seok,
or the medicine he's bringing?

701
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,347
Does that matter?

702
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,224
Is that your answer?

703
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,712
BAMSEOM

704
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,853
Shit.

705
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,399
Hypocrite.

706
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,247
You're not real.

707
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,540
Of course not.

708
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,292
The real me died on that day.

709
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,546
The moment you strangled your own family
with your own two hands.

710
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,257
How did it feel?

711
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,427
You actually enjoyed it, didn't you?

712
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,728
You enjoy it after all.

713
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,604
Killing people.

714
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,898
It's what you do best.

715
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,528
Just do it.

716
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,157
You're not even particularly attached
to life, anyways.

717
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,122
I'm not done.

718
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,457
What?

719
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,583
I'm not...

720
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,886
I am not

721
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,013
done here yet.

722
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,152
Doctor!

723
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,739
Oh, God, no. No.

724
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:11,829
It's PTSD.

725
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,499
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

726
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,211
It has to be.

727
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,630
Right?

728
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,553
I think I might be able
to help you out, Sergeant.

729
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:35,019
I'm above petty threats and blackmail,
just so you know.

730
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,814
There are nicer ways of putting it.

731
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,691
A deal, a quid pro quo. Scratch that.

732
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,402
A negotiation, huh?

733
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,155
What do you want?

734
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,409
Let me out of here.

735
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,443
<i>Do you know the implications
of the Oh Jun-il incident?</i>

736
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:12,450
It's challenged the very laws
of monsterization as we know them.

737
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,870
I'm saying things might be different now.

738
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,540
Are you just going to sit around?
You have to do something.

739
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,127
{\an8}All the experiments have failed,

740
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,254
{\an8}and there's nothing you can do
about it, Dr. Lim.

741
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,882
Jesus.

742
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,344
You have the wrong idea.

743
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:36,057
I'm not saying
I'm going to treat monsterization.

744
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,268
I'm saying I'll help you resist it

745
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,437
so you won't turn into a monster.

746
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:49,236
You know the special infectees, right?
I can turn you into one.

747
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,160
If you go down, it won't be long
before this place follows suit.

748
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,913
You said you wanted to protect this place.

749
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,148
He won't attack you.

750
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,874
I'm looking for Yi-kyung.

751
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,711
You know where she is, right?

752
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,424
I have to meet with her.

753
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,509
Mom...

754
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,595
The people...

755
01:06:58,597 --> 01:06:59,765
They are all bad.

756
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,184
Did you say "Mom"?

757
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,978
You're no different.
