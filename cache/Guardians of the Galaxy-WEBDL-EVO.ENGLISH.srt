1
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,658
<i>Peter.</i>

2
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:43,264
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,510
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:26,612
Why have you been fighting with
the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,356
Peter?

6
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:34,050
They killed a little frog that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:37,261
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:40,895
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,597
You even look like him.

10
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,927
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,642
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

12
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:53,142
You got a present there for Peter, don't you?

13
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,638
Of course.

14
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,910
There.

15
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,418
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,691
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,793
Your grandpa

18
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,936
is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:22,302
At least until your daddy comes back to get you.

20
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,144
Take my hand.

21
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,378
Peter.

22
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:34,787
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,082
Take my hand.

24
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,063
Mom?

25
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,132
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,567
Mom! No!

27
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,202
- Come with me.
- No!

28
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,531
No!

29
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,406
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:55,973
No...

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,808
Okay?

32
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,424
No.

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,709
Mom!

34
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,007
Drop it!

35
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,835
Hey.

36
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,112
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,646
No problem at all.

38
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:38,517
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,252
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,988
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,424
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,792
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:49,461
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
- What is your name?

44
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,830
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

45
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,331
- Move!
- Why?

46
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,734
Ronan may have questions for you.

47
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:59,295
Hey, you know what? There's another
name you might know me by.

48
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,008
Star-Lord.

49
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:07,137
- Who?
- Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

50
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:10,439
- Guys?
- Move!

51
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,543
Forget this.

52
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,862
Peter?

53
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,801
What happened?

54
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:13,229
Hey...

55
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,394
I...

56
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,742
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

57
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,776
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

58
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:47,405
<i>Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today</i>

59
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:51,009
<i>protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor</i>

60
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,078
<i>and Xandar's Nova Prime.</i>

61
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,947
Peter, you have call.

62
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,443
- <i>No, wait, don't!</i>
- <i>Quill?</i>

63
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:03,788
Hey, Yondu.

64
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,957
<i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

65
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,258
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

66
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,527
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

67
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:10,895
<i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

68
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:13,565
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

69
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:16,167
- I slaved putting <i>this</i> deal together.
- Slaved?

70
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:17,302
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

71
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,506
<i>And now you're gonna rip me off!</i>

72
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:22,040
<i>We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

73
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,876
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

74
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,845
- <i>When I picked you up on Terra...</i>
- "Picked me up."

75
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,881
- <i>...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.</i>
- Yeah?

76
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,016
<i>They ain't never tasted any Terran before.</i>

77
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,351
<i>I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!</i>

78
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,145
<i>I will find you, I will...</i>

79
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:38,790
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.

80
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,525
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

81
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,060
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

82
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,505
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him

83
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,265
like we was hired to do!
He was cargo!

84
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:52,103
- You have always been soft on him.
- You're the only one I'm being soft on!

85
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:54,973
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

86
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,541
As soon as we get him back here,

87
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:00,378
I'm gonna kill him myself.

88
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,275
What we do need to worry about,

89
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:06,081
is who else out there wants that Orb!

90
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,734
<i>They call me "terrorist,"</i>

91
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:32,001
<i>"radical," "zealot,"</i>

92
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:36,005
<i>because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,</i>

93
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:39,851
<i>and punish those who do not.</i>

94
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:43,088
<i>Because I do not forgive your people</i>

96
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,227
<i>and his father, and his father before him.</i>

97
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:55,967
<i>A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!</i>

98
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,365
You can't do this! Our government
signed a peace treaty.

99
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:02,801
My government knows no shame.

100
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:06,739
You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.

101
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,713
You

102
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,116
will never rule Xandar.

103
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,705
No.

104
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:15,744
I will cure it!

105
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,601
Ronan,

106
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,569
Korath has returned.

107
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,873
Master, he is a thief,

108
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,041
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

109
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,677
But we have discovered he has an agreement

110
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:42,580
to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known

111
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,215
as The Broker.

112
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:47,752
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him.

113
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,912
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

114
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:55,223
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.

115
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:56,694
It will be my honor.

116
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,283
It will be your doom.

117
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,633
If this happens again, you'll be facing our father

118
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,434
without his prize.

119
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,501
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

120
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,738
Just like you.

121
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,173
But I know Xandar.

122
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,941
Ronan has already decreed that I...

123
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,508
Do not speak for me.

124
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:16,012
You will not fail.

125
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,340
Have I ever?

126
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,802
Xandarians.

127
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:40,104
What a bunch of losers.

128
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:44,776
All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid,

129
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:47,111
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

130
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,179
Look at this guy!

131
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,848
Can you believe they call us criminals,

132
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,283
when he's assaulting us with that haircut?

133
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:55,153
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

134
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:58,857
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

135
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,357
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

136
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,722
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

137
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:07,866
<i>Right, Groot?</i>

138
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,033
Groot?

139
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,035
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

140
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,671
That's disgusting!

141
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,707
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

142
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,399
Why are you lying?

143
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,547
Looks like we got one.

144
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:27,106
Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you?

145
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:32,783
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

146
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,066
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

147
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:50,440
The Orb.

148
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:54,045
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

149
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:55,880
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

150
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,015
And told me to tell you,

151
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:59,810
that you got the best eyebrows in the business.

152
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:03,041
What is it?

153
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,691
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

154
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,826
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.

155
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:12,327
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.

156
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,260
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

157
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,169
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

158
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:19,270
I truly am.

159
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,533
But I want no part of this
transaction if Ronan is involved.

160
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,276
Who's Ronan?

161
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,613
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty,

162
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:33,051
who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture,

163
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,860
- is wiped from existence!
- Come on.

164
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:37,322
He's someone whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

165
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:40,952
- What? What about my bad side?
- Farewell, Mr. Quill.

166
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,660
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

167
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,792
What happened?

168
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:57,203
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.
If there's one thing I hate,

169
00:17:57,304 --> 00:18:01,035
it's a man without integrity.
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

170
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,382
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

171
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:07,041
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

172
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,855
People say it about me, all the time,

173
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,622
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.

174
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,334
This wasn't the plan.

175
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,614
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

176
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,017
No! Not her, him!

177
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,016
Learn genders, man.

178
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,547
Biting? That's not fair!

179
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,686
Take it easy!

180
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,657
Fool. You should have learned.

181
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:22,020
I don't learn. One of my issues.

182
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,360
What the...

183
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,733
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

184
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,379
You gotta be kidding me.

185
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,344
Hey!

186
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:03,034
I live for the simple things.

187
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,795
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

188
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,742
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

189
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:15,880
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

190
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,947
Quit whining.

191
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:29,553
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

192
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,262
Crap.

193
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:32,797
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

194
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,699
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

195
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,968
...for endangerment to life and
the destruction of property.

196
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:40,238
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

197
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:43,608
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

198
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,311
I picked this guy up a while back for
petty theft. He's got a code name.

199
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:48,446
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

200
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:50,414
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

201
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,216
Just relax, pal.

202
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,875
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

203
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,977
Fascists.

204
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:14,438
Ronan is destroying Xandarian
outposts throughout the galaxy.

205
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:18,406
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

206
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,379
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.
What more do you want?

207
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:25,816
At least a statement from the Kree Empire
saying that they condemn his actions.

208
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,921
He is slaughtering children.
Families.

209
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:34,881
That is your business. Now,
I have other matters to attend to.

210
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,327
Prick.

211
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,565
Well, some good news.

212
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:44,101
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

213
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:48,472
Gamora. Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

214
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:51,409
The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

215
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:54,679
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

216
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,049
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

217
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:02,520
<i>Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."</i>

218
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,988
The result of illegal genetic

219
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:07,191
and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form.

220
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,360
What the hell?

221
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,028
They call it "Groot."

222
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:13,598
A humanoid plant that's been travelling recently

223
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:17,326
as 89P13's personal houseplantlmuscle.

224
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:21,172
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

225
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:24,342
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

226
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,277
led by Yondu Udonta.

227
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,878
I'm sorry.

228
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:30,948
I didn't know how this machine worked.

229
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,551
What a bunch of a-holes.

230
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,585
Transport all four to the Kyln.

231
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:42,393
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws,

232
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:46,063
but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.

233
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:50,034
But, hey, that's not my problem.
I ain't gonna be here long.

234
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:53,604
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

235
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:56,274
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise, me and Groot

236
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,209
would be collecting that bounty right now,

237
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,345
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

238
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,581
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years.

239
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:06,484
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

240
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:07,652
Hold.

241
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,654
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

242
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,055
It's what you are, stupid.

243
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:14,191
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

244
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,861
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase,

245
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,453
Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

246
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,999
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

247
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,768
So what? What's the Orb?

248
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,070
I have no words for an honorless thief.

249
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,674
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

250
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,642
Yeah, I know who you are.

251
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:35,413
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

252
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:38,015
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

253
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:40,515
Yeah, you said that.

254
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:45,122
I wasn't retrieving the Orb
for Ronan. I was betraying him.

255
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:47,690
I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.

256
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,594
I am Groot.

257
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:54,932
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

258
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:57,201
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

259
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,503
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you.

260
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:03,674
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

261
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,476
Exclusively in that order.

262
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:08,271
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

263
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,072
Hey. Put that away.

264
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,018
Hey!

265
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,454
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

266
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:20,652
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

267
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:28,764
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.
That song belongs to me!

268
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:51,348
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

269
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,984
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

270
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:58,782
You're scum! You're scum!

271
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,493
It's like I said,

272
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,428
she's got a rep.

273
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,497
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families

274
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,666
to Ronan and his goons.

275
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,034
She'll last a day, tops.

276
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:11,702
Murderer!

277
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:13,337
The guards will protect her, right?

278
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:15,706
They're here to stop us from getting out.

279
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:17,775
They don't care what we do to each other inside.

280
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:21,412
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

281
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:25,607
are dreams compared to what's behind me.

282
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:29,086
Check out the new meat.

283
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:32,923
I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly,

284
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:34,785
and go to town...

285
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,192
Let's make something clear.

286
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,425
This one here is our booty!

287
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:47,933
You wanna get to him,

288
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:50,267
you go through us!

289
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,310
Or, more accurately,

290
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,310
we go through you.

291
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,119
I'm with them.

292
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,318
I hate you.

293
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:14,653
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

294
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,401
You're dead!

295
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:29,979
Dead!

296
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,541
Take her down to the showers.

297
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:00,939
It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.

298
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:14,919
Quill, where you going?

299
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,282
Quill.

300
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:19,195
Quill!

301
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,233
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

302
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,469
for your crimes against the galaxy.

303
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,229
You dare?

304
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,274
You know who I am, yes?

305
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:36,880
You're Drax.

306
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,116
The Destroyer.

307
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,217
Quill!

308
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:42,286
And you know why they call me this.

309
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:45,411
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

310
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:48,892
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

311
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:51,426
and my daughter, Camaria.

312
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,991
He slaughtered them where they stood.

313
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:56,266
And he laughed!

314
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:57,334
Quill?

315
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:58,992
Her life

316
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,770
is not yours to take.

317
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:05,764
He killed my family.

318
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,635
I shall kill one of his in return.

319
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,106
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

320
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,352
Quill! What are you doing?

321
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:23,153
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

322
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:34,463
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

323
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:38,709
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

324
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:41,345
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

325
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,614
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,

326
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:45,511
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

327
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:48,852
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?

328
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:51,321
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

329
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,992
Look, this is from a
smoking-hot Rajak girl.

330
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:58,328
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like
me skipping out on her at sunrise.

331
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,998
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.

332
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:04,268
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

333
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:07,771
I was trying to get information.
You ever see an A'askavariian?

334
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,740
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.

335
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,535
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...

336
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:16,068
You don't care. But here's the point.

337
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:20,612
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

338
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,410
And when he does,

339
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:24,850
that's when you...

340
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,358
Why would I put my finger on his throat?

341
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,982
What?

342
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:32,796
No, it's a symbol.

343
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:37,568
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.

344
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,636
I would not slice his throat.

345
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:42,506
I would cut his head clean off.

346
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,708
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.

347
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:46,360
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

348
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:47,878
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:50,105
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

350
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:55,217
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.

351
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:58,284
Don't do his work for him.

352
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:13,669
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

353
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,507
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

354
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:19,743
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

355
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:23,005
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

356
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:24,414
You know where to sell my Orb.

357
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:27,209
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?

358
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:29,509
My friend Rocket, here,

359
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,382
has escaped 22 prisons.

360
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:32,723
We're getting out.

361
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,793
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

362
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:39,988
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?

363
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,166
Four billion units.

364
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,101
- What?
- Holy shit.

365
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:48,228
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

366
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,164
If you free us,

367
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:54,945
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll
split the profit between the three of us.

368
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,114
I am Groot.

369
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:58,282
Four of us.

370
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:01,951
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per frickin' usual.

371
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,323
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

372
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,550
We know only that she has been captured.

373
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:11,161
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

374
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:15,699
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

375
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,402
Look, your partnership with Thanos

376
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,697
is at risk.

377
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:25,198
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

378
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:34,351
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

379
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,953
and yet you summon me.

380
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,955
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

381
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,123
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.

382
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:42,092
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

383
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:44,962
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.

384
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:46,864
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.

385
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:51,068
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

386
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:52,502
Lower your tone!

387
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,069
I may be your...

388
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:06,180
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.

389
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,854
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,

390
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,682
is you.

391
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,525
Your politics bore me.

392
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,695
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

393
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:23,959
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

394
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,039
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

395
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,402
if you bring me the Orb.

396
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,833
But return to me again empty-handed,

397
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:38,312
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.

398
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,549
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

399
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:48,585
This is one fight you won't win.

400
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:51,487
Let's head to the Kyln.

401
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:02,673
If we're gonna get out of here, we're
gonna need to get into that watchtower.

402
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,900
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.

403
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:09,980
The guards wear security bands to
control their ins and outs. I need one.

404
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,515
Leave it to me.

405
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:14,418
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

406
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:16,253
- His leg?
- Yeah.

407
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,855
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

408
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:19,957
All right.

409
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:24,361
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

410
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:26,430
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

411
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,667
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

412
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,903
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.

413
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,404
How are we supposed to do that?

414
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:36,773
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

415
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:38,508
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.

416
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,743
You must be joking.

417
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:41,611
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

418
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:43,313
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

419
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,816
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

420
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:48,685
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.

421
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:51,989
I got one plan, and that plan
requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

422
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,681
so figure it out!

423
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,526
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

424
00:34:56,626 --> 00:35:00,197
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

425
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:02,666
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.

426
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:08,902
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,
so you definitely need to get that last.

427
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:16,279
Or we could just get it first and improvise.

428
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:18,904
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

429
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,598
Prisoner, drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

430
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:37,029
or we will open fire.

431
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:44,741
I am

432
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:47,611
Groot!

433
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:49,542
Fire!

434
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,456
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.

435
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,001
You idiot!

436
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:14,297
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?

437
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:21,711
The animal is in control.

438
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,245
Fire on my command!

439
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,065
Creepy little beast!

440
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:54,667
Oh, yeah.

441
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,452
You need my what?

442
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,742
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

443
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,277
It's internally wired.

444
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:29,469
I'll figure something out.

445
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,117
Drop the leg!

446
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:37,277
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

447
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,532
Rocket!

448
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,704
Move to the watchtower!

449
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,728
You!

450
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,332
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

451
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:36,836
It was one time, man.

452
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:41,172
We need all available guards in full combat gear...

453
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,039
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

454
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,198
Why is this one here?

455
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,846
We promised him he could stay by
your side until he kills your boss.

456
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:12,882
I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

457
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:14,710
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

458
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:17,854
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

459
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,656
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

460
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:22,659
Was it funny? Wait, what did
he look like hopping around?

461
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:25,159
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

462
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:29,155
How are we going to leave?

463
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,137
Well, he's got a plan. Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

464
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:35,839
I have a plan! I have a plan!

465
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:39,276
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

466
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:42,646
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

467
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:45,680
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

468
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:47,117
It's just a metaphor, dude.

469
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:50,086
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

470
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,888
Nothing goes over my head.

471
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:55,548
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

472
00:39:55,759 --> 00:40:00,025
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

473
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,564
Those are some big guns.

474
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,031
On my command!

475
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:11,974
Number one!

476
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:16,339
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
- Hold on!

477
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,676
Number two!

478
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:24,220
I recognize this animal. We'd roast
them over a flame pit as children.

479
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,923
- Their flesh was quite delicious.
- Not helping!

480
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,490
Number three!

481
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:37,233
All fire on my command!

482
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,802
Three!

483
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,437
Two!

484
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,163
One!

485
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,921
He turned off the artificial gravity,

486
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,455
everywhere but in here.

487
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:41,060
I told you I had a plan.

488
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:05,014
That was a pretty good plan.

489
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,400
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

490
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,170
It's the Milano, the orange and
blue one over in the corner.

491
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,071
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

492
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:24,639
That's rude! They folded yours.

493
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:34,484
The Orb's there. Let's go.

494
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:37,153
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

495
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:39,322
That bastard didn't put it back.

496
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:42,025
- Put what back?
- Here.

497
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,827
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

498
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:46,496
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

499
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:47,931
Go.

500
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,759
Go!

501
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,917
My neck!

502
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,760
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

503
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,796
He declined to share that information with me.

504
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:21,363
Well, screw this, then!

505
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:25,268
I ain't waiting around for some humie with
a death wish. You got the Orb, right?

506
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:27,426
Yes.

507
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:52,295
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.

508
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:53,363
No!

509
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,931
We're not leaving without the Orb.

510
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:05,869
Behold.

511
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:15,018
This one shows spirit.

512
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:18,054
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.

513
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:21,088
Companion, what were you retrieving?

514
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:28,786
You're an imbecile.

515
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,476
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

516
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:43,179
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!

517
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:45,114
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

518
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:46,182
It's a bomb.

519
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:47,350
- A bomb?
- Yup.

520
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,152
And you leave it lying around?

521
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:50,853
I was gonna put it in a box.

522
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:52,055
What's a box gonna do?

523
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:54,357
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

524
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:55,458
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

525
00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:57,525
- Shut up.
- Hey!

526
00:44:58,327 --> 00:44:59,429
What is that?

527
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:02,632
That's for if things get really hardcore.

528
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:03,967
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

529
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:05,602
No one's blowing up moons.

530
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,870
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.

531
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,495
So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.

532
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:13,376
We're heading in the
right direction. For now.

533
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:16,012
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

534
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,614
And how much do you trust me?

535
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:21,149
I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was.

536
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:24,587
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.

537
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:25,989
I don't know what it is.

538
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,424
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.

539
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:30,460
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

540
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,628
Or just you, murderess!

541
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,396
I let you live once, princess!

542
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:35,598
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

543
00:45:35,698 --> 00:45:39,725
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

544
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:43,573
We're stuck together until we get the money.

545
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:45,875
I have no interest in money.

546
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:47,669
Great.

547
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:52,071
That means more money for the three of us.

548
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:57,453
For the four of us. Partners.

549
00:45:57,553 --> 00:46:01,246
We have an agreement, but I would
never be partners with the likes of you.

550
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,818
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

551
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,157
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

552
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:14,325
She has no idea.

553
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,439
If I had a black light,

554
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:19,507
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

555
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:21,836
You got issues, Quill.

556
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:33,179
I swear. I don't know where
they went! I swear.

557
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:36,159
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

558
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:37,694
Yeah.

559
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:42,031
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.

560
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:46,569
Well, then, send Necrocraft to
every corner of the quadrant.

561
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:50,139
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

562
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,741
- And this place?
- The Nova can't know what we're after.

563
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:57,142
Cleanse it!

564
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,984
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one?

565
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:06,089
I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.

566
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:08,291
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

567
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:10,526
He's being fully serious.

568
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:13,321
In that case, I can show you...

569
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,798
But first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is,

570
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:18,559
and why everybody cares so damn much about it.

571
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:20,503
And then you gonna tell me,

572
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:22,739
who out there might wanna buy it.

573
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,001
Sir, the high-end community is a...

574
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:30,343
The high-end community is a...

575
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,081
It's a tight-knit...

576
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:33,449
Tight-knit...

577
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:35,744
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

578
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,354
I cannot possibly betray

579
00:47:38,454 --> 00:47:40,615
the confidentiality of my buyers!

580
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:54,166
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

581
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,741
Carina.

582
00:47:58,841 --> 00:47:59,976
Yes, Master.

583
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:03,513
Your people do have elbows, do they not?

584
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,047
We do, Master.

585
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:08,582
Then use them.

586
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:10,820
I don't have to remind you

587
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,390
what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.

588
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,389
Do I?

589
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:23,226
Chop, chop. Our guests
will be here soon.

590
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:29,595
Heads up! We're inbound.

591
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:50,013
What is it?

592
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:52,562
It's called Knowhere.

593
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:55,932
The severed head of an ancient celestial being.

594
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:58,295
Be wary headed in, rodent.

595
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:02,629
There are no regulations whatsoever here.

596
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:29,365
Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in

597
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:32,034
to mine the organic matter within the skull.

598
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:34,437
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

599
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:39,642
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

600
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:43,379
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

601
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:45,674
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

602
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:49,151
Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

603
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:50,753
It sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.

604
00:49:50,853 --> 00:49:52,342
Yeah, you should.

605
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:54,357
Excuse me.

606
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:57,289
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

607
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:06,358
Get out of here.

608
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:13,476
Your buyer's in there?

609
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:15,478
We are to wait here for his representative.

610
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:17,079
Get out of here!

611
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,415
This is no respectable establishment.

612
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:22,040
What do you expect us to do while we wait?

613
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:24,944
Yes! Yes!

614
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:35,395
Yahoo!

615
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,739
My Orloni has won,

616
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,102
as I won at all things!

617
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:49,045
Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.

618
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:53,513
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

619
00:50:54,525 --> 00:50:56,594
Man, you wouldn't believe what
they charge for fuel out here.

620
00:50:56,619 --> 00:51:01,057
- I might actually lose money on this job.
- My connection is making us wait.

621
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:05,194
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

622
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:10,626
Where yours is more,
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

623
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,559
- My father didn't stress diplomacy.
- Thanos?

624
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:17,668
He's not my father.

625
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:22,739
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

626
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:27,683
He tortured me, turned me into a weapon.

627
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:31,821
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

628
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:34,355
I couldn't stand by and...

629
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:41,228
Why would you risk your life for this?

630
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:44,889
My mother gave it to me.

631
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:49,205
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

632
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:50,673
I happened to have it on me,

633
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:53,104
when I was...

634
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,672
The day that she...

635
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:59,842
You know, when I left Earth.

636
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:01,584
What do you do with it?

637
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:05,421
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

638
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:10,192
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

639
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:11,560
Really?

640
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,865
On my planet, there's a legend about people like you.

641
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,500
It's called

642
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,901
Footloose.

643
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:23,072
And in it, a great hero

644
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:24,900
named Kevin Bacon,

645
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:30,505
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

646
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:33,612
It's the greatest thing there is.

647
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:35,651
Who put the sticks up their butts?

648
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,219
What? No, that's just a...

649
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:39,188
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

650
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:41,949
people use.

651
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:02,670
The melody is pleasant!

652
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,530
- No!
- What the hell?

653
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,032
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

654
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:26,435
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

655
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:28,737
Your pelvic sorcery!

656
00:53:28,837 --> 00:53:30,702
That is not what is happening here.

657
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,642
No.

658
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:48,057
Stop it!

659
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:49,492
What are you doing?

660
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:52,728
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!

661
00:53:52,828 --> 00:53:54,797
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

662
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:57,299
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

663
00:53:57,399 --> 00:53:59,568
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

664
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:01,737
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!

665
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:04,440
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

666
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,309
He thinks I'm some
stupid thing! He does!

667
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,812
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

668
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,981
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

669
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,083
and put back together, over and over

670
00:54:14,183 --> 00:54:16,452
and turned into some...

671
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:17,620
Some little monster!

672
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,688
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

673
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:21,957
He called me "vermin"!

674
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:24,727
She called me "rodent"!

675
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:26,162
Let's see if you can laugh

676
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,398
after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!

677
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:33,302
No, no, no, no!
Four billion units! Rocket!

678
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:37,696
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one
more lousy night and you're rich.

679
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:48,231
Fine. But I can't promise,

680
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:50,886
when all this is over I'm not gonna
kill every last one of you jerks.

681
00:54:50,986 --> 00:54:54,944
See? That's exactly why none
of you have any friends!

682
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,726
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

683
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:01,830
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.

684
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,398
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

685
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:08,437
- Drax!
- Let him go.

686
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:10,197
We don't need him.

687
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,243
Milady Gamora.

688
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:16,606
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

689
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,753
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

690
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:28,151
We house the galaxy's largest collection

691
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:31,290
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.

692
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:39,101
I present to you,

693
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:43,296
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

694
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:59,245
Oh, my dear Gamora.

695
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:02,091
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

696
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:05,094
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

697
00:56:05,194 --> 00:56:08,128
We have what we discussed.

698
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:13,235
What is that thing there?

699
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:15,496
I am Groot.

700
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:20,843
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

701
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,842
Sir...

702
00:56:23,112 --> 00:56:26,415
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

703
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:29,451
At the moment of your death, of course.

704
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:30,853
I am Groot.

705
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:33,722
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?

706
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:35,289
That's your pet?

707
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:38,250
- His what?
- Tivan.

708
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:42,231
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

709
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:44,433
Very well, then.

710
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:47,501
Let us see what you brought.

711
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:03,510
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.

712
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:07,409
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

713
00:57:08,548 --> 00:57:11,785
You shall send a message for me.

714
00:57:11,885 --> 00:57:13,818
Oh, my new friends.

715
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:17,891
Before creation itself,

716
00:57:17,991 --> 00:57:20,152
there were six singularities.

717
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:25,732
Then the universe exploded into existence,

718
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:27,934
and the remnants of these systems

719
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:31,935
were forged into concentrated ingots.

720
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:34,969
Infinity Stones.

721
00:57:35,675 --> 00:57:37,210
These stones, it seems,

722
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,179
can only be brandished

723
00:57:39,279 --> 00:57:42,816
by beings of extraordinary strength.

724
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,405
Observe.

725
00:57:47,187 --> 00:57:52,993
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

726
00:57:53,093 --> 00:57:57,051
like wheat in a field.

727
00:57:58,098 --> 00:58:00,828
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.

728
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:02,469
Once, for a moment,

729
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:06,673
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,

730
00:58:06,773 --> 00:58:10,208
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.

731
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:18,076
Beautiful.

732
00:58:19,419 --> 00:58:22,353
Beyond compare.

733
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:28,186
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

734
00:58:29,629 --> 00:58:31,097
How would you like to get paid?

735
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:33,688
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

736
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,225
Very well, then.

737
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:42,976
Carina.

738
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:44,543
Stand back.

739
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:47,414
I will no longer be your slave!

740
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:49,447
No!

741
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:37,820
What the...

742
00:59:46,807 --> 00:59:49,609
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

743
00:59:49,709 --> 00:59:53,213
- What do you still have it for?
- What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

744
00:59:53,313 --> 00:59:57,183
- I can't believe you had that in your purse!
- It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

745
00:59:57,283 --> 01:00:00,954
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.
There's a chance they can contain it.

746
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:03,858
Are you kidding me?
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

747
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,493
- Just give it to Ronan!
- So he can destroy the galaxy?

748
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:08,394
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?

749
01:00:08,494 --> 01:00:11,498
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

750
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:13,399
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

751
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:18,271
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow
the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

752
01:00:18,371 --> 01:00:21,708
We have to go back to your ship, and deliver it to Nova.

753
01:00:21,808 --> 01:00:24,640
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

754
01:00:24,978 --> 01:00:28,948
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

755
01:00:29,048 --> 01:00:32,218
who's really nice for a whole lot of money.

756
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:34,854
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

757
01:00:34,954 --> 01:00:38,123
You're despicable. Dishonorable.

758
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:39,758
Faithless!

759
01:00:40,026 --> 01:00:42,016
- No.
- At last!

760
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:46,666
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

761
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:48,927
You called Ronan?

762
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:56,831
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

763
01:00:57,543 --> 01:01:00,102
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

764
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,985
Ronan the Accuser!

765
01:01:06,085 --> 01:01:08,621
You are the one who transmitted the message?

766
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:10,483
You killed my wife.

767
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:13,220
You killed my daughter!

768
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:24,532
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

769
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:33,508
It is Gamora. She is
escaping with the Orb.

770
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:43,489
No!

771
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:45,056
Nebula,

772
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:47,517
retrieve the Orb.

773
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:05,941
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

774
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:07,907
Bring it down!

775
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:39,245
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.

776
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:41,781
How? We've got no
weaponry on these things.

777
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:43,716
These pods are industrial grade.

778
01:02:43,816 --> 01:02:45,018
They're nearly indestructible.

779
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:47,720
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

780
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,844
That's not what I'm saying.

781
01:03:37,904 --> 01:03:40,031
Let me borrow your ride.

782
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:14,634
I don't recall killing your family.

783
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:21,344
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

784
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:40,795
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

785
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:42,434
I have to head out.

786
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,904
Wait! These things aren't
meant to go out there.

787
01:04:53,479 --> 01:04:55,810
You are a disappointment, sister.

788
01:04:56,148 --> 01:04:58,548
Of all our siblings,

789
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:00,820
I hated you least.

790
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,188
Nebula, please.

791
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:04,223
If Ronan gets this stone

792
01:05:04,323 --> 01:05:06,518
- he'll kill us all.
- Not all.

793
01:05:07,793 --> 01:05:09,920
You will already be dead.

794
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:07,418
Ronan, it is done.

795
01:06:10,022 --> 01:06:11,511
Quill, come on.

796
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:14,160
Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,

797
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,329
but there's nothing we can do for her.

798
01:06:16,429 --> 01:06:17,997
These pods aren't meant to be out here.

799
01:06:18,097 --> 01:06:20,963
In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.

800
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,770
Damn it.

801
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:33,145
Quill?

802
01:06:33,245 --> 01:06:35,281
Yondu! Yondu.

803
01:06:35,381 --> 01:06:36,415
This is Quill!

804
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:40,186
- My coordinates are 227 K324.
- Quill.

805
01:06:40,286 --> 01:06:41,521
Quill, what are you doing?

806
01:06:41,621 --> 01:06:43,122
Just outside Knowhere.

807
01:06:43,222 --> 01:06:45,815
If you're there, come get me.

808
01:06:46,058 --> 01:06:48,025
I'm all yours.

809
01:06:57,003 --> 01:06:59,437
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

810
01:07:00,573 --> 01:07:02,975
Get back into your pod!

811
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:06,601
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

812
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:09,448
You'll die in seconds!

813
01:07:09,548 --> 01:07:11,140
Quill.

814
01:08:11,744 --> 01:08:13,905
Quill?

815
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:17,014
What happened?

816
01:08:17,717 --> 01:08:20,208
I saw you out there.

817
01:08:21,187 --> 01:08:24,121
I don't know what came over me.

818
01:08:24,623 --> 01:08:26,886
But I couldn't let you die.

819
01:08:29,261 --> 01:08:32,161
I found something inside of myself.

820
01:08:32,732 --> 01:08:34,367
Something

821
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:36,867
incredibly heroic.

822
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,773
I mean, not to brag,

823
01:08:40,873 --> 01:08:42,141
but, objectively...

824
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:43,730
Where's the Orb?

825
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:47,446
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

826
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:49,035
What?

827
01:08:51,317 --> 01:08:54,217
Welcome home, Peter.

828
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:19,872
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

829
01:09:20,746 --> 01:09:23,049
Quill just got himself captured.

830
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:27,520
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

831
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,314
take on a frickin' army!

832
01:09:30,623 --> 01:09:32,283
You're right.

833
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:37,086
I was a fool.

834
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:41,259
All the anger,

835
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:43,764
all the rage,

836
01:09:46,472 --> 01:09:49,236
was just to cover my loss.

837
01:09:57,383 --> 01:10:00,181
"My wife and child are dead."

838
01:10:01,253 --> 01:10:03,522
I don't care if it's mean!

839
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:05,953
Everybody's got dead people.

840
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,893
It's no excuse to get everybody else

841
01:10:07,993 --> 01:10:10,358
dead along the way!

842
01:10:13,732 --> 01:10:16,469
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

843
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:19,772
The only chance we got is to get
to the other side of the universe

844
01:10:19,872 --> 01:10:21,841
as fast as we can and maybe,

845
01:10:21,941 --> 01:10:27,037
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

846
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:30,449
I am Groot.

847
01:10:30,549 --> 01:10:32,918
Save them? How?

848
01:10:33,018 --> 01:10:35,855
I am Groot.

849
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:38,591
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,

850
01:10:38,691 --> 01:10:41,494
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.

851
01:10:41,594 --> 01:10:43,652
And there's only two of us!

852
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,958
Three.

853
01:10:54,573 --> 01:10:56,876
You're making me

854
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:58,611
beat... up

855
01:10:58,711 --> 01:11:00,178
grass!

856
01:11:02,248 --> 01:11:04,443
The Orb is in my possession,

857
01:11:05,084 --> 01:11:06,652
as I promised.

858
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:08,387
Bring it to me.

859
01:11:08,487 --> 01:11:12,252
Yes, that was our agreement.

860
01:11:12,524 --> 01:11:14,260
Bring you the Orb,

861
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,963
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

862
01:11:18,063 --> 01:11:22,668
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,

863
01:11:22,768 --> 01:11:24,870
I wonder what use I have for you.

864
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,705
Boy,

865
01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:29,671
I would reconsider your current course.

866
01:11:30,376 --> 01:11:32,711
Master! You cannot!

867
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:35,779
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.

868
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:38,042
Not anymore.

869
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:02,741
You call me "boy!"

870
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:07,446
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,

871
01:12:07,546 --> 01:12:11,116
and burn it to its core!

872
01:12:11,216 --> 01:12:13,219
Then, Thanos,

873
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:15,753
I am coming for you.

874
01:12:17,656 --> 01:12:20,960
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?

875
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,962
You dare to oppose me?

876
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:24,864
You see what he has turned me into.

877
01:12:24,964 --> 01:12:29,696
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

878
01:12:30,002 --> 01:12:31,969
You betray me?

879
01:12:32,438 --> 01:12:33,472
Steal my money?

880
01:12:33,572 --> 01:12:35,474
Stop it! Leave him alone!

881
01:12:35,574 --> 01:12:37,710
When I picked you up as a kid,

882
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:40,212
these boys wanted to eat you.

883
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:42,815
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

884
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:44,583
I saved your life!

885
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,919
Will you shut up about that? God!

886
01:12:47,019 --> 01:12:49,321
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,

887
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:52,124
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

888
01:12:52,224 --> 01:12:55,861
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!

889
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:58,497
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!

890
01:12:58,597 --> 01:13:00,155
You abducted me, man.

891
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:03,035
You stole me from my home and from my family.

892
01:13:03,135 --> 01:13:05,671
You don't give a damn about your Terra!

893
01:13:05,771 --> 01:13:06,839
You're scared

894
01:13:06,939 --> 01:13:09,041
because you're soft in here.

895
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:10,476
Here, right here!

896
01:13:10,576 --> 01:13:11,644
Yondu!

897
01:13:11,744 --> 01:13:12,945
Listen to me.

898
01:13:13,045 --> 01:13:15,281
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.

899
01:13:15,381 --> 01:13:17,316
I know what he's got, girl.

900
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:19,752
Then you know we must get it back!

901
01:13:19,852 --> 01:13:23,322
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

902
01:13:23,422 --> 01:13:26,425
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

903
01:13:26,525 --> 01:13:29,161
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

904
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:30,728
Sentiment?

905
01:13:31,764 --> 01:13:34,027
Eating away your brain like maggots!

906
01:13:38,337 --> 01:13:40,202
That's it.

907
01:13:40,406 --> 01:13:41,807
No!

908
01:13:41,907 --> 01:13:43,075
Sorry, boy.

909
01:13:43,175 --> 01:13:46,745
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

910
01:13:46,845 --> 01:13:48,573
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

911
01:13:50,949 --> 01:13:53,252
If you kill me now,

912
01:13:53,352 --> 01:13:57,879
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

913
01:14:02,594 --> 01:14:04,493
The Stone?

914
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:06,799
I hope you got something better than that.

915
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:09,993
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.

916
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:12,104
We got a ringer.

917
01:14:12,204 --> 01:14:14,103
Is that right?

918
01:14:14,773 --> 01:14:17,209
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.

919
01:14:17,309 --> 01:14:18,610
His ships,

920
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:20,312
his army.

921
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:22,709
He's vulnerable.

922
01:14:23,048 --> 01:14:24,350
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

923
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:28,477
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

924
01:14:35,727 --> 01:14:37,251
Let him go!

925
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:41,133
You always did have a scrote, boy!

926
01:14:41,233 --> 01:14:44,429
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

927
01:14:52,244 --> 01:14:54,279
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

928
01:14:54,379 --> 01:14:57,040
Attention, idiots.

929
01:14:58,684 --> 01:15:02,521
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

930
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:04,390
It's a weapon of my own design.

931
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:05,991
What the hell?

932
01:15:06,091 --> 01:15:08,861
If you don't hand over our companions now,

933
01:15:08,961 --> 01:15:11,330
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

934
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:13,265
A very big new one!

935
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:16,635
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

936
01:15:16,735 --> 01:15:19,905
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

937
01:15:20,005 --> 01:15:21,840
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

938
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,009
We figured it out! We're fine!

939
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:25,769
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

940
01:15:27,212 --> 01:15:28,847
You call that "figured it out"?

941
01:15:28,947 --> 01:15:31,316
We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.

942
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:32,851
You want to talk about senseless?

943
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:35,220
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?

944
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,157
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

945
01:15:38,257 --> 01:15:40,125
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over

946
01:15:40,225 --> 01:15:41,760
when you only gave them a count of five?

947
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,364
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan.

948
01:15:45,464 --> 01:15:47,733
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

949
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,002
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

950
01:15:50,102 --> 01:15:54,173
What's important now is we get the
Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.

951
01:15:54,473 --> 01:15:58,043
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's
just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

952
01:15:58,143 --> 01:16:01,213
- We'll figure that part out later.
- We have to stop Ronan.

953
01:16:01,313 --> 01:16:02,781
How?

954
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:05,451
- I have a plan.
- You've got a plan?

955
01:16:05,551 --> 01:16:06,618
Yes.

956
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,140
First of all, you're copying me
from when I said I had a plan.

957
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:12,758
No, I'm not. People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

958
01:16:12,858 --> 01:16:14,760
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.

959
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,663
I have part of a plan!

960
01:16:17,763 --> 01:16:19,298
What percentage of a plan do you have?

961
01:16:19,398 --> 01:16:22,601
You don't get to ask questions after
the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

962
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:24,336
I just saved Quill.

963
01:16:24,436 --> 01:16:27,172
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

964
01:16:27,272 --> 01:16:29,508
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

965
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:31,632
I wasn't listening. I was
thinking of something else.

966
01:16:32,277 --> 01:16:35,347
She's right. You don't get an opinion.
What percentage?

967
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:38,679
- I don't know. Twelve percent.
- Twelve percent?

968
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:41,420
That's a fake laugh.

969
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,255
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

970
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:48,026
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

971
01:16:48,126 --> 01:16:50,562
- because that is not a plan.
- It's barely a concept.

972
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:53,265
- You're taking their side?
- I am Groot.

973
01:16:53,365 --> 01:16:56,301
So what, it's better than 11%? What the
hell does that have to do with anything?

974
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:59,037
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

975
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:03,038
See? Groot's the only one
of you who has a clue.

976
01:17:07,613 --> 01:17:09,102
Guys.

977
01:17:09,481 --> 01:17:10,616
Come on.

978
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:12,718
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

979
01:17:12,818 --> 01:17:15,786
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

980
01:17:16,688 --> 01:17:19,053
I need your help.

981
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:23,061
I look around at us.

982
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:24,650
You know what I see?

983
01:17:25,163 --> 01:17:26,630
Losers.

984
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,435
I mean, like,

985
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,471
folks who have lost stuff.

986
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:35,198
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

987
01:17:35,874 --> 01:17:37,636
Our homes,

988
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:39,740
our families,

989
01:17:40,412 --> 01:17:42,381
normal lives.

990
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:45,677
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

991
01:17:46,051 --> 01:17:47,653
Today, it's given us something.

992
01:17:47,753 --> 01:17:49,354
It has given us a chance.

993
01:17:49,454 --> 01:17:51,251
To do what?

994
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:54,453
To give a shit.

995
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,662
For once.

996
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:59,230
Not run away.

997
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,102
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

998
01:18:04,202 --> 01:18:07,728
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

999
01:18:08,373 --> 01:18:11,433
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1000
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:14,513
it's impossible.

1001
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:17,377
You're asking us to die.

1002
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:25,919
Yeah, I guess I am.

1003
01:18:38,303 --> 01:18:39,895
Quill.

1004
01:18:43,608 --> 01:18:47,407
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

1005
01:18:50,982 --> 01:18:55,646
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

1006
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:01,891
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1007
01:19:03,128 --> 01:19:05,789
I will fight beside you.

1008
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:08,498
And in the end,

1009
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:12,492
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1010
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:21,637
I am Groot.

1011
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:35,187
What the hell. I don't got
that long a lifespan, anyway.

1012
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:43,368
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1013
01:19:43,468 --> 01:19:45,704
We're all standing up now.

1014
01:19:45,804 --> 01:19:49,501
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

1015
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:57,849
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1016
01:19:57,949 --> 01:19:59,985
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

1017
01:20:00,085 --> 01:20:03,322
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1018
01:20:03,422 --> 01:20:05,123
All plants, animals,

1019
01:20:05,223 --> 01:20:07,156
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1020
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:09,759
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1021
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:14,299
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1022
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:16,601
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1023
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:20,772
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1024
01:20:20,872 --> 01:20:23,642
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1025
01:20:23,742 --> 01:20:27,040
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1026
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:33,852
Once they know we're on board,

1027
01:20:33,952 --> 01:20:37,356
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1028
01:20:37,456 --> 01:20:39,958
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.

1029
01:20:40,058 --> 01:20:41,760
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1030
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:45,329
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1031
01:20:47,432 --> 01:20:50,902
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

1032
01:20:51,002 --> 01:20:53,438
Use these devices to contain it.

1033
01:20:53,538 --> 01:20:55,335
If you touch it,

1034
01:20:55,607 --> 01:20:57,404
it will kill you.

1035
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:03,014
I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.

1036
01:21:03,114 --> 01:21:06,208
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.

1037
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:09,946
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.

1038
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:11,915
That guy's eye.

1039
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,960
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1040
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,857
that guy's eye.

1041
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:20,556
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1042
01:21:24,769 --> 01:21:27,706
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,
and will arrive in T-minus

1043
01:21:27,806 --> 01:21:29,708
fifteen minutes.

1044
01:21:29,808 --> 01:21:31,643
Remember, boy.

1045
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:33,678
At the end of all this,

1046
01:21:33,778 --> 01:21:35,113
I get the Stone.

1047
01:21:35,213 --> 01:21:38,113
You cross me, we kill you all.

1048
01:22:00,305 --> 01:22:02,102
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1049
01:22:11,149 --> 01:22:12,451
This is a terrible plan.

1050
01:22:12,551 --> 01:22:15,110
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1051
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:21,058
Nova Prime.

1052
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,562
I received a transmission

1053
01:22:23,662 --> 01:22:25,356
from one of the Ravagers.

1054
01:22:25,463 --> 01:22:28,099
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1055
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:29,568
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1056
01:22:29,668 --> 01:22:30,936
Good God.

1057
01:22:31,036 --> 01:22:33,004
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1058
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:35,574
Did he say why we should believe him?

1059
01:22:35,674 --> 01:22:37,909
He said his crew just escaped from prison

1060
01:22:38,009 --> 01:22:41,444
so he'd have no other reason to
risk coming to Xandar to help.

1061
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,406
He says that he's an

1062
01:22:44,015 --> 01:22:45,317
"a-hole."

1063
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:46,685
But he's not,

1064
01:22:46,785 --> 01:22:48,520
and I'm quoting him, here,

1065
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,922
"100% a dick."

1066
01:22:51,022 --> 01:22:52,784
Do you believe him?

1067
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:56,027
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1068
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:59,528
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

1069
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:04,234
Yeah.

1070
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:15,680
A fleet approaches.

1071
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,838
They appear to be Ravagers.

1072
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,018
Fire!

1073
01:23:40,905 --> 01:23:42,140
Cover it down.

1074
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,605
Submerge!

1075
01:23:57,088 --> 01:23:58,748
Rocket, hurry!

1076
01:24:04,796 --> 01:24:06,064
All pilots, dive!

1077
01:24:06,164 --> 01:24:07,790
They're beneath us!

1078
01:24:16,174 --> 01:24:17,642
Evacuate the city.

1079
01:24:17,742 --> 01:24:21,700
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

1080
01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:29,708
Forward thrust, now!

1081
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:44,268
Come on!

1082
01:24:45,503 --> 01:24:47,527
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1083
01:25:09,394 --> 01:25:10,962
Hell!

1084
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:12,564
I'm going down, Quill!

1085
01:25:12,664 --> 01:25:14,466
No more games with me, boy!

1086
01:25:14,566 --> 01:25:15,667
I'll see you

1087
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:17,962
at the end of this!

1088
01:25:23,808 --> 01:25:25,673
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1089
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:28,172
We'll never make it up there!

1090
01:25:42,727 --> 01:25:43,928
Peter Quill.

1091
01:25:44,028 --> 01:25:46,464
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

1092
01:25:46,564 --> 01:25:49,934
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

1093
01:25:50,034 --> 01:25:51,736
They got my "dick" message!

1094
01:25:51,836 --> 01:25:53,462
Prove me wrong.

1095
01:26:00,445 --> 01:26:02,776
Yes!

1096
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:25,059
Yes!

1097
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:30,166
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1098
01:26:33,945 --> 01:26:35,513
The starboard kern has been breached!

1099
01:26:35,613 --> 01:26:36,915
We have been boarded.

1100
01:26:37,015 --> 01:26:38,483
Continue our approach.

1101
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:39,918
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1102
01:26:40,018 --> 01:26:42,687
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

1103
01:26:42,787 --> 01:26:43,888
Seal security doors!

1104
01:26:43,988 --> 01:26:45,477
Now!

1105
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:49,521
Get out of my way!

1106
01:27:00,305 --> 01:27:01,873
Oh, man.

1107
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:06,411
All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade.

1108
01:27:06,511 --> 01:27:10,811
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.

1109
01:27:22,894 --> 01:27:24,520
Locked in!

1110
01:27:24,929 --> 01:27:26,521
Locked in.

1111
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:29,132
We're locked in.

1112
01:28:06,971 --> 01:28:09,564
I can barely see.

1113
01:28:35,466 --> 01:28:37,669
When did you learn to do that?

1114
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:38,937
Pretty sure the answer is

1115
01:28:39,037 --> 01:28:41,061
"I am Groot."

1116
01:28:41,773 --> 01:28:44,741
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1117
01:28:47,545 --> 01:28:51,349
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1118
01:28:51,449 --> 01:28:54,144
It is pleasing to once again have

1119
01:28:54,285 --> 01:28:55,752
friends.

1120
01:28:56,387 --> 01:28:59,257
You, Quill, are my friend.

1121
01:28:59,357 --> 01:29:00,625
Thanks.

1122
01:29:00,725 --> 01:29:03,284
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1123
01:29:04,963 --> 01:29:08,264
- And this green whore, she, too...
- You must stop!

1124
01:29:10,702 --> 01:29:16,307
Gamora, look at what you have done.
You have always been weak.

1125
01:29:16,407 --> 01:29:18,966
You stupid, traitorous...

1126
01:29:23,715 --> 01:29:26,479
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1127
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:31,479
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut
down the power to the security doors.

1128
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,899
Yondu Udonta.

1129
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:44,957
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.

1130
01:30:01,285 --> 01:30:02,887
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1131
01:30:02,987 --> 01:30:05,250
Time to die...

1132
01:30:37,488 --> 01:30:38,977
Nebula, please.

1133
01:30:53,037 --> 01:30:55,840
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1134
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:58,465
enact immolation initiative.

1135
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:03,047
They're dive-bombing the city!

1136
01:31:03,147 --> 01:31:04,983
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

1137
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:07,175
No! Hold your positions.

1138
01:31:38,382 --> 01:31:39,851
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1139
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:41,586
We'll take care of the people down here.

1140
01:31:41,686 --> 01:31:44,313
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1141
01:31:47,058 --> 01:31:48,659
Star-Lord.

1142
01:31:48,759 --> 01:31:50,226
Finally.

1143
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:02,195
You thief!

1144
01:32:13,618 --> 01:32:16,916
You will never make it to Ronan.

1145
01:32:22,193 --> 01:32:24,923
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.

1146
01:32:33,104 --> 01:32:34,935
Come on!

1147
01:33:17,315 --> 01:33:21,251
Finger to the throat means death.

1148
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:28,092
Metaphor.

1149
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,527
Yeah, sorta.

1150
01:33:29,627 --> 01:33:31,253
No.

1151
01:33:58,756 --> 01:34:00,655
Xandar!

1152
01:34:00,858 --> 01:34:03,918
You stand accused.

1153
01:34:04,295 --> 01:34:07,365
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1154
01:34:07,465 --> 01:34:09,066
save you now.

1155
01:34:09,166 --> 01:34:12,863
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1156
01:34:37,028 --> 01:34:38,095
Rocket!

1157
01:34:38,195 --> 01:34:40,424
Hold on, Saal, just...

1158
01:35:06,724 --> 01:35:07,992
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1159
01:35:08,092 --> 01:35:09,727
The city's been evacuated,

1160
01:35:09,827 --> 01:35:12,396
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.

1161
01:35:12,496 --> 01:35:14,395
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1162
01:35:38,656 --> 01:35:40,123
Nebula!

1163
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:43,828
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1164
01:35:43,928 --> 01:35:45,763
You know he's crazy.

1165
01:35:45,863 --> 01:35:47,965
I know you're both crazy.

1166
01:35:48,065 --> 01:35:49,691
No!

1167
01:35:52,136 --> 01:35:53,603
What the?

1168
01:35:54,405 --> 01:35:56,395
Get out!

1169
01:36:37,348 --> 01:36:38,815
You did it!

1170
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:06,143
I was mistaken.

1171
01:37:06,243 --> 01:37:08,301
I do remember your family.

1172
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:10,281
Their screams were

1173
01:37:10,381 --> 01:37:12,940
pitiful. I...

1174
01:39:09,633 --> 01:39:11,191
No, Groot!

1175
01:39:11,335 --> 01:39:12,436
You can't.

1176
01:39:12,536 --> 01:39:14,469
You'll die.

1177
01:39:14,572 --> 01:39:16,474
Why are you doing this?

1178
01:39:16,574 --> 01:39:18,507
Why?

1179
01:39:24,682 --> 01:39:26,550
We

1180
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:28,139
are

1181
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:30,252
Groot.

1182
01:40:34,218 --> 01:40:36,709
I called him an idiot.

1183
01:40:58,976 --> 01:41:01,376
You killed Groot!

1184
01:41:05,082 --> 01:41:06,810
Behold!

1185
01:41:07,284 --> 01:41:10,721
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1186
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:13,257
What fruit have they wrought?

1187
01:41:13,357 --> 01:41:17,461
Only that my father and his father

1188
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:21,198
shall finally know vengeance.

1189
01:41:21,298 --> 01:41:23,993
People of Xandar,

1190
01:41:24,168 --> 01:41:25,970
the time has come

1191
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:28,939
to rejoice and renounce

1192
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:31,734
your paltry gods!

1193
01:41:32,109 --> 01:41:35,908
Your salvation is at hand.

1194
01:41:48,192 --> 01:41:50,159
Listen to these words.

1195
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:00,896
Now bring it down hard!

1196
01:42:03,874 --> 01:42:05,342
What are you doing?

1197
01:42:05,442 --> 01:42:08,467
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1198
01:42:11,448 --> 01:42:13,313
Gamora.

1199
01:42:13,884 --> 01:42:16,286
Subtle. Take it back.

1200
01:42:16,386 --> 01:42:18,822
What are you doing?

1201
01:42:18,922 --> 01:42:21,720
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

1202
01:42:37,474 --> 01:42:39,464
No!

1203
01:43:12,976 --> 01:43:16,570
Peter! Take my hand!

1204
01:43:21,518 --> 01:43:23,986
Take my hand, Peter.

1205
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:26,256
Mom.

1206
01:43:26,356 --> 01:43:28,881
Take my hand!

1207
01:44:22,846 --> 01:44:24,882
You're mortal!

1208
01:44:24,982 --> 01:44:26,316
How?

1209
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:28,619
You said it yourself, bitch.

1210
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:31,551
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1211
01:45:00,951 --> 01:45:02,619
Well, well, well.

1212
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,243
Quite the light show.

1213
01:45:06,089 --> 01:45:08,216
Ain't this sweet.

1214
01:45:09,326 --> 01:45:11,862
But you got some business to attend to

1215
01:45:11,962 --> 01:45:14,862
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1216
01:45:16,099 --> 01:45:18,335
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1217
01:45:18,435 --> 01:45:22,539
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1218
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:26,868
but the only way the universe can survive
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1219
01:45:27,244 --> 01:45:29,871
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1220
01:45:31,682 --> 01:45:34,013
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1221
01:45:35,252 --> 01:45:37,219
Hand it over, son.

1222
01:45:53,603 --> 01:45:55,070
Yondu.

1223
01:45:57,708 --> 01:46:01,439
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1224
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:04,545
You've seen what it does to people.

1225
01:46:14,825 --> 01:46:17,520
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1226
01:46:17,928 --> 01:46:20,564
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

1227
01:46:20,664 --> 01:46:21,665
like we was hired to do.

1228
01:46:21,765 --> 01:46:24,961
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1229
01:46:29,373 --> 01:46:33,400
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1230
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,976
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1231
01:46:38,749 --> 01:46:40,876
I know.

1232
01:46:42,285 --> 01:46:44,377
But he was about the only family I had.

1233
01:46:46,823 --> 01:46:48,312
No.

1234
01:46:49,126 --> 01:46:50,786
He wasn't.

1235
01:47:38,575 --> 01:47:40,143
Why would you even know this?

1236
01:47:40,243 --> 01:47:42,980
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1237
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,945
so we had it checked out.

1238
01:47:45,782 --> 01:47:47,484
I'm not Terran?

1239
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,152
You are half Terran.

1240
01:47:49,252 --> 01:47:52,956
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1241
01:47:53,056 --> 01:47:56,827
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

1242
01:47:56,927 --> 01:48:00,956
That could be why you were able to
hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1243
01:48:01,398 --> 01:48:02,865
Your friends have arrived.

1244
01:48:04,301 --> 01:48:06,870
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1245
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:12,568
we'd like to express our profound
gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.

1246
01:48:13,944 --> 01:48:16,713
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1247
01:48:16,813 --> 01:48:20,577
- he has something to show you.
- Thank you, Nova Prime.

1248
01:48:28,925 --> 01:48:33,830
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1249
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:35,165
Yes.

1250
01:48:35,265 --> 01:48:37,630
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1251
01:48:37,934 --> 01:48:40,561
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1252
01:48:42,772 --> 01:48:46,002
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

1253
01:48:46,143 --> 01:48:48,577
We salvaged as much as we could.

1254
01:48:51,214 --> 01:48:52,681
I...

1255
01:48:54,217 --> 01:48:55,775
Thank you.

1256
01:48:56,887 --> 01:48:58,955
I have a family.

1257
01:48:59,055 --> 01:49:00,988
They're alive because of you.

1258
01:49:05,228 --> 01:49:07,664
Your criminal records have also been expunged.

1259
01:49:07,764 --> 01:49:12,166
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1260
01:49:12,335 --> 01:49:14,638
Question. What if I see
something that I want to take,

1261
01:49:14,738 --> 01:49:17,407
- and it belongs to someone else?
- You will be arrested.

1262
01:49:17,507 --> 01:49:20,110
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

1263
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,012
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1264
01:49:22,112 --> 01:49:24,848
No, I want it more, sir. Do you
understand? What are you laughing at?

1265
01:49:24,948 --> 01:49:26,783
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1266
01:49:26,883 --> 01:49:28,785
What if someone does something irksome

1267
01:49:28,885 --> 01:49:31,546
and I decide to remove his spine?

1268
01:49:32,656 --> 01:49:34,214
That's...

1269
01:49:34,858 --> 01:49:37,519
That's actually murder.

1270
01:49:38,862 --> 01:49:41,465
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1271
01:49:41,565 --> 01:49:44,863
So... also illegal.

1272
01:49:48,004 --> 01:49:49,493
They'll be fine, Dey.

1273
01:49:49,739 --> 01:49:50,974
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1274
01:49:51,074 --> 01:49:52,541
You?

1275
01:49:55,545 --> 01:49:58,980
Yeah. Me.

1276
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,490
Peter,

1277
01:50:19,603 --> 01:50:23,402
I know these last few months have been hard for you.

1278
01:50:24,241 --> 01:50:26,910
But I'm going to a better place.

1279
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:29,513
And I will be okay.

1280
01:50:29,613 --> 01:50:33,810
And I will always be with you.

1281
01:50:35,051 --> 01:50:37,787
You are the light of my life.

1282
01:50:37,887 --> 01:50:40,582
My precious son.

1283
01:50:41,091 --> 01:50:44,492
My little Star-Lord.

1284
01:50:44,761 --> 01:50:47,195
Love, Mom.

1285
01:52:47,317 --> 01:52:49,185
So, what should we do next?

1286
01:52:49,285 --> 01:52:50,752
Something good?

1287
01:52:51,321 --> 01:52:52,822
Something bad?

1288
01:52:52,922 --> 01:52:55,014
A bit of both?

1289
01:52:56,192 --> 01:52:59,559
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1290
01:53:01,364 --> 01:53:02,853
Bit of both.

1291
02:00:26,742 --> 02:00:29,506
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1292
02:00:30,379 --> 02:00:32,403
Gross.

1293
