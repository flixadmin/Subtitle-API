00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,619
is it would be nice if we knew
who was in charge around here.

322
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,120
- Maybe we should take a vote.

323
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,955
Choose a leader.
Someone we can all trust.

324
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,208
- Well, I trust Oliver.
He's got my vote.

325
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,628
- Appreciate that, Cisco,
but Barry put us all together.

326
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,421
It should be him.

327
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,341
- Fair enough.

328
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,050
- Okay.

329
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,220
Cool, all right, well,
I guess as Team Leader,

330
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,849
first thing to do
is start out by...

331
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,851
- Doing a test run.
- Let's do a test run.

332
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,271
Yeah, let's do a test run.

333
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,398
- Against Supergirl.
- Against Supergirl, all right?

334
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,941
Test run against Supergirl.

335
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,942
- Are we
just supposed to pretend

336
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,319
like we don't hear him?

337
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,279
- So just suit up.
Mm-kay? Look alive.

338
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,949
We're training to fight aliens
by fighting an alien, so...

339
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:27,950
- Do it.
- Suit up.

340
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,536
- Stop.
- What?

341
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,330
- Oliver. Hey. Kara.
Really quick.

342
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,541
I was excited about the two
of you guys meeting each other.

343
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,835
Oliver was the first person
to train me.

344
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,169
- Really?
- Yeah.

345
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,754
- Well, you did
a really good job.

346
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,255
- It's 'cause
I didn't hold back.

347
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,131
I shot him.

348
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,133
You can't hold back either.

349
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,678
- He did shoot me.
- Ouch.

350
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,765
Okay, are you sure about that?

351
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,891
I just met these people...

352
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,100
- These people need
to understand

353
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,644
this isn't gonna be easy.

354
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,022
Don't hold back.
Especially against me.

355
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,232
- Yes, sir.

356
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,025
Wow.

357
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,110
Does he not like me?

358
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,574
- He's like that with everyone.
He'll warm up to you.

359
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,118
- Old West Dwarf Star
plus Replicator,

360
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,079
equals new suit.
- You know what, Ray?

361
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,624
Maybe it's just me, but I think
this thing's due for an update.

362
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,501
- Ha. Yes.

363
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,212
But after we dominate
the Dominators.

364
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,673
- Oh! I see what you did there.

365
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,632
- [chuckles]

366
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,051
- Hey.

367
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,970
- Listen.
I got to get to work.

368
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,097
Felicity's waiting for me.

369
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,808
But we'll talk about this later.

370
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,017
- Hey, Barry.

371
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,186
- Where's Snart?

372
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:43,401
- Man, I'm sorry, Barry.
I forgot that we never told you.

373
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,278
- What happened?

374
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,072
- He sacrificed himself.
Saved us all.

375
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,452
He died a hero.
- A Legend.

376
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,164
- Wally,
what are you doing here?

377
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,625
You can't just show up and think

378
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,918
you're gonna train
with everyone else.

379
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,085
- Why not?

380
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,503
- Because we need
to test you more.

381
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,713
- H.R. said that
my results were great.

382
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,381
He said I'm good to go.

383
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,801
- I don't care what H.R. said.
You are not ready.

384
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,218
- I am ready.
- Wally.

385
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,804
Everyone here
has been doing this

386
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,388
for a long time,
and this is gonna be

387
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,515
the hardest challenge
they have faced.

388
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,143
Fighting Alchemy
or Savitar or aliens

389
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,771
isn't something
you just show up and try.

390
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,315
If you screw up, you could die.

391
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,943
Do you...
do you get that?

392
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,237
Great.

393
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,197
- Satellite's not picking up
anything abnormal.

394
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,199
- No.

395
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,452
- I don't know if we're gonna
find any Dominators this way.

396
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,871
- Hey, I...just,
I couldn't help but notice

397
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,499
things are a little bit tense.

398
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,627
You don't need to be able
to Vibe to figure that out.

399
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,129
- Okay, so apparently,
it's, like, illegal

400
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,965
to be mad at Barry,
but guess what.

401
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,801
He screws up,
just like the rest of us.

402
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,218
- Yeah, and when he does,
he feels bad

403
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,553
like the rest of us too.

404
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,680
- Felicity, he took
it upon himself

405
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,473
to change the timeline.

406
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,561
And because of it,
my brother was killed.

407
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,439
So there's no amount
of feeling bad

408
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,358
that could ever
make up for that.

409
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,947
- Barry.

410
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,365
Before we start training,

411
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
there's something
you need to hear.

412
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,784
- A message that would be better

413
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,703
if we could share with you
in private.

414
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,538
- All right, I'll step away.
- No, no, it's fine.

415
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,706
You can stay.

416
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,249
- All right, but no one else.

417
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,376

441

- I went back in time,

442
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,227
and I saved my mom.

443
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,605
I created a timeline
where she's alive.

444
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,898
It's called Flashpoint.

445
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,316
I lived in it for a few months,

until I realized that
I made a big mistake,

447
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,946
and I tried
to reset the timeline,

448
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,781
put things back
to how they were supposed to be,

449
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,782

Barry, that's...

453
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,664
- So what's changed
since you did this?

454
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,793
- Cisco's brother is dead.
Caitlin has powers.

455
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,503
Diggle has a son now
instead of a daughter.

- What? John had a daughter?

457
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
- I didn't just screw up
my life, man.

458
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,718
I screwed up everybody's lives

459
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,929
and, apparently,
everybody's lives in the future.

460
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,889
It felt like,
when these aliens got here,

461
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,682
that finally something
had happened I didn't cause,

462
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,225
and maybe I could make up

463
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,394
for everything I'd done
to everybody, but I...

464
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,605
- I think we should be
on the up and up with everybody.

465
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,107
We got to tell 'em.

466
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,275
- We're going up
against a bunch of aliens,

467
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,860
and you want to tell people

468
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,612
that their lives might have been
affected by time travel?

469
