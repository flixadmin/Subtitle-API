anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?

It's time to sound the alarm.

Then what were your orders?

My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

and wait for you.

That's not what the president believes.

He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

I turned myself in to that punk...

But since there is
no justice in this country,

this is a temporary transfer of location.

And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogota'.

Because of moncada and galeano.

But I didn't kill those men.

about some dispute between gangsters?

We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

I will gladly escort you out myself.

How long will I be here
as a hostage?

[Pablo] You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

Escobar has sandoval
inside the prison.

316
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,540
Hang up right now,
Mr. President.

- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's ok.

Mr. President,
hang up the phone.

319
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,797
If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

320
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,508
Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.

Hang up the phone. Sir!

So, then...

The president is too busy
to speak with me.

What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

We agreed that ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

333

Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

Please, I suggest we call das
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

have a good excuse to kill me.
