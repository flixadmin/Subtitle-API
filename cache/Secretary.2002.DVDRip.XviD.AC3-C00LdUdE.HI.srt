1
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,195
(rapid keystrokes)

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,201
(carriage bangs)

3
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,226
(keystrokes resume)

4
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,830
(bangs)

5
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,677
Woman's voice:
I got out of the institution

6
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,655
on the day
of my sister's wedding.

7
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,488
I'd started to get used
to the place...

8
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,222
breakfast at 8:00,
classes at 2:00,

9
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,062
therapy at 4:00,
and asleep by 10:00.

10
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,090
You can call me anytime, Lee.

11
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,571
I will always try
and be of help to you.

12
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,835
Lee's voice:
Inside, life was simple.

13
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,865
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

14
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,140
For that reason,
I was reluctant to go.

15
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,170
Bon voyage.

16
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,298
(cheering)

17
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,467
- Oh!
- Man: Come on kiss her, kiss her.

18
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,609
Woman:
Give her a big wet kiss...

19
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,448
Man:
Save some for the honeymoon.

20
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,752
Hi, Peter.

21
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,596
Peter, yeah, who you
almost successfully forgot.

22
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,625
No, I did not.

23
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,762
Are you happy
to be home?

24
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,769
I mean, are you happy
to be home?

25
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,778
How did you know?

26
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,075
I know what you mean.

27
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,779
(music plays)

28
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,812
# Me and baby brother #

29
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,291
# Used to run together #

30
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,920
# Yeah, hey, hey... #

31
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,123
# Drunk on one another... #

32
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,860
DJ: Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

33
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,197
(blues ballad plays)

34
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,396
Oh boy.

35
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,497
You look so beautiful.

36
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,202
Thanks, Dad.

37
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,210
I thought you stopped.

38
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,715
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

39
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,313
I missed you too.

40
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,586
# Well you know that I love you... #

41
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,892
You know what?

42
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,421
Dad:
I don't feel so good.

43
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,458
Peter:
Let's go sit down.

44
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,031
# Well, I pray... #

45
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:48,241
# That our love
would last always... #

46
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,913
(guests clap, cheer)

47
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,611
Bride: Bye!

48
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,411
(faint angry voices)

49
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,972
Father: You want to talk to me
like a child.

50
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,576
I'm not a child!
Think I don't know what I'm doing?

51
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,247
Mother: You act like a child!
You don't act like a man.

52
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,621
You've been fired!

53
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,649
Father:
Well, I'm glad I'm fired.

54
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,093
I'm glad I'm fired.
Boy, I hated that job.

55
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,620
Mother: I don't care
that you hated it. You're drunk!

56
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,566
I'm not drunk. Why do you...
why do you... I'm not drunk!

57
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,592
Mother:
Why do you always say that?

58
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,900
Get off my fucking back!

59
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,043
Watch this.
Watch this, huh?

60
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,199
(gasps)

61
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,149
Instructor:
Avoid the temptation

62
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,679
of placing your fingers
on the home keys by sight.

63
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:23,184
Strike each key so that your
fingers bounce with each stroke.

64
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,454
Do not strike without thinking.

65
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,798
Do not even attempt to steal
a glance at your paper.

66
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,032
Lee: "My flowers had just about
given up in despair,

67
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,041
so with the exception of a few
potted plants from the florist,

68
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,101
we're flowerless
for the first spring in years."

69
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,136
Instructor:
And... time.

70
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm so proud of you, honey...

71
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,051
being out in
the world like this.

72
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,616
Lee's voice:
When my accident happened

73
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,360
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

74
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,594
Upstairs, my dad was
just leaving for work

75
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,865
at Havis Department Store.

76
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,134
Because there was
a limited amount of time

77
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,903
that my mom's
back was turned...

78
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,740
- Lee!
- I slipped and cut too deep.

79
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,145
I'm not sure how
I could have misjudged.

80
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,845
I've been doing it
since 7th grade.

81
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,031
Mother:
Just a precaution.

82
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,352
"Be a leader."

83
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,183
Ahem...

84
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,062
I have never
had a job before.

85
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,091
But I can assure you

86
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,968
that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

87
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,599
Thank you.

88
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,836
Oh... well...

89
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,845
I don't have
any references yet.

90
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,746
But I think that
the Municipal Tax Office

91
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,717
would be
a wonderful place...

92
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,347
to begin...

93
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,380
my career.

94
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,065
(softly)
"Secretary."

95
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,665
(rain splattering)

96
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,578
Hello, I...

97
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,876
Wait. I...

98
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,428
Hello?

99
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,900
Lee:
Hello?

100
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,803
In here.

101
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,880
Hi.

102
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,018
Hi.

103
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,222
Are you the lawyer?

104
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,292
Oh...

105
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,236
yes.

106
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:38,004
- I'm sorry, I'll come back later.
- No.

107
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,635
No, stay.

108
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,231
It said, "secretary."

109
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,193
That's right.

110
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,569
Are you pregnant?

111
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,537
No.

112
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,282
Do you plan
on getting pregnant?

113
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,220
Oh...

114
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,781
...no.

115
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,417
- Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

116
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,624
- Alone?
- With my parents.

117
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,758
Siblings?

118
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,236
My sister is going
to live in the backyard,

119
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,602
with her husband,
in the pool house.

120
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,834
Are you married?

121
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,900
No.

122
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,108
Have you ever
won an award?

123
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,743
- Yes.
- What did you win the award in?

124
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,447
Typing.

125
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,827
Grey:
Are those your scores?

126
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,091
Yes.

127
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,124
Lee...

128
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,160
...Holloway.

129
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,914
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

130
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,021
(clatters)

131
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,131
(splatters)

132
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,802
Do you really
want to be a secretary, Lee?

133
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,838
Yes, I do.

134
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,988
Grey: You scored higher than anyone
I've ever interviewed.

135
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:46,691
You're really
overqualified for the job.

136
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:51,101
- You'd be bored to death.
- I want to be bored.

137
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,838
I have a part-time
paralegal.

138
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,315
All I need

139
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,784
is a... typist,

140
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,381
who can get
to work on time...

141
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,483
- and answer the phone.
- I can do that.

142
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,326
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

143
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:23,630
- That's fine.
- It's very dull work.

144
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,365
I like dull work.

145
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,772
There's something
about you.

146
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,144
You're...

147
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,752
you're... closed tight.

148
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,158
Wall.

149
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,164
I know.

150
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,860
Do you ever
loosen up?

151
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,200
I don't know.

152
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,866
(phone rings)

153
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,071
I'm not here.

154
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,571
(ringing)

155
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,489
- Less sugar in the coffee.
- (ringing continues)

156
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,662
Mother:
How did it go?

157
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,006
Lee: I got it.

158
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,501
(laughs)

159
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:50,051
Mother:
I knew you could do it!

160
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,633
"Hello..."

161
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,867
(music box chiming)

162
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,007
(chiming stops)

163
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,214
"Hello.

164
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,121
You have reached the office

165
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,217
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

166
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,029
Please leave your message
and the time you called

167
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,262
along with your phone number

168
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,202
and the best time to reach you...

169
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,039
and we...

170
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:49,275
will get back to you
as soon as possible."

171
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,674
"We."

172
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,551
(softly)
Secretary...

173
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,356
(typewriter clacking)

174
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,461
Type up this letter and send
four copies to O'Malley & Barrett.

175
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,738
Right away, sir.

176
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,179
That's good.
That's good.

177
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,791
Woman:
So you're the new secretary?

178
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,589
Lee:
Yeah.

179
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,937
Excuse me?
What exactly is a paralegal?

180
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,246
Woman:
See ya.

181
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,680
(door slams)

182
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,850
Oh, umm...

183
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,363
(mumbles softly)

184
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:26,207
Okay...

185
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,235
up...

186
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,748
and... wide.

187
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,235
Lee:
Ahem...

188
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,503
I brought you these.

189
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,042
I think I accidentally

190
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,576
threw out my notes
on the Feldman case.

191
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:13,182
- Maybe you could...
- Go through the garbage?

192
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,955
Yes, Lee, thank you.

193
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,354
Ugh!

194
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,441
Oh.

195
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,992
(huffing)

196
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,935
Why are you here?

197
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,877
I'm just waiting for you,
honey.

198
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,540
But I'm here
for five more hours.

199
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,278
I know.

200
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,756
Excuse me, sir?

201
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,195
It's okay.
I found another set.

202
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,500
Oh.

203
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,835
(file thumps)

204
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,865
- This needs more sugar.
- Sugar?

205
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,605
And six copies of these.

206
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,948
Freshen up that trap, Lee,
and put out one more.

207
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,032
Oh.

208
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,337
Mice like to go behind
the chairs too, Lee.

209
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,372
Just because
it's hard to reach

210
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,852
does not mean we don't
take care of every possibility.

211
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,626
Here, give me that.

212
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,641
Thank you.

213
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,933
(phone rings)

214
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,869
(ringing)

215
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,652
E. Edward Grey's office,
may I help you?

216
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,421
We're very happy with AT&T.
Thanks, though.

217
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,624
- Is he in?
- Could you just wait one moment?

218
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,397
You're right,
that is a very good offer.

219
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:21,394
- I'm going back now.
- Could you wait one minute, please?

220
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,203
Yes, I do understand that.

221
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,040
Submissive.

222
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,706
Excuse me?

223
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,978
(yells)
Edward!

224
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,286
Listen... I have no idea
if we make

225
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,314
over $40 worth of long distance
calls to Chattanooga each month.

226
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,758
(handset bangs)

227
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,961
Tell him
it's Tricia O'Connor.

228
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,757
Lee:
Mr. Grey?

229
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,333
Hello?

230
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,209
Mr. Grey?

231
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,776
(faintly)
Ms. Holloway.

232
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,320
Mr. Grey?

233
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,198
(softly)
I'm not here.

234
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,438
Okay.

235
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,465
(emery board scratching)

236
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,777
I'm afraid he's gone.

237
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,943
Is that right?

238
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,145
(ringing)

239
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,386
E. Edward Grey's office.

240
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,691
- Is that you honey? It's me.
- Daddy?

241
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,221
It's so good
to hear your voice.

242
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,893
Dad... where are you?

243
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,995
I'm downtown...
somewhere.

244
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,407
Could you...
please hold?

245
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,575
Do you have a message,
Ms. O'Connor?

246
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,586
Tell him to sign
the settlement.

247
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,287
(door slams)

248
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,756
Hello?

249
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,894
Hello?

250
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,200
Hello, Dad?

251
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,469
(bangs)

252
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,275
Mother:
How's work?

253
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,378
Fine.

254
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,481
How's Mr. Grey?

255
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,152
He's fine.

256
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,787
Well... Peter called.

257
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,297
# It's so strange
the way love works... #

258
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,534
Peter: Some people
have to wash something

259
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,837
as soon as they've worn it
for like half a day.

260
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,106
- Lee: Yes.
- Peter: And then you got

261
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,977
your more laid-back folk, who will
wash this stuff when it's dirty.

262
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,539
Which kind are you?

263
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,677
I'm the type of guy...

264
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,952
who wants to get married
and have a kid.

265
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,390
I wash my clothes
just when they're dirty.

266
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,490
Me too, and that
is what counts in a relationship.

267
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,400
Compatibility.

268
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,669
- In a relationship?
- In a...

269
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,107
Both:
...relationship.

270
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,140
(coughs)

271
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,379
Whoa.

272
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,287
May I interest you
in a little more?

273
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,486
- Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

274
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,925
You're different than you were
in high school, Peter.

275
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,869
I've changed.

276
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,170
- What happened?
- I had a nervous breakdown.

277
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,540
Me too.

278
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,337
Sort of.

279
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:38,282
Tom, I have this
and these.

280
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,416
- Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

281
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,292
I've read that if you wear
that kind of underwear

282
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:49,028
that it squeezes...

283
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,058
your "thingies."

284
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,094
- Balls... my balls?
- Yes.

285
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,467
- My "grapes"?
- Your grapes.

286
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,977
- My...
- Your testicles.

287
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,809
(mock gasp)
Oh..!

288
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:07,307
Your sperm gets "squozen"
and then you can't have babies

289
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,843
and I thought that you said
that you wanted to have babies.

290
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,878
There you go,
I said it.

291
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,481
(grunts)

292
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,226
To babies.

293
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,619
Diapers.

294
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
Diaper rash.

295
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,200
Breast feeding
and crying.

296
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,761
(softly)
Vomit.

297
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,939
Look at it.

298
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,211
- Do you see that?
- What?

299
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,313
This letter has
three typing errors in it,

300
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,722
one of which is,
I believe, a spelling error.

301
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,090
Oh, I'm...

302
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,118
- I'm sorry.
- This isn't the first time, either.

303
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,154
There have been others
that I let go

304
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,894
in the first few weeks.
This cannot go on.

305
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,765
Do you know what this
makes me look like

306
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,794
to the people who receive
these letters?

307
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,829
I'm... I'm sorry.

308
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:40,105
Type it again...
and get it right.

309
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,108
(door bangs)

310
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,675
(clicking briskly)

311
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,723
(paper crinkles)

312
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,123
Grey:
You're wasting my time.

313
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,298
(clicking slowly)

314
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,323
(sniffling)

315
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,696
Bye.

316
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,521
Go type up a bill
for that woman for $500.

317
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,550
Aren't you going
to proofread the letter?

318
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,508
(book snaps shut)
Lee...

319
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,040
when people come
into this office,

320
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,679
you are a visual
representation of my business...

321
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,485
and the way
you dress is disgusting.

322
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,262
Uh... sorry.

323
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,926
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

324
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,958
You're either going
to have to wear a hair net

325
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,732
or stop playing
with your hair.

326
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,403
And another thing...

327
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:57,346
do you realize that you
are always sniffling?

328
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,441
I... I'm sniffling?

329
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,578
And what is with
your tongue...

330
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,681
when you're typing?

331
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,216
I'm sorry,
I didn't know I sniffled.

332
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:14,664
Well, you do.

333
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,734
"Mr. Grey...

334
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,402
thank you so much

335
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:30,005
for your
helpful suggestions.

336
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,607
Because I...

337
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,914
am trying to be

338
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,615
the very best secretary
that I can be

339
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,819
for you."

340
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,517
(Grey yelling within)
The sentence should read,

341
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:48,089
"Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,

342
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,862
my client would
never have made

343
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,462
these material decisions
on her own." Period!

344
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,530
I have repeated
the sentence...

345
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,634
(yelling continues)

346
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,657
Woman: Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

347
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,752
We make it homemade,
don't we, Stewart?

348
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,231
- Try it, it's good.
- Would you like some, Lee?

349
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:25,065
No, thank you.
Not right now, Sylvia.

350
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,593
Sylvia: Peter talks
about you all the time.

351
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,335
He says he's found
his soul mate.

352
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,310
Did you say that?

353
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,546
- I did.
- Peter's sister Lindsey

354
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:43,849
is getting married
this coming winter in Vegas.

355
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,185
Oh.

356
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,884
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at J. C. Penney?

357
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,122
- They even gave him a cell phone.
- Perhaps it'll be a double wedding?

358
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,762
(softly)
Mom...

359
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,098
(faint grinding)

360
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,585
(intercom buzzes)
Ms. Holloway.

361
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,060
Come into the library...

362
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,724
immediately.

363
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,632
(snorts)

364
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,106
Grey: "...the remarks
made in print,

365
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,141
in summation
of the events in regard

366
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:52,053
to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely," etc.

367
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,550
Okay.

368
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,086
The phone is ringing.

369
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,560
Answer it.

370
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,903
- I'm sorry...
- Brr-ing!

371
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,844
Brr-ing!

372
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,979
- Oh.
- Brr-rr..!

373
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:25,881
"Hello.
This is the office of..."

374
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,914
Listen...
you're a big girl.

375
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:32,224
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

376
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,529
- Tiny?
- Ms. Holloway,

377
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:41,061
you told me when I hired you that
you were used to answering phones.

378
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,131
I am.

379
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,439
Did you get
enough sleep last night?

380
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,571
- I...
- The phone is ringing.

381
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,142
(bold voice)
"Hello...

382
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:58,281
this is the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey."

383
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,950
You see? You see?

384
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:05,155
That's showing a little spunk.
I'm not running a mortuary.

385
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,221
(giggles)
No.

386
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,706
Lee.

387
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,337
Mr. Grey?

388
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,247
Come here.

389
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,508
Did you have
a date recently?

390
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,576
Yes.

391
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,954
With whom did you
have a date?

392
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,316
- Peter.
- Peter.

393
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,554
Did you have sex?

394
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,118
(giggles)

395
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,131
No?

396
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,930
I don't know.

397
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,733
Are you shy?

398
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,711
I'm shy.

399
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,944
You're not shy.
You're a lawyer.

400
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,154
I'm shy.

401
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,622
I overcome
my shyness...

402
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,991
...in order to get
things done.

403
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,757
I don't think
you're shy.

404
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,129
Lee, I'm going
to be frank with you.

405
00:42:57,174 --> 00:43:01,042
I know I'm
your employer

406
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,878
and we have
a proscribed relationship...

407
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,111
but you really
should feel

408
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,646
free...

409
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,856
to discuss your
problems with me.

410
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,222
Oh.

411
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,503
What's going on with
the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

412
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,375
Lee?

413
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,080
I feel...

414
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,224
Both: Shy.

415
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,756
Do you want some
hot chocolate?

416
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,792
Okay.

417
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,215
Why do you
cut yourself, Lee?

418
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,184
I don't know.

419
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,129
Is it that sometimes the pain
inside has to come to the surface

420
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,758
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside

421
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,234
you finally know
you're really here?

422
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,533
Then when you watch
the wound heal

423
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,007
it's comforting,
isn't it?

424
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,101
I...

425
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,811
that's a way
to put it.

426
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,412
I'm going to tell you something.
Are you ready to listen?

427
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,657
- Yes.
- Are you listening?

428
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,920
You will never...

429
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,955
ever...

430
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,525
cut yourself again.

431
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,867
Do you understand?

432
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,432
Have I made that
perfectly clear?

433
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,171
You're over that now.

434
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,202
It's in the past.

435
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,444
Yes.

436
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,082
Never again.

437
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,853
Okay.

438
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:38,426
Now, you know what
I want you to do?

439
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,434
I want you
to leave work early.

440
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,410
You're a big girl...
a grown woman,

441
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,777
your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

442
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,045
I want you
to take a nice walk home,

443
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,747
in the fresh air,
because you require relief.

444
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:03,283
Because you won't be
doing that anymore, will you?

445
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,956
No, sir.

446
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,727
Good.

447
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,705
Oh, it's early.

448
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,016
Mom...

449
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,784
I'm going to walk home
from now on.

450
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,693
Lee's voice: I took a shortcut
through Hawkins Park,

451
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,028
and it was as if
I'd never taken a walk

452
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,000
by myself before.
And when I thought about it,

453
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:49,404
I realized that I had probably
never had taken a walk alone.

454
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,567
But because he had given me
the permission to do this...

455
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:56,636
because he'd
insisted I do it, I felt

456
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,446
held by him
as I walked along.

457
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,510
I felt he was with me.

458
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,078
At the same time

459
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:10,890
I was feeling something
growing in Mr. Grey...

460
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:16,332
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

461
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,130
nursed on the feeling
that he had discovered

462
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,037
something about me.

463
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,337
The next day
I didn't even bring

464
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,570
my cuticle scissors
and my iodine

465
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,273
but I did make
another typing mistake.

466
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,181
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do...

467
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:36,118
type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

468
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,485
- I'm sorry.
- It certainly seems to be.

469
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,082
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

470
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:45,527
What goes on inside
that head of yours?

471
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,473
(Lee sniffling)

472
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,103
Come into my office
and bring that letter.

473
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,121
Put the letter
on my desk.

474
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,703
I want you to bend over the desk
so you're looking directly at it.

475
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,770
Get your face
very close to the letter

476
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,477
and read
the letter aloud.

477
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,919
I don't understand.

478
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,753
There's nothing
to understand.

479
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,225
Put your elbows
on the desk...

480
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,285
bend over...

481
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,524
get your face
close to the letter

482
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,089
and read it aloud.

483
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,575
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

484
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,410
I'm grateful
to you for referring..."

485
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,610
(loud slap)

486
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,086
(softly)
Continue.

487
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,898
Ms. Holloway, read.

488
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,849
"...for referring me
to your case.

489
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,387
The subject
of animal captivity

490
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:28,050
has been of interest
to me for quite a while,

491
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:32,187
and my secretary has prepared...
research material

492
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,596
that I think you will
find illuminating.

493
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,066
If you would be so kind...

494
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,070
as to send me the June 5th letter
of which we spoke,

495
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,975
my associates and I
will review it immediately.

496
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:53,439
Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

497
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:58,079
Yours sincerely,
E. Edward Grey."

498
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,453
(slight gasp)

499
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,221
Grey:
Read it again.

500
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,905
"Dear Mr. Garvey..."

501
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,932
Oh, oh-hh!

502
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,444
"I am grateful to you..."

503
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,914
"for referring me
to your case.

504
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:32,513
The subject of animal captivity
has been of interest to me..."

505
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,547
(grunts)

506
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:41,495
"...for quite a while.

507
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:45,126
And my secretary
has prepared research material...

508
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:51,664
that I think you
will find illuminating."

509
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,826
Oh...

510
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,307
Now straighten yourself up
and go type it again.

511
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,170
(sighs)

512
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,206
(rapid keystrokes)

513
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,624
Ms. Holloway?
Good letter.

514
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,095
(crickets chirp)

515
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,204
Mom?

516
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,116
The lock can
come off the cabinet now.

517
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,521
Oh, honey.

518
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,237
- (slapping within)
- (Lee grunting)

519
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,787
# If you want a lover #

520
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:05,761
# I'll do anything
you ask me to... #

521
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:09,060
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

522
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,324
120 watts.

523
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,701
- Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

524
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,002
You remember my secretary,
Ms. Holloway.

525
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,100
I'm sorry about the typo.

526
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:23,840
# If you want a partner,
take my hand #

527
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,749
# Or if you want
to strike me down in anger... #

528
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:32,687
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed... no...

529
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,088
creamed potatoes,

530
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,720
green peas, iced tea,
and ice cream.

531
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:42,254
Okay. Just a scoop
of creamed potatoes...

532
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:45,062
...and a slice of butter.

533
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:48,161
Four peas...

534
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:51,868
...and as much ice cream
as you like to eat.

535
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,206
#... I'll examine #

536
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,873
# Every inch of you #

537
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,477
# If you want a driver #

538
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:04,487
# Climb inside #

539
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:09,925
# Or if you want
to take me for a ride #

540
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,417
- # You know you can #
- (slapping, grunting within)

541
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,556
# I'm your man #

542
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,500
# Ah, the moon's too bright #

543
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,134
# The chain's too tight #

544
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:31,079
# The beast won't go to sleep... #

545
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,675
Lee: "Cosmo's" advice
for "getting your man

546
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:37,584
to share his feelings
more intimately"

547
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,249
is to first try
some "breezy humor."

548
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,783
Whatever you do,
don't jump too quickly

549
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,991
into "relationship talk."

550
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,569
(moans)

551
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,237
I'm your secretary.

552
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,372
I'm your secretary.

553
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:15,851
Just one scoop
of creamed potatoes,

554
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,285
one slice of butter...

555
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:22,155
oh... and four peas...

556
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,853
oh!

557
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,521
Grey: How many inches away
was the furnace?

558
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,558
Had you turned off the furnace

559
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,400
before you went down
into the basement?

560
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,605
Okay...

561
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,481
maybe you didn't
squeeze it hard enough.

562
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,586
There's always concern
about it bursting.

563
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:59,228
No, God no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

564
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,332
I'm doing as much
as I possibly can.

565
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,429
Uh-huh.

566
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,704
Where was she

567
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,004
when you crawled
under the house?

568
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,747
And the lock box? Did you cover it
with dirt before you left?

569
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:22,345
Mud upstairs?

570
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,752
No, I'm confused
by that.

571
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,881
Ah, but...

572
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:32,054
this was the overweight child
or your nephew from Baltimore?

573
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,520
On the banister.

574
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,373
I have to work.

575
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,501
(woman whimpering
over phone)

576
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,843
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

577
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:53,872
I'm sorry, the office has been...

578
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,186
...overwhelmed.

579
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,357
Mr. Grey, I'm going
to go home now.

580
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:07,124
If you need
any more typing done

581
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,257
I could come back later.

582
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,205
Thank you, Ms. Holloway.
Good night.

583
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,072
That will be all.

584
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,342
(grumbles)

585
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,113
Louisa: Oh, here's
just one example.

586
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,626
He asked me out
to Red Lobster the other night

587
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,424
- for a nightcap.
- Allison: Right.

588
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,626
And yesterday he asked
if my hose were control top

589
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,191
and if they were,
I certainly didn't need it.

590
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,635
- Your boss?
- Yeah.

591
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,572
You should sue him
for sexual harassment.

592
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,939
- Louisa: I like that idea.
- Hello?

593
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,967
My lawyer is representing
a woman who's suing her boss

594
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,003
for sexual harassment.

595
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,345
Is he a good lawyer?

596
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,874
He's the best.

597
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,980
- "He's the best."
- Mother: How long will he be there?

598
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,630
Who was that?

599
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,600
Mother: He checked himself
into the hospital.

600
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:45,883
Lee?

601
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,048
(knocking)

602
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:09,176
(rock music
plays faintly)

603
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,491
Yes, Lee?

604
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:23,260
Hi.

605
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,293
I...

606
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:32,364
I just wanted...

607
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:37,041
I needed you...

608
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:41,209
I wanted you to...

609
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,144
You need me to what?

610
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,986
I just wanted you
to not forget to go over

611
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,022
the Lynch papers
for tomorrow.

612
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,694
No, I haven't.

613
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,536
That's good.

614
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,714
Thank you, Lee.

615
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,258
Lee's voice: After he turned me
away from his house,

616
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,493
he put me back
at my old desk

617
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:08,060
and he just
stopped doing it.

618
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,005
He threw out
all his red pens.

619
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,565
I kept making typos

620
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:18,444
but he just treated me
like a regular old secretary.

621
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,472
Are you coming?

622
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:24,179
After a while I began to wonder
if that was all I was.

623
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,421
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

624
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:32,291
No, sir.

625
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,319
File these.

626
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,297
That's a pretty tie.

627
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,139
But I guess you
won't be golfing today.

628
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,667
What?

629
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:53,341
Your tie...
it has golfers on it.

630
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,713
Right.

631
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,991
Damn it.

632
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,700
(stapler bangs)

633
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,903
(stapler bangs)

634
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,849
(bangs)

635
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,942
# At first I was afraid
I was petrified #

636
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,848
# I kept thinking
I could never live #

637
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,011
# Without you by my side #

638
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:46,954
# But then I spent
so many nights #

639
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,387
# Just thinking
how you'd done me wrong #

640
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,019
# And I grew strong #

641
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,723
# I learned
how to get along #

642
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:59,462
# And so you're back
from outer space #

643
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,266
# I just walked in
to find you here #

644
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,499
# Without that look
upon your face #

645
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,509
# I should have changed
my fucking lock #

646
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,738
# I would have made you
leave your key #

647
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:12,645
# If I'd have known
for just one second #

648
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,172
- # You'd be back to bother me... #
- Don't be scared.

649
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:19,950
I'm... I'm not.

650
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,924
# Just turn around now #

651
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:26,860
# You're not welcome anymore... #

652
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:34,167
- That's not what I meant.
- Oh...

653
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,935
I'm sorry.

654
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,965
Look here, see...

655
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,002
I'm sorry.

656
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,039
Okay...

657
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,609
but my clothes get to stay on
and I want the lights out.

658
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:54,020
# I will survive. #

659
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,559
(Peter moans)

660
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,888
(flatly)
Oh...

661
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,231
Peter:
Oh... oh-oh-oh...

662
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:11,904
Oh...

663
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,807
Uh-hh!

664
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:19,973
(groans)

665
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:23,382
Lee, Lee, Lee.

666
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,220
I didn't hurt you,
did I?

667
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,752
No.

668
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,963
(switch clicks)

669
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:14,800
(grunting)

670
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,903
(grunting continues)

671
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,113
(gasps)

672
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:08,313
Ms. Holloway?

673
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,750
Yes, Mr. Grey?

674
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,355
Come in to my office.

675
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,466
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

676
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,703
Ms. Holloway,
come in to my office.

677
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,004
Yes, sir.

678
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:31,337
(whispers)
Finally.

679
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,238
(doorbell rings)

680
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,546
Ignore it.

681
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,200
Now pull up your skirt.

682
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,563
Why?

683
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:36,100
You're not worried that I'm going
to fuck you, are you?

684
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,878
I'm not interested in that,
not in the least.

685
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,646
Now pull up your skirt.

686
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,247
(sings softly)
# Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee... #

687
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,249
Lee? Lee?

688
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,157
I said, pull up
your skirt.

689
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,626
Peter?

690
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:06,574
I'm not going to be able to come
to the diner today, okay?

691
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,403
Okay.

692
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:16,714
That's okay, 'cause...
it's all right.

693
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,836
Pull down your pantyhose
and underwear.

694
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,642
I told you I'm not
going to fuck you.

695
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,362
(zipper buzzing
slowly)

696
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,453
(Grey pants softly)

697
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,877
(panting louder)

698
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,955
Get these forms
filled out.

699
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,931
And then you can
take your lunch break.

700
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,367
Bring me my sandwich,
I'm eating in.

701
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:57,031
And...

702
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:02,136
go have the usual.

703
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,814
No mayonnaise
this time.

704
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,840
And...

705
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,816
send in
what's-his-name.

706
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,185
Okay?

707
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:08,599
(softly)
Mr. Grey.

708
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,422
Cock.

709
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,435
Place your prick
in my mouth.

710
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:37,029
Screw me.

711
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,558
Oh shit. Fuck.

712
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:01,084
Mayonnaise.
Orchid.

713
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,459
Oh, Mr. Grey..!

714
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:11,164
(loud moan)

715
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,147
Edward.

716
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,606
Recording: Most people think
that the best way to live

717
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,910
is to run from pain.

718
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:56,179
But a much more
joyful life

719
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,517
embraces the entire spectrum
of human feeling.

720
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:02,955
If we can fully experience
pain as well as pleasure,

721
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:09,055
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

722
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,764
(door closes)

723
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,732
(shredder whines)

724
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:58,535
Ms. Holloway?

725
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:04,076
- Yes, sir?
- Bring your typing scores.

726
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,277
Okay.

727
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,169
What happened?

728
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:35,774
Are you pregnant?

729
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,310
No.

730
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:42,689
- Do you plan on being pregnant?
- Could I...

731
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,420
You plan on
getting pregnant?

732
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,419
No.

733
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,624
Are you living
in an apartment?

734
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,758
A house.

735
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,532
- Alone?
- With my parents.

736
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:59,870
Are you married?

737
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,167
No.

738
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,656
Are those your scores?

739
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,885
Yes.

740
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:26,394
Do you really want
to be my secretary?

741
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,598
Yes, I do.

742
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:38,371
This isn't just about
typos, tape, staples and pencils,

743
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,314
- is it, Lee?
- No, sir.

744
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,340
What?

745
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:45,876
(bolder)
No, sir.

746
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:53,194
I like you Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

747
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,496
Why?

748
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,892
It's your behavior.

749
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,469
What about my behavior?

750
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:07,634
It's very bad.

751
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:14,837
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

752
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,512
- Time out.
- Time out?

753
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,817
- You're fired.
- You're fired!

754
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,722
You're fired!
Now, Lee. Get out!

755
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:34,796
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

756
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,600
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

757
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:42,633
Are you aware you kick
your shoes off under your desk?

758
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,668
I can smell your feet.
Do you ever change your pantyhose?

759
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:47,340
- Every day.
- Every time you erase

760
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,907
there are little shavings
all over your desk.

761
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,648
I told you to take
that Walkman home.

762
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:57,522
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music

763
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:59,754
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

764
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,957
I saw it in your desk...
I know it's there.

765
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,431
I'll move it.

766
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,464
You have to go
or I won't stop.

767
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:51,001
Don't.

768
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,442
I cannot
do this anymore.

769
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:01,250
But I want
to know you.

770
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:30,044
I'm so sorry
for what happened between us.

771
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,920
I realize what
a terrible mistake

772
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,050
I made with you.

773
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:42,756
And I can only hope
that you understand.

774
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:47,257
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

775
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:53,897
Get out.

776
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,534
Get out.

777
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,207
- What are you do...
- Get out!

778
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:19,081
Lee's voice: I opened
the envelope the second I got home.

779
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,585
It was a check for $680.

780
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,928
More than he actually owed me.

781
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:28,493
It occurred to me
to tear up the check, but I didn't.

782
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:31,232
I felt like I was doing
the right thing.

783
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:35,140
And I didn't tell anybody
about any of it.

784
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,371
I pretended to go
to work as usual,

785
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:41,974
and watched his office
from across the street.

786
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:44,007
He hired a new girl

787
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,543
and changed the locks
on the doors.

788
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:51,584
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

789
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:05,002
My doctor
at the institution once said,

790
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,475
"Every journey begins
with the first step."

791
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:12,605
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

792
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:17,442
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples

793
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,919
before we even
made it to his car.

794
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,114
Hi.

795
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:24,556
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio

796
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:28,153
- and when I refused, he said...
- I thought you were a masochist.

797
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,495
Then there was the one who liked
being tied to a gas stove

798
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,523
while the burners were on
full blast.

799
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:36,594
- I had to throw tomatoes at him.
- Thank you.

800
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:40,073
For a while I stopped trying
and stayed at home

801
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:43,669
helping Dad adjust
to his new sobriety.

802
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,408
Until one day,
out of the blue,

803
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,746
Peter proposed marriage to me

804
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:53,311
in the basement of J.C. Penney's.

805
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:56,687
I think I said yes because
I didn't know what else to do.

806
01:29:56,724 --> 01:30:00,626
I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

807
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:02,652
Okay.

808
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:07,496
Sylvia: If you hold your breath
through the wedding, you'll make it.

809
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:09,594
Don't move.
I'm going to get Stewart.

810
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:13,129
You're beautiful,
you're just too beautiful.

811
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:37,964
Lee?

812
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:40,866
No! I'm not supposed to see you
before the wedding.

813
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,097
Sylvia:
Where are you going?

814
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:01,343
- I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

815
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:03,050
I love you.

816
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,854
Lee, you should not
be here.

817
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:08,589
I love you.

818
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:25,040
I'm sorry, I... but I don't
believe that to be true.

819
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:27,138
Well, it is true.

820
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:29,172
It is.

821
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:33,816
This matter was resolved

822
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:35,914
when I received your canceled
severance check.

823
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,392
I love you.

824
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:45,260
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

825
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:47,631
Why not?

826
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:04,512
Put both your hands
on the desk, palms down.

827
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,452
I want to make love.

828
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:25,270
Keep both your feet
on the floor until I come back.

829
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:11,442
(touch tones beeping)

830
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:14,852
(cell phone rings)

831
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:17,587
- Hello?
- In case you're wondering,

832
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:20,458
your fiance
is at my office.

833
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,528
(rings)

834
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:30,436
(rings)

835
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:44,114
(ringing stops)

836
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:57,822
Lee, I'm very fond
of you as well...

837
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:59,958
(door closes)

838
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,571
Oh, it's you.

839
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:16,712
Lee, what are
you doing?

840
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:20,482
Lee, I don't... I don't know
how to deal with...

841
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:22,819
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

842
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,651
I'm your fianc, Lee.

843
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:30,789
You are trespassing.

844
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:33,732
You are making
an unwarranted incursion...

845
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:37,704
a gradual or stealthy entrance
into the sphere of another.

846
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:43,438
Peter:
Okay, Lee...

847
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:46,913
are you doing something...

848
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:50,379
sexual, right now?

849
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:53,581
Does this look
sexual to you?

850
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,847
I don't know, Lee!

851
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:02,629
Why don't you
move your hands?

852
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:08,693
Because I don't want to.

853
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:13,663
No-oo!

854
01:35:43,704 --> 01:35:46,935
Peter...

855
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:49,499
I don't want you.

856
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:55,939
Now, get out.

857
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:59,342
Get out.

858
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,080
Get out!

859
01:36:43,898 --> 01:36:46,924
I brought you
some peas.

860
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:53,297
There are no statutes
capable of controlling

861
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,036
the relations between
men and women.

862
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:58,442
There are other ways
to show your feelings, Lee.

863
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,504
More conventional ways.

864
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:04,780
I expect that dress back,
dry cleaned, in perfect condition.

865
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:08,277
I'm just going to leave
you with this literature.

866
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:12,349
Why don't you read
about women's struggle first?

867
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:29,701
Man's voice:
You know, Lee,

868
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:32,871
there's a long history
of this in Catholicism.

869
01:37:32,913 --> 01:37:37,111
The monks used to wear
thorns on their temples.

870
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:40,552
And the nuns wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

871
01:37:40,588 --> 01:37:44,251
Two years ago when it didn't
work out between us, that was it.

872
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:46,282
I let him slip
through my fingers.

873
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:50,696
- You are part of a great tradition.
- I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

874
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:54,827
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I've ever known.

875
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:57,269
The worm... amazing.

876
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:01,104
Who's to say that love
needs to be soft and gentle?

877
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:05,510
"You are the child of God's
holy gift of life.

878
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:08,140
You come from me,

879
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:11,310
but you are not me.

880
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:14,446
Your soul and your body
are your own,

881
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:18,322
and yours to do with
as you wish."

882
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:23,919
Thank you, Daddy.

883
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:41,638
Drinks.

884
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:43,673
Take what you ordered.

885
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:46,447
Don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

886
01:38:47,054 --> 01:38:49,989
(weakly)
# 57... #

887
01:38:50,024 --> 01:38:53,721
# Beers on the wall... #

888
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,457
# 57... #

889
01:38:56,497 --> 01:39:00,092
# Bottles of beer... #

890
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:04,565
# Take one down... #

891
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:21,919
Reporter: We are here on day three
of what has come to be known

892
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,323
as the "Lee Holloway Hunger Strike."
You may have heard

893
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:27,691
that there are those
in the community who wonder

894
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:30,754
if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

895
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:38,571
Lee: "In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

896
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:41,301
I didn't know why,
exactly.

897
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:45,802
But I do know that I'm not
so scared of suffering now.

898
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:48,872
I feel more
than I've ever felt,

899
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:52,443
and I've found
someone to feel with...

900
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,579
to play with,

901
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:56,680
to love,

902
01:39:56,724 --> 01:40:00,319
in a way
that feels right for me.

903
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:04,263
I hope he knows that I can see
that he suffers too,

904
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:07,665
and that I want
to love him."

905
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:16,269
# I never felt this way before #

906
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:20,103
# I've seen so many islands #

907
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:24,133
# I never felt this way before #

908
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:28,114
# In this song here
I describe him #

909
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:31,083
# The chariots rise #

910
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:34,713
# Up high in the sky #

911
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:39,187
# What grace have I #

912
01:41:39,226 --> 01:41:42,992
# To fall so in love? #

913
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:47,226
# What a wonderful dream #

914
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:51,101
# It seems to be #

915
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,139
# 'Cause I love him #

916
01:42:02,916 --> 01:42:06,545
- # Though I have waited long #
- # Waited long... #

917
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:10,182
- # And they have all been wrong #
- # All been wrong... #

918
01:42:10,224 --> 01:42:13,660
# Now I find in the end #

919
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:17,994
# With him I need not pretend #

920
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:21,057
# The chariots #

921
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:24,559
# They rise up high #

922
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:27,733
# In the sky #

923
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:31,505
# What grace have I #

924
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:36,482
# To fall so in love? #

925
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:38,781
# What a wonderful dream... #

926
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:42,084
Lee:
Each cut, each scar.

927
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:46,149
Each burn,
a different mood or time.

928
01:42:46,193 --> 01:42:49,356
I told him
what the first one was.

929
01:42:49,396 --> 01:42:51,887
I told him
where the second one came from.

930
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:54,628
I remembered them all.

931
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:58,160
And for the first
time in my life,

932
01:42:58,205 --> 01:43:01,697
I felt beautiful.

933
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:04,506
Finally part of the earth.

934
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:07,412
I touched the soil

935
01:43:07,447 --> 01:43:10,439
and he loved me back.

936
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:14,511
# They rise up high #

937
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:18,514
# In the sky #

938
01:43:18,559 --> 01:43:21,221
# What grace have I #

939
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:24,526
# To fall so in love? #

940
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:31,100
# What a wonderful dream
it seems to be... #

941
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,766
Where did you go
to high school?

942
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:39,908
What was your mother like?

943
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:42,780
What was her name?

944
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,345
What did it say...

945
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:52,722
under your senior
yearbook picture?

946
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,161
Who was your first love?

947
01:44:02,269 --> 01:44:04,635
When did your heart...

948
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:07,936
first get broken?

949
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:16,613
Where were you born?

950
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:26,523
Des Moines, Iowa.

951
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,180
Lee:
All our activities

952
01:44:49,216 --> 01:44:52,481
melted into
an everyday sort of life

953
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:56,011
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

954
01:44:56,056 --> 01:44:58,547
Pull it over, yes.

955
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:01,425
Just pull it tight.

956
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:04,362
Now these pillows

957
01:45:04,398 --> 01:45:06,389
like to be stacked...

958
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:10,859
largest to the smallest.

959
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:13,372
We had a June wedding,

960
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:15,807
by ourselves,
at the justice of the peace.

961
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:20,642
Then we honeymooned
in the mountains.

962
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:24,981
We only had the weekend, because
Edward had to get back to work.
