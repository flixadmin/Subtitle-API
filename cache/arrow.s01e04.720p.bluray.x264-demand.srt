on Brodeur. Brodeur had her murdered.

LAUREL:
Ajury has found you guilty, Mr. Declan.

168
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,127
The evidence was stacked against me,
but I didn't kill my wife.

169

I didn't take my daughter's mother
from her.

170
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,328
The murder weapon was a knife
from your kitchen...

171
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,090
...with your prints on it.

172

It was found,
along with Camille's blood...

173
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,966
...in the trunk of your car.
Your neighbors said...

174
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,128
...they heard an argument that night.

175
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,210
We had a knockdown fight
over Jason Brodeur.

176
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,564
Camille worked for him...

177
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,162
...and his company had been
dumping toxic waste into the Glades.

178
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,165
Camille told me she'd gone
and told a supervisor about it.

179
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,562
I was afraid for my family's safety.

180
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,282
And we argued...

181
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,330
...very loudly, Yes-

182
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,684
Izzy started crying, so Camille went
and stayed in her room.

183
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,367
In the morning,
I went to apologize...

184
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,764
...and that's when I found her.

185
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,328
So I just grabbed Izzy
and I ran outside and I called 911.

I'm innocent, Ms. Lance.

187

Well, it looks like someone forgot
a lunch date with his wife.

Lunch isn't for another...

something: $2.6 million withdrawal...

193
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,088
...from one of our Vancouver
subsidiaries.

194
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,729
Are you saying that someone embezzled
$2.6 million from the company?

195
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,847
It's probably a bookkeeping error, but
Compliance is worried about an IRS audit.

Mm.

...we had fingerprints, we had blood,
we got motive, everything.

Declan said his wife
went to her supervisor...

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,244
...with allegations that Brodeur
was dumping toxic waste.
