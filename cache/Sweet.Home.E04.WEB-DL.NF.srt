1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:04,017
Ripped by TTEOKBOKKIsubs

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,438
He could still be alive.

3
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,607
No.

4
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,652
Move out of the way.

5
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,235
She died because of you.

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,945
If only I'd gone out sooner…

7
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,784
This is your fault.

8
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,206
You killed her.

9
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,446
ORIGINAL STORY <i>SWEET HOME</i>
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

10
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,898
You can't trust that announcement.

11
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,110
Will you really be okay?

12
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,823
We can't keep sponging off you.
We should do something.

13
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,325
Thank you for the meals and this.

14
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,578
May God bless you.

15
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,706
I'm Buddhist.

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,420
If the first floor is safe,
we'll come back to get you.

17
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,798
Don't make a promise you can't keep.

18
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,384
I feel like

19
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,887
I should say farewell now.

20
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,478
Someone once said that
even the thickest darkness

21
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,148
disappears with the faintest light.

22
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,611
Is the person who said that still alive?

23
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm not sure.

24
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,866
I…

25
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,330
Can I go with you?

26
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,499
I guess three is better than two. Right?

27
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,543
Of course.

28
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,545
Okay.

29
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,630
Go.

30
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,549
Go. All of you.

31
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,517
Hyun-su, you have to come back, okay?

32
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,942
Okay.

33
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,903
Thank you for saving us.

34
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,991
Shall we get going?

35
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,203
Thank you.

36
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,942
Suddenly,

37
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,196
I'm like the head of a kindergarten.

38
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,453
AUGUST 18, 2020
DAY 4 OF CONFINEMENT

39
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,915
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS GLAD TO HEAR
THE APARTMENT PA ANNOUNCEMENT

40
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,667
I WANTED TO GO AS SOON AS I HEARD HIM

41
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,711
URGE US TO GO DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR

42
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,631
I THINK WE SHOULD GO DOWN
FOR YU-RI'S SAKE

43
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,966
I think it's time to leave.

44
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,301
Not yet, sir.

45
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,763
I'm praying hard for you
to live a long life.

46
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,598
No, I didn't mean this world.

47
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,768
I meant here. This disgustingly small,

48
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,645
dirty old room.

49
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,982
But isn't this place
younger than you, sir?

50
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,942
How long have you been living here?

51
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,111
Let me see.

52
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,988
Hold on.

53
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,037
Was it since the independence

54
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,080
or the Korean War?

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,585
Your life has been extended just now.

56
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,261
I guess I won't die anytime soon
thanks to you.

57
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,521
What are you doing?

58
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,068
Didn't you hear the announcement?
I should go to the first floor to help.

59
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,528
Could you be of any help?

60
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,036
Careful.

61
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,974
She must be devastated.

62
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,811
If my Bom died,

63
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,231
I think I'd be devastated, too.

64
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,985
I think this is a little different.

65
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,904
No, it's not.

66
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,448
Bom is family to me.

67
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,243
Still,

68
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,497
it can't be the same
as losing your own child.

69
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,417
You don't have kids, either.

70
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,377
You wouldn't know what it's like.

71
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,384
-Right.
-Anyway, I feel really bad

72
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,846
for Ms. Cha and the firefighter lady.

73
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,973
What about her?

74
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,309
Her fiancé used to live here.

75
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,313
He died.

76
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,983
The wedding's supposed to be in two days.

77
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,068
What happened to him?

78
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,489
I don't know.

79
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,451
What do you think happened?

80
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,873
She seemed so poised. I had no idea.

81
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,421
But what's taking her so long?

82
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,840
Do you think something happened to her?

83
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,963
SANG-WON

84
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,840
Sang-won.

85
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,986
The cellphone's out of service anyway.

86
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,279
Exactly.

87
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,783
But how'd she know her daughter
was coming?

88
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,201
It's a mystery.

89
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,620
Do you think she's possessed?

90
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,831
Possessed? No, she's just crazy.

91
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,750
I feel bad for her.

92
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,295
Anyway,
you better watch out for Eun-hyeok.

93
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,465
That guy is totally heartless.

94
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,593
That's bullshit. He saved your life.

95
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,720
What are you talking about?

96
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,847
If he hadn't stopped you,

97
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,515
you'd be dead like that soldier.

98
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,934
Hey, Seok-hyeon.

99
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,020
It's so reassuring
to have you as the leader.

100
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,773
Leader, my ass. I don't want that job.

101
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,860
But we can't let that four-eyes
be the leader.

102
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,359
I'm glad you're okay.

103
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,573
You knew

104
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,284
there was a monster, didn't you?

105
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,248
Yi-kyung.

106
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,088
I was worried about you.

107
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,174
Are you okay?

108
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,026
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

109
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,071
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

110
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,531

{\an8}<i>Good luck.</i>

133
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,814
See? We're fine.

134
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,567
The military will come and rescue us
if we hold out.

135
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,818
I knew it.

136
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,987
She just told us to survive on our own.

137
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,113
Is that what she meant?

138
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,990
Desire makes you a monster?

139
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,200
-Does that make sense?
-You saw them roaming outside.

140
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,578
She told us to survive.

141
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,747
-That's what she meant, right?
-What?

142
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,290
That's it!

143
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,584
-But the president died.
-Is that really what she meant?

144
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,669
-Yes, of course.
-What do you mean by hold out?

145
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,171
-What?
-Do you really believe that?

146
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,048
-We all saw it.
-Pay back what you owe!

147
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,060
Seriously?

148
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,900
Is it okay to go downstairs like this?

149
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,611
Shouldn't we grab something useful?

150
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,321
The most useful thing is our lives.

151
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,832
It's a person.

152
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,251
I'm relieved to see a corpse.

153
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,802
It's still warm.

154
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,554
He hasn't been dead for long.

155
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,847
Oh, God.

156
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,199
Put it back if you don't want it.

157
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,203
-You're mean.
-Yes, I am.

158
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,416
I can do worse things to survive.

159
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,549
You're an accomplice now.

160
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,136
Let's go.

161
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,676
Don't die. Why did you die?

162
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,346
You can't leave me here all alone.

163
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,601
Don't die, please. I beg you.

164
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,400
{\an8}MOON HYEON-SUK, CHA SU-A

165
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,360
{\an8}<i>-Is he dead?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

166
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,404
<i>He isn't dead.</i>

167
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,865
<i>I thought he'd die.</i>

168
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,203
<i>-Do you know him?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

169
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,996
<i>Don't go near him.</i>

170
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,874
<i>-We can't leave the infected here.</i>
<i>-Take this monster out.</i>

171
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,589
Dad…

172
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,426
<i>You really fell.</i>

173
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,893
When I told you not to die here,
I meant the whole building.

174
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,270
Where am I?

175
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,399
It's a place where everyone gathered,
waiting to die.

176
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,028
What about the other two?

177
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,657
They're safe.

178
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,787
I guess you aren't as shitty as I thought.

179
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,790
You should worry about yourself, not them.

180
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,708
Pardon?

181
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,335
Eun-yu.

182
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,262
You're fine.

183
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,182
You fell from the 9th floor
and woke up in 3 hours.

184
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,560
Maybe the golden hour saved you.

185
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,771
Isn't it ironic?

186
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,399
The golden hour used to mean
the last hour to save someone.

187
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,027
Now it means the only possible period
of time to destroy someone.

188
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,575
How do you feel?

189
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,251
I think I'm okay.

190
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,794
Good.

191
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,672
It's going to be tough from here on out.

192
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,176
What is it?

193
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,969
Why did he call us?

194
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,054
-What?
-Keep going.

195
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,683
You're out of your mind.

196
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,312
You brought a frigging monster in here.

197
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,192
Don't you dare turn.

198
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,404
Got it? You fucking monster.

199
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,410
Answer when an adult speaks to you.

200
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,788
Got it.

201
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,417
-What?
-We can't do that.

202
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,669
I don't intend on missing the golden hour.

203
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,838
-The Lord said--
-I'm sure Jesus never lived

204
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,924
in a world like this, did He?

205
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,092
It's for everyone's safety.

206
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,677
Here.

207
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,804
What is that?

208
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,641
Each of you take a piece of paper.

209
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,728
If you think we should oust Hyun-su,
draw a circle.

210
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,273
And if you don't think we should,
draw an X.

211
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,983
Then put the paper in this box.

212
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,152
Obviously, he'll be kicked out.
Why bother?

213
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,447
Just do a show of hands. I want him out.

214
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,990
Who wants him out?

215
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,744
Why don't you raise your hand?

216
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,705
I don't.

217
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,542
You aren't old enough to vote.

218
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,461
Are we electing the president?

219
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,380
Age doesn't matter.

220
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,173
How dare you talk back?

221
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,842
When an adult says something,
you should shut up and agree.

222
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,347
FUCK BASTARDS LIKE YOU

223
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,517
Did you just swear at me?

224
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,979
I'm old enough to be your dad.
How dare you!

225
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,397
No, I didn't.

226
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
I said you're the best.

227
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,402
FUCK BASTARDS LIKE YOU

228
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,409
To protect everyone's privacy,
it must be a secret ballot.

229
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,368
What?

230
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,330
Because ousting him…

231
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,583
would be taking part in murder.

232
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,723
Privacy? My ass.

233
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,558
I want him out. Out!

234
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,768
Murder?

235
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,564
We're making this decision to survive.

236
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,024
Don't be scared!

237
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,694
Hey, aren't you going to raise your hand?

238
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,195
What? Well…

239
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,281
Raise your hand, you stupid cow.

240
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,658
I think Eun-hyeok has a point.

241
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,121
Isn't it better not to know
who agreed to oust him?

242
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,499
It's only natural to vote
in a democratic country.

243
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,627
Democracy? The world is coming to an end.

244
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,547
Stop calling your wife names

245
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,008
and using profanities.

246
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,301
It's very offensive.

247
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,179
Why you…

248
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,431
-How dare you tell me what--
-Enough.

249
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,689
IN FAVOR, 8

250
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,691
OPPOSED, 7

251
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,654
There are eight in favor
and seven opposed.

252
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,077
If one of the last two ballots is
in favor, he'll be ousted.

253
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,080
Seven people opposed?

254
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,540
Are you guys crazy?

255
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,291
Opposed.

256
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,668
It's eight to eight.

257
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,963
Damn it.

258
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,589
Did you oppose?

259
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,217
I didn't.

260
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,179
All the bitches and bastards on his side

261
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,347
should all be thrown out!

262
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,640
Hey, mister!

263
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,725
Don't get worked up yet.

264
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,272
This last vote will determine the result.

265
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,914
Invalid.

266
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,463
No way.

267
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,135
Hey, bring that bastard here.

268
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,344
Me?

269
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,680
Yes! We have to get rid of him
as fast as we can!

270
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,352
Voting, my ass.

271
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:40,979
Are you all nuts?

272
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,815
Did you already forget that someone died?

273
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,151
Are you against the result?

274
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,446
What? "Taking part in murder?"

275
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,948
Murder is killing a human being,

276
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,035
not a monster!

277
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,170
Honey.

278
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,796
Honey…

279
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,594
This is…

280
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,096
It's because I'm tired.

281
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,848
-Don't come near us!
-Don't!

282
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,391
It's because I'm tired!

283
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,397
You better brace yourself.

284
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,107
What?

285
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,736
If you don't want to be eaten
by a monster.

286
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,738
You son of a bitch.

287
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,705
Do I have the right to vote?

288
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,381
If I put this in,
he'll be thrown out with me, right?

289
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,093
Am I right?

290
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,482
He looks like he's just a kid.

291
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,568
A handsome kid.

292
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,821
Didn't you see how much he bled
and still didn't die?

293
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,824
You can't judge someone on their looks.

294
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,827
Would he survive a shot to the head?

295
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,328
How can we kill him then?

296
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,039
-Can we?
-How can you…

297
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
Did you vote in favor?

298
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,168
You're the murder accomplices.

299
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,962
What if he turns into a monster?

300
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,213
Will you leave him like that?

301
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,049
Can someone explain

302
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,884
why this is happening?

303
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,263
Is it because of a virus?

304
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,639
It's because of radiation.

305
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,600
Come on. Didn't you guys watch the news?

306
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,643
It's because of human desire.

307
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,522
Right. It must be because the owner
of the supermarket is so greedy.

308
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,065
Then what about Hyun-su?

309
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,734
What was his desire?

310
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,111
You better be careful, too.

311
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,072
It seemed your appetite
was out of control.

312
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,577
-It's because of radiation.
-Radiation?

313
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,703
We're getting punished.

314
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,833
It's God's punishment.

315
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,169
Yes. I agree.

316
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,047
That's the most plausible answer
I've heard so far.

317
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,300
Since we're all humans,

318
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,136
no one knows…

319
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,727
who will be next.

320
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,330
What?

321
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,208
Why am I…

322
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,127
You had a nosebleed and fainted.

323
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,381
I think it's pretty obvious.

324
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,179
That can't be…

325
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,099
Why now?

326
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,892
Why?

327
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,695
Well…

328
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,323
I hear you're holding out.

329
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,576
How are you doing it?

330
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,412
How?

331
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,833
You're shameless.

332
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,672
I have to live. I want to live.

333
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,467
Pull yourself together.

334
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,554
What?

335
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,724
I have nothing else to tell you.

336
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,948
It's a good thing. Don't you think?

337
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,075
He beat you every day.

338
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,369
What? Did I say something wrong?

339
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,621
Divorcees are considered hot these days.

340
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,373
A new life lies before you.

341
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,302
Excuse me.

342
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,722
I can't find Su-ung anywhere.

343
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,768
Oh, my… I guess you haven't heard.

344
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,061
Ms. Cha's daughter

345
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,731
really came back.

346
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,361
And Su-ung went out to rescue her.

347
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,198
He barely took a few steps.

348
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,074
Whoosh! It got him.

349
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,921
<i>We're stuck here.</i>

350
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,841
{\an8}GREEN HOME HAIR SALON

351
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,307
SANG-WON

352
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,725
Sang-won…

353
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,696
Here.

354
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,826
You must be starving.

355
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,750
Thank you.

356
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,003
Eat this and cheer up.

357
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,807
I'm sorry I stared.

358
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,727
Eat up.

359
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,533
What's wrong?

360
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,535
Is something wrong with it?

361
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,498
It tastes okay.

362
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,003
My stomach is a little upset.

363
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,795
She's very pretty.

364
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,178
Did you take many pictures of her?

365
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,388
I only took a few.

366
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,099
That's what I regret.

367
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,149
He was a good person.

368
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,243
You need energy to miss someone.

369
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,660
Is this funny to you?

370
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,830
You should quit music
and become a comedian.

371
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,290
Why don't you teach me then?

372
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,794
First, relax your body.

373
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,174
<i>Spread your legs shoulder-width apart.</i>

374
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,843
<i>Keep your hands close.</i>

375
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,096
<i>Don't take your eyes off the ball.</i>

376
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,823
It's disgusting to see you act nice.

377
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,412
Do you think a frigging chocolate bar
can cheer her up?

378
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,251
You did that to make yourself feel better.

379
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,462
Are you the crazy bitch around here?

380
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,631
Fine. Go head, you crazy bitch.

381
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,902
He doesn't die?

382
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,293
You're here?

383
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,921
You said see you again, son of a bitch!

384
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,894
Wait a minute.

385
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,443
I have something to say.

386
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,403
I…

387
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,100
I think I've turned into a monster.

388
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,526
Please lock me up.

389
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,284
When did you get here?

390
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,953
Did you see the news?

391
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,122
It's not infectious.

392
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,959
We're still fucked, though,

393
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,461
because the world is doomed.

394
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,260
Moron.

395
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,639
He really looks like he got beat up.

396
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,349
He's the one who wants to be locked up.

397
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,976
Why did it happen to such a good man?

398
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,313
If you feel that bad,
you can get in there with him.

399
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,902
That's not the reason, is it?

400
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,489
Jeez.

401
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,014
Good morning.

402
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,891
You must be hungry.

403
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,562
I'm good.

404
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,567
What?

405
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,738
A monster can't eat?

406
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,991
You sleep well, though.

407
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,459
What does it feel like?

408
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,673
You feel so powerful, don't you?

409
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,104
How can I become like that?

410
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,899
Tell me.

411
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,987
Tell me.

412
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,200
I can do it really well.

413
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,703
What should I do?

414
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,275
Here.

415
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,445
You can take it.

416
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,952
PREGNANCY TEST

417
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,955
It's okay.

418
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,415
You never know.

419
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,584
Just in case.

420
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,212
Okay?

421
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,343
PREGNANCY TEST

422
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,322
Amen.

423
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,581
It was your voice, wasn't it?

424
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,085
"The first floor is quite safe for now."

425
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,795
Yes.

426
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,214
Did I hear you wrong?

427
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,971
That shield.

428
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,687
Who made it?

429
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,828
Mister.

430
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,788
What?

431
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,332
Ms. Im…

432
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,086
still hasn't come out of the bathroom.

433
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,632
Do you need to poop?

434
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,886
How long has she been in there?

435
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,847
It's been about an hour.

436
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,651
Okay. Step aside for a bit.

437
