00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,120
What if the only way to kill Mallus
is to let him out?

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,754
to let an ancient demon
out of his bloody cage?

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,958
Well, you opened a door, love.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,789
And Mallus wasn't
the only thing that got out.

- How can you even tell them apart?

Well, Paul is the cute one,
George is the quiet one, and Ringo...

Never met an Englishman I haven't
wanted to punch in the face.

Relax, Mick. If it wasn't
for the British Invasion,

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
there'd be no Rolling Stones.
No Led Zep.

That's right, Mick.

So, Gideon sent us
on a wild goose chase.

Interesting fact. The real
Paul Revere didn't actually say...

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,874
Oh, my God. It's Paul Revere!

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,116
I got this.

35

Where am I?

Geez. Who died?

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,152
Oh, come on. We just met the Beatles
and saved Fourth of July.

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,520
No, it's cool. It's just all
becoming, I don't know, old hat.

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,114
Yeah, we did spend all of last year

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,560
returning displaced people
to their proper place in history.

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,592
Four years doing the same old crap.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,871
I'm beginning to think
Wally had the right idea.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,271
He's taking time off, clearing
his head, traveling the world...

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,120
Speaking of the same old crap,
isn't that what he did last year?

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,160
Look. All I know is, Constantine
promised us new mysterious monsters.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,152
So, where are they all hiding?

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,275
I'm confused. We are all happy that
there was only one dragon, right?

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
We don't wanna be fighting
werewolves in the Alamo.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Eh...

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,678
Well, it would be good
for our ratings.

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
What ratings?

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,400
Oh, you don't know? The Time Bureau
rates all their employees.

61
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,955
But don't worry, we have
a few dedicated fans.

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,759
Yeah, Gary doesn't count.

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,315
Who gives a damn about
Time Pig ratings?

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,395
I want dragons.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,594
What is wrong with you guys?

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,952
Don't you get it?
Constantine was wrong.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
Our crazy plan
to let Mallus out worked.

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,398
Finally, we're not screw-ups
forced to clean up our own mess.

Captain Lance.

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,616
I would like you and your team

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,393
to report to the Time Bureau
immediately.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,759
Copy that.
Gideon, set a course for Star City.

I'm not talking
about our field office, Miss Lance.

I meant our Time Bureau
headquarters in D.C.

Over and out.

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,873
Damn it!
Who told Ava about the dragon?

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,711
You sure that you can't tell us
what all this is about?

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,640
Oh, I'd love to but the boss lady
will kill me.

Mick.

- Talk
- I can't. Director Sharpe's...

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,416
Whatever Ava threatened is nothing
compared to

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,920
what I'm about to do to you.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,296
You told her about the dragon head,
didn't you, Gary?

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
What? No!

89

- Did Constantine get you to squeal?
- I wish.

90
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,311
We looked.
There are no more monsters.

This isn't what you think.

92

On behalf of the Time Bureau,

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,110
I would like to recognize
Captain Lance and her crew

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,556
for fixing the final anachronism.

98

- Well, it means that... [clears throat]

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,960
Paul Revere was the final crack
in the timeline.

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,592
You, my friends, fixed history.

103
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,955
The same history we broke?

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
Just take the win.

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,432
I don't want your stinking medal.

106
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,438
- There's an open bar.
- Where?

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Sorry, Sara. I know
you don't like surprises but...

108
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,029
I like this one.

109
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,709
Now, I was thinking maybe you could
give me a tour

110
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,480
of the headquarters, Director Sharpe.

111
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
[music playing]

112
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,792
Gee, I really wonder how she managed
to escape from the Time Bureau.

113
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Yeah.

114
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,476
I mean... I mean, if I had to...

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,472
If I had to guess, I'd probably say
that someone must have given Nora

116
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,994
her dead father's time stone.

117
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,676
Furthermore, that someone
must've done it

118
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,150
in hopes that she would
turn over a new leaf in life.

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,353
Sounds like that someone forgot
about Nora's serious lack of ethics.

120
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,831
Around, you know, murder, for one.

121
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,318
But that someone
must've had a really big heart

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,119
to give her a second chance.

123
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
You're a good guy, Ray Palmer.

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,720
[Sara giggling]

125
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,398
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Oh, no...

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,199
Yes, I gotta get back to the ship.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,112
The Legends aren't used
to being on furlough.

128
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,873
Come on, they will be fine
for one night.

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,514
Besides, I was hoping
that you and your team

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,398
would be spending more time here
in 2018.

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,034
But mostly, you know, you.

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
With me.

133
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,515
In this apartment.

134
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,715
Ava Sharpe.

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,472
Are you trying to make
a kept woman out of me?

136
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,592
[gasps] What? No. I wouldn't dare.

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,350
I'm just saying that, you know,

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,037
since you fixed all the anachronisms,
maybe you wouldn't mind being kept.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,035
Just part of the time.

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,120
It'd be fun to come home to you.

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,990
[sighs]

142
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,995
I'm sorry. Oh. That was just stupid.

143
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,776
You just got back into town,
and here I am hitching

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,190
the old U-Haul
to the back of the Subaru.

145
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,590
- It was stupid.
- No, no. Hey.

146
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
It wasn't that... I'm...

147
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm just thinking and...

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,236
I'm ready to take the next step.

149
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,319
I am ready to be
a partially kept woman.

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,430
Yes!

151
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,119
[giggles] Come here.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,354
Mmm. Mmm.

153
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,560
Okay. So why don't you rustle us up
another bottle of champagne

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,976
and let's make this thing official?

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,400
- That I can do.
- Yeah?

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,836
[cork pops]

157
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,035
Hello, John.

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,236
You know, tonight really isn't
the night for celebration, Sara.

159
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,554
The darkness, it's rising.

160
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,758
What are you doing?
And what does that even mean?

161
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,839
Mallus wasn't the only prisoner
to escape when you decided

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,037
to pull back the veil
between our worlds.

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,680
And yet for the past five months,
the timeline has been quiet.

164
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,833
If you wanted to come and see me,
all you had to do was ask.

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,994
Five months is a blink of an eye
for an immortal monster.

166
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,437
Look, this is your bloody mess,
Sara,

167
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,296
so stop playing tiddlywinks
with the missus and get ready

168
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,515
for the fight that's coming.

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,479
What if this is who I am now?

170
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Really?

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,997
[whistles] This is who you are.

172
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Fuzzy throws
and fluffy pink slippers.

173
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,232
I like my pink fluffy slippers.

174
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,752
- Huh. Yeah.
- Okay, reunion's over. Time to go.

175
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,273
[chanting incantation]

176
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,070
What am I looking at?

177
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,595
The knuckle bones
of a martyred saint, obviously.

178
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,158
They act as a divining rod
able to detect the presence of beings

179
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,674
not belonging to our world.

180
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,315
My team spent the last five months
scouring the timeline

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,198
for another one of
your mystical creatures.

182
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,873
You wanna know what we found?

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Nothing.

184
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,480
[Agent Sharpe] What the hell
are you doing here?

185
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
[bones clatter]

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,756
Is everything all right?

187
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,514
- Yeah, everything is great.
- I was just telling Sara about...

188
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,991
About an exorcism that he has to do
tomorrow in Georgetown.

189
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,630
It's really nothing you want to hear
before bedtime.

190
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,952
Come back again soon now, John.
Don't be shy about that doorbell.

191
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,720
[Constantine]
I'll be seeing you around, Sharpie.

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,954
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

193
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,856
Should I be worried
about your ex-lover

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,160
breaking into my apartment or...

195
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,833
Well, I thought that this was
our apartment.

196
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,712
You are smooth.

197
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,030
Don't forget the bubbly.

198
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,679
[rattling]

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,115
[sighs] Bollocks.

200
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,056
[Nate] Mick, what are you
still doing here?

201
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,675
Machine's still spinning
and I'm still standing.

202
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,816
You know what?
Hook me up with one of those.

203
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,991
Now that we've fixed
our last anachronism,

204
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,800
it's only a matter of time before
the Bureau puts us out to pasture.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Which blows because being a Legend
was the only thing I was good at.

206
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,870
Well, speak for yourself.
I was a great criminal.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
At least we got these cool medals.

208
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,113
Actually, the medal has to remain
top secret because no one can know

209
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,034
about time-travel. So I'll just take
these back now for safe-keeping.

210
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,396
What do you say you and I find
some real action?

211
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,830
Mick, I'm 100% down.

212
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,713
Ooh. I'll come with.

213
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,394
[grunting]

214
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,034
I could've just called us an Uber.

215
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,600
You ready to steal something, Pretty?

216
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,831
- Um... [blows raspberry]
- [engine starting]

217
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,838
Yeah, I could do some light theft.

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,197
What is this? Spring break?
I'm talking about a felony.

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,192
- Now get in.
- You know what, Mick?

220
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,616
If we're gonna rob a house,
we really should make sure

221
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,154
there's stuff in there
worth stealing.

222
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,438
And I think I know
just the neighborhood.

223
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,549
- [taps car]
- [tires screeching]

224
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,869
Mick! Wait, wait, wait!
You are so aggressive.

225
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,955
Why don't you look for a spare key?

226
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,394
Good spotting, Pretty.

227
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,877
Yeah, I'm a real criminal mastermind.

228
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,478
- [snaps fingers]
- Bingo.

229
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,673
[gun cocking]

230
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,479
Yes, I'd like to report a robbery.

231
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,279
You'll do nothing of the sort!

232
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,355
Oh, Nate! It is so good to see you!

233
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,193
What the hell is going on here?

234
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,632
Um, Mick, these are my parents.

235
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,675
I am Dorothy Heywood.
You can call me "Dot."

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,310
- Hi.
- And, uh, this is my dad.

237
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,149
- Hank.
- Henry Heywood.

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,190
And I believe one of my great
grandmother's silver candlesticks

239
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,078
has found its way into your coat.

240
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,672
Oh, you have exquisite taste
in silver, Mr...

241
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,198
Rory. Mick Rory.
Of the Central City Rorys.

242
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,200
We didn't mean to scare you, Mom.

243
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,136
I thought you'd be up at Martha's
Vineyard this time of year.

244
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Oh, we were.

245
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,074
But your father just took
a very exciting job at the Pentagon.

246
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
- We'll get going. Right, Mick?
- [Hank] Good idea.

247
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
[Dorothy] Don't be ridiculous.

248
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,472
Mr. Rory, do you like sandwiches?

249
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,914
You bet your ass I do, ma'am.

250
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,875
Wonderful. Then I'm gonna fix
you boys a little midnight snack.

251
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,509
You, too, Henry.
You're one of the boys.

252
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,715
Gary, wake up.

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,790
[glass clatters]

254
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,080
I got a hunch there might be
a monster loose in history.

255
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Like the dragon you made me
not tell Director Sharpe about?

256
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,635
Exactly.

257
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,630
Uh...

258
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,759
No, the timeline's only showing
a few burps.

259
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,313
This is the only significant one.

260
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
What if there's a creature
that no one's noticed yet?

261
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,114
The only way people wouldn't notice
a monster is if it was hiding.

262
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,677
[Sara] Or if they were on drugs.

263
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,390
I'm gonna go check it out.

264
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,239
- Ooh, I'll come with.
- Nope.

265
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,996
But if you're going back to 1969,
you're gonna need...

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,196
Your Time Courier.

267
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,949
[sighs]

268
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,440
[Zari] Going somewhere, Raymond?

269
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,554
And don't give me any of that

270
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,393
"routine maintenance on the Jumpship"
crap.

271
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,394
Yeah, no, I wouldn't do that.

272
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,630
I had Gideon monitor the Time Bureau.

273
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,630
Someone over there pulled up
unusual activity at Woodstock, 1969.

274
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,040
You think it's Nora.

275
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,272
And if the Time Bureau
finds her first,

276
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,680
she's gonna tell them you're the one
who helped her escape.

277
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,080
Ray, I'm not gonna let you
get on that Jumpship.

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,071
- [stammers]
- Not without me.

279
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,115
[sighs] Oh, good.

280
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,274
I was not looking forward to dealing
with those hippies on my own.

281
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
What's a hippie?

282
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
[rock music playing]

283
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,360
[indistinct chatter]

284
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,757
- Give peace a chance.
- Oh!

285
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,309
Together, we can end
the war in Vietnam.

286
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,554
[chuckles] Hey!
Yeah, this place is groovy.

287
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,156
So, tell me.
Why would Nora time stone

288
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,436
to the least evil event in history?

289
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,520
Well, who knows? Maybe she's
turning over a new non-evil leaf.

290
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,595
- Inspired by yours truly.
- Right.

291
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,192
- All right.
- What is that?

292
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,756
Oh. It's my old trusty
Eagle Scout compass.

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,336
I thought we could
locate the epicenter

294
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,296
of the temporal disturbance
the old-fashioned way.

295
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,312
- That sounds like a blast, Ray.
- Yeah.

296
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,874
197, 198, 199...

297
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,233
[sighs] Sorry, Ray.
It looks like Nora's in the wind.

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,150
What is that?

299
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,073
[Zari] Uh, what is that?

300
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Ray...

301
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,076
It's beautiful.

302
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,911
It's like some
sort of magical pixie goo.

303
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,193
No, not that. That!

304
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,634
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

305
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,756
Why? Who would wanna kill
hippies at Woodstock?

306
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,073
Literally ripping
people's hearts out.

307
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,638
[Zari] Now that's the Nora I remember.

308
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,592
You certainly can eat
a lot of sandwiches, Mr. Rory.

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,639
Where did you get those big muscles?

310
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Prison.

311
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
[chuckles]

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,760
What a hoot. Isn't he a hoot, Henry?
[laughing]

313
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,434
He's a real barrel of laughs.

314
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,155
Excuse me.

315
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,191
So you just drop in on us
in the middle of the night

316
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,235
after barely a phone call
for the past two years?

317
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,313
I know, Dad. I'm sorry.
I've just been busy.

318
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,312
- Busy doing what?
- History stuff.

319
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
You know, the same stuff
you never took seriously.

320
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,117
Maybe that's because
deductive historical reconstruction

321
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,959
isn't an actual profession!

322
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,800
Should I have your mother
just grab her checkbook now,

324
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,216
or would you prefer your friend here

325
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,072
swipe it out of her purse
on the way out?

326
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,230
I'm easy either way.

327
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,551
- I don't want your money, Dad.
- Then why are you here?

328
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,996
- Honestly, I don't know.
- You don't... [scoffs]

329
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,596
We had a name for people like you
back in my day.

330
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,440
Oh, here comes the big rant
about hippies. Go ahead.

331
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,496
To tell the truth, I have nothing
but pity for those people.

332
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,556
Yeah, since when?

333
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,075
Since they were slaughtered
like lambs back in '69.

334
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,876
Look, I'm not saying the Woodstock
massacre was their fault,

335
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,952
but it wasn't not their fault either.

336
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,920
[clears throat]
Mom, thanks for the sandwiches!

337
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,640
There's something wrong with history.

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,151
Not Nora. Hi. [clears throat]

339
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,675
Not Nora. Not Nora.

340
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,999
Definitely not Nora.

341
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,356
Ray, I really don't need to hear
your inner dialogue.

342
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,632
Sorry. [stammering]
I'm nervous and upset.

343
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,639
I mean, how could she be
so heartless?

344
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,240
Pun not intended.

345
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,950
Well, her father did give her over
to a demon-loving cult, so...

346
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,554
- Nora Darhk is here?
- Sara?

347
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,376
Hey, what are you doing at Woodstock?

348
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,993
Probably the same thing as you are.

349
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,356
Looking for whatever's
messing with history.

350
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Huh.

351
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,914
I think I just saw Joan Baez
talking to Carlos Santana.

352
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,677
- Woodstock...
- ...turns into a massacre.

353
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,315
- Nate, you're here, too?
- Yeah, buddy.

354
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Hey.

355
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
[both grunt]

356
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Hey.

357
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,158
Okay. What is going on?

358
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,952
Woodstock is no longer remembered
as three days of peace and love,

359
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,997
but instead, the end of
the hippie movement.

360
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,834
Reports from survivors
are sketchy at best,

361
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,513
but what they all could agree upon

362
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,353
was there was a series
of grisly murders

363
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,070
that ultimately led to a deadly
stampede where 400,000 kids

364
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,719
tried to escape the festival at once.

365
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,598
Yeah, Ray and I just saw a body

366
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,115
in the woods with a gaping hole
in his chest.

367
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,715
- We think that Nora did it.
- Well, that's a relief.

368
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,917
- It is?
- Yeah, it means we're in the clear.

369
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,436
Look, it's not our fault
the Time Bureau let Nora escape.

370
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,233
[man] Guys, come check this out.

371
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't panic. I left Mick alone here.
He's itching to punch a hippie.

372
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,119
Ah... That's not good.

373
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,472
Is that what I think it is?

374
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,673
[Nate] Twilight Sparkle come to life...

375
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,314
[neighing]

376
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,635
Are you a brony?

377
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,360
Dude, we're brony-bros.

378
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,634
Mick, join the herd.

379
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,310
Outta my way.

380
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Hey, what are you doing?

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,913
Well, it's not a dragon
but it'll have to do.

382
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,510
No, Mick, hold on.
It's not like it's hurting anyone.

383
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
[whinnying]

384
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,189
[all gasping in awe]

385
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,556
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

386
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,757
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

387
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,119
[all exclaiming]

388
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
It's beautiful.

389
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,230
[neighing]

390
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,430
Oh, my God!

391
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,995
[Nate exclaiming]

392
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
What?

393
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,310
[people screaming]

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,680
Oh, my God. Is it...

395
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,229
Yup, it's eating her heart.
I'm gonna be sick.

396
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,830
[retching]

397
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,350
- Mick!
- Shoot it!

398
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,759
Damn horse is fireproof.

399
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,036
[all groaning]

400
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,516
[Mick groaning]

401
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I hate glitter.

402
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,199
- Seriously?
- Where'd it go?

403
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Okay, we can fix this

404
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,136
before the Time Bureau
even has to know about it.

405
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,310
Oh, really? Can we?

406
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,552
Look, Ava still thinks of me
as the woman

407
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,120
who saved the world last year and...

408
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,153
I don't want her to know there's
a whole new problem with history.

409
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,993
Yeah. That we basically created.

410
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,994
You go find the unicorn,

411
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,520
and I'll go find Constantine.

412
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,312
Yeah. Every time.

413
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,800
[knocking on door]

414
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,817
[Constantine] I'll be right back.
Somebody can't read the bloody signs.

415
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,036
Do you not know
there's a "do not disturb" sign

416
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,349
on the bloody door?

417
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Sara.

418
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,832
Yeah, uh...
I can't talk right now, love.

419
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,833
I've got a threesome
that's about to pop off in here

420
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,718
with some contortionists.

421
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
You were right.

422
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,076
Ah.

423
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,716
What was that now?

424
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,713
[sighs] You were right!

425
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,639
There's a magical creature
at Woodstock.

426
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,756
Now let's go.

427
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,514
You know, for someone with
a time-traveling machine,

428
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,478
you seem to be in an awful hurry.

429
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,950
John, the unicorn has already
gored two hippies.

430
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,356
Oh.

431
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,594
- A unicorn?
- Yeah.

432
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,680
Well, all right. I'm in.
But first, I need to know,

433
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,874
was any of your team
musked by the beast?

434
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,715
If that's what you're calling
its sparkle sauce,

435
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,029
then yeah. Why?

436
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,069
Oh, they're in for one hell of a ride.

437
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,078
[groans in disgust]

438
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,675
Man, I wish my dad could see us now

439
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,116
hunting a bloodthirsty creature
through Woodstock.

440
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,669
What's the beef between you
and your old man anyway?

441
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
- He hit you?
- No.

442
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,036
- Burn you?
- Nope.

443
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,070
He dress up like a clown
and scare the hell out of you?

444
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,590
What the hell, Mick? No.

445
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,960
He was emotionally unavailable
to me when I was growing up.

446
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,431
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

447
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
To the whole world,

448
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,315
my dad was this great
larger-than-life guy, but to me,

449
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,350
he was just cold.

450
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,229
[Mick] Boo-hoo!

451
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,635
- Hank?
- [Mick's voice] What?

452
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,069
I'm not your dad.

453
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,830
Oh.

454
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,316
So you're ashamed of me?

455
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,230
Pa, I'm sorry I didn't follow
in your footsteps and enlist.

456
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,560
But for your information,
I had a medal pinned to my chest.

457
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,552
Only you don't have
the clearance to see it.

458
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,832
- What's happening?
- What?

459
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,276
Axl?

460
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,430
[squeaking]

461
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,394
[Nate] I'm getting something off
my chest. And you know what, Hank?

462
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,550
It feels pretty good.

463
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,591
I just wish, for once,
you would tell me you're proud of me,

464
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,239
no matter what I do with my life.

465
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
You know what I'd say?

466
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
[squeaks] I love you.

467
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,789
I love you, too.

468
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,315
- Really?
- I thought you were dead.

469
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,197
I thought you were dead
on the inside.

470
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
[Nate chuckles]

471
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,553
Ray. Ray, my hand is glowing.

472
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
[gasps]

473
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,560
Can you see it?

474
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,478
No, it looks like your hand.

475
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,679
No, no, you gotta
open your eyes, man.

476
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,836
[gasps]

477
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,993
It's all around us.

478
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
What is?

479
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Love.

480
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Oh.

481
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,150
Those hippies had the right idea.

482
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,999
Woodstock is beautiful.

483
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,077
- What's wrong, Ray?
- What?

484
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
[gasps]

485
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,516
You were hoping to see Nora here.

486
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,350
- You like her, Ray Ray.
- No.

487
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,631
No, I do not like Nora.

488
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,554
Uh-huh. Because you love her.

489
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,199
No. No. The only reason
I ever wanna see Nora Darhk again

490
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,159
is so that I can take
the time stone back

491
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
and I can lock her up
in the Time Bureau.

492
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,520
Oh, my God. She's here!

493
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,314
[chiming]

494
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,953
You know,
a unicorn is no bloody joke.

495
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,680
You might wanna get your
ol' girlfriend on the blower.

496
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,430
[chuckles] You didn't tell
Director Sharpe

497
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,910
that you let all the monsters out
to play, did ya?

498
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,596
Ava and I are in a great place
right now. Better than great.

499
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,759
In fact, she asked me to move in
with her and I said yes.

500
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,318
So, why rock the boat
unless it's absolutely necessary?

501
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,073
Because when the boat
eventually tips,

502
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,958
- you'll both bloody drown.
- Nice.

503
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,376
I'm just trying to
look after you, love.

504
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,754
You and I are similar.

505
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,432
We're both survivors but our survival
comes at a terrible cost.

506
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Look...

507
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,376
You can take it from a man
who's caused nothing but misery

508
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,676
to everyone he's ever loved.
Trust me...

509
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,797
End it with Ava before it's too late.

510
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,277
You ever think that you cause misery
not because of some romantic

511
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,511
"I was born to walk alone" crap,

512
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,195
but because you're an ass
who doesn't know how to trust people?

513
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
You know, I trust,

514
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,998
the people around me get hurt,
killed, or far, far worse.

515
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,159
You think that I'm not scared?
That I don't know grief?

516
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,639
I'm not willing to turn my back
on life,

517
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,430
because that is exactly
what you're doing, John.

518
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,475
Our friends and family,
they don't make us weaker.

519
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,994
They make us stronger.

520
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,160
You know what you need?

521
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,596
You need to be a part of a team.

522
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,749
[chuckles softly]

523
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
You were saying...

524
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,749
This is King Solomon's
original grimoire.

525
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,877
The oldest magical textbook
in existence.

526
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,074
Now, if there is a spell to quell
our equine friend,

527
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,355
it'll be in here.

528
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,399
Well, not to pressure you,

529
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,598
but the entire fate of the sexual
revolution is in the balance here.

530
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,512
It is my favorite revolution.

531
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,990
John, welcome aboard.

532
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,480
Hey, Ray, big man.

533
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,633
Glad to see you're all back
from the land of milk and honey.

534
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,315
I'm still a little fuzzy on
how exactly we were...

535
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,635
Roofied by a horse.

536
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,838
That beast sprays a powerful
mind-altering hallucinogen

537
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,480
to disarm its prey. Ah!

538
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,993
"How to expel a magical creature
from the mortal realm."

539
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,671
Now, the ingredients from this spell
aren't so easy to come by.

540
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,389
Don't suppose any of you lot

541
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,433
have the saliva for
a nine-fingered man, now, do ya?

542
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,917
You could chop off one of my pinkies.

543
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,470
No, Ray. Don't be the giving tree.

544
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,910
Now, as every Dead Head knows,

545
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,875
Jerry Garcia was missing most
of his middle finger

546
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,111
on his right hand
from a wood-chopping accident.

547
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,072
Cool, so how do we get his saliva?

548
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,795
[psychedelic rock music playing]

549
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,755
Jerry! My man.

550
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,596
Can I get a hit of that?

551
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,311
This doobie will make you fly.

552
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,476
Cool.

553
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,879
- Spin move!
- Hey!

554
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Not cool.

555
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,279
We need the protection stone
of a powerful shaman.

556
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,040
[grunts]

557
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,041
Watch it.

558
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Brother.

559
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,955
And the lock of a doomed woman.

560
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,470
[panting]

561
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,234
Janis, this is quite an honor.

Little robot man.

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,871
Hi. My mom is a huge fan.

564
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040

[laughing]

566
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,471
And for our final ingredient...

567

[Constantine inhales deeply]

What?

570
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,830
A virgin.

571
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,074
[Ray] A virgin? At Woodstock?
Ha! Good luck with that.

572
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,958
This is
the least celibate place in history.

573
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,396
Are you serious?

574

[Zari] <i>Yeah, apparently,
virgins are like catnip to unicorns.</i>

575
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,080
And we need one to volunteer.

576
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,914
Rory, do you see any virgins
where you're at?

577
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
No.

578
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,989
Now, come to think of it...

579
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,314
I do know one virgin.

580
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,038
No. Not a chance.

581
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
This feels wrong.

582

Don't worry. We'll be watching from
a short distance and you'll be fine.

583
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,416
What am I supposed to do
with the pomegranate?

584
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,035
Oh, the unicorns, they can't get
enough of them, mate.

585
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,589
Yeah, that and human hearts.

586
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,391
So the pomegranate is the bait?

587
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,234
Yeah, we wouldn't put
an interim member of our team

588
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,470
in jeopardy, right, guys?

00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,315
I'm an interim Legend?

Well, then... [chuckles]

591
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,750
Uh, one more question.
Are you sure that I'm a virgin?

592
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,719
- 'Cause that thing we did...
- Positive, mate.

Admit it. This is fun.
Working with a team.

597

Well, if our Gary gets eaten alive,
it only goes to prove my point.

598
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,636
People who care about us die.

599

- What was that?
- Oh, nothing, mate.

You're golden. Carry on, yeah.

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,120
[screaming]

635
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,720
Gary, you okay?

636
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,836
Just a scratch.

637
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Where did the unicorn go?

638
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,555
Ah! Sent the bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

639
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,315
Yep, folks.

640
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,155
That is some
Grade A magic right there.

641
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,479
Maybe the Bureau will up our ratings.

642
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,160
People do love the supernatural.

643
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,909
Gary, you're like, really bleeding.

644
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
[yelps]

645
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,639
The unicorn bit my nipple off!

646
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,439
Oh. Hey, maybe Gideon can
make you a new one.

647
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,560
Oh, forget it, mate. Come on,
it's a badge of honor.

648
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,116
You see, my soul's heading
straight to hell,

649
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,874
but your nipple,
it just got there first, that's all.

650
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,675
It's like we're two birds
of the same dark feather.

651
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,233
Yeah, that's right, mate.

652
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,630
Come on.
Let's grab a beer, all right?

653
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,392
Now, about this whole
virgin situation...

654
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,509
[clears throat]

655
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,030
Nathaniel?

656
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,232
I assumed you would have left
town by now.

657
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,440
Yeah, I decided to stay
a couple of extra days.

658
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Yeah, let me guess.

659
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,117
You got fired from whatever
online college

660
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,600
you conned into hiring you.

661
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,871
Sweet burn, Hank, but, um,
[clears throat] I was just

662
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,311
wondering if you wanted
to have a beer with me.

663
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,675
We don't do that.

664
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,710
Maybe we should start.

665
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,558
Wow, you're looking a little
glum there, buddy.

666
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,400
Just thinking about all the musicians
who died after Woodstock.

667
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,152
Janis Joplin overdosed in 1970.

668
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,753
Sad and alone.

669
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,678
That's terrible but this is
obviously about Nora.

670
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,198
When I gave her the time stone,

671
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,320
our hands touched.

672
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,193
And I felt a spark.

673
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,800
Ray, Nora is...

674
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,196
Nora is like a unicorn.
Beautiful and dangerous.

675
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,357
She's going to eat you alive.

676
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,034
I guess she and I are doomed.

677
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,351
There's something I wanna show you.
Come on.

678
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Okay.

679
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,873
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

680
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,675
That's my mom.

681
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
And that's me.

682
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,395
[inaudible]

683
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,996
We lived in D.C. in 2018
before my brother was born.

684
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,880
It would be so easy, Ray.

685
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,319
To just walk over there
and tell her to get her family

686
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,074
and go to Canada
before everything changes.

687
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,630
[voice breaking] Before this country
that she worked so hard

688
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,871
to become a citizen of betrays her.

689
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,880
You'd be changing your future.

690
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,035
You'd never meet us,
never become a Legend.

691
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,896
Think of all the people you saved.

692
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,434
Yeah, I know. I know.

693
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,793
There's no loophole where I can save
my family and not screw up history,

694
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,480
but that doesn't mean
I don't feel guilty

695
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,519
every day that I have the power
to change everything and...

696
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,875
I do nothing.

697
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,120
I'm so sorry, Z.

698
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,760
Look at her, Ray.

699
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,593
How could anyone be afraid of her?

700
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
[door opens]

701
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,274
Hello.

702
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,354
Smells good in here.

703
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,155
Oh, yeah.
I, uh, burned the first chicken piccata,

704
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,960
but I think I got the second one
just right.

705
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,235
Are those our medals?

706
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,159
I wanted to remind you of
all the good you did last year.

707
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,231
Yeah, we, um...
We weren't that good.

708
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,719
Would you stop being so hard
on yourself, Sara? I'm proud of you.

709
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,916
[sighs]

710
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
When we freed Mallus,

711
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,240
we accidentally released
magical monsters into the world.

712
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,835
And I didn't wanna tell you
because I love the idea of us

713
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,576
living together
and I didn't wanna risk that

714
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,831
or you thinking that
maybe I wasn't such a screw-up.

715
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,394
- I know.
- You do?

716
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Mmm-hmm.

717
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,552
Gary was very proud
about losing a nipple.

718
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,312
- But you cooked dinner.
- Yeah.

719
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
[chuckles]

720
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,791
Because I love you, you goober,
and nothing is gonna change that.

721
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,056
Even after I went behind your back
to work with Constantine

722
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,120
to send a unicorn to hell?

723
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,992
Okay, yeah, I wasn't so crazy
about that part.

724
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,952
Let's not talk about Constantine.

725
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,557
I'm crazy about you. Come here.

726
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,234
Stop being neurotic.

727
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,275
I don't think that you're a screw-up.

728
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,552
I think that you are
a damn fine captain,

729
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,994
faced with some extraordinary
circumstances.

730
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,911
God, I love you.

731
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,553
And I got a question.

732
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,592
- Do we, you and I...
- Mmm-hmm.

733
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,036
...think that maybe right now

734
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,958
is not the best time
for me to move in?

735
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,496
You know that I want to.
Nothing would make me happier.

736
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,590
It's just...

737
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,800
I feel like I need to be out there
with my team.

738
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
I understand.

739
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,556
But can you promise me

740
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,837
that our relationship
will continue to evolve?

741
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,440
Please, I want this.

742
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,200
You and me. For real.

743
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
So do I.

744
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,240
We're gonna figure it out.

No.

749
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,039
I haven't even asked you
anything yet.

750
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,516
It's not even magic, love.
It's deduction.

751
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,992
You need me to join the Legends
despite knowing that

752
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,155
needing me always causes
somebody trouble.

753
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,476
What is up with you?

754
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,071
Something must've happened
in the last five months.

755
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,032
You're more miserable than usual.

You and I are friends.

759
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,436
And I like friends.
Friends are useful, but roommates...

760
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,392
See, Sara, I would rather bloody
top myself than move in with you lot.

761
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,074
See you around, John.
