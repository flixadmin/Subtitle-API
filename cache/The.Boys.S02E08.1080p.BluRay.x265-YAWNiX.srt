1
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,472
Okay, this is insane.

2
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:15,642
- We need more Compound V!
- Absolutely.

3
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,060
We need more Supes!

4
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:22,232
<i>More Supes! More Supes! More Supes!</i>

5
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:23,317
Come with me.

6
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:25,694
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,699
I'm sleeping in a basement
beneath a pawn shop in East Flatbush.

8
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,159
I never wanted that for you.

9
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:34,620
We have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

10
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:37,289
- I want us to be a family.
- They flew me up and showed me!

11
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,416
This house, the neighbours are fake.
You're fake.

12
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,335
No! Ryan!

13
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:43,503
You have five minutes
to make your opening...

14
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,937
There's a supervillain
on your school campus.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,855
You hear the calls of distress.

16
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,024
You witness a violent display
of superpowers.

17
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,192
What do you do?

18
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:06,860
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

19
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:09,947
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

20
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,449
On the first report
of an active supervillain,

21
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:14,785
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

22
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:20,082
But to stay alive in the moment,
remember, stay calm and follow the LAW.

23
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,043
Lock all doors and windows.

24
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:27,756
Arm yourselves.

25
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,467
Your teacher should have
an authorised firearm.

26
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,681
But use whatever you can.

27
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:40,185
And wait for a hero.

28
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:48,235
Unfortunately, the possibility that
you will experience a supervillain attack

29
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:49,778
grows more likely every day.

30
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,824
By having an action plan,
you can increase your chances of survival.

31
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,368
And survival is all that matters.

32
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:02,207
- <i>Coverage of the attack...</i>
- Jody! Where's my flag pin?

33
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,500
How should I know?

34
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,877
Well, I can't go to this thing
without a flag pin.

35
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:08,880
Bob, before he makes any decisions,
just let me talk to him.

36
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:13,176
One, the president doesn't like you,
he used the word "standoffish."

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,262
And two, he's decided.

38
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,640
He's declaring a national emergency,
bypassing the FDA,

39
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:22,686
and authorising Compound V for use
by law enforcement and first responders.

40
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,564
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I wish I were.

41
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,816
Doses are going for 5 million a pop.

42
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:31,445
Pentagon's got a big order in,
and ICE is next in line.

43
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:35,324
You can't release V into the mainstream,
we're talking an avalanche of Supes.

44
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,408
It's suicide.

45
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,286
In one hour,
I will be standing at the memorial service

46
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,956
for the fallen heroes of the House attack,
with my flag pin!

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,627
Giving my thoughts and prayers
and pledging to keep America safe.

48
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,088
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

49
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,840
We know. We there, remember?

50
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:55,927
Covered in my chief of staff's brains.
There was no terrorist, it was Vought.

51
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,971
It's a fucking coup.

52
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:01,141
- A bunch of their guys died too.
- To cover their own tracks.

53
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:06,605
For the record, I agree with you.
And I hate this.

54
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,940
But you've got no proof.

55
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:10,859
Folks are scared.

56
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:13,153
If Vought took a shit
in the middle of Fifth Avenue,

57
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,905
they'd throw a ticker tape parade.

58
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,991
- Here's what we do have, Bob...
- Oh, let me guess.

59
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:21,286
A tape of me fucking my kid's nanny
at her daughter's quinceañera?

60
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,414
Release it, please, I'm begging you.

61
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:28,001
A plumb gig at Fox
and this shithole in my rear-view?

62
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,085
Sounds dreamy.

63
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:32,214
Okay, what if we got hard proof?
A witness? Anything?

64
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,549
If you could get
Jesus Christ himself,

65
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,677
or maybe Homelander
in front of a camera, sure.

66
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,763
I really am sorry.

67
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,510
I'm nervous about driving
in the city.

68
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,595
You'll be okay. The plan again?

69
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:25,225
Okay, drive straight to Gen's in Sedona.
Cash for gasoline, no hotels.

70
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:29,604
- I don't wanna leave you here.
- I'll be fine.

71
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,653
The anxious boy? Really?
With the moist handshake?

72
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,197
- Mom! God.
- Okay. All right, okay.

73
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,281
Um.

74
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,075
You need a new one.

75
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,452
I...

76
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,706
I'm not gonna wear it.

77
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:51,501
I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

78
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,215
I love you.

79
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,009
I love you too.

80
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,138
You be safe.

81
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,514
- Okay.
- Bye.

82
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:09,477
Hey.

83
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,022
- What's going on?
- They've lost their minds.

84
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,567
The RPG releases
an electromagnetic pulse on impact.

85
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:18,195
Should cut through
Stormfront's plasma bolts.

86
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:20,238
- How sure are you?
- It's a guesstimate.

87
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:21,948
So that's Stormfront.

88
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,994
And thanks to Starlight, we know
that Noir needs any fucking tree nut.

89
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:27,078
How about A-Train?

90
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:29,581
Enough epinephrine
to blow up that motherfucker's heart.

91
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:33,543
- Hey, we can't just kill everyone.
- That is exactly what we're gonna do.

92
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,421
Listen, you heard Mallory,
she said all we need is another witness.

93
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,048
Wile E. Coyote.

94
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,092
Always chases Road Runner.

95
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,803
Always with an elaborate plan.
Always fails.

96
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:46,223
I always say, why do this, Coyote?

97
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:49,851
All you need is an AR-15
and "meep-meep," no more.

98
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,813
Exactly. See? We're just gonna shoot
Road Runner in the fucking head.

99
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:57,108
That won't stop Vought.
That won't stop Compound V.

100
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,903
If you kill these Supes,
Vought will just make a thousand more.

101
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,489
I'm gonna top those cunts too.

102
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:03,698
Great. So that's settled.

103
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:07,619
- We're just supervillains now, huh?
- Vought attacked the country, Hughie.

104
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:08,912
Fuck them all.

105
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,124
What if I testify?

106
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,710
Escaped convicts
don't have a ton of credibility.

107
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,507
No, but maybe I know someone who does.

108
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,343
Give us the day.

109
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:25,554
Hughie.

110
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,139
See you later.

111
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,811
<i>...officials are still trying to determine
the perpetrator of the Capitol attack.</i>

112
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:37,440
<i>The Department of Homeland Security
has issued a crimson terror alert.</i>

113
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,901
<i>In Washington, all government buildings...</i>

114
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,529
- How's Noir?
- Unresponsive.

115
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:46,449
They don't think there's brain damage,
but it's hard to tell.

116
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,786
Noir's a vegetable.
Lamplighter's a charcoal briquette.

117
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,872
Starlight's in the breeze somewhere.
And you're, what, fine with it?

118
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:56,334
Yes, because none of that matters anymore.
Because of this.

119
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,713
<i>So far, no terrorist group
has claimed responsibility...</i>

120
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:04,009
- All right. So, you didn't do this.
- I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

121
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,928
- But, no, it wasn't me.
- Right.

122
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,806
And there's no supervillains
on American soil.

123
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,309
- None that we know of.
- Then that means...

124
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:15,854
It's Edgar.

125
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:20,025
Maybe. I mean, he is pretty smart,
especially for his kind.

126
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,278
<i>...Compound V to members of the military
and law enforcement...</i>

127
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:27,282
Hey, smile. This is good news.

128
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,285
Yes, there have been sacrifices,

129
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:35,165
but we are this close
to no more premieres or paparazzi.

130
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,668
Or screaming fans
or any of that dancing-monkey shit.

131
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,088
We have to make sure that
the right people get the doses,

132
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,132
but it is a whole new world.

133
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,302
What about the wrong people?

134
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,930
Couple of billion of them,
they're not just gonna sit there.

135
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,977
Don't worry, silly.
Frederick had a solution for everything.

136
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:06,613
Okay. There's something really important
that I've been meaning to ask you.

137
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,367
Last I checked, you're not 57 years old.

138
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,246
So, come on,
why is it always, always Billy Joel?

139
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,750
- I'm 57 on the inside.
- No, really. Please.

140
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,921
It was just the music
in my house growing up.

141
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,256
I did some somersaults
to "You May Be Right"

142
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,509
that were pretty thrilling to watch.

143
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:32,722
<i>♪ Only the good die young
That's what I'm saying... ♪</i>

144
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:35,141
Butcher is right, you know.

145
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,478
We've already tried
to take Vought down the right way.

146
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:39,729
This isn't gonna work.

147
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:42,607
This is not gonna stop Compound V
from getting out there.

148
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:46,903
So it's hopeless?
Just kill them all, let God sort them out?

149
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:47,986
I mean...

150
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,701
Then why are you even helping me?

151
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,413
Why did you save me at the Tower?

152
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,415
They were gonna hurt you.

153
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,667
You could've gotten yourself killed.

154
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,839
I mean, after the way that I treated you,
you had every reason to give up on me.

155
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,382
So why didn't you?

156
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,930
I just... would never.

157
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,684
That's why I'm helping.

158
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,906
You were stupid to text.

159
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,702
Everyone's looking for you.

160
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:37,871
Where's Elena?

161
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,999
This is the guy?

162
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,168
Um...

163
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:46,671
I'm... Hi. Hughie.

164
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,008
He's even more of a twink
than in the photo.

165
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,970
I could split that shit like dry firewood.

166
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:56,597
Big fan.

167
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,808
I need to ask you something.

168
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,394
It's a lot.

169
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:06,441
- I need you to testify.
- Testify?

170
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:07,859
On the record.

171
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,198
Against Vought, against Homelander,
Stormfront, everything.

172
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:19,120
- And why would I do that?
- Because things are really bad, and...

173
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:22,332
you're our last chance.

174
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:23,458
Pass.

175
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,878
- Look, I get that it's dangerous.
- It's suicide.

176
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,131
- But that's not the reason.
- Well, then what is?

177
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,842
I'm tired.

178
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:38,056
We're all tired,
but they're hurting people.

179
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:40,725
Sooner or later,
they'll hurt someone you love.

180
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:41,809
Am I talking to you?

181
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,687
Look...

182
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:55,107
I get that it's easier
to just disappear inside of yourself.

183
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,242
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

184
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,035
But we can't, Maeve.

185
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,496
We can't.

186
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,792
- This is a war now, and we...
- Shut the fuck up.

187
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,418
Christ, you...

188
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,838
Haven't I done enough for you?

189
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:16,219
Didn't I save your fucking life?

190
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,267
It doesn't matter what we do.
Nothing changes.

191
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:31,442
Nothing ever changes or gets better.

192
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:37,740
And I'm tired.

193
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,828
Just leave.

194
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Go!

195
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:48,585
Take your fucking twink
and get the fuck out of here!

196
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,712
Okay.

197
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,006
Come on.

198
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:11,274
Monsieur Charcuterie, we need you. Now.

199
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:16,946
He said he lives under a pawn shop
in East Flatbush!

200
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,824
- He has to be here! Help me.
- Let her in.

201
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,203
Billy. They took him.

202
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,873
- They have Ryan.
- Who's got him?

203
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,838
I appreciate you
coming all this way, Stan.

204
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:39,093
Well, I can't exactly be seen
with you at the Tower now, can I?

205
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,931
- Fresca?
- No, thank you. Awful stuff.

206
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:48,311
So you had a chance
to look over our proposal?

207
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,397
He publicly confessed
to a sexual assault, Alastair.

208
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,692
And we've made a substantial investment
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

209
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:58,738
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

210
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:03,076
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

211
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,829
Oh, what sort of commission
is the church getting these days?

212
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,706
Forty percent? 50?

213
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,377
Sounds like you're open to reinstatement.
That's fantastic.

214
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,880
What about A-Train?

215
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,508
You do need a speedster
since Shockwave exploded.

216
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:23,096
Harder sell.
One has-been back is redemption.

217
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,889
Two is weakness.

218
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,058
Stormfront has problems with him.

219
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,644
And at the moment, I have to indulge her.

220
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,689
What's her problem with A-Train?

221
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,902
I understand that she was among
your grandfather's first followers,

222
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:40,405
back when the Collective was a start-up.

223
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:44,450
I can neither confirm or deny that.

224
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,999
Then your internal research bureau
knows exactly

225
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:53,584
what Stormfront's problem is with A-Train.

226
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,921
Deep is still a win.

227
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:00,133
- Shall I have Business Affairs reach out?
- Please do.

228
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:01,509
Let me walk you out.

229
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:16,315
Sons of bitches.

230
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:19,736
Okay, yeah.

231
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,613
Voilà.

232
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,617
Jambon buerre. Simple,
but it's the ingredients, you know?

233
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,412
- Thank you.
- Diet Coke with lime, right?

234
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,331
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:33,708
We've heard a lot about you.

236
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:40,298
I'm sorry, I wish I could say the same.

237
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:44,260
- Are you all close with Billy?
- Yeah.

238
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,263
I mean, sure.

239
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,016
- Why the hesitation?
- Well...

240
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,937
let's just say he ain't really close
to a lot of people. You know?

241
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:58,149
- Well, except you, of course.
- I'm close to him.

242
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,941
I am.

243
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:03,279
- All right, lads, give her some air, eh?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,158
So Ryan ain't on
any of their social media.

245
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,660
Which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

246
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,788
- So you think he's in the Tower?
- Not sure.

247
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:17,085
You stay here. Rest up.
I'm gonna go do a little digging.

248
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,670
Hey, Billy.

249
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,511
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask you
to help me after what I said to you.

250
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,764
Look, don't you worry, all right?

251
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:32,141
I will find your son.

252
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,523
Thank you.

253
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,030
Fuck off, you lot.

254
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,538
What is it, Samantha?

255
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,791
<i>Mr. Edgar,
normally I wouldn't put this through,</i>

256
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,335
<i>but the man says it's life or death,
and you know him.</i>

257
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,963
- What's his name?
<i>- William Butcher.</i>

258
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,842
Hi, hi!

259
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:08,302
We've been having
a super fun time in here.

260
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,555
I've been googling
the names of the cats in <i>Cats.</i>

261
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:14,100
- Can you believe Ryan has never seen <i>Cats?</i>
- What happened to your hair?

262
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,185
- Nothing.
- Hey, buddy.

263
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:21,399
Sorry we had to leave you all alone.
Dad's work can sometimes get pretty crazy.

264
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:24,986
He hasn't been alone. I've been here.
I got him all these dipping sauces.

265
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,155
You didn't wanna play
<i>Vought Tournament of Heroes?</i>

266
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:31,742
- I'm the main guy.
- I was working on my states.

267
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:32,784
States?

268
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:35,913
Yeah, I write down all 50 states
as fast as I can

269
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,958
in either alphabetical order
or geographical order.

270
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:43,713
- You're giving yourself homework?
- Mom says that learning is a gift, so...

271
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,006
Mm. Mm.

272
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,927
That mom of yours, she sure does
have some cute little sayings.

273
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,515
Do you think maybe I could call her?

274
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,815
Hey, Ryan.

275
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,028
I get it.

276
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,114
I would feel lonely too,
if I was cooped up all day by myself

277
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,742
in this West Elm Death Star.

278
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:15,118
Mm-hm.

279
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,372
How about we take a field trip?

280
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,416
What do you say, Dad?

281
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:25,046
<i>Welcome to Planet Vought.</i>

282
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,006
<i>Have a super day.</i>

283
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,471
<i>Let's give a warm hero's welcome
to Cashket who's turning five today.</i>

284
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,639
Welcome to Planet Vought.

285
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,642
Would you like to try our new
Brave Maeve Rainbow Veggie Burger?

286
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,311
Holy shit!

287
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,817
Here you go, maestro.

288
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,073
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

289
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:57,078
Hey, wait until you try
the Big Homey with bacon.

290
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:01,290
It's so good. And, uh...
And the Mocha Noir Shake?

291
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:04,252
It's amazing.
It won't be lumpy like your mom's.

292
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,255
- Homelander?
- Hey.

293
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:10,424
- Can I get a selfie?
- Ask the boss.

294
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,220
Kidding. Of course you can.

295
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,222
Stormfront, I love you.
Can I get a selfie?

296
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,307
Oh, sure. One at a time.

297
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,810
- Homelander! I'm a huge fan.
- Kids first.

298
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,311
Can I get a picture?

299
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:24,146
- All right.
- Homelander!

300
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:26,273
Hey.

301
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,369
Hey. You okay?

302
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,787
I want my mom.

303
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,832
Okay, I got you. I got you.

304
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:49,213
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

305
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:52,174
Stay back, please.
Please, please, please. Just stay back.

306
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:54,010
Stay back. Thank you.

307
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,599
- New bling?
- Mm-hm.

308
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,268
Donna got it for me.

309
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,313
I'm pretty sure she got it at Duane Reade.

310
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:14,280
Oh, gosh, moms.
The gift that keeps on giving. Forever.

311
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,409
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

312
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,953
Oh, no, it's fine.

313
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:24,832
No. No. I'm an asshole for bitching
about my mom when yours is...

314
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,045
My mom's not dead.

315
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:33,090
She's not? Oh, it's just
you never mentioned her, so...

316
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,259
She left when I was six.

317
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,845
Oh, wow, shit.

318
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,556
I'm really sorry.

319
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,435
That's where Billy Joel comes from.

320
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,939
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

321
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,441
She was fun.

322
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,111
She made awesome
Seven costumes for Halloween.

323
00:19:55,363 --> 00:20:00,576
And then one day,
she just left and never called again.

324
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,869
Not even a card.

325
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:06,207
You know, it was like some
silent alarm went off and she was, like,

326
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,127
"Well, fuck them, time to go."

327
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,130
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

328
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,632
What would you call it?

329
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,764
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

330
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,391
no matter how bad it gets.

331
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,021
'Cause I don't want to be like her.

332
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:35,611
That's kind of clingy and pathetic,
isn't it?

333
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,906
No. No. It isn't.

334
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,990
At all.

335
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:44,661
What's up, shitbirds?

336
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,002
What the fuck? What the fuck?

337
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,171
- How did you find us?
- Please.

338
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,133
I can cover the boroughs in three hours.
I went looking, that's all.

339
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:00,219
- I'm surprised your heart can take it.
- My heart is just fine.

340
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,848
- Take a step closer and I'll show you.
- Hey, I saved your life, asshole.

341
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,349
Now you're coming after us?

342
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,273
We're even now, bitch.

343
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,863
Holy shit!

344
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,488
Is this true?

345
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,491
Everything makes more sense now,
doesn't it?

346
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:26,245
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't get it, okay? I was never here.

347
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,913
You got that shit on your own. Yeah?

348
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,707
But why are you doing this?

349
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,544
'Cause I want back in, so I need her gone.

350
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,754
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

351
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,452
Would you ask Mario if he could whip up
some of those Gruyère puffs?

352
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,580
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

353
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:14,084
I assume you got a man out there,
with a clean shot?

354
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,586
More than one.

355
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,214
Then I'll skip the fucking hors d'oeuvres,
if you don't mind,

356
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,007
and we'll just cut straight to it, yeah?

357
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,969
You mentioned on the phone
that you could help with Homelander's son.

358
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,264
I must say, I'm not sure what you mean.

359
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,560
That boy is your only possible
contingency against Homelander.

360
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,983
Now, that contingency don't work
if they're off playing Ward and the Beav.

361
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:40,485
I can fix that.

362
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:45,741
Thank you, Alvin.

363
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,829
Homelander's a friend.
Why would I betray him?

364
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,541
Because you're a ruthless bastard.

365
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:57,585
That's hurtful.

366
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,048
You turned a racist piece of shite
into America's sweetheart.

367
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,925
Now, what word would you use?

368
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,228
Stormfront's good at making people angry.

369
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:19,483
Angry people want Compound V.
Compound V raises our stock price.

370
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:24,822
I'd have preferred V remained a secret,
but we play with the cards we're dealt.

371
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:29,326
It's not ruthless, it's prices per share.
That's all.

372
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:33,038
Maybe you should
take a look in the mirror, mate.

373
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:35,082
'Cause that bitch should bother you.

374
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,044
Of course she does, but it's not about me.

375
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:45,509
I can't lash out
like some raging, entitled maniac.

376
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:48,345
That's a white man's luxury.

377
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,267
So it's just business then, eh?

378
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,606
When, Mr. Butcher, in history
has it ever been about anything different?

379
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,362
And what makes you think
that you can control that racist bitch?

380
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,033
Look, I've got to get across town...

381
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,910
I can get the boy away from Homelander,
all right?

382
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:12,994
How?

383
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:15,414
That's my business.

384
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,878
When I got him, I'll call your people,

385
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,548
they zero in on this cell signal,
and come and scoop him up.

386
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:28,385
And then you do a better fucking job
hiding him this time, yeah?

387
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,513
You have my word.

388
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,391
I will get Rebecca and Ryan
somewhere safe.

389
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:37,811
No. Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

390
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:42,149
But that's the whole point,
that he's raised by his mother.

391
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,319
Find him a new fucking mum.
I'm taking my wife back.

392
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,695
That's the deal.

393
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,990
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up at my doorstep,

394
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,826
begging to be reunited with her boy?

395
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,750
You say it's the only way
you can guarantee

396
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,335
Ryan's protection from Homelander.

397
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,295
'Cause as you know,

398
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,385
a mother will do anything
to protect her son.

399
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,889
And you call me a ruthless bastard.

400
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,683
You tell me where he is...

401
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,269
and I'll do the rest.

402
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,538
- Where's Ryan?
- He's inside.

403
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,624
- He doesn't want to talk.
- So go in, anyway.

404
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:44,044
No, no, no. I've tried.
He wants to be left alone.

405
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:48,507
You are the strongest man in the world,
and you're scared of a little boy.

406
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,384
He's your blood.

407
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,302
Just talk to him.

408
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,556
Be the man I know you are.

409
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:01,937
New York. North Carolina.
North Dakota.

410
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:06,734
Ohio. Oklahoma. Oregon.

411
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,406
I'm sorry.

412
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:17,411
No, no, no. Buddy, don't you be sorry.
I should've known better.

413
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,836
There were just so many people.

414
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,296
Yeah, there was.

415
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,768
You know, I remember
the first time I was in a crowd.

416
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,352
Probably didn't bother you.

417
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,188
I was terrified.

418
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:48,984
All these people staring at me
and reaching out, trying to grab me,

419
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,736
and egging me on to use my powers.

420
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,989
I just... I felt like I was drowning.

421
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,700
Well, what did you do?

422
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:59,912
Well, I took off.

423
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,333
I flew away.

424
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:08,545
They found me 80 miles down the I-9,
crying my little eyes out.

425
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,218
You cry?

426
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,098
Yes.

427
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:27,147
But I'm a man, so not in a long while.

428
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:30,275
But who knows? Maybe, uh...

429
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,779
maybe next time, you'll fly away.

430
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,615
Maybe with me?

431
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:45,290
Look, I know you want me to be like you,

432
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,959
but, Dad, I'm not.

433
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:52,965
Son...

434
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:58,720
I didn't just wake up one day
and fly out the door.

435
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,598
That's not how it works. I had to learn.

436
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,979
Only I didn't have anyone to teach me
'cause the doctors that, um...

437
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:12,860
The people that raised me,
uh, were scared of me,

438
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,444
so they kept their distance.

439
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:18,115
And I had to figure it all out
by myself, see?

440
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,868
Well, you don't have to
go through any of that.

441
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,870
I'll teach you.

442
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:24,745
Really?

443
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,875
I love you.

444
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,023
Hey, did you find anything?

445
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,192
They got him in a cabin up in Rochester.

446
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,736
- What?
- I mean...

447
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,322
Becca. She's great.

448
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:02,784
We talked earlier, and she's really great.
You're really... You're great.

449
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,119
Easy, tiger.

450
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,038
How'd you get on?
I guess you got fuck all?

451
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,249
No witnesses.
But we definitely found fuck all.

452
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm not sure
I'm using that term properly, but...

453
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Here.

454
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,089
Fuck me.

455
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,968
This is a jackpot.

456
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:21,762
Well done, you two.

457
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,890
This'll do nicely.

458
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,516
All right, listen up, you lot.

459
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,312
Getting the kid back ain't your fight.
I ain't gonna ask you to come along.

460
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,857
Lick my big Black balls, Butcher.
Sorry, Becca.

461
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:39,071
You done asked us to lie, spy,
do all kinds of fucked up shit for you.

462
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,531
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

463
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,367
and you think we'll take a pass on that?

464
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,493
We're in.

465
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,537
Of course we're in.

466
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,499
All right.

467
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,542
Let's get a shift on.

468
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:26,284
What?
You remember the range at Fort Bragg?

469
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,620
I was a better shot than you.

470
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:31,873
Well, you had a bloody good teacher,
didn't you?

471
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,502
I like your friends. Especially Hughie.

472
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,213
He's, uh... He's good for you.

473
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,801
Look, Becca, you ain't coming with us.

474
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,971
No, bullshit. Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

475
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,098
It's too dangerous,
I ain't gonna lose you again.

476
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,017
He's my son and I'm coming.

477
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,446
I need you to promise me something.

478
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,324
I need you to promise me
that you will save him no matter what

479
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,868
and you will get him back to me.

480
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:13,498
- Yeah. Of course.
- You realise this isn't just about me.

481
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,751
He can't grow up like Homelander.

482
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,046
You have to think of all of the people
out there that he would...

483
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,176
Swear to me, then.

484
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,929
Swear to me on your brother's soul.

485
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,811
I swear to you.

486
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,981
I swear to you on Lenny's soul.

487
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,779
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

488
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,355
I can use your help loading the car.

489
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:28,073
What if it happens again?

490
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,451
When I see Stormfront...

491
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:32,535
Stormfront...

492
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,122
...what if I freeze?

493
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,167
"Freeze," yes?

494
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,586
Sorry, I'm still learning.

495
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:44,672
Look...

496
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,679
If there's one thing I know,

497
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,140
it's that you can take care of yourself.

498
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,768
So when the time comes...

499
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:00,313
you'll know what to do.

500
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,361
Let's go.

501
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,869
Keep going. You got it.

502
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,162
That's it, don't give up.

503
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,747
That's it, that's it. Keep going.

504
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,209
Little more, little more, you got it.

505
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,009
Hey, that's okay.
You'll get it, you'll get it.

506
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,092
Um...

507
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,515
I know what. Imagine...

508
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:40,103
Well, sometimes, it helps
to imagine someone you hate. Okay?

509
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,855
So try that.

510
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:47,444
But at home, when I say "hate,"
I have to put a quarter in the swear jar.

511
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,947
Well, there's no swear jar here,
so you can hate away.

512
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,658
But I don't really hate anyone.

513
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:58,038
Well, that is very sweet, Ryan.

514
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,124
But it's not something we can afford.

515
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,959
We're under attack.

516
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,043
We are?

517
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:08,215
Bad guys want to hurt us
just because of what we look like.

518
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:13,386
They want to wipe us from this Earth
just because of the colour of our skin.

519
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:16,972
Really?

520
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:19,809
It's called White Genocide.

521
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:24,481
We're gonna need people like you
to protect our kind.

522
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,733
Hm.

523
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,443
All right. So let's try again.

524
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,904
Go for it. Imagine...

525
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,656
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

526
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:34,491
What?

527
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,117
What?

528
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:49,047
Are you sure this'll work?

529
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,507
Don't worry, it will work.

530
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,969
This is nothing compared
to the raves I used to set up in Algiers.

531
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,804
Do you dance?

532
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,097
Of course I dance.

533
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,974
What is the point of life without dancing?

534
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,104
She's on the move.

535
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,654
I see her, Frenchie.
We gotta go now. You close?

536
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:13,737
<i>One moment, mon ami.</i>

537
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:17,034
- Holy shit. It just broke.
<i>- News from Vought Tower,</i>

538
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:21,037
<i>concerning Stormfront
and alleged Nazi ties.</i>

539
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,623
<i>Stormfront may be 100 years old.</i>

540
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,375
<i>What's even more incredible,</i>

541
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:30,088
<i>we have authenticated photos
showing Stormfront with Nazi High Command,</i>

542
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,465
<i>including Goebbels and Göring.</i>

543
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:37,345
<i>Based on the photos, it is now believed
that she was the wife of Frederick Vought,</i>

544
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,473
<i>who was, of course,
the founder of Vought International.</i>

545
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:44,519
<i>Already, an intense international outcry
has emerged under...</i>

546
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,564
<i>I can't believe I actually
have to say this, this day and age,</i>

547
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,107
<i>but Nazis are bad.</i>

548
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,741
It's catchy.

549
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:02,996
- You ready?
<i>- Oui.</i>

550
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,053
<i>But the question now is,</i>

551
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:21,264
<i>how can we possibly
let Vought release Compound V</i>

552
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,309
<i>in light of this
unprecedented malfeasance?</i>

553
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:27,395
- What's malfeasance?
<i>- A Nazi in Seven Tower?</i>

554
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,564
<i>- Was she part of the attack?</i>
- It's a... Never mind.

555
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,610
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

556
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,736
Stay here.

557
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,785
Now!

558
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,470
Ryan! Hey!

559
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,138
Hey. Hey.

560
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,890
Hey, bud. Hey.

561
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,058
- Mom?
- It's me.

562
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,352
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- Come here.

563
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,479
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean anything I said.

564
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:13,108
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of it.
- It's okay.

565
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:14,943
- Got to go.
- I love you so much.

566
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,196
You're okay.
We're gonna go, okay? Come on.

567
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,364
Who's that?

568
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,910
That's my husband.

569
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,121
It's all right. Come on.

570
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,540
I got you.

571
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,167
Come on, to the car. This way.

572
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:51,938
What the fuck?

573
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:56,359
What the hell are they doing back?

574
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,154
Butcher, this wasn't the plan.

575
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,072
What's going on?

576
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,156
What's wrong?

577
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,325
Take my car.

578
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,286
Get them both to Mallory.
Get them both safe.

579
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,997
- No, no, that's not part of the plan.
- The plan just changed.

580
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,082
M.M., you're the only one
I trust with her.

581
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,126
Hey. What's happening? No.

582
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,545
M.M.'s gonna take you
to a woman with the CIA.

583
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,255
What? No, you have to come with us.

584
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,674
I cut a deal with Stan Edgar.

585
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,344
What?

586
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:27,599
I cut a deal that when I got Ryan,
that I would call Vought.

587
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:31,144
They were gonna come and take him away,
and you'd never fucking see him again.

588
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:34,814
What?

589
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:38,651
But, fuck me, I couldn't do it.

590
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:45,992
Bedroom's clear.

591
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,161
- Kitchen's clear.
- All rooms secure.

592
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,079
Butcher? You here?

593
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:04,344
Did I hear you say "Butcher"?

594
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:09,224
- What's going on?
<i>- Do you have the boy?</i>

595
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:27,575
Where is my son?

596
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,374
Where is my son?!

597
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,835
I'm not leaving here without you,
I don't care.

598
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,504
I was gonna sell you out.

599
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,589
I fucking well might do it again.

600
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,967
You didn't, though.
You didn't and you won't.

601
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,511
You can't have a cunt like me
around that kid.

602
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:48,304
I don't wanna pass my shit on to him.

603
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,390
Don't say that. You have to come with us.

604
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,766
You raise him right.

605
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,185
Raise him right,
and I'll make sure they never find you.

606
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,021
Don't you say that! Stop it.
Stop, you have to come with us.

607
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,648
Becca, we are out of time.

608
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,025
Please...

609
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,320
you gotta let me do this.

610
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,365
You got to let me
do this one fucking thing.

611
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,012
Becca!

612
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:22,774
There you are, you slippery little bitch.

613
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:25,693
I'm assuming it's you
who sent all those lies to the press.

614
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:26,986
They're not lies.

615
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:31,407
The pictures are clearly deepfakes,
and you're a lying slut.

616
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,915
Here we go, yeah?

617
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,504
People love
what I have to say.

618
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,047
They believe in it.

619
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:49,926
They just don't like the word "Nazi,"
that's all.

620
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:51,928
Are you all right?

621
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,889
- You all right? Yeah?
- Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.

622
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:56,557
Ryan! Ryan!

623
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,226
Ryan? Come here.

624
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,314
Are you okay?

625
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,274
Go! We'll hold her off.

626
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:07,025
You're okay.

627
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,407
What about the truth?

628
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:14,408
What truth?

629
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,203
What is the truth?

630
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,471
And what are you laughing at?

631
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,356
She says the truth is,

632
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,651
she's gonna stick her boot
up your Nazi kitty.

633
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:05,918
- Annie!
- Come on, the RPG!

634
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,713
It's in the car! It's our only chance!

635
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:04,519

00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:42,974
Die, you bitch!

645
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:44,642
Girls do get it done.

646
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:48,479
Fucking bitch!

647
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,620
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

648
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:37,569
Come here, Ryan.

649
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:38,738
Not on your life.

650
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:45,912
You're not like her, Ryan.
You belong with us.

651
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,914
Stay the fuck away from my son.

652
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:49,165
We love you, Ryan.

653
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:56,339
You fucking bitch.

654
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,508
Stop! Stop it!

655
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:01,886
Stop, please! Stop it!

656
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:04,597
Stop, you're hurting her! Just let her go!

657
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,142
Stop, you're hurting her! Just let her go!

658
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:10,644
Let her go!

659
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:12,647
Stop!

660
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,398
Look at me.

661
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:16,776
I like to see the light go out.

662
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:17,859
Stop!

663
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,037
I'm sorry.

664
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,664
I'm sorry, Mom.

665
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,212
No. No.

666
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:21,298
No. No, no.

667
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:23,884
- Hold on.
- Please.

668
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:25,969
Mom, I'm sorry.

669
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:28,097
Help us!

670
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,517
Somebody help us!

671
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:37,440
It's not his fault.

672
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:39,525
It's not his fault.

673
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,360
You make sure he knows that.

674
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,028
Yeah?

675
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:46,282
He's good. He's good.

676
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:50,661
He's good.

677
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:56,876
You promise me you keep him safe.

678
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:38,709
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

679
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,135
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

680
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,219
Mommy.

681
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,846
Mom...

682
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:52,932
Mom, please.

683
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:10,574
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

684
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,359
Ryan?

685
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:49,445
Did you do this?

686
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:52,449
I didn't mean to.

687
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:57,830
Let's go.

688
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:05,545
Come here.

689
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:12,844
Come.

690
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:16,890
Ryan.

691
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:19,434
Ryan.

692
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,060
Come here.

693
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:32,155
No.

694
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:48,088
He's mine.

695
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:52,927
What, are you gonna blow yourself up...

696
00:50:54,595 --> 00:50:57,640
to save the little shit
who fucking murdered your wife?

697
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:04,396
I promised.

698
00:51:06,315 --> 00:51:07,650
Have it your way.

699
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:08,733
Stop.

700
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:15,199
What are you doing here?

701
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:20,829
You're gonna let them go.

702
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:24,625
And if I don't?

703
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,296
<i>- Please!
- Don't die with them.</i>

704
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:31,548
Let them go.

705
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,843
You're gonna stop hunting Starlight.

706
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:38,013
You're gonna leave me and Elena alone.

707
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:39,265
<i>Take my daughter!</i>

708
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:40,933
Or I release this.

709
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:43,894
If you do that...

710
00:51:47,398 --> 00:51:50,693
I'll destroy everything and everyone.

711
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:56,031
Great, as long as everyone sees
what a fucking monster you are.

712
00:51:58,075 --> 00:52:01,996
As long as no one ever loves you again.

713
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,172
<i>Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!</i>

714
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:16,176
<i>Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!</i>

715
00:52:58,052 --> 00:53:00,679
We believe that Stormfront

716
00:53:00,763 --> 00:53:03,390
was the sole perpetrator
of the attack on Washington.

717
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:06,769
In the light of Stormfront's atrocities,

718
00:53:06,852 --> 00:53:11,482
the release of Compound V
has been placed on indefinite hold.

719
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:14,025
Homelander.

720
00:53:14,026 --> 00:53:15,944
Mr. Edgar, a follow-up question.

721
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:18,447
Are there any more
Compound V terrorists out there?

722
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:23,827
Thanks to the heroism
of Queen Maeve and Starlight,

723
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:26,121
Stormfront has been neutralised

724
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:29,291
and is being held
in an undisclosed location.

725
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:32,878
I would personally like
to apologise to Starlight,

726
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:36,757
who was wrongfully accused
of sabotage and conspiracy.

727
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,342
Welcome back to the team.

728
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:42,930
And I know that you and Maeve
are two of the best,

729
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:45,140
most loyal friends that I could ever have.

730
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,769
We are your heroes.

731
00:53:48,852 --> 00:53:51,355
We are here to serve and protect you.

732
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:55,484
Stormfront's violation
of that special relationship,

733
00:53:56,026 --> 00:53:59,279
of that trust, is unacceptable.

734
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,532
And she will be punished.

735
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,660
Justice will be served...

736
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:17,673
<i>Justice will be served.
She will be punished.</i>

737
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:23,720
<i>As the leader of The Seven,
I give you my word, no one will ever...</i>

738
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:29,268
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

739
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:31,061
Always happy to see you, sir.

740
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,274
I'm afraid we had an incident
at the Archives.

741
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:38,402
Someone broke in
and stole PDR on Stormfront.

742
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:41,362
PDR?

743
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:42,949
Private data reserve.

744
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:45,492
No one saw the thief come or go.

745
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:49,371
Isn't that right... A-Train?

746
00:54:51,457 --> 00:54:52,916
That was you? Dude!

747
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,295
I didn't know, sir. Fuck him.
I would never go behind your back.

748
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:58,630
Please, just let me explain.

749
00:54:58,714 --> 00:55:00,507
I think it showed initiative.

750
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,343
Stormfront's been critical of the church,

751
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:07,306
and Vought needs to take
a firm anti-Nazi stance right now.

752
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:08,389
Wait.

753
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:09,558
Does that mean...?

754
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:11,351
I just spoke to Stan Edgar.

755
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:12,894
You're back in.

756
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,897
- Fuck, yeah!
- What? Yeah!

757
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,232
Yeah! A-Train is back, baby!

758
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:18,942
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

759
00:55:19,443 --> 00:55:20,443
All right.

760
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:22,529
- Finally.
- Yeah.

761
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:25,407
I'm back too, right? Right?

762
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:26,449
I'm anti-Nazi.

763
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,244
I'm sorry, Deep,
but they only had one slot.

764
00:55:30,287 --> 00:55:33,373
One hero is redemption, two is weakness.

765
00:55:33,457 --> 00:55:34,373
So they took him?

766
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:36,168
Fuck, yes, they did!

767
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:37,920
Well, shit!

768
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,005
Peace out, bitch! Ha, ha!

769
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,135
You have to be patient, Deep.

770
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:47,554
We'll get you into a few more courses,
up to Level 7.

771
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:49,139
I don't wanna pay for more courses!

772
00:55:49,223 --> 00:55:50,641
Deep, please calm down.

773
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:52,434
I signed over my bank account to you.

774
00:55:52,518 --> 00:55:54,728
I filled out all those
fucking children's workbooks,

775
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:58,273
I married some weirdo
who gives terrible blowjobs.

776
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:00,526
I did everything you asked,

777
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:04,530
and when I found out that we're all just
fucking space spores, I didn't laugh.

778
00:56:04,613 --> 00:56:06,323
I did everything you asked.

779
00:56:06,406 --> 00:56:09,660
Because you said you'd get me back
in The Seven, you fucking promised.

780
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:13,372
I'm sorry, Deep, but you are acting
like a toxic personality.

781
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:15,040
I think you should leave.

782
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:21,921
Fuck Fresca.

783
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,391
- Look at you.
- I know.

784
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,016
I know.

785
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:37,897
But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

786
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,150
then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

787
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:45,695
You know?

788
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:50,200
Are you sure it's safe for you
to go back into the Tower?

789
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:51,284
No.

790
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:53,745
No, I'm not...

791
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:59,084
but if you jump ship
and you let the assholes steer...

792
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:02,045
then you're part of the problem.

793
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:05,006
And...

794
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:09,678
someone taught me something
about hanging in there.

795
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:26,945
I've been thinking about that lately,
the hanging in there.

796
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:31,366
And I think maybe I am too clingy.

797
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,909
No, you're not.

798
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:36,705
Sticking with people
just because I'm terrified of losing them?

799
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:40,542
I... I can't do that anymore.

800
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:47,424
I think it's time I go off,
stand on my own two feet for once.

801
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,804
Right. Um...

802
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,187
Yeah, no worries. We'll, um...

803
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:04,608
We'll just be friends, then.

804
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:07,027
Oh, God, no. No, no, no,
I'm still gonna cling onto you.

805
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,570
I'm not fucking crazy.

806
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:34,680
So if you weren't talking about me,
who were you talking about?

807
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:41,770
I'm scared.

808
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:00,621
This here...

809
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,166
belonged to your mum.

810
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,585
This is St. Christopher.

811
00:59:06,128 --> 00:59:08,380
She gave it to me a long time ago...

812
00:59:09,548 --> 00:59:13,885
and told me... it would keep me safe.

813
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,346
And it has.

814
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:18,931
Mostly.

815
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:29,860
Now your mum...

816
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:33,196
is gonna help keep you safe.

817
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,080
Come on.

818
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:54,885
Now, remember what I told you.

819
00:59:56,178 --> 00:59:57,220
Don't be a cunt.

820
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:18,033
William, I'm so sorry.

821
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:23,079
Vought's gonna want him back.

822
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:24,706
Let me handle Vought.

823
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:27,959
You think he'll turn into his father?

824
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:34,674
Becca didn't think so.

825
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:38,762
I pray she's right.

826
01:00:40,138 --> 01:00:42,891
All the charges against you and the boys
have been dropped,

827
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,851
even for the crimes you did commit.

828
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,269
You're a free man.

829
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:50,023
And the White House
is opening an Office of Supe Affairs.

830
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:52,692
Victoria Neuman is the new czar.

831
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:55,821
She's sneaking me
some off-the-books funding

832
01:00:55,904 --> 01:00:58,448
for a team that can
keep tabs on the Supes.

833
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:00,784

Congratulations on the appointment,
congresswoman.

854
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:53,939
It's about time
we had an Office of Supe Affairs.

855
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:57,275
Well, I know it was your intel
that took Stormfront down, so thank you.

856
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,527
<i>Yeah, and that's just the start.</i>

857
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:03,323

<i>- Call my office, set up a meeting?</i>

- Here's the research you asked for.
- Thank you.

866
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,599
- And your 2:00 is waiting.
- Thank you.

867

Hugh Campbell.

868
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,691
I don't know how to repay you
for what you did.

869
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:21,526
You know, I can think of a way.

870
01:04:22,027 --> 01:04:23,403
Oh?

871
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:26,573
You can... give me a job.

872
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:29,034
You serious?

873
01:04:29,117 --> 01:04:30,075
Uh...

874
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:31,328
What about your team?

875
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:34,122
Don't get me wrong,
I still want to fight Vought. I just...

876
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:38,460
I want to do it the right way,
not covered in quite as many guts.

877
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:44,049
Look, the truth is,
I never totally fit in with the guys.

878
01:04:44,132 --> 01:04:45,132
And...

879
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,012
I think it's time
I stand on my own two feet.

880
