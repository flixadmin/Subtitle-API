1
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,627
- Chow time!
- It's time!

2
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,630
Floyd, step up to the door. Dinner time.

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,678
Only my friends call me Floyd.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,166
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

5
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,683
What's that?

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,893
- That is called loaf.
- Loaf.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,229
It's got a little bit of pasghetti
in there.

8
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,814
Toenails.

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,482
Rat shit.

10
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,651
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

11
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,548
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

12
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,614
Yeah.

13
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,116
One day,

14
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,952
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

15
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,456
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,100
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

17
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,838
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you have.

18
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,089
Do something.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,049
Let's have some fun.

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,705
Open the goddamn gate!

21
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,874
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

22
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,878
Sector C! Pull your heads outta your ass!
Boss is on deck!

23
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:11,757
Open!

24
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,192
Bravo 14, open perimeter fence.

25
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,217
Stay back!

26
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,887
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

27
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,599
You gonna come down from there or what?

28
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,811
Look at you.

29
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,149
You know the rules, hotness.

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,692
You gotta keep off these bars.

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,736
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

32
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,405
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,993
You are really
in bad shape upstairs, lady!

34
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,392
Gonna come in here and tell me that?

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,414
Or are you too scared?

36
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,416
Come on, I'm bored.

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,251
I'm bored. Play with me.

38
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,587
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

39
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,547
No one's gonna play with you.

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,132
You sleep on the ground.

41
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,595
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

42
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,598
Oh, man. I love you.

43
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,767
Alpha One, hit her.

44
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,646
Come on, man.
You're six foot four.

45
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,314
She's a tiny little girl.

46
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,210
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

47
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,861
We got chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,407
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

49
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,658
Ahh!

50
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:20,826
Spring break!

51
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:25,956
Whoo.

52
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,127
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

53
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,817
The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.

54
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,571
And then it changed again when he didn't.

55
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,333
And that is why I'm here.

56
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,607
We lose a national hero,

57
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,094
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

58
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,861
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,780
It's taken some work.

60
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,950
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

61
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,623
There's rumors, Amanda,
that some of them have abilities.

62
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,459
Well, the rumors are right.

63
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,045
You know what the problem
with a met a human is?

64
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,338
The human part.

65
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,716
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

66
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,092
The next Superman might not.

67
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,886
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

68
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,055
I'm fighting fire with fire.

69
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,449
You're not going to pitch us that

70
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,392
Task Force X project
of yours again, are you?

71
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,560
Yes.

72
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,419
But this time, you're gonna listen.

73
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,317
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

74
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,002
He's the most wanted
hitman in the world.

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,176
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

76
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,638
- What?
- Hey, Angelo.

77
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,933
This is the exterminator
you called for your rat problem.

78
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,102
My account's looking a little thin.

79
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,564
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.

80
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,816
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

81
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,361
Whoa. Here's your boy right now.

82
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,948
With about 20 of his new best friends.

83
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

84
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,082
Listen, stop being cute and do your job!

85
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,793
They're taking him outta the car now.

86
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,005
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

87
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,091
Okay. Okay, okay. Relax.
There was an accounting error.

88
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,802
We sent it.

89
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,597
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

90
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,599
We're not the kind of people
you play with.

91
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,559
Did you just... Did you threaten me?

92
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,621
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

93
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,813
You son of a bitch.

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,026
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

95
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,964
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

96
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,134
His is an 11-year-old honor student
in Gotham City.

97
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,302
His daughter.

98
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,180
So we watched her and waited.

99
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,973
You should talk to Mama more.

100
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,892
Yeah, yeah, I know.

101
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,852
Mama stays in bed a lot.

102
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,146
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

103
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,524
Dad, it's okay. I can take care of her.

104
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,527
I know how to make pancakes now.

105
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,529
Hey, babe, that's beautiful.

106
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,573
Um, she's supposed to be
taking care of you.

107
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,542
You know, that's how
that's supposed to work.

108
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,537
I want you to come live with me.

109
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,167
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us a spot.

110
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,086
It's gonna be nice, all right?

111
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,506
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

112
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,051
That's not true.
That's a lie. She's lying to you.

113
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,304
Daddy... I know you do bad things.

114
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,307
Don't worry, I still love you.

115
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,561
Come on.

116
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,815
- And you caught him?
- Not me.

117
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,068
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.

118
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,405
I'mma figure this out. All right?

119
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,369
It's over, Deadshot.

120
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,664
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

121
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,009
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

122
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,761
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

123
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,098
Please.

124
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,434
Don't do it.

125
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,988
All right.

126
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,539
Love you, Daddy.

127
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,834
So now we have the man who never misses.

128
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,002
Where'd you put him?

129
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,529
Let's just say, I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

130
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,050
Harley Quinn.

131
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,226
Before she ran off
and joined the circus,

132
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,188
she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

133
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,648
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

134
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,652
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

135
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,780
Dr. Quinzel.

136
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,699
You know,
I live for these moments with you.

137
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,702
- What do you got?
- I got you a kitty.

138
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,163
So thoughtful.

139
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,625
She thought she was curing him,
but she was falling in love.

140
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,338
There is something
you could do for me, doctor.

141
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,506
Anything. I mean, yeah.

142
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,926
I need a machine gun.

143
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,221
A machine gun?

144
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,142
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

145
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,697
- Get off me.
- Shh!

146
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,953
What do we have here?

147
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,666
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

148
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,167
What?

149
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,338
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

150
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,091
I'm just gonna hurt ya

151
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,428
really, really bad.

152
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,595
You think so?

153
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,182
Well, I can take it.

154
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,026
They became the king
and queen of Gotham City.

155
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,196
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

156
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,323
We finally meet.

157
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,616
Nah, he don't shake hands.

158
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,244
But sit down and have a drink.

159
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,207
Hey, J.

160
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,752
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

161
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,463
I wanted to come by
and personally say thank you.

162
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,216
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

163
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,927
Are you sweet talking me?

164
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,891
I love this guy.

165
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,768
He's so intense!

166
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,525
MAN 1. Mmm. You're a lucky man.

167
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,195
You got a bad bitch.

168
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,282
Oh, that she is.

169
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,869
The fire in my loins.

170
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,497
The itch in my crotch.

171
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:51,544
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

172
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,640
Oh, come to Daddy.

173
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,809
Pudding!

174
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,645
Listen,

175
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,982
you are my gift
to this handsome hunka hunka!

176
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,693
You belong to him now.

177
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,195
Well...

178
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,658
You're cute.

179
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,409
You want me?

180
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,204
I'm all yours.

181
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,792
I don't want no beef.

182
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,378
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

183
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,630
Why, what's wrong?
You don't like me?

184
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,465
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

185
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,841
This is your lady.

186
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,178
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

187
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,889
No.

188
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,766
That's your lady, Joker.

189
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,933
That's right.

190
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,018
Yo, J.

191
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,399
And that was just the beginning.

192
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,076
Come on, Pudding. Do it!

193
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,745
Oh.

194
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,706
We have got company.

195
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,041
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

196
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,296
She's crazier than him.

197
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,214
And more fearless.

198
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,718
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

199
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,555
Pudding.

200
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,892
Pudding, I can't swim!

201
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:11,434
But the Bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

202
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,325
And then there's the Aussie.

203
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,452
Digger Harkness.

204
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,497
Or as the tabloids call him,
Captain Boomerang.

205
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,673
We're gonna be rich.

206
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,134
Yeah, you and me, mate.

207
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,719
Go and get the car.

208
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,138
He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.

209
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,433
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

210
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,479
Doesn't work well with others.

211
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,152
No honor among thieves, eh?

212
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,157
But he tangled with a met a human
and lived to tell about it.

213
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,078
And have you heard of
the pyrokinetic homeboy?

214
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,291
How'd you catch him?

215
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,043
We didn't. He surrendered.

216
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,590
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

217
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,718
This LA gangbanger thought
he was king of the world...

218
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,846
...until he lost his queen.

219
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,185
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

220
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,479
The security video is incredible.

221
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,111
Oh, Jesus. The hell is that?

222
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,863
His name is Waylon Jones.

223
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,240
K.C., dinner.

224
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,033
Open it up, B.

225
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,077
Evolution took a step backwards
with this one.

226
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,330
Give me that, Smitty.

227
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,331
Where you at?

228
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,502
They call him Killer Croc.

229
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,048
He looked like a monster.

230
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,426
So they treated him like a monster.

231
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,888
Then he became a monster.

232
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,392
He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.

233
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,145
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

234
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,730
He never found it.

235
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,115
I saved the best for last.

236
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,409
- The witch.
- A witch?

237
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,871
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

238
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,874
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

239
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,629
Archeologist Dr. June Moone,

240
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,924
wandered into the wrong cave.

241
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,476
June...

242
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,369
She opened something
she shouldn't have...

243
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,454
...releasing a met a human more powerful
than any we've encountered.

244
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,873
The Enchantress.

245
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,881
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.

246
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,675
Where is this witch?

247
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,718
In my pocket.

248
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,054
Now tell him
why she won't turn you into a frog.

249
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,057
Some say the witch
has a secret buried heart,

250
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,726
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

251
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,573
So we searched the cave
where she turned up

252
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,313
and we found her heart.

253
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,277
That thing's her heart?

254
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,681
Hmm. She's vulnerable without it.

255
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,282
You want to put our national security
in the hands of

256
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,618
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

257
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,221
Don't forget about The Joker's girlfriend.

258
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,371
These are villains, Amanda.

259
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,456
What makes you think you can control them?

260
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,585
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interest

261
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,837
for the national security
of the United States

262
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,714
is what I do for a living.

263
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,718
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced,

264
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,011
Colonel Rick Flag.

265
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,202
Help me.

266
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,038
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,

267
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,041
and just as I hoped, it got personal.

268
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,335
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

269
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,086
I have the witch's heart.

270
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,088
And Dr. Moone has his.

271
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,509
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

272
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,389
In a world of flying men and monsters,

273
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,559
this is the only way
to protect our country.

274
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,816
What if Superman had decided to fly down,

275
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,735
rip off the roof of the White House

276
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,582
and grab the President
of the United States

277
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,905
right out of the Oval Office?

278
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,240
Who would've stopped him?

279
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,411
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea,

280
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,830
anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.

281
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:29,669
But what happens if the next Superman
becomes a terrorist?

282
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,922
Amanda Waller has a plan. Amanda?

283
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,383
I wanna build a team
of some very bad people

284
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
who I think can do some good.

285
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,845
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

286
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,472
Not on my watch.

287
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,059
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

288
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,520
General, we run them
covertly, non-attributed.

289
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,105
Strictly need to know.

290
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,482
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

291
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,235
The next war will be fought
with these met a humans.

292
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,404
Ours, or theirs.

293
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,948
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

294
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,200
You know we can't control these people.

295
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,457
June, be strong.

296
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,835
Dr. Moone.

297
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,445
Enchantress.

298
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,919
Meet the Enchantress.

299
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,173
Everything we know about her
is in your briefing packs.

300
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,134
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

301
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,553
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

302
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,264
This meeting is now a magic show?

303
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,434
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

304
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,605
Go get it, girl.

305
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:32,208
How about a little something
from the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

306
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,386
We've been chasing these plans for years.

307
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,808
Uh, please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

308
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,935
Thank you. We'd like Dr. Moone back.

309
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,654
Enchantress.

310
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,282
Please. Please.

311
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,660
I'm sorry, I can't do that again.

312
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,411
Flag, get her out of here.

313
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:17,127
I move to, uh, authorize Amanda Waller
to establish Task Force X

314
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,838
under the ARGUS program.

315
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,424
All right.

316
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,677
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

317
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,333
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

318
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,692
How you doing, man?

319
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,610
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

320
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,571
Welcome, ma'am. How are you?

321
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,656
I'm here to assist you in any way.

322
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,658
Where are they?

323
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,136
Are you the Devil?

324
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,181
Maybe.

325
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,838
Ain't you scared?

326
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,095
Why'd they put you down here?

327
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,682
I asked.

328
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,521
Yo, ese.

329
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,231
Hola, amigo.

330
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,610
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

331
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,707
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?

332
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,875
Then come down here.

333
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,586
That ain't me.

334
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,753
That wasn't you?

335
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,132
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.

336
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,509
He's dead.

337
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,594
- And yet, here you are.
- Ma'am.

338
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,137
Let me try to talk to him.

339
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,144
You wanna die in here, buddy?

340
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,730
You got a real shot
at walking the block again.

341
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,650
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

342
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,360
A woman.

343
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,239
Look, man, you ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

344
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,824
Ask what?

345
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,994
I'm a man, okay? I ain't no weapon.

346
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,706
I'mma die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

347
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,959
I've caused enough harm.

348
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,428
All right, unlock him.

349
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,805
- What?
- You heard me.

350
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,181
You know what this man can do?

351
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm here to find out. Lose the restraints.

352
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,899
Okay.

353
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,820
What is this? Cheerleading tryouts?

354
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,406
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

355
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,242
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.

356
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,047
Mmm-hmm.

357
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,259
Now you got one in the chamber.
What you gonna do with it?

358
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,011
Shit!

359
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,555
Give me the word, boss. I'll drop him.

360
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,973
Everybody calm down.

361
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,600
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

362
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,893
Tell them, "Put it down."

363
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Stand down.

364
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,064
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

365
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,816
- What's for dinner?
- Ames, if this man shoots me,

366
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,777
I want you to kill him

367
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,321
and I want you to go clear
my browser history.

368
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,409
See, the firing pin is filed down, right?

369
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,038
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

370
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,831
You're absolutely right.

371
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,709
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

372
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,378
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

373
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,964
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

374
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,841
I've known you, like, nine months.

375
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,528
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

376
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,848
What?

377
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,100
Oops.

378
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,854
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

379
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,739
All right. Now you know
what you're buying.

380
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,201
Let me tell you the price.
First, I want out of here.

381
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,413
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.

382
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,541
All right? And her mom can have, like,
supervised visits.

383
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,919
But her stank-ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.

384
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,671
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

385
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,674
Third, y'all gonna pay
for my daughter's whole education.

386
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,510
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

387
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,179
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

388
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,139
- So Ivy League.
- Ivy League, yeah.

389
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,765
One of them big joints, you know?

390
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,852
And if she can't cut it
and her grades start slipping,

391
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,621
- I need you to white-people that thing.
- Mmm-hmm.

392
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,105
- You know how y'all do.
- Oh, yeah.

393
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,272
You know, right? Okay.

394
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,649
Now that's my price.

395
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,986
But I'm concerned 'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

396
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,572
You're in no position
to make any demands.

397
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,617
Oh, I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

398
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,287
No, errand boy. I'm talking to your boss.

399
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,667
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.

400
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,090
You notice these are criminals?

401
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,594
They're psychotic antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

402
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,641
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you

403
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,657
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

404
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,850
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

405
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,561
In World War Two,
the US Navy made a deal with the mafia

406
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,355
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

407
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,981
This ain't World War Two.

408
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,483
It's World War Three.

409
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,526
What are you really up to?

410
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,363
It's a "need to know", and all you need
to know is you work for me.

411
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,824
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends, too, you know.

412
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,828
There you go. Call.

413
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,497
But without you minding her,

414
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,501
your lady friend stays here strapped
to a board in a drug-induced coma.

415
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,629
They warned me about you.

416
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,549
My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.

417
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,682
Nobody does.

418
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,901
Where is she?

419
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,154
It's complex. This is not just her.

420
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,156
Everybody's disappearing.

421
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,324
There's this new law,

422
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,491
where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist” on your jacket.

423
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,456
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.

424
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,667
That's where she is.

425
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,712
So what are we doing?

426
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,423
Bring the car around.

427
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,259
We're going for a drive.

428
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,906
Lester, Lester!
Hit me one more time!

429
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,825
Come on, man!

430
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,578
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10 K.

431
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,454
- Hey!
- Oh!

432
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,832
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

433
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,173
Good job, man. He's killing it.

434
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,591
Come on, man. Why am I here?

435
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,760
All right, yeah, I'm down.
I get it, all right?

436
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:49,056
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault. All right?

437
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,766
Dude, this is real.

438
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,935
I had to stop these guys from burning
down your house with your kids in it.

439
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,609
But you're lucky.

440
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,778
Maybe. Why do you think so?

441
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,492
Yo, slick. What's up?

442
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,703
Griggs. You are?

443
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,413
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

444
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,291
Can I go, man?
What the hell is going on, man?

445
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,793
This is crazy.

446
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,795
Blah,
blah-blah, blah-blah.

447
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,963
Blah-blah, blah, blah.

448
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,967
All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.

449
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,386
Oh! My God!

450
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,435
Mmm.

451
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,616
I could tell you meant that.

452
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,618
Yeah.

453
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,914
You're gonna be my friend.

454
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,975
Enchantress.

455
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,822
- Log time of death. 1620.
- June?

456
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,534
Let's get her down to the morgue.

457
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,536
June? June?

458
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,830
June.

459
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,207
June.

460
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,545
What did you do?

461
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,464
Shh.

462
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,549
Okay.

463
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,796
Plus, it could be the routing number.

464
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,883
Wanna go for drinks?

465
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,400
Enchantress.

466
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,487
God damn it!

467
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,824
June! June!

468
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,953
June, I'm sorry.

469
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,126
Shh.

470
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,382
She went somewhere.

471
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:58,305
If you have to choose between her or me,
stop her.

472
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,515
Promise me you'll stop her.

473
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,979
Even if it kills me.

474
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,216
Sir. Sir. You okay?

475
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,178
Can you breathe? Did you take anything?

476
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,890
This is twenty-one.
Send medical to my location.

477
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,059
I'm a physician.

478
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,894
Roger.
Bringing medical to your location.

479
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,271
No pulse. Starting compressions.

480
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,217
Sir.

481
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,053
Midway City is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.

482
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,554
I think you know what to do, sir.

483
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,598
Activate Task Force X

484
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,267
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus on scene ASAP.

485
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,477
Sir.

486
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,439
We're going live
with Task Force X. Pull 'em.

487
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,114
Prisoner,
get down on your knees, now!

488
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,633
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

489
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,741
Hands up high!

490
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,410
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

491
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,453
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

492
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,541
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!

493
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,459
Damn it!

494
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,839
Open the gate!

495
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,632
Everybody, line up for extraction.

496
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,426
Let's go! Let's move, move.

497
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,303
Yeah. Open the door! Let's go!

498
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,019
Hit him!

499
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,563
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

500
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,107
Where you at?

501
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,817
Whoa

502
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,240
Is that the new guy?

503
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,707
What is that? What is that? Who are you?

504
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,101
- Stand by. Arming device.
- Who are you?

505
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,519
- I don't know who you are.
- Device armed.

506
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,337
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

507
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,506
Injection successful.

508
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,675
Location verified.

509
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,846
- Anybody who touches me is dead.
- Anybody who--

510
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,141
- Lady.
- Injection successful.

511
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,685
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

512
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,853
Next!

513
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,397
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

514
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,108
Come on.

515
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,694
Shut up, and get it done.

516
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,364
Whee!

517
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,593
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

518
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,868
It's from Mr. J.

519
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,555
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

520
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,747
You're so screwed.

521
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,124
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

522
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,668
Get off me! Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?

523
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,087
Harley!

524
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,096
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Cries.

525
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,974
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

526
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,061
Hey, cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

527
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,855
Thank you. You're a good man.

528
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,869
Open up!

529
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,505
Just please, do whatever they say.

530
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,617
Do whatever they say. Just do it.

531
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,852
Hmm.

532
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,436
This looks neat.

533
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,279
Light it up!
Light it up! Light it up!

534
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,331
He's right above us.

535
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,292
This is a mistake. Rick, I can't do this.

536
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,918
- I can't--
- Listen.

537
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,503
There's no other way.

538
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,797
Just get it done.

539
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,384
Just get it done.

540
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,972
Enchantress.

541
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,516
Flag, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

542
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,477
Amanda, she bolted.

543
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,979
Say it again?

544
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,647
She bolted!

545
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,399
Shit!

546
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,962
Go!

547
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,225
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

548
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,310
I thought this was contained!

549
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,494
This is the worst day of my life!

550
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,290
All evacuees
must report to a FEMA representative.

551
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,044
What's going on in that city?

552
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,255
Those assholes here yet?

553
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,839
Yeah, they're here.

554
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,011
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

555
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,016
What the hell, Flag?

556
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,686
Unlock 'em.

557
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,943
Mmm!

558
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,030
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

559
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,656
How do you do?

560
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,997
Huh?

561
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,500
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?

562
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,963
Sorry. It's the voices.

563
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,009
I'm kidding! Jeez!

564
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,344
That's not what they really said.

565
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,096
What do we got here?

566
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,640
Twelve pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

567
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,732
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

568
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,988
Hey, what's going on, man?

569
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,156
Calm down.

570
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,450
Hey, one minute
I'm playing Mahjong with me Nanna,

571
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,827
then this red streak hits me
outta nowhere.

572
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,538
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

573
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,956
I was not!

574
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,754
Here comes Slipknot,
the man who can climb anything. Wonderful.

575
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,589
Have a good time, scumbag.

576
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,216
Ooh.

577
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,176
Straighten up.

578
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,805
She had a mouth.

579
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,516
Listen up!

580
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,309
In your necks,

581
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:27,522
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

582
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,609
It's the size of a rice grain,
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

583
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,237
You disobey me, you die.

584
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,449
You try to escape, you die.

585
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:43,162
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

586
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,039
You die.

587
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,084
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

588
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,335
Lady, shut up!

589
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,712
This is the deal.

590
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,176
You're going somewhere very bad,
to do something that'll get you killed.

591
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,803
But until that happens,

592
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,056
- you're my problem.
- Mmm.

593
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,393
So was that like a, uh, pep talk?

594
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,811
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

595
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,229
There's your shit.

596
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,399
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

597
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,609
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

598
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,403
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

599
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,655
He's like the gold standard, okay?

600
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,533
Triangle, bitch. Study.

601
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,346
What?

602
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,145
Won't fit anymore?

603
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,566
Too much junk in the trunk?

604
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,570
Nah. Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

605
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,696
And?

606
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,408
I like putting it on.

607
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,369
Goody.

608
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,789
Something tells me
a whole lotta people are about to die!

609
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,332
Yeah. It's us.

610
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,699
We're being led to our deaths.

611
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,043
Speak for yourself, mate.

612
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,749
Hey, what's that crap on your face?
Does it wash off?

613
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,259
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light
her cigarette with your pinkie?

614
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,052
Because that would be real classy!

615
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,805
Hey, y'all might
wanna leave old boy alone.

616
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,183
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, ese?

617
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:13,479
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.
I'm cool, homie.

618
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,481
Behold the voice of God.

619
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,278
For those of you
who don't know me officially,

620
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,113
my name is Amanda Waller.

621
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,409
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

622
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:30,913
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.

623
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,332
I'm sorry. Uh...

624
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:37,086
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1?

625
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:41,215
The only person that matters in the city,
the one person you can't kill.

626
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,885
Complete the mission,
you get time off your prison sentence.

627
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,762
Fail the mission, you die.

628
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,516
Anything happens to Colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.

629
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,144
Remember, I'm watching.

630
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,272
I see everything.

631
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,651
There's your pep talk.

632
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,195
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

633
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,156
So that's it?

634
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,242
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

635
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,828
I'll notify your next of Kin.

636
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,707
Alpha, Bravo team. Mount up!

637
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,504
You're late.

638
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,618
This is Katana. She's got my back.

639
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,704
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke,

640
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,415
just like mowing the lawn.

641
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,459
I would advise not getting killed by her.

642
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,879
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

643
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,049
Harley Quinn. Nice to meet ya.

644
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,258
Love your perfume.

645
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,969
What is that? The stench of death?

646
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:15,601
Whoa, easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of a mission. Have a seat.

647
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,603
She seems nice.

648
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,207
Shh.

649
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,014
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights!

650
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,101
Are you guys seeing this?

651
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,478
What happened?

652
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,023
Terror attack.

653
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,444
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

654
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,571
You know, usual shit.

655
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,738
Right.

656
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,575
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

657
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,761
I don't know if they told you,

658
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,872
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

659
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,540
Anything for a dollar, right?

660
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,043
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

661
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,045
I'm a soldier!

662
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,090
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

663
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:32,595
When the shooting starts,
and it will, you'll cut and run.

664
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,611
Six-one is going down.

665
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,654
Six-one is going down hard.

666
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,670
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

667
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,681
Whoo! What a ride!

668
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,350
We're okay. We're okay.

669
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,060
Assets are undamaged.

670
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,454
- Mind games.
- What's that?

671
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,706
All this bomb in the neck crap.

672
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,667
That ain't real, mate.

673
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,532
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

674
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:51,215
But you look around, we're free, brah.

675
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,383
How do you know this?

676
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,718
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

677
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,846
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

678
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,974
Question is, are you coming?

679
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,105
Yeah. Smart!

680
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:28,877
Hold your fire.

681
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,632
Sorry. It's what I do.

682
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,935
Damn it.

683
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,190
Now that's a killer app!

684
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,900
Okay. You wanna keep playing

685
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,671
the Hollywood Squares version
of "I'll Blow Your Freaking Head Off"?

686
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,695
Are you next?

687
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,865
You tripping, homie.

688
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,326
You next, Deadshot?

689
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,455
You just threatened me?

690
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,040
Oh, yeah.

691
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,708
He just threatened me.

692
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,880
Move.

693
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,632
You got a boyfriend?

694
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,928
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

695
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,239
Well, you better make it quick

696
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,983
'cause he's gonna Kill
all of us one by one.

697
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,366
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady,
five or seven of these SEALSs.

698
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,520
After that, I'm gonna need
some help. You down?

699
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,231
Always. What about the shit in our necks?

700
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,068
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

701
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,406
You're my friend, too.

702
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,952
Stay evil, doll face. Spread the word.

703
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,667
I'm standing by for follow on tasking.

704
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,471
C2, what is the operational load
of the PLS?

705
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,056
Boss, we got people up here.

706
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,809
I'm on my way.

707
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,114
Shit.

708
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,282
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

709
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,201
Flag, get out of there.

710
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,704
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

711
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,580
Copy that.

712
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,998
We're diverting.

713
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,751
Bump out second squad two blocks east.

714
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,504
We'll pass through you, continue north.

715
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,089
Take Bravo two blocks east.

716
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,150
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

717
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,174
Copy that.

718
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,812
Hey. I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.

719
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:52,980
Yeah.

720
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:54,940
Come on.

721
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,441
Yeah, uh...

722
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,860
Hold that thought.

723
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,455
Rick, why do they look like that?

724
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,290
Just stay cool.

725
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,178
The hell are they?

726
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,097
You cut and run, I'll blow your head off.

727
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,152
Hit them!

728
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,246
Huh.

729
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Hey.

730
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,595
Ha!

731
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:04,945
Get off me!

732
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,367
Get off me! Son of a--

733
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Flag!

734
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,834
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

735
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,294
He dies, we die.

736
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,057
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

737
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,269
Backblast, clear!

738
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,694
Pinky.

739
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,201
That's how I cut and run.

740
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,168
Hey.

741
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:44,335
Hey, come on.

742
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,630
What? I saw it move.

743
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,133
See? It flinched. I think.

744
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,469
Hey, you were some help, princess.

745
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,888
It's better this way.

746
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:56,515
Trust me.

747
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,433
Oh, yeah, you're the fire bloke, eh?

748
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,727
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah. Hey.

749
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,230
Well, looky here.

750
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,982
Whoo! It's fire.

751
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,233
Whoo!

752
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,237
The brief said terrorists.

753
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:11,965
You wanna start explaining this?

754
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,429
If I told you, would you believe me?

755
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,702
- What are they?
- I don't know.

756
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,328
That's bullshit.

757
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,331
Thing has on a $3,000 watch.

758
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,084
Is that a person?

759
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,752
It was.

760
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,921
Now it's not.

761
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,340
Hey, don't!

762
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,175
What?

763
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,760
We got a job to do.

764
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,806
We're moving.

765
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,769
Get your boys moving.

766
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:46,648
Let's go.

767
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,367
Waller,
we're moving on the objective.

768
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,095
We lost contact with Bravo.
You got a visual?

769
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,120
Stand by.

770
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,622
- Anything on the other squad?
- No, ma'am.

771
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,125
Go-7, I need your sensors
on those coordinates.

772
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,334
Flag, it's a negative.

773
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,463
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.

774
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,417
Seriously?

775
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,920
The hell is wrong with you people?

776
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:53,006
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

777
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:15,529
Take a knee.

778
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,886
Our body's at the top of that building.

779
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,329
We get up there,

780
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,256
pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

781
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,083
Helos extract us off the roof.

782
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,876
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

783
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,514
Waller?

784
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,227
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

785
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,876
What do you say we get this over with?

786
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,360
What the hell?
Deadshot. Fall back.

787
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,201
You mind if we tag along?

788
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,977
Whoo! Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

789
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,845
Be a walk in the park.

790
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,597
Easy peasy.

791
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,557
Don't make me shoot you.

792
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,564
God damn it. Harley!

793
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,316
Go, go, go, go!

794
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,490
Hey, guys!

795
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,414
Come on. Let's go.

796
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:44,344
Ma'am. I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

797
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,182
- Flag, they're all around you.
- Hold.

798
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,351
Use extreme caution.

799
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,562
I don't like this, Flag.

800
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,983
I don't like it either.

801
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,405
Pussy.

802
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,699
I will knock your ass out.

803
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,242
I do not care that you're a girl.

804
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,252
They're after Flag again.

805
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,921
Son of a bitch. Get off me.

806
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,178
Circle up. Circle around him.

807
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,935
- Let me fight!
- You die, we die.

808
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,024
Clear! Everyone move out!

809
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,308
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

810
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:40,126
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

811
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,378
Don't touch me, man!

812
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,855
Don't touch you? What you gonna do?

813
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,815
- Don't touch me!
- I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

814
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,716
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

815
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,985
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah, I wanna see--

816
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,209
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something.

817
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,329
I was just trying to get you there.

818
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,124
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

819
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:24,003
I knew you'd come through.

820
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,089
That shit crazy.

821
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,392
Clear.

822
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,782
I gotta work on my cardio.

823
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,461
Question.

824
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,548
Would you die for me?

825
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:11,843
Yes.

826
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,553
That's too easy.

827
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,055
Would you...

828
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,560
Would you live for me?

829
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,480
Mmm?

830
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,981
Yes.

831
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,317
Careful.

832
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:32,113
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

833
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:37,327
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.

834
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,582
Do you want this?

835
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,918
I do.

836
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,419
Say it.

837
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,339
Say it. Say it.

838
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,966
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

839
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,259
Please.

840
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,970
Aw! God, you're so...

841
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,680
Good.

842
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,455
Whoa!

843
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,958
Relax. Just me.

844
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,672
You ever been in love?

845
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,759
Nah. Never.

846
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,177
Bullshit.

847
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,179
You don't kill as many people
as I've killed

848
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,017
and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.

849
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,521
Another textbook sociopath.

850
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:33,985
Clear.

851
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,153
Clear.

852
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,405
All right, secure the roof.

853
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,199
Sweep for shooters
SO we can bring in our aviation assets.

854
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,367
Going to the roof.

855
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,376
Oh. Wait here.

856
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,544
Please.

857
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,213
I don't wanna give this dude
a heart attack. Okay?

858
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,133
Aw, he's
embarrassed of us!

859
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,551
Hey, Flag.

860
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,012
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

861
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,396
You ready? Let's go.

862
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,274
You wouldn't have made it without them.

863
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,444
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

864
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,030
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

865
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,824
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.
Why'd you stay?

866
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,743
I was studying your girlfriend.

867
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,580
She takes an average person,
a yoga mom, an elderly retiree,

868
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:30,667
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot and still fight.

869
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,002
It's an instant army.

870
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,213
How'd she do it, Flag?

871
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,425
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

872
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,013
I'll accept the consequences.

873
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,599
I am your consequence.

874
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,101
You might need to be careful.

875
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,937
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

876
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,605
I can take care of myself.

877
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,972
Shut it down, wipe the drives.

878
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,608
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

879
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,320
Uh, hey, man. I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped

880
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:02,073
in your temple of soldierly
self-righteousness,

881
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,618
but a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

882
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,704
Oh, says the guy who shoots people
for money.

883
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,070
My cards is on the table, man.

884
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,623
It got done, didn't it?

885
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:20,800
Damn. That is just a mean lady.

886
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,428
Yeah. You get used to it.

887
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,181
And I'm the bad guy?

888
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,645
That's gangsta.

889
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:34,897
What?

890
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,944
They weren't cleared for any of this.
Any of it.

891
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,986
Hey, I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

892
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,706
No way.

893
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,426
Let's go home.

894
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,136
Yeah, let's go home.

895
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,973
That sounds good. You guys wanna go home?

896
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,142
Or you wanna go back to prison?

897
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,727
I'm not going back to prison.

898
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:15,188
What I'm saying
is we Kill the pair of 'em now

899
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,981
before they Kill us.

900
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,900
I got this.

901
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,696
You all made it this far.

902
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,700
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

903
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,968
I like her.

904
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,891
Savior One-Zero,
this is Ground Element.

905
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,314
Savior One-Zero, how copy?

906
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,734
Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.

907
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,853
Boss, they're not talking to me.

908
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:12,078
Our bird's been jacked.

909
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,914
Light it up!

910
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,067
What? I got a hickey or something?

911
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,236
Professor,
could you pick up the pace?

912
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,583
Harley!

913
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,212
Hello, baby.

914
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:06,923
Kill her!

915
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,428
Her nanite's disarmed!

916
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,098
Come on, baby.

917
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,655
Deadshot,

918
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,576
shoot that woman right now!

919
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,620
She ain't do shit to me.

920
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,830
You're a hitman, right?

921
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,248
I got a contract.

922
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:43,294
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it for your freedom and your Kid.

923
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,048
Now she dead.

924
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,880
I missed.

925
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,761
Good one, mate.

926
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,055
It's Waller.

927
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,684
Savior One-Zero's been hijacked.
Shoot it down.

928
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,769
Roger that,
ma'am. Going hot.

929
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,069
Pudding!

930
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,119
You got all dressed up for me?

931
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,830
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.

932
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,499
By the way,
I've got some grape soda on ice,

933
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,918
- and a bear skin rug waiting.
- Yeah?

934
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,837
Boss, we got a problem!

935
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,296
Huh?

936
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:16,762
- This bird is baked.
- No.

937
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,808
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

938
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,268
Let's do it.

939
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,296
Target destroyed, ma'am.

940
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,506
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

941
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,092
Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.

942
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,805
The Joker
and Harley Quinn

943
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,183
are no more.

944
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,146
You couldn't save her.

945
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,110
Roger. I see ya.

946
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,448
Watch your step, ma'am.

947
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,661
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

948
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,391
Waller's down.

949
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:26,559
It's over.

950
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,688
Ops just confirmed. She's down. 1k west.

951
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,900
Let's go get her.

952
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,866
The mission's not over.

953
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:45,244
Nah. It is for me. We had a deal.

954
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:47,538
Without Waller, you got nothing.

955
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,337
Hey, guys. I'm back!

956
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,090
I missed you all so much.

957
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,636
We're glad you could make it.

958
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,443
Hey, craziness.

959
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:49,159
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

960
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:53,497
Now tell me how to destroy your armies.

961
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,541
Do your worst, bitch!

962
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,070
So let me guess.

963
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:29,325
We're going to
the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

964
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,493
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

965
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,040
When does this end, Flag?

966
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,750
Load up. We're in for a fight.

967
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,111
You tell everybody everything.

968
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:09,073
Or me and you gonna go right now.

969
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,372
Three days ago,

970
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,291
a non-human entity appeared
in the subway station.

971
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,753
Waller, we're almost there.

972
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,382
So Waller sent me and a woman
with incredible abilities.

973
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,384
Enchantress.

974
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,886
A witch.

975
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:35,140
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but the witch could.

976
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,477
Bomb's ready.

977
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,270
Set for two seconds.

978
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,957
You just press the button and drop it.

979
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,821
Needless to say,
the whole thing was a bad idea.

980
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,155
She bolted!

981
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,824
Shit!

982
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,376
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

983
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,171
So now you know.

984
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,508
You can just kill me right now,

985
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,469
but I'm going to have a drink.

986
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,471
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

987
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,016
No, sir. You need a miracle.

988
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:55,095
Here's to honor among thieves.

989
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,181
I'm not a thief.

990
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:00,851
Oh. She's not a thief.

991
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,567
Well, we almost pulled it off

992
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:11,445
despite what everybody thought.

993
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,157
Worst part of it is, they're going to
blame us for the whole thing.

994
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,035
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

995
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:20,162
We're the patsies.

996
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,580
The cover-up.

997
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,084
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

998
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,795
And, uh,

999
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,550
for about two sweet seconds,

1000
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,885
I had hope.

1001
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:37,679
You had hope, huh?

1002
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,642
Hope don't stop
the wheel from turning, my brother.

1003
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:43,644
Hmm. You preaching?

1004
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,646
It's coming back around for you.

1005
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,774
How many people you killed, man?

1006
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,610
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1007
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:54,530
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

1008
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,198
No kids.

1009
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,326
I don't kill women or children.

1010
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:00,827
I do.

1011
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,917
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1012
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:10,420
I kept it hidden
for most of my life, but...

1013
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,549
The older I got, the stronger it got.

1014
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,467
So I started using it.

1015
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,428
For business, you know.

1016
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,807
The more power on the street I got,
the more fire power I got.

1017
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,326
Like, that shit went hand in hand.

1018
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,894
You know? One was feeding the other.

1019
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,064
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1020
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,733
Except my old lady.

1021
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,697
You know, she used to pray for me.

1022
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:37,864
You're welcome.

1023
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,493
Even when I didn't want it.

1024
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,089
God didn't give me this.

1025
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,301
Why should he take it away?

1026
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,303
Hey.

1027
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:02,681
This is our home.

1028
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,325
You put that back where you found it.

1029
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,851
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

1030
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:08,020
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1031
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:11,398
See, when I get mad, I lose control.
You know, I just...

1032
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,650
I don't know what I do...

1033
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,326
...till it's done.

1034
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,258
And the kids?

1035
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,013
He killed them.

1036
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,435
Didn't you?

1037
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,236
Own that shit.

1038
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:00,238
Own it!

1039
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,908
What'd you think was gonna happen? Huh?

1040
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,743
Hey, Harley. Come on.

1041
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,578
What, you were just...

1042
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,330
Thinking you can have a happy family

1043
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,249
and coach little leagues,
and make car payments?

1044
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,168
Normal's a setting on the dryer.

1045
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,796
People like us, we don't get normal!

1046
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,131
Why is it always a knife fight

1047
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:21,009
every single time you open your mouth?

1048
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:26,056
You know, outside you're amazing.

1049
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:30,352
But inside, you're ugly.

1050
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,270
We all are.

1051
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,774
We all are! Except for him.

1052
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:39,444
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1053
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,697
Not me, shorty.

1054
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:47,577
I'm beautiful.

1055
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,372
Yeah, you are.

1056
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:01,842
We don't want you here.

1057
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:13,311
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1058
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:15,814
Yeah.

1059
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,943
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1060
01:27:23,196 --> 01:27:26,491
Apparently, that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1061
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,536
'Cause the witch is scared of him.

1062
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,621
The only woman I ever cared about

1063
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,750
is trapped inside that monster.

1064
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,461
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.

1065
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,129
Everything is over.

1066
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,047
Everything.

1067
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:45,218
You're free to go.

1068
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,485
Your daughter writes you every day.

1069
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,532
Every single day.

1070
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,091
You had these the whole time?

1071
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:30,096
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

1072
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:35,685
I'm gonna get you there.

1073
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,563
And you're gonna end this.

1074
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,982
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1075
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,570
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1076
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:48,406
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1077
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:54,079
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy is not a piece of shit.

1078
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,257
I'll come.

1079
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,470
What?

1080
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,013
You got something better to do?

1081
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,765
Come on!

1082
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:16,935
Pussies.

1083
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,848
We think that thing"s a weapon.

1084
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,099
Here. Lower.

1085
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,692
We gotta take out the big one.

1086
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:11,698
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1087
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,244
There's a flooded tunnel,
leads right underneath that building.

1088
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,832
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

1089
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,919
We get in its face and distract the hell
out of that son of a bitch

1090
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,445
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1091
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,215
That's how we take it out.

1092
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,686
I'm going with ya.

1093
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:44,898
We got this.

1094
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,108
I'm not asking, bro.

1095
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:52,822
I live underground.

1096
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,325
Y'all are just tourists.

1097
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:22,769
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1098
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,731
His soul's trapped inside of It.

1099
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,109
She talks to him.

1100
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:31,236
Hey, well,

1101
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:33,571
you know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1102
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,074
Huh?

1103
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:44,916
Let's do this.

1104
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,002
You gonna fight with us?

1105
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,130
What if I lose control?

1106
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,299
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1107
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:47,729
Duck in.

1108
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:04,287
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff, right?

1109
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,247
Yeah. Why?

1110
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,291
I'm off my meds.

1111
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,169
So that's your old lady?

1112
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,171
Yeah.

1113
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:15,256
Well, you need to handle
this shit, all right?

1114
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:19,094
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her, "Knock this shit off."

1115
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,429
I do not think that'd be wise.

1116
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,556
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1117
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:26,184
My boys will detonate the bomb
underneath him.

1118
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:33,108
You know, we should get a drink sometime.

1119
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:36,861
I've been
waiting for you all night.

1120
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:42,158
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.

1121
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,370
Hmm.

1122
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:47,872
What the hell? Grab her.

1123
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,709
Why are you here?

1124
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:55,046
Because the soldier led you?

1125
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:56,756
And all for Waller.

1126
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:59,884
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1127
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,387
I am your ally.

1128
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:05,014
And I know what you want.

1129
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:08,059
Exactly what you want.

1130
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:51,352
Baby. Baby.

1131
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,981
Baby, it's just a nightmare.

1132
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:57,984
It's just a bad dream.

1133
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,819
I'm here.

1134
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,789
Miss me?

1135
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:22,634
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then maybe we can kick it?

1136
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:25,470
Yeah?

1137
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:31,476
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

1138
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:33,311
He married me!

1139
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:36,189
It's not real.

1140
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:37,941
I killed the Bat.

1141
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,651
Nah, homie. You don't want that.

1142
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:41,945
What? I want that.

1143
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,671
She trying to play games with you, man.

1144
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,490
- It's not real!
- He's right.

1145
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:47,575
It's not real.

1146
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,830
How long have you been able to see?

1147
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:54,958
My whole life.

1148
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:58,002
You can't have them.

1149
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,462
These are my people right here.

1150
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,422
But it is our time.

1151
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:06,427
The sun is setting, and the magic rises.
The met a humans are a sign of change.

1152
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:11,474
Lady, you are evil!

1153
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,480
Oh, wow.

1154
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:21,817
Uh-oh.

1155
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:23,861
Who's this?

1156
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,364
- It's gonna be bad!
- We should run.

1157
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:40,003
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1158
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:51,992
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1159
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:53,808
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1160
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,782
I lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another one.

1161
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,117
Look, think it through.

1162
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:14,662
I got this.
Let me show you what I really am.

1163
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,497
Over here!

1164
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,042
Go!

1165
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:16,974
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1166
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:18,976
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1167
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:34,909
- Get him, mate!
- Come on.

1168
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:38,246
Yeah, do it!

1169
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,425
Diablo, get clear! Get outta there!

1170
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,009
Blow it!

1171
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,222
Blow it.

1172
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,477
- Now, GQ. Now.
- No!

1173
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,355
Everybody, down!

1174
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,436
You next.

1175
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,191
My spell is complete.

1176
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:52,111
Once you and your armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1177
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:55,740
And it will be mine to rule.

1178
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:12,882
That was our main satellite uplink.

1179
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,823
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

1180
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,682
It's a secret facility.

1181
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,272
You got a move here, Flag?

1182
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,441
We gotta cut her heart out.

1183
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:02,765
While we're fighting,

1184
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,226
that thing's laying waste
to the whole damn world.

1185
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:13,734
Where is she?

1186
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:15,987
I don't know.

1187
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:21,324
Hey.

1188
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:29,000
Look out. Look out!

1189
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,481
Uh-oh.

1190
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,233
Sorry.

1191
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,407
Flag!

1192
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:37,068
Enough!

1193
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:46,243
Of all who have faced me,
you have earned mercy.

1194
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,245
For the last time,

1195
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:52,166
join me, or die.

1196
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:57,088
I'm not much of a joiner,

1197
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:00,257
but maybe we should.

1198
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:01,842
Hey!

1199
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:03,636
She's trying to take over the world.

1200
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:04,929
So?

1201
01:43:05,638 --> 01:43:08,766
What's the world ever done for us, anyway?
It hates us.

1202
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:11,394
Hey, Harley!

1203
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:16,148
Hey, lady? Um...

1204
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:21,195
I lost my Pudding.

1205
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,448
But you can get him back, right?

1206
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:27,493
I can, my dear.

1207
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,621
Anything you want.

1208
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:34,750
You promise?

1209
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,627
Yes, child.

1210
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,714
You need only bow

1211
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:44,802
and serve beneath my feet.

1212
01:43:49,724 --> 01:43:51,976
I like what you're selling, lady.

1213
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:56,147
There's just one teeny problem.

1214
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:58,816
You messed with my friends.

1215
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,158
Her heart's out! We can end this!

1216
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:13,122
Hey, Croc!

1217
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,418
Harley!

1218
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,215
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

1219
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:09,637
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1220
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,097
Daddy, I love you.

1221
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:15,017
Please, don't do this.

1222
01:46:10,114 --> 01:46:11,240
That was a great shot, man.

1223
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:13,617
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

1224
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:16,412
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1225
01:46:23,127 --> 01:46:25,546
Let me join my brother.

1226
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:27,756
Katana, no!

1227
01:46:32,761 --> 01:46:33,971
Give me that.

1228
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:38,809
You bring June back. You bring her back.

1229
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,978
She's not coming back.

1230
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:43,772
I'll crush this. Do you hear me?

1231
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:45,816
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1232
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:47,192
Go ahead.

1233
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:49,987
You don't have the balls.

1234
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,083
Hey, Flag.

1235
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:54,717
June!

1236
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:06,063
She's gone.

1237
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:07,606
I thought I killed you.

1238
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:09,441
I thought I killed you.

1239
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:13,028
Y'all don't mind,

1240
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:15,781
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1241
01:48:15,948 --> 01:48:18,492
Yeah, and I got some business to handle
back in Gotham.

1242
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:20,327
I'm going to hot wire a car. Need a ride?

1243
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:21,745
Your ass is not driving.

1244
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:22,913
Why not?

1245
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:27,543
How are you not dead?

1246
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:29,878
We just saved the world.

1247
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:32,548
A "thank you" would be nice.

1248
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,258
Thank you.

1249
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:36,260
You're welcome.

1250
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:38,220
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1251
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:40,931
Ten years off your prison sentences.

1252
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:47,062
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1253
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,858
That can be arranged.

1254
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:53,444
Any other requests?

1255
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:56,071
Ooh. An espresso machine.

1256
01:48:56,697 --> 01:48:58,282
BET.

1257
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:01,618
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1258
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:03,579
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

1259
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:05,581
or we're going
to start having some real fun.

1260
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:07,624
Why don't we have some fun?

1261
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:20,095
You're trying to figure out this length.

1262
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:22,222
That's the hypotenuse.

1263
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:24,183
So, you have to know this angle.

1264
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:28,604
Okay. So, if you're up here,
like in a building,

1265
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:31,899
and you shoot a man
down here on the street,

1266
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:34,151
that's how far the bullet actually goes?

1267
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:37,071
Yeah. That's right.

1268
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:38,697
You are so smart. Right.

1269
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:41,116
The hypotenuse. Good one. Um...

1270
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:44,179
So, that would make you
have to know the angle

1271
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:46,538
between the building and the sidewalk.

1272
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,207
You got to know that angle.

1273
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:51,126
No, I mean, in real life,
you have variables.

1274
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:52,586
You know, you got rifling twist.

1275
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:55,089
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1276
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,010
Some shots you'll even
have to take the curvature

1277
01:49:58,175 --> 01:49:59,635
of the Earth in with the...

1278
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:01,261
It's time.

1279
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:03,972
...wind effect.

1280
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:07,351
You know, there's a lot of variables

1281
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:10,062
in the street.

1282
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:15,109
I gotta go.

1283
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,361
Are you coming back?

1284
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:19,988
Yeah.

1285
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:22,699
I'm working it out. All right?

1286
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:26,870
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go,

1287
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:29,456
without killing them all.

1288
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:30,749
Bring it in.

1289
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:35,379
I love you, Daddy.

1290
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:36,547
Hmm.

1291
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,341
I love you.

1292
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:07,828
Hey! Let me out!

1293
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,872
Let me out of here right now!

1294
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:13,000
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1295
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:15,752
Let me out of here, darling, please.

1296
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:17,272
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1297
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:20,632
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1298
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,217
Come on!

1299
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:18,649
Pudding!

1300
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:22,653
Let's go home.

1301
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:49,466
This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

1302
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:52,511
And you do understand my legal exposure.

1303
01:54:52,677 --> 01:54:54,679
If anyone knew what I procured for you--

1304
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:58,100
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

1305
01:54:58,266 --> 01:54:59,476
What do you want?

1306
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:02,270
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

1307
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:04,117
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1308
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:07,234
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1309
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:09,986
Consider yourself under my protection.

1310
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:11,446
If you deliver.

1311
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,172
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1312
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:33,135
Just like to make friends.

1313
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:35,863
That's the difference between us.

1314
01:55:35,887 --> 01:55:38,223
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

1315
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:40,684
Good night.

1316
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:42,853
You look tired.

1317
01:55:43,019 --> 01:55:45,147
You should stop working nights.

1318
01:55:46,106 --> 01:55:50,110
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.
