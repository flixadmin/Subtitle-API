1
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,285
<i>Benji?</i>

2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,370
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,539
<i>Benji?</i>

4
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,875
<i>Shh.
-Where is Ethan?</i>

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,794
I can't talk right now.

6
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,714
<i>The package is on the plane.</i>

7
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,340
Yeah, I know.

8
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>We're currently formulating a plan B.
Although, technically, it's a plan C.</i>

9
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,054
This isn't going very well.

10
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.</i>

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,642
- Wher*e's Ethan?
-I don't know. We're on radio silence.

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,312
That plane cannot take off
with the package on it.

13
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,980
<i>Do you understand'?
-We'r*e working on it.</i>

14
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,733
Luther'?
What the hell are you doing there?

15
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,484
<i>You're supposed to be
on assignment in Malaysia!</i>

16
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,236
lam in Malaysia.
I've been here two days.

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,238
- Benji needed my help.
-I didn't need help.

18
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,782
I needed assistance.
It's a different thing.

19
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,034
The package is still on the plane.

20
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,455
<i>We understand the package
is on the plane.</i>

21
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,790
- We'r*e trying to cripple it remotely.
-You can do that?

22
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,627
We can if the pilot left
the satellite uplink switched on.

23
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,836
Which he has.

24
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,381
- And how do you access the uplink?
-It involves hacking a Russian satellite.

25
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,301
- I can't authorize that.
-Which is why I didn't ask permission.

26
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,095
We're under investigation
for misconduct.

27
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,389
The package is on board.
What do you want me to do?

28
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,025
Luther'.

29
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,027
I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji.

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,279
- The engines are starting.
-Yeah, I'm aware of that.

31
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,240
<i>But I can't do anything
until I'm connected t0 the satellite.</i>

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,326
Benji, you're connected.

33
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,619
Okay, great.

34
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,497
The package is still on that plane.

35
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,582
<i>Shut down the fuel pump.</i>

36
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,460
The mechanicals are locked down.

37
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,004
- What about the electrical system?
-That might work.

38
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,339
No.

39
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,299
<i>Hydraulics!
Okay, standby.</i>

40
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,926
No, they're encrypted.

41
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,012
Benji, the plane!

42
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,348
Yes! The package is on the plane!
We get it!

43
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,268
Can you open the door'?

44
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,604
Ethan? Where are you?

45
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,315
<i>I'm by the plane.
Benji, can you open the door'?</i>

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,818
Can I open the door'? Maybe.

47
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,986
Open the door when I tell you!

48
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,378
<i>I'm on the plane. Open the door.</i>

49
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,546
<i>How did you get in the plane?</i>

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,298
<i>Not in the plane. I'm on the plane!</i>

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,300
Open the door'!

52
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,890
Benji! Open the door'!

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,809
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay!

54
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,316
- Benji, open that door right now!
-Yeah, I'm trying!

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,292
Come on, Benji!
-Benji, open that door'!

56
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,669
Come on! Come on!

57
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,051
Come on!

58
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,219
Yes, got it!

59
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,393
That's the wrong door'!

60
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,187
Benji, not that door'. The other door'.

61
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,481
The other door', right!
Yes, the other door'.

62
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,691
Okay, yes! Sorry, my bad, my bad!

63
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,948
Check it out.

64
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,368
All right, look, I'm gonna open
the para door'! How's that?

65
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,810
We're about to close.

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,395
I won't be long.

67
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,148
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,359
Something Pare.

69
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,573
Let me guess.

70
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,576
Classical.

71
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,661
- Jazz.
Sax?

72
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,080
- C0ltr*ane.
-Pian0?

73
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,165
Monk.

74
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,084
Shadow Wilson on bass.

75
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,337
Shadow Wilson played drums.

76
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,548
Know why they call him Shadow?

77
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,426
Because he had a light touch.

78
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,803
You're in luck.

79
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,515
I have a first pressing.

80
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,734
It really is you.

81
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,197
I've heard stories.

82
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,908
They can't all be true.

83
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,932
<i>Good evening, Mr*. Hunt.</i>

84
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,811
<i>The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed t0 be VX nerve gas</i>

85
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,729
<i>capable of devastating a major city.</i>

86
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,148
<i>The bodies of the air crew were found</i>

87
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,068
<i>less than 24 hours
after they landed in Damascus.</i>

88
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,321
<i>They were identified as
low-level Chechen separatists</i>

89
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>with neither the access n0!" the ability</i>

90
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,450
<i>to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.</i>

91
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,995
<i>This would support your suspicion</i>

92
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,373
<i>that a shadow organization
is committed to inciting revolution</i>

93
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:22,085
<i>by enabling acts of terror
in nations friendly t0 Western interests.</i>

94
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,588
<i>IMF suspects this to be
the same shadow organization</i>

95
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,841
<i>you have been tracking for the last year,</i>

96
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,801
<i>also known as the Syndicate.</i>

97
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,345
<i>IMF would be right.</i>

98
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,806
<i>Normally, you and your team
would be tasked</i>

99
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,892
<i>with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network.</i>

100
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,604
<i>But we have taken steps t0 ensure
that this will not happen.</i>

101
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,274
<i>Because we are
the Syndicate, Mr'. Hunt.</i>

102
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>And now we know who you are.</i>

103
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,822
<i>Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to face your fate.</i>

104
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,201
<i>Pursue us, you will be caught.
Resist us, you will be killed.</i>

105
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:59,247
<i>And your precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.</i>

106
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,623
<i>Good luck, IVIP. Hunt.</i>

107
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,376
<i>This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

108
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,430
<i>Mr'. Chairman,
the IMF's misadventures date back</i>

109
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,349
to my earliest days at the CIA

110
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,937
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

111
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,106
And now, more recently,
a Russian warhead?

112
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,273
Disarmed Russian warhead.

113
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,859
- A Russian nuclear warhead...
Rendered safe by the IMF.

114
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,694
...clipped the Transarnerica Pyramid

115
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,613
before plunging into
the San Francisco Bay.

116
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,658
- Saving the western hemisphere.
-This made possible by IMF agents

117
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,662
who did willingly provide
the launch codes to a known terrorist.

118
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,038
Do I have that right, Agent Brandt?

119
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,126
I can neither confirm nor deny details

120
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,294
of any such operation
without the Secretary's approval.

121
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,214
This was the same Week that the IMF
infiltrated the Kremlin.

122
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,632
Here is the Kremlin before

123
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,302
and the Kremlin after'.

124
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,933
I can neither confirm nor deny details
of any operation...

125
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,768
Without the Secretary's approval,
yes, we know.

126
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,146
In fact, until this panel appoints
a new Secretary,

127
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,690
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?

128
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,233
Well, I didn't write the rules, Ml". Hunley.

129
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,069
Mr*. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Force

130
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,280
is not just a rogue organization.

131
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,284
It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency

132
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,869
-and without oversight.
-Mr*. Chairman?

133
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,538
- Time has come to dissolve the IMF...
-Mr*. Chairman?

134
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,000
...and transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA.

135
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,086
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 4O years.

136
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,839
- Mr*. Chairman?
-Ar*e its methods unorthodox? Yes.

137
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,842
Are its results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

138
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,553
- But Without the IMF...
-Ther*e will be order and stability!

139
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,013
Without the IMF...

140
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,895
This panel recognizes
the lMF's contribution to global security.

141
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,315
But the events laid out
by CIA Director Hunley

142
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,359
also show a pattern
of wanton brinksmanship

143
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,279
and a total disregard for protocol.

144
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,115
From where I sit,
your unorthodox methods

145
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,576
are indistinguishable from chance.

146
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,706
And your results, perfect or not,
look suspiciously like luck.

147
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm afraid today is the day
when the lMF's luck runs out.

148
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,063
What are you doing here'?

149
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,195
I said, what are you doing here'?

150
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,122
What does he see in you, I wonder'?

151
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,583
Who is "he"?

152
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,006
I want to see what he's made of.

153
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,261
Well, why don't you take off the cuffs
and I'll show you,

154
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,430
Vi nte P'?

155
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,186
You know who I am.

156
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,104
Janik Vinter'.

157
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,941
They call you the Bone Doctor'.

158
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,819
The funny thing is,

159
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,199
you were officially declared dead
three years ago.

160
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,909
Nice shoes, by the way.

161
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,621
Not his.

162
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,956
Yours.

163
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,715
Our instructions were to break him down...

164
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,966
...n0t kill him.

165
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,261
Some guys break different than others.

166
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,140
This one's a fighter'.

167
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,726
He'll die before you turn him.

168
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,645
Are you worried
he's going to take your place?

169
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,035
You should go before it gets ugly.

170
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,417
Yeah, he's right. You should go.

171
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,392
So now let's see how tough you are.

172
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,146
Janik.

173
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,356
We've never met before, right?

174
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,776
Follow me.

175
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,285
Give me the gun!

176
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,000
- What are you doing?
-I can't leave.

177
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,169
You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

178
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,797
We didn't kill them, you did.

179
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,299
I tried to stop you. You got away.

180
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,803
Who are you?

181
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,806
You better hurry now. Good luck.

182
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,724
No, wait! Wait!

183
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,226
Where is he'?

184
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,812
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

185
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,648
Run. He's getting away. HURRY.

186
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,413
<i>Setcom seven.
-Wester*n Europe unsecured.</i>

187
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,790
Designator'?
Bra vo-Echo- 7- 7.

188
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,874
Connecting.

189
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,836
- This <i>is Brandt.
- Go secure.</i>

190
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,755
Go.

191
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,842
<i>London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.</i>

192
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,928
Agent in place is down.
Request immediate extraction.

193
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,638
What happened?
Who breached London?

194
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,473
<i>Do you have anything t0 g0 on?</i>

195
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,683
A face.

196
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,437
<i>He wanted something. Not information.
He could've killed me.</i>

197
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,063
But he didn't.

198
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,734
- Okay. What do you think it means?
-The Syndicate is real.

199
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,820
They know who we are, how we operate.

200
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,906
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

201
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,577
Just focus operations on gathering
any available intel regarding

202
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,078
former covert operatives.

203
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,247
It doesn't matter
what country or agency,

204
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,583
just as long as they're dead
or presumed dead.

205
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,044
Start with Janik Vinter'.

206
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,171
<i>He's also known as the Bone Doctor.</i>

207
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,380
I can't do that.

208
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,758
What? What are you talking about?

209
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,677
The Committee has shut us down.

210
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,347
Operations have been handed over
to the CIA.

211
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,976
<i>There is no more IMF.
I've been ordered t0 bring everyone in.</i>

212
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,355
<i>Ethan...</i>
- I <i>understand.</i>

213
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,273
<i>Ethan...</i>
- I understand, Brandt.

214
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,067
We didn't have this conversation.

215
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,445
I've disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

216
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>If I'm dead or alive.</i>

217
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,115
This man you saw, can you find him?

218
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,244
I Won't stop until I do.

219
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,998
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

220
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,917
Make it count.

221
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,418
Brandt?

222
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,690
<i>Since we're going
to be working together,</i>

223
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,608
<i>I want you to choose
your next words very carefully.</i>

224
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,151
Where is Hunt?

225
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,195
- I don't know.
-Don't lie to me, Brandt.

226
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,781
I have no way of contacting him.
He's deep cover'.

227
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,700
Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

228
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,287
Let's cut the bull. You know who we are,
you know what we're capable of.

229
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,039
How come the CIA has never discovered

230
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,792
any actionable intel
regarding this Syndicate?

231
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,837
- What are you implying?
-Not implying. Stating.

232
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,131
Leveling an accusation, actually.

233
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,384
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

234
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,303
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination,

235
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,223
created to justify the lMF's existence.

236
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,059
I am going to find him, Brandt,
and when I do,

237
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,853
he will be called upon to answer for

238
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,231
every wanton act of mayhem
he is responsible for'.

239
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,485
Welcome to the CIA.

240
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
You'll never find him.

241
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,327
Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt
is living his last day as a free man.

242
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,845
All right, everybody, heads up! This is it.

243
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,766
<i>- Alpha team prepped, standing by.
-Execute.</i>

244
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,935
Langley, Brimstone. Go.
I say again, we are go.

245
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,744
<i>Langley, there's nobody here.</i>

246
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,295
Langley, Brimstone. Face the north Wall.

247
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,947
Dunn.

248
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,035
Is it that time already? Okay.

249
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,289
I will ask you
a series of control questions.

250
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,041
I know, and I'm gonna answer truthfully,

251
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,460
and then you're gonna ask me
to lie intentionally.

252
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,962
- State your name.
-The King of Norway.

253
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,006
See, that's a lie.

254
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,635
I'm actually third in line to the throne.
My brother was...

255
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,386
Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?

256
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,513
- Why would he contact me?
-Hunt has resurfaced.

257
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,182
This time in Cuba.

258
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,352
He left these behind.

259
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,313
Tell me What you make of them.

260
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,815
I don't know.
He's taken up scrapbooking?

261
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,233
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

262
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,111
All of them are either missing or dead.
Every one.

263
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,197
All of them were government agents.

264
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,407
Russian, French, British, Israeli,
you name it.

265
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,703
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no trouble collecting them.

266
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,122
And he always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

267
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,624
I wonder how.

268
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,210
- Ar*e you suggesting I'm helping him?
-The thought had crossed my mind.

269
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,629
Six months I have been here,

270
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,883
sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

271
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,137
I have decrypted, processed, parsed
more data than anyone in my section.

272
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,098
And yet, every week you haul me in here

273
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,059
and you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

274
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,979
And today you haven't answered it.

275
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,567
You seem to think
I have some kind of obligation to him.

276
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,696
Okay. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

277
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,699
Ethan Hunt is still out therein the field,

278
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,618
and I am stuck here answering for it.

279
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,162
We are not friends.

280
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,666
I owe him nothing.

281
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,424
That'll be all, Dunn.

282
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,401
<i>Welcome t0 Vienna, Benji. Miss me?</i>

283
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,029
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

284
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,989
You know what?
Please, don't tell me that.

285
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,034
Because it's just another thing I'll have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

286
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,119
<i>Everything3 gonna be fine.
Just keep walking.</i>

287
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,288
<i>But make sure
you're not being followed.</i>

288
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,332
I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?

289
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,792
<i>No, I'm afraid not.</i>

290
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>So, where do we meet'?
-We don't.</i>

291
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,129
<i>For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.</i>

292
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,255
<i>You have mail.</i>

293
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,051
<i>- Who is he?
Jhetis whet We '/"e he/"e t0 find out.</i>

294
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,304
<i>What I do know is he's our
only possible link t0 the Syndicate.</i>

295
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,848
<i>And I have reason to believe
he's going t0 be here tonight.</i>

296
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,851
<i>But I can't find him alone. Are you in?</i>

297
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,603
<i>Are you in?</i>

298
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,355
Yes, of course. Of course.

299
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,940
So what's the play?

300
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,819
<i>Simple. You find him. We tag him.
I follow him wherever he goes.</i>

301
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,070
And after that'?

302
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,613
<i>After that, you're on a plane.</i>

303
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,658
<i>Back at work Monday morning.
No one is the wiser.</i>

304
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,286
<i>- Wait, that's it?
- Y0u '/"e in enough danger as it is.</i>

305
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,914
<i>I didn't want to involve you this much,
but I had no choice.</i>

306
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,582
Well, if you're going to bring me
all this way,

307
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,752
you could at least give me something
a bit more, you know, dramatic.

308
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,630
<i>Benji, We're trying t0 keep a low profile.</i>

309
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,259
<i>You Want drama, g0 t0 the opera.</i>

310
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,623
- Ar*e you seeing what I'm seeing?
Yea <i>lam.</i>

311
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,967
<i>Am I correct in assuming
that is the Chancellor of Austria?</i>

312
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,468
Yes, you are.

313
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,346
<i>- Did you know he was going to be here?
No.</i>

314
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,391
<i>Right. Well, we have
a European head of state here</i>

315
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,270
<i>at the same time as we are looking
for a nefarious terrorist.</i>

316
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,064
<i>And I'm sure that the two things
are completely unrelated.</i>

317
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,149
Benji.

318
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,817
<i>Meanwhile, I will try and overlook
the fact that</i>

319
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,570
<i>you're an international fugitive
wanted by the CIA!</i>

320
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,990
<i>And that this little unsanctioned
operation is tantamount t0 treason.</i>

321
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,744
<i>Because, as you stated earlier, I will be
back at my desk on Monday morning,</i>

322
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,413
playing videogames,
and no one will be any the wiser'.

323
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,873
<i>- The sh0w's about t0 start, Benji.
Phght.</i>

324
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,208
<i>Just take your position.</i>

325
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,667
<i>-7'e// me What you see.</i>
- Okay.

326
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,169
<i>Nice tux, by the way.</i>

327
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,066
Lights ready, Act One preset.

328
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,576
Final preparations complete.

329
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,828
Everyone standby please.

330
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,241
Join the IMF! See the World!

331
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,244
On a monitor'. In a closet.

332
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,996
Okay, I have eyes.

333
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,290
Searching.

334
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,728
Talk to me, Benji.

335
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,271
Nothing yet. Stand by.

336
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,693
I know you're here. Where are you?

337
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,828
Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm.

338
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,663
- Wher*e?
Backstage. I'll direct you.

339
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,089
<i>Take the door on your left.</i>

340
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,007
He should be right in front of you.

341
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,884
Benji, do you see that?

342
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,218
<i>See what?</i>

343
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,722
- That woman.
-What woman? Where are you?

344
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,223
I can't see you.

345
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,613
What was that?

346
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,114
I don't know.

347
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,963
Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in!

348
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,774
Ethan, the lighting booth!

349
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,192
Ethan, do you copy?

350
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,072
It's just a fleshwound.

351
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,701
Seal the building. Close the exits.

352
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,873
I have a way out. Interested?

353
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,793
Lead the way.

354
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,013
Anything you want to tell me?
-No, not right now.

355
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,849
- H0w's the pace?
-Don't wait for me.

356
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,817
What's next?

357
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,364
There.

358
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,082
Shoes.

359
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,250
Shoes, please.

360
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,266
If anything were to happen to you -

361
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,144
N0thing's going to happen to me.

362
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,104
STOP THE CAR.

363
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,239
Get in!

364
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,701
Go, go, go.

365
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,295
What the... She tried to shoot me!

366
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,505
That doesn't make her a bad person.

367
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,883
I'm going to have to search you.

368
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,552
- You have to let me go.
-Not a chance!

369
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,345
I assumed you were deep cover
back in London,

370
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,139
but isn't this taking the Pole a little far'?

371
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,724
Hang on a minute. Do you know her'?

372
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,225
We haven't been formally introduced,

373
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,686
but I'm pretty sure
she's British intelligence?

374
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,105
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

375
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,692
And that shade is very hard to find.

376
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,320
What were you doing
at the opera tonight?

377
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,905
Aside from killing the Chancellor'.

378
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,365
Saving your life in London
put me in a tight spot

379
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,409
with some very dangerous people.

380
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,453
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

381
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,538
So you admit that you killed him!

382
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,708
I Went through the motions.
That's not the same thing.

383
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,460
You thought you'd put him
in the hospital,

384
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,920
take him out of harm's way.

385
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,088
Same thing you tried to do.

386
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,547
You're not going to
believe that, are you?

387
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,007
What about the Pest of her team?

388
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,926
You mean those other two idiots.

389
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,761
I can only assume
they were redundancies.

390
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,889
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

391
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,433
the other one to kill you.

392
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,728
- A test.
Second one I've failed, thanks to you.

393
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,189
And the car bomb was insurance.

394
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,861
We have a tail.

395
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,657
Who is he?

396
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,284
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

397
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,121
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you have to let me out.

398
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,288
They're closing!

399
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,709
This has to look like an escape,
so you just throw me out anywhere.

400
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,419
Tell me who he is.

401
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,383
Change of plan! Throw her out!

402
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,720
You have everything you need
to find me.

403
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:19,282
<i>Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt,</i>

404
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,743
he was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

405
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,746
And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

406
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,207
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,

407
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,252
but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

408
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,337
Consider for the moment
the possibility that

409
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,840
Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,

410
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,550
and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!

411
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,762
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.

412
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:45,433
The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.

413
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,685
You mean shoot to kill.

414
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:52,190
Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.

415
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,376
New identity.

416
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,920
Passport, cash, move map.

417
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,296
There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.

418
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,007
Everything you need
to make it to DC. undetected.

419
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,218
Once you're there,
you have to inform on me.

420
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,887
-L'rn sorry, What?
-Just tell the truth.

421
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,807
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

422
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,434
I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.

423
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,978
- You refused.
-That's not the truth!

424
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,438
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

425
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,774
It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear'.

426
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,361
Ethan, at least tell me
What this is all about.

427
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,870
You recognize anyone?

428
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,260
Him.

429
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,387
He's former KSA. German intelligence.

430
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,055
Missing, presumed dead.

431
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,975
He was at the opera tonight.

432
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,435
This one, too.

433
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,270
Former Mossad.

434
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,980
Let me guess. Presumed dead.

435
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,773
Tonight, I made it official.

436
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,902
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

437
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,489
The same clay, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

438
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,576
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

439
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,455
hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

440
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,749
with 236 passengers.

441
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,877
I just missed him in the Philippines

442
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,171
right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant

443
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,214
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

444
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:27,136
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

445
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,891
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

446
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,604
That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.

447
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,274
That wreck triggered a civil war.

448
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,861
These are no accidents.

449
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,113
They're links in a chain.

450
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,450
The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate.

451
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,620
A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,

452
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,413
imbued with a new sense of purpose.

453
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,459
Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.

454
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,879
An a nti-I M F.

455
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:06,175
Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

456
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,761
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,

457
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,471
the start of a new phase.

458
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,683
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

459
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,311
He was there.

460
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:19,980
Every time.

461
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,316
Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it.

462
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,278
I don't know who he is, where he's from,

463
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,906
how he's funded.

464
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,825
But I know he's the key.

465
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:34,787
Ethan, this is What I signed up for'.
Let me help you find him.

466
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,664
That's why I brought you here
in the first place,

467
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,290
and look what happened!

468
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,792
I can't protect you.

469
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,169
That's why I need you to leave.

470
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,797
That's not your decision to make, Ethan!

471
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,134
I am a field agent. I know the risks.

472
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,844
More than that, I am your friend,

473
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,887
no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.

474
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,932
Now, you called me
because you needed my help.

475
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,309
And you still do. So I am staying.

476
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,521
And that is all
we are going to say about that.

477
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,734
Okay.

478
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,070
Good.

479
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,031
Where do we start?

480
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,410
Ilsa.

481
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,039
Right. And how do we find her'?

482
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,584
She said we have everything we need.

483
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,584
We had an agreement.

484
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,129
You send me to do a job, I do it.
But my way, not yours.

485
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,547
Where did I deviate?

486
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,633
You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight.

487
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,926
One of them tried to kill me.

488
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,469
You missed.

489
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,180
I missed because Ethan Hunt was there
looking for you.

490
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,642
Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because
you allowed him to escape in London.

491
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,937
Vinter would have killed him in London,
and that's not what you asked for'.

492
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,273
Twice now you've let him slip away.

493
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,109
Curious.

494
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,363
Are you questioning my loyalty
or my ability?

495
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,701
- Can't decide.
-I've told you before, trust me or kill me.

496
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,995
But if you're going to kill me, be a man.

497
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,749
Do it yourself.

498
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,029
Did he say anything?

499
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,449
He knows about Morocco.

500
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,660
What does he know about Morocco?

501
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,164
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

502
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,001
Find him, please.

503
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,296
He'll find me.

504
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,173
I've seen to that.

505
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,722
That's interesting.

506
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,307
- What is it?
-it's a skiff.

507
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,226
A secure computer facility.
Offline, ultra-contained.

508
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,270
It's impossible to hack into
from the outside.

509
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,939
It's essentially
a digital safety deposit box.

510
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,359
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

511
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:53,902
Where's it located?

512
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,280
Morocco.

513
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,617
Morocco.

514
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,070
And what brings you gentlemen
to Casablanca?

515
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,060
Good to see you.

516
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,479
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

517
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,984
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

518
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,778
We believe that
Ethan and Benji were there.

519
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,157
Hunley has handed this over
to the Special Activities Division.

520
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,618
We need to find Ethan before they do.

521
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,204
And that's where you come in.

522
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,750
Not interested.

523
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,670
Okay, look, Luther'...
-Look, man, I know Ethan.

524
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,213
I don't know you.

525
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,925
All I know about you
is that you chose to work for Hunley.

526
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,511
All I know about you
is you chose to resign.

527
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:29,433
You don't have to worry about Ethan.
They'll never catch him.

528
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,268
No, they're not gonna catch him. No.

529
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,771
This is the CIA.
This is Hunley we're talking about.

530
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,940
Things are out of control.
No, they're going to kill him.

531
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,611
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

532
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,072
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

533
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,248
You need to understand something.

534
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,877
Ethan is my friend.

535
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,048
And if I have one second of doubt
whose side you're on...

536
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,178
I believe you.

537
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,765
- All right.
-All right.

538
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,891
What do I have to go on?

539
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,478
Not much. And not a lot of time.

540
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,440
<i>His name is Solomon Lane.</i>

541
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,943
He created the Syndicate.

542
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,778
Where does he come from?

543
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,864
He's former British intelligence.

544
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,660
Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,

545
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,829
why don't they just tell the CIA?

546
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,664
Because they don't want
anyone knowing

547
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,708
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

548
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,337
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust

549
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,674
and eventually identify the members
of his organization.

550
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,928
And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.

551
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,264
Lane had a ledger'.

552
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,434
It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,

553
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,229
the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.

554
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,357
One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,

555
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,570
and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.

556
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,364
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

557
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,157
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

558
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,871
So the key to crushing Lane

559
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,957
is sitting in a computer',
just waiting for someone to take it.

560
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,420
So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?

561
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,505
He has.

562
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,632
He sent me.

563
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:27,801
And I can tell you

564
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,804
it's impossible.

565
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,520
The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.

566
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,355
And the only way to download the ledger

567
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,317
is through the central
computer terminal, located there.

568
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,029
<i>To reach the terminal,
you'll need t0 pass the main gate,</i>

569
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,033
<i>access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,</i>

570
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,329
<i>and open
three separate combination locks.</i>

571
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,170
<i>Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent</i>

572
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,006
who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!

573
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,698
Unfortunately, even if you could
make it through

574
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,618
every other security measure,
you won't beat the last one.

575
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,287
<i>That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.</i>

576
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,539
<i>The step beyond facial recognition.</i>

577
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,209
<i>These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,</i>

578
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,877
<i>how he talks, how he moves.</i>

579
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,213
<i>Right down t0 his facial tics.</i>

580
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,098
<i>So, what you're saying is
no mask can beat it.</i>

581
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,432
We're busted before we even get
into the vault,

582
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,892
and lwind up in a Moroccan jail,

583
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,561
playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler.

584
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,188
Okay, I don't get to wear a mask.

585
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,357
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

586
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,692
No other way in.

587
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,902
- Air* shaft?
Six-inch-diameter' pipe.

588
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:09,987
Foundaflon?

589
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,863
Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom.

590
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,824
Electrical conduit.
Electrical conduit.

591
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,617
Bottom line is there's no way
into that terminal

592
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,996
unless your profile is preinstalled
in the security system.

593
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,082
Profile.

594
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,001
Where are the profiles stored?

595
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,338
All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array.

596
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,924
Here, inside the torus.

597
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,427
Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?

598
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,053
- Yes.
-Yes.

599
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,306
Okay. So, to get the ledger',

600
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,142
<i>one of us needs to enter the torus</i>

601
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,854
<i>and change the security profile,</i>

602
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,859
<i>so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.</i>

603
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,530
- That's the only way.
-That's the only way.

604
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,784
Can I get in through there? What's that?

605
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,121
That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside.

606
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,998
If you try and open it from the outside,

607
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,209
you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water'.

608
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,419
Where does the water come from?

609
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,881
Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.

610
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,009
And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automatically

611
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,011
if any metal enters the intake.

612
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,555
No oxygen tanks.

613
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,102
All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swim

614
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,771
from the intake to the service hatch?

615
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,814
Two minutes,
with the current at full power'.

616
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,900
Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes.

617
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,194
What about installing
the security profile?

618
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,404
Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops.

619
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,073
So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes.

620
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,657
You can do that.

621
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,826
What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion.

622
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,954
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

623
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,666
Don't worry about him, all right?
All he has to do is install the fake profile

624
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,253
before I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way.

625
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,214
That doesn't sound impossible.

626
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,513
Satellite overwatch
covering all seven continents.

627
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,225
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

628
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,977
So, how are we supposed to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

629
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,064
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her'.

630
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,525
What do you mean?

631
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,112
These sketches. What do you see?

632
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,699
Ethan's not exactly sure who this guy is.

633
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,203
But this Woman...

634
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,581
- He knows her'.
-He trusts her'.

635
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,835
I'm betting that if he's not already
with her', he's on his way.

636
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,545
Find her', find Ethan.

637
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,047
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition off a sketch.

638
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,757
For mere mortals, no.

639
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,885
- F0r* me, I c0uld've done this at home.
-All right.

640
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,350
- How long is this gonna take?
-F0und her'.

641
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,566
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

642
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,443
What the hell?

643
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,488
She's bad news.

644
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:28,977
Sorry.

645
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,717
Your card isn't working.

646
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,135
<i>Benji, we're in.</i>

647
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,348
One more time.
You'll have three minutes.

648
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,310
Two and a half minutes
to switch the security profile.

649
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:54,729
Thirty seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

650
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,274
Remember', conserve oxygen.

651
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,276
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

652
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,671
I'm in the elevator'.

653
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,934
That current will carry you to the torus.

654
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,728
Once you're there, I'll shut it down.

655
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,399
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

656
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,819
And a slightly more important note.
If you haven't switched that profile

657
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,405
before I Peach the gait analysis,
I'm dead.

658
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,324
Thank you, Benji.

659
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,061
What's the problem?

660
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,356
The cooling system's rebooting by itself.

661
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,901
All systems normal.

662
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,153
Cooling system's at full power'.

663
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,369
No, no, no.

664
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,203
You're all right.

665
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,621
You're okay.

666
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,915
You see? What did I tell you?

667
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,751
Difficult? Absolutely. But certainly not...

668
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,506
Jesus. Is he all right? What happened?

669
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,729
Okay.

670
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:34,939
Here.

671
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:37,984
H 9V-

672
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,694
I misjudged you.

673
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,618
Hey, man. You okay? How you doing?

674
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,287
Hey, buddy.

675
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,458
- Benji.
-Yeah, Benji. You did good.

676
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,085
You take a moment, all right?
Just take a moment.

677
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,713
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air' won't fix.

678
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,882
- You'll be right as Pain.
-What are you doing here?

679
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:02,925
Look, look.

680
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,510
We got it.

681
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,512
I knew we'd get it.

682
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,433
Listen, I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay?

683
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,477
I appreciate everything you do for me,

684
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,354
but one of these days,
you're going to take it too far'.

685
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,232
We got it!

686
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:19,901
We're gonna nail that...

687
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,370
Wait, wait...

688
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,752
-I thought you said you could find him.
-l said I could locate him.

689
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,629
- You have to find him.
Right.

690
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,566
Where's Hunt?

691
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:07,990
He's dead.

692
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,742
That really hurts!

693
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,035
- Can you walk?
-Yes.

694
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,830
We have to get to her before Lane does.

695
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,717
Are you okay to drive?
A minute ago you were dead.

696
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,427
What are you talking about?

697
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,013
This is not going to end well.

698
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:23,983
There she is!

699
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,330
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

700
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,831
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

701
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,835
God damn it!

702
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:28,047
We found him.

703
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,716
Come on, man!

704
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,471
Shit!

705
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,099
It's a high-speed chase!

706
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,393
You just had to get the four-by-four',
didn't you?

707
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,145
- Don't blame me. You chose the car'.
-You just had to have it!

708
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,564
- Do you want me to drive?
-Look at this thing!

709
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,483
Look how slow you're going.
Speed it up!

710
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,906
Who's this guy?

711
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,159
Shit!

712
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:25,563
Go! Go! Go!

713
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,277
I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay!

714
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,963
Here they come!
What are we gonna do?

715
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:05,936
Gun!

716
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,151
- Do you have your seatbelt on?
-You'r*e asking me that now?

717
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,660
Hang on!

718
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:02,493
We good?

719
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,579
Things got a little out of hand.

720
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:07,706
Look out!

721
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,089
We're good?

722
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,057
Hey, boys, what did I miss?

723
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,565
That looks sharp. Careful! Careful!

724
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,456
So what do we do now?

725
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:23,462
Please tell me
you made a copy of that disk.

726
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,050
Of course I made a copy.

727
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,476
So where are we going?

728
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:05,421
It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

729
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,005
Who they are,
the politicians they control,

730
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,384
and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know.

731
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:15,097
What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?

732
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,225
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

733
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,477
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

734
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:24,064
Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?

735
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,650
Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.

736
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,360
It's what he's trained to do.

737
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,572
Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt.

738
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,783
Together', you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.

739
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,035
This may be authentic.

740
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:41,832
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

741
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,586
No.

742
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:50,048
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

743
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:51,758
Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate

744
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:55,012
that We may learn more
about them firsthand.

745
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,514
This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else.

746
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,017
The only way to pass is to go back.

747
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,146
I can't do that. I've betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

748
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,732
And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition.

749
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,443
He was going to torture and kill
an American agent.

750
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,905
And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust.

751
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,157
This is the trade. Hunt understands that.

752
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,659
I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally.

753
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:21,830
There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests.

754
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:25,292
As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country.

755
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,922
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

756
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,675
Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?

757
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,094
Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No.

758
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,847
Lane will order you.

759
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,184
And to regain his trust,

760
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,353
you will do it.

761
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:49,775
You sent me to do a job. I did it.

762
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,528
Now you bring me in!

763
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:55,280
Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?

764
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:00,327
The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally.

765
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,704
Of course, to protect your cover',
I had to lie.

766
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,373
So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,

767
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,292
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

768
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,421
Precious few people know
about your true identity.

769
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:15,801
It would be unfortunate if we forgot.

770
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,805
You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa.

771
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,848
You're going back.

772
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,150
Glad to know you're still with us.

773
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:43,287
- What's happening?
-I can't open it.

774
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:47,249
- What do you mean, you can't open it?
-I mean I can't open it, ever'.

775
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,917
That's a red box.

776
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,669
- A what?
-it's a red box.

777
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,213
The British government uses them
to transport state secrets.

778
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,300
- Doesn't sound good.
-Meaning it's triple-encrypted.

779
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,509
You're not getting into that thing

780
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,636
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan,

781
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:03,098
and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual.

782
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,142
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

783
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:06,393
Yes, him.

784
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,604
So what you're saying is
there is no ledger',

785
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:11,064
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.

786
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:14,693
So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA.

787
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,154
I'm so proud of us.

788
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,656
What I don't understand is
why is there a red box

789
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,200
sat in a private data vault in Morocco?

790
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,953
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

791
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,914
If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it.

792
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,043
And We just helped him steal it.

793
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,965
He's going to take the Prime Minister'.

794
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:40,344
Yes, he is. The question is how.

795
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,095
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

796
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,305
Yeah, IVIIB.

797
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,224
No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute.

798
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,310
We have a responsibility
to warn the British government

799
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,605
and not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,

800
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:56,109
just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn.

801
01:25:58,528 --> 01:26:00,113
Is that What you think this is?

802
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:01,990
Brandt?

803
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,411
Is that What you think this is?

804
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:11,083
I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way.

805
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,795
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

806
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:18,131
And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna allover again!

807
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:19,424
You don't know him.

808
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,511
If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!

809
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,513
That's why we have to warn the British.

810
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,848
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

811
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,309
Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British.

812
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,728
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,

813
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,106
before he takes the Prime Minister'.

814
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,278
Okay.

815
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,781
All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

816
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,451
But please tell me
how are we going to do that?

817
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,743
All is forgiven.

818
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:30,078
That isn't a ledger', is it?

819
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,122
You didn't take a look for yourself?

820
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:35,250
Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted.

821
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,419
And why would I lie to you?

822
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,463
So that I would lie to Hunt.

823
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,592
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

824
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,928
And you wouldn't have helped him.

825
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,599
What is actually on that disk?

826
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,977
I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me.

827
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,982
Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?

828
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,905
You're still alive
because I believe in your potential.

829
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,865
But I'm growing impatient.

830
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,535
Why do you continue to resist?

831
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,460
Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist.

832
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,463
If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear'.

833
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:25,717
But my method is far more surgical.

834
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,638
You kill innocent people.

835
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,099
I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more.

836
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,893
So much more.

837
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,021
Killing to keep things as they were.

838
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,650
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

839
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,153
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

840
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:49,407
Ethan Hunt is a gambler'.
And one day his luck will Pun out,

841
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,953
and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

842
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,831
Which one of us will be the villain then?

843
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,128
Nothing here. It's empty.

844
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,606
I'm interested to see who you blame

845
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,402
for what happens next.

846
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,117
So that's her'?

847
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:15,619
That's her'.

848
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:23,585
I have to say you sure can ride.

849
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,007
- Ethan...
-You were just doing your job.

850
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:31,718
That's all we're going to say about it.

851
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,722
Atlee said you would understand.

852
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,475
Atlee.
Your handler in British intelligence.

853
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,272
And he didn't bring you in,

854
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,692
even after you gave him the disk.

855
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,196
You knew perfectly well it was blank.

856
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,198
<i>That's a lie.</i>

857
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,742
The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm sure of it.

858
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,203
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

859
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,134
They don't care if you live or die.

860
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,894
But you knew
I was going to take it to him.

861
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,856
I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out.

862
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,860
That means Lane doesn't have the disk.
Only we do.

863
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,404
I have a question.

864
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,949
If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?

865
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:39,869
<i>Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her.</i>

866
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,540
So who you working for now?

867
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,628
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

868
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:50,964
We only think
we're fighting for the right side

869
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,924
because that's what
we choose to believe.

870
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,136
So where does that leave us?

871
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:59,097
The way I see it,
you have three choices.

872
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:02,642
One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA.

873
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,978
I am proof the Syndicate exists.

874
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:08,314
Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.

875
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:10,567
- My thoughts exactly.
-W0r*ks for me.

876
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,527
But you know
they're not gonna believe you.

877
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:15,113
And you'll all be tried for treason.

878
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,032
Lane goes free.

879
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,075
I'm afraid she has a point.

880
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,620
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

881
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:26,332
You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.

882
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,253
But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.

883
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,048
And being a gambler', you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,

884
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,716
whether you want to or not.

885
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,968
That is entirely possible.

886
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:39,012
And option three?

887
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,139
Come away with me.

888
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,142
Right now.

889
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,105
Oh, boy.

890
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:53,985
And What about Lane?

891
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,112
Forget about Lane.

892
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:58,698
There will always be another Lane.

893
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,951
There will always be people like us
to face him.

894
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:06,164
We've done our part
and we've been east aside.

895
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,167
We can be anyone.

896
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,669
We can do anything.

897
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:15,673
It's only a matter of going.

898
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,773
Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?

899
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,734
I've saved your life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

900
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,153
What's the message?

901
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,376
Benji.

902
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,557
Parking garage.

903
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,267
Luther', stay with her'!

904
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,710
She's gone. I lost her'.

905
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:38,715
She set us up, Ethan.

906
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:41,384
No. She delivered a message.

907
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:44,345
She set us up!
She knew this would happen!

908
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,265
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen!

909
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,023
<i>I have a job for you, Ethan.</i>

910
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:57,817
<i>And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.</i>

911
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:58,902
I'm listening.

912
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:02,030
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

913
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:05,700
<i>is t0 bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight tonight.</i>

914
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,452
<i>Now say the words, please.</i>

915
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,205
laccept

916
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:12,373
Yes.

917
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,502
I knew you would.

918
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:28,640
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight.

919
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:33,144
Ethan, there's only one person on Earth
who can unlock that disk.

920
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:36,981
We have to take the Prime Minister'.

921
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,485
Let's just think about that for a minute.

922
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,239
It's the only way to get Benji back.

923
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:47,158
Ethan, that's exactly
what Lane wants you to do.

924
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:50,620
Which is why it has to happen.

925
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,335
This is how we beat Lane.

926
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,004
This is how we make everything right.

927
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:01,589
Can you see?

928
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,342
Can't you see it?

929
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,359
William Brandt, sir'. He says it's urgent.

930
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,449
I had a feeling
you'd come to your senses, Brandt.

931
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,119
I'm only calling you
because I have no other choice.

932
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,870
I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.

933
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:34,872
<i>I can understand that. Where are you?</i>

934
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,211
- London.
-F?er*0ute us to London now.

935
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:43,298
<i>- VVher"e</i> in <i>London?</i>
-I'll <i>tell you when you land not before.</i>

936
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,466
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

937
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:48,428
And I'm not interested
in seeing my friends get killed either'.

938
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,930
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going do this on my terms

939
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,807
and my terms only. Do you understand?

940
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,226
<i>Keep your phone on.
Instructions will follow.</i>

941
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:04,402
- You sh0uld've been gone by now.
-Yeah.

942
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,115
You okay?

943
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:13,661
We're supposed to take down

944
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,455
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain tonight.

945
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:17,874
So...

946
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,085
Brandt?

947
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:27,050
I can't see another way.

948
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:30,887
Neither can I.

949
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,184
But we do what we have to do
for our friends, right?

950
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,480
Get him ready, please.

951
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,174
You were right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

952
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:52,135
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

953
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:54,971
- What does he intend to do?
-What matters is that he's alive.

954
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:58,015
And I need your reassurance
that he's going to stay that way.

955
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,825
Have you informed
the British government

956
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,785
that Hunt has targeted
the Prime Minister'?

957
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:21,330
I will help you capture him alive.
That is the deal.

958
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:30,840
You've picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt,

959
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:34,427
the worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

960
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:36,929
Stay with him.

961
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:43,144
Chief Atlee! Chief Atlee.

962
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:45,563
Director Hunley,
how delightful to see you here.

963
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:49,484
Last time we spoke, you were hunting
rogue agents in Morocco.

964
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:53,529
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger'.

965
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:57,909
I'm listening.

966
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:04,749
Any advance on 22,000? Anyone?

967
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,335
Going once. Going twice.

968
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:10,046
Sold to our generous chairwoman.

969
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:13,633
Sir'? Chief Atlee from IVIIB
needs to see you.

970
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,259
He says it's urgent.

971
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,304
Excuse me.

972
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,233
What's this all about?

973
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:32,568
It's a matter of national security, sir'.

974
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:42,620
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter'.

975
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:44,080
Yes, sir'.

976
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,124
<i>Help me t0 understand.</i>

977
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:50,878
Who is this man? Why is he after me?

978
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,714
I'm afraid, Prime Minister,
Director Hunley and I

979
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:56,050
share responsibility for this.

980
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:59,136
Ethan Hunt was part of
a disgraced intelligence agency

981
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,429
which has since been dissolved.

982
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,847
And he's gone rogue,

983
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:05,518
unfortunately intent on dismantling
an imaginary terror network.

984
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,145
But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulated

985
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,064
by one of your own former agents.

986
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:13,025
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister'.
She disappeared two years ago.

987
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,904
If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?

988
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:20,074
Sir', this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

989
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:23,327
He came forward with firsthand
knowledge of the plot against you.

990
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:26,080
Sir', Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red box

991
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:27,999
that can only be opened by you.

992
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:31,502
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

993
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:35,089
The Syndicate, you say?

994
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,009
Yes, sir'. That's what he calls it.

995
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:40,011
Atlee?

996
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,222
He couldn't possibly be talking about

997
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:44,682
that Syndicate.

998
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:51,314
Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise.

999
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:54,775
And it was, Prime Minister',
I can assure you.

1000
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:55,860
And yet here we have

1001
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,112
the Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise.

1002
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,572
I don't understand.

1003
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,741
Prime Minister', your life is in danger'.

1004
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:05,286
I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location.

1005
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:08,247
Sir', does the name Solomon Lane
Ping a bell?

1006
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:11,709
Yes.

1007
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:15,713
Unfortunately, it does.

1008
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:20,885
So there actually is a Syndicate?

1009
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:25,306
It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1010
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,434
Recruit former agents
from other nations,

1011
01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:29,894
supply them with a new identity,

1012
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:33,731
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1013
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:36,817
Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore

1014
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,904
in a virtual red box
which I alone would control.

1015
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:43,074
It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner',

1016
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,408
with zero accountability.

1017
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:47,161
I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.

1018
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,914
Furthermore,
I was given every assurance

1019
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,832
it never passed the planning stage.

1020
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:54,460
Prime Minister', there is no Syndicate.

1021
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:57,088
These men have been duped
by Agent Faust.

1022
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:00,508
Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.

1023
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,301
Sir', I urge you not to leave this room.

1024
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:03,594
Excuse me.
Please.

1025
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,555
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1026
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,017
A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures.

1027
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,353
There is no secret he cannot extract.

1028
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:15,773
No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become.

1029
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:20,236
He has, most likely,
anticipated this very conversation

1030
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:23,197
and is waiting to strike
in whatever direction we move.

1031
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,368
Sir', Hunt is the living manifestation
of destiny.

1032
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:30,037
And he has made you his mission.

1033
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,040
Prime Minister'?

1034
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:50,141
Hunt

1035
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:53,227
Sir', please step away
from the Prime Minister'.

1036
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,650
Just relax, sir'.
Everything5 going to be all right.

1037
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:02,319
- Atlee shot me.
-Yes, he did, sir'.

1038
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:08,325
Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back

1039
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:11,162
US-UK relations
to the American Revolution?

1040
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:14,415
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1041
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:18,043
I'm here.

1042
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:19,795
<i>Stand by to receive.
Peady.</i>

1043
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,846
The Prime Minister's office asked me
to meet him here.

1044
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,347
This way, sir'.

1045
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:31,766
Scanning.

1046
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,646
Retinal scan confirmed.

1047
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:42,443
It's okay. Here you go, sir'.

1048
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:46,155
You've got a very warm hand.

1049
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:56,665
<i>Biometric confirmed.</i>

1050
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,210
The prompt is "Kipling."

1051
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:01,045
The prompt is "Kipling."

1052
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:05,841
Sir', I'm going to need a pass-phrase.
The prompt is "Kipling."

1053
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,259
Yes, of course.

1054
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,846
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs...

1055
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:19,522
<i>"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."</i>

1056
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:26,028
<i>- Y ou got t'?
-I got it.</i>

1057
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:27,822
Oh, man, do I got it.

1058
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:29,573
I'm here to see the Prime Minister'.

1059
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,367
We were told not to let anybody in.

1060
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,745
'By VVhOrTq?
'BY YOU, sir...

1061
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:40,751
Hunley? What is this'?

1062
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:42,336
Security!

1063
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:50,261
Chief Atlee.

1064
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:52,513
Kind of you to accept our invitation.

1065
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,108
Do you know who I am?

1066
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:08,487
We know you created the Syndicate.

1067
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,906
But Lane went rogue
and turned it against you, didn't he?

1068
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,617
And you've been
desperately trying to cover it up.

1069
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,870
That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you.

1070
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,122
That's true.

1071
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:25,671
Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1072
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:28,382
Namely, how you framed her'.

1073
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:30,843
That's also true.

1074
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:37,057
It's the antidote.

1075
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:39,560
When the Prime Minister' found out
about the Syndicate,

1076
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:41,270
Atlee attacked him.

1077
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:42,563
Yes, that's true.

1078
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,357
And then you saved
the Prime Minister', sir'.

1079
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,734
Did he?

1080
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:48,485
I'm very grateful.

1081
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:00,956
Sir'.

1082
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:06,295
You're cutting it very close, Ethan.

1083
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:10,174
I have what you want. Where do I g0?

1084
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:29,735
Ethan, Wait.

1085
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,904
If I'rn not there in 'l 5 minutes,
he'll kill Benji.

1086
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:33,864
The mission
is to bring down the Syndicate.

1087
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:38,160
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1088
01:47:38,243 --> 01:47:40,663
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1089
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:44,041
And what happens, Ethan,
if you can't make it back?

1090
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:46,502
I'll make it back.

1091
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,088
Just be ready.

1092
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:55,511
<i>Greetings, Prime Minister.</i>

1095
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:03,727

1096
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:05,312
<i>in untraceable currency</i>

1097
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:09,817

1098

1099
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:23,474
This is the end, Ml". Hunt.

1100
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,984
Careful.

1101
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:38,739
Two pounds of Semtex.

1102
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:42,659
Five hundred .30 caliber ball bearings.

1103
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:45,079
Your friend is sitting on
a highly sensitive...

1104
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:46,705
mpressure trigger.

1105
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:48,832
So no sudden moves.

1106
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,509
Your final test.

1107
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:02,429
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1108
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:06,600
If not, everyone dies.

1109
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,355
No time to think, Ethan.

1110
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:13,607
Have a seat, please.

1111
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:31,792
Human nature. My weapon of choice.

1112
01:50:32,376 --> 01:50:35,963
From the moment I killed the young lady
in the record shop,

1113
01:50:36,046 --> 01:50:38,841
- I knew you would...
-...st0p at nothing to catch me.

1114
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,552
I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.

1115
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:45,556
Whether she broke you
that night you met or let you go,

1116
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,891
whether you let her Pun in Morocco,

1117
01:50:48,684 --> 01:50:51,061
whether she went to Atlee or not...

1118
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:55,232
You were certain we'd end up
where we are right now.

1119
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:00,904
Then, again,

1120
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:03,198
so was I.

1121
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:05,826
<i>I know you, Lane.</i>

1122
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:08,787
<i>Somewhere along the line,
you had a crisis of faith.</i>

1123
01:51:08,871 --> 01:51:12,374
Human life didn't matter anymore.
Or maybe it never really did.

1124
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,878
Either way,
you killed too many innocent people

1125
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:20,090
without ever asking
who was giving the orders or why.

1126
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:24,428
<i>You blame the system for what you are,
instead of yourself.</i>

1127
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:28,974
You wanted revenge,
but Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.

1128
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:32,269
You needed help.
You needed money, a lot of it.

1129
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:35,772
And you'll stop at nothing to get it.

1130
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:38,692
That's how I know
I'm going to put you in a box.

1131
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:42,237
Where's the disk?

1132
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:45,282
Where is the disk?

1133
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:46,992
You like to play games.

1134
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,911
I have a game for you.

1135
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:52,831
I'll give you $50 million

1136
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:56,752
<i>t0 let Benji g0.</i>

1137
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:14,603
Where is the disk?

1138
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:16,980
Where is the disk?

1139
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:19,608
You're looking at it.

1140
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:20,901
I am the disk.

1141
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:24,571
I memorized it.
All E24 billion in numbered accounts.

1142
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:26,865
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.

1143
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:31,495
<i>Without this money, you're nothing.
Without rne, you're nothing.</i>

1144
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,001
<i>Right now, you're thinking it's a bluff.</i>

1145
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:39,920
<i>I'd never let my friends die.</i>

1146
01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:43,298
<i>I couldn't possibly memorize
the entire disk.</i>

1147
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:45,300
There's only one way to be sure.

1148
01:52:46,802 --> 01:52:48,178
Let Benji go.

1149
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:06,905
Take him.

1150
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:13,829
They come one step closer', shoot me.

1151
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:16,790
Stop!

1152
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:22,838
You remember I told you one day
you were going to take things too far?

1153
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:24,506
This is me speaking, by the way,
it's not him.

1154
01:53:24,881 --> 01:53:29,678
The only way this ends is you and me,
Lane, face to face.

1155
01:53:30,012 --> 01:53:32,681
<i>Only this time,
I won't be locked in a glass box.</i>

1156
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:34,182
<i>You Want your money?</i>

1157
01:53:34,266 --> 01:53:36,935
The Bone Doctor is going to
have to beat it out of me!

1158
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:40,355
Now let Benji go.

1159
01:53:45,235 --> 01:53:47,070
ll-3-9...

1160
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:10,093
- Go.
-Ethan...

1161
01:54:10,177 --> 01:54:11,845
Brandt and Luther are Waiting. Go.

1162
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,521
What do I do?

1163
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:22,981
Kill the Woman.

1164
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,818
I need Hunt alive.

1165
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:16,284
<i>- Go!
-/t{9 Benj/I Where am I going?</i>

1166
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:17,869
- They'r"e Corning.
-VVe'r"e not ready.

1167
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:19,079
Then get ready.

1168
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:47,065
Which way?

1169
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:10,917
Now let's see what you're made of.

1170
02:00:07,158 --> 02:00:10,829
Face to face, just as you wished, Ethan.

1171
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:35,812
It hurts, I know.

1172
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:40,650
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1173
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:43,319
Ml". Lane,

1174
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:46,823
meet the IMF.

1175
02:02:06,277 --> 02:02:07,612
You're free now.

1176
02:02:10,698 --> 02:02:12,200
Where will you g0?

1177
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:14,869
I don't know.

1178
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,249
I've done my part.

1179
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:21,042
Yeah.

1180
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,924
Ethan, we got to go!

1181
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,602
You'd better hurry now.

1182
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:43,064
Good luck.

1183
02:02:58,288 --> 02:02:59,956
You know how to find me.

1184
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,142
Director Hunley?

1185
02:03:21,269 --> 02:03:23,021
Director Hunley!

1186
02:03:23,104 --> 02:03:24,355
Ml". Chairman.

1187
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:26,232
Six months ago,
you stood before this panel

1188
02:03:26,316 --> 02:03:29,110
and demanded that
the IMF be dissolved.

1189
02:03:29,193 --> 02:03:30,862
That is correct, sir'.

1190
02:03:30,945 --> 02:03:32,822
How do you explain
your testimony today?

1191
02:03:32,906 --> 02:03:35,241
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

1192
02:03:35,325 --> 02:03:38,661
the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1193
02:03:38,745 --> 02:03:41,331
In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,

1194
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:44,250
his cover had to be absolute.

1195
02:03:44,334 --> 02:03:45,460
The whole operation was known

1196
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:48,504
only to myself
and a handful of IMF agents.

1197
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:53,718
So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate scheme

1198
02:03:53,801 --> 02:03:55,803
to expose the so-called Syndicate.

1199
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:57,180
That is correct, sir'.

1200
02:03:57,263 --> 02:04:02,310
Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1201
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:04,395
That is correct, sir'.

1202
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:09,901
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1203
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:13,780
Desperate times, desperate measures,
Mr. Chairman.

1204
02:04:15,698 --> 02:04:19,535
And you, Ml". Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?

1205
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:25,249
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1206
02:04:25,333 --> 02:04:27,377
without the Secretary's approval.

1207
02:04:35,343 --> 02:04:37,720
Welcome to the IMF,

1208
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:39,305
Ml". Secretary.
