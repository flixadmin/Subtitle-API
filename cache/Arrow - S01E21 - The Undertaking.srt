1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,083
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,285
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,326
Survive.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,961
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,606
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish:

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,249
To use the list of names he left me and
bring down those who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,801
To do this, I must become someone else.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,682
I must become something else.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,365
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,484
I want you to find out
all you can about that notebook.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,409
I'll be driving your mother around.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,647
She's not a suspect.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,042
Something's going on in this city.
You know it.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,890
Walter, please.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,481
You've got to stop looking into this,
it's not safe.

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,327
Accidents tend to befall people
who are too curious.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,961
- It's done.
- And he won't be harmed?

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,731
Nor will he discover your involvement.
You have my word.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm not ready for the commitment
you're looking for.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,763
- You can't be serious.
- This is me serious, Laurel.

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,090
Call Cayman Fidelity.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,726
Tell them their favorite accountant
is flying in...

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,284
...to make a special deposit
for a special client.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,642
That elevator's supposed to be on a key.
Go check it out.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,285
Harold Backman.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,608
You have failed this city.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,844
I'm only an accountant. I'm just the money.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,283
Money that leads to extortion,
kidnapping and drugs.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,324
It's the destruction of innocent lives!

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,803
You think you scare me
more than the people I work for?

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
No.

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,001
They can deal with you.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,441
Hmm. Let me guess. Some bad guy
missing his fancy new laptop?

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,687
Harold Backman.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,009
He's who Starling City's worst call when
they want to launder money in the Caymans.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,761
Then shouldn't we just turn this over to,
I don't know, the IRS?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,846
We will. Just as soon as you return
the money to the rightful owners.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,354
That sounds like a very nice
idea, but Backman's files are

39
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,349
all protected with an asymmetric
encryption algorithm.

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,488
- So it's gonna take a while to break in.
- Days, at least.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,570
Better get started, then.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,568
At the risk of ending up
with an arrow in my eye, can I ask...

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,367
- ...when are you planning on making peace with Diggle?
- He's the one who left, Felicity.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,042
- I did everything I could to stop him.
- Except apologize.

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,442
You promised you'd help him track
down Floyd Lawton and you...

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,404
Made a choice that I can live with.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,441
- If he can't, then I don't need him.
- Oliver...

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,122
I need to get back to the club.
Let me know when you break in.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,606
I wish someone would send me off
to the Caymans.

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,927
Yes, I know it's been six months, but...

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,684
I am very well aware of the statistics...

53
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,441
...but I haven't given up hope
and neither should you.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,327
That didn't sound too good.

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,090
Oh, it's fine.

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,890
Who were you talking to?

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,969
Just the insurance company.

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,410
They insist on paying out
Walter's life insurance policy.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,845
I know we haven't talked about Walter
in a while, but I miss him too.

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,050
It's like losing Dad all over again.

61
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,690
- You look radiant.
- Flatterer.

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,247
I think you're the last to arrive.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,329
- How's Tommy?
- Tommy is Tommy.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,767
- How's Oliver?
- Still in bed. It's only noon.

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,121
- Well, look who I just found.
- Heh-heh.

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,721
Get lost trying to find the house?

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,326
You say that as if your driveway's
not longer than most roads.

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
- Can I get anyone anything else?
- We're fine dear, thank you.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,928
Oh. Excuse me.

70
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,930
Hello, Mrs. Queen.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,130
Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly, Walter.
Come in, please.

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,566
You're here to see Robert?

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,883
Yes, there's just some papers
he needs to sign for the stock offering.

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,734
Well, he's in some private
meeting right now, but

75
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,313
you're welcome to wait
for him in his study.

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,448
- Thank you.
- Unless you'd like to help me...

77
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,682
...get my children out of the house.

78
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,804
- You don't have children do you, Walter?
- Not yet, I'm afraid.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,608
Well, save yourself the trouble and don't.
They eventually all turn into teenagers.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,561
Adam Hunt was reluctant at first,
but was more cooperative...

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,240
...upon being informed
we knew about his embezzlement.

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,966
The police's communications system
could use an upgrade.

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,921
I think Mr. Hunt can be persuaded
to make an anonymous donation.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,130
Well, that will certainly cure
what ails this city.

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,167
What's that, Malcolm?

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,011
We're emptying the Atlantic
with a tablespoon.

87
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,647
For years, we've been forcing
the city's worst to do what is best...

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,123
...leverage them to help us save this city.
But it's not working.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,086
Crime in the Glades is rising.
The cancer is spreading.

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,080
- We just need to take some more time...
- Did Rebecca get more time?

91
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,921
Did the man who raped Frank's daughter
give her any quarter?

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,442
Everyone in this room has lost something
or someone to the Glades.

93
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,689
And we have committed ourselves
to fixing it...

94
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,531
...but what have we truly accomplished?

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,530
Nothing. And maybe it's because
the Glades can't be fixed.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,087
You're saying we should
abandon the project.

97
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,691
Yes.

98
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,682
In favor of a new undertaking.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,810
Like Ben Tre in Vietnam.

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,767
The village must be destroyed
before it can be saved.

101
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,131
Are you suggesting
we somehow level the Glades?

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,731
Down to the bedrock.

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,882
Only then can we truly rebuild Starling
City and make it safer for everyone.

104
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,605
That's 24 square blocks.

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,690
And if we did,
and I'm not saying we should...

106
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,327
...if we did, wouldn't
suspicion fall on us?

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,286
Not if the destruction appears to be
caused by a natural disaster.

108
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,051
You've always had something
of a God complex, Malcolm...

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,961
...it's part of your charm. But even
you can't create a natural disaster.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,480
Have you ever heard of Unidac Industries?

111
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,683
It's a small company. They have an idea.

112
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,971
An idea that will serve our purposes.

113
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,885
My sources tell me
they're five years away from prototype...

114
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,607
...and any undertaking of value
is worthy of patience.

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,849
- And restraint.
- One man alone can't save this city, Robert.

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,724
We both know that.

117
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,730
"Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world, she walks into mine."

118
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,367
This coffee is terrible, Oliver.

119
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,086
That's what you get
for ordering coffee at a bar.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,286
You look tired.

121
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,084
Too much work?

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,688
Too much crying.

123
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,245
Tommy broke up with me.

124
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,281
- What happened?
- I have no idea.

125
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,921
Things were good, they were great.

126
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,650
And then, suddenly, he's packing up
his things and telling me that it's over.

127
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,444
Did he say anything to you?

128
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,645
No. Tommy and I haven't talked
very much since he quit.

129
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,606
But he'll come around.

130
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,642
It's probably just cold feet.

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,041
Like it was with you?

132
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,251
Oliver, you don't sleep
with your girlfriend's sister...

133
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,046
...unless you're looking
to blow the relationship up.

134
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,005
If you still want to be with Tommy...

135
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,328
...do what we should've done.

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,204
Talk to each other. And be honest.

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,042
Oliver, I need to show you what...

138
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,407
I just totally walked in
on a thing, didn't I?

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,011
I'm sorry, uh, who are you?

140
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,449
Nobody. I mean, I'm not nobody.
I'm someone, obviously.

141
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,086
And so are you. You're Laurel, right?

142
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,768
That Laurel. Gorgeous Laurel.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,367
This is Felicity.
She's setting up my Internet.

144
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,690
Router. And I need to show Oliver
something very important related to it.

145
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,324
I'll let you go, then.

146
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,320
Thank you for the coffee.

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,010
And the advice.

148
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,328
- Tell me you got in.
- Better.

149
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,521
I hacked Cayman Fidelity
and put together a list

150
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,305
of all the deposits
Backman made last year.

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,931
Felicity, what good does that do us if
we don't know whose money that was??

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,488
Look at the biggest deposit Backman
made last year. Bottom of the page.

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,001
"Two million dollars on Decem..."

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,368
December 12th.

155
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,211
- That's...
- The day Walter disappeared.

156
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,529
What if one of Backman's clients
was paid 2 million to kidnap Walter?

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,371
Then we find out which client it was...

158
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,204
...and use them to find Walter.

159
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,206
Okay, back trace the account.
Follow the money.

160
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,046
Hopefully, it will lead us
to whoever kidnapped Walter.

161
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,084
After all this time, do you think
Walter might still really be alive?

162
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,401
I don't know.

163
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,687
Got it. Dominic Alonzo.

164
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,001
- Ugh.
- Name ring any bells?

165
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,283
Yeah. Alonzo runs the biggest
underground casino in Starling City...

166
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,562
...when he's not busy kidnapping.

167
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,207
He looks like the kind of lowlife
someone would hire to kidnap Walter.

168
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,927
How many arrows do you think you'll have to
put in him before he gives Walter's location?

169
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,327
- Say "a lot."
- It's not that simple.

170
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,965
That casino has its own private army.

171
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,324
We need to access Alonzo's computer
but without setting off any alarms.

172
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,887
Looks like we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

173
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,208
It's too bad there's not someone
else we could call.

174
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,528
That's enough. We can do this on our own.

175
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,008
Well, then, it looks like someone's
going gambling tonight.

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,567
Those guys would make me
the minute that I walked in there.

177
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,445
Oliver Queen would never be
caught dead in a place like that.

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,483
I wasn't talking about you.

179
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,808
- Absolutely not.
- I can count cards.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,480
It's all probability
theory and mathematics.

181
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,843
Have you met me? Bottom line,
I know my way around a casino.

182
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,367
- Felicity...
- Oliver, the reason I joined you...

183
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,528
...in the first place was to find Walter.

184
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,451
For the first time,
we have a real chance at finding him.

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,845
You have to let me do this.

186
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,485
All right.

187
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,723
But we do it my way.

188
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,250
Come on.

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,251
I'm sorry I had to pull you away
from whomever you were meeting.

190
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,970
Oh, it's nothing.

191
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,049
Everyone's left already.

192
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,568
Besides, it's my fault for forgetting
to sign the K-Fives this morning.

193
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,411
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but is everything all right?

194
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,047
Just, uh, taking care
of some odds and ends.

195
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,162
- Well, if ever you need a friendly ear.
- You're a good man, Walter.

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,880
I thought you'd left.

197
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,527
- I'm still waiting for your answer.
- How can you even think of doing this?

198
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,281
- That place took your soul, Robert.
- And doing this...

199
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,204
...won't give it back.

200
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,367
Won't bring back Rebecca, either.

201
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,531
It still feels like yesterday, that day.

202
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,124
When she called my cell phone for the
first time, I remember being annoyed.

203
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,769
She knew I was busy, so I just let it ring.

204
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,242
When she called back a minute later...

205
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,842
...I shut my phone off.

206
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,041
A little after midnight, two S.C.P.D.
officers showed up at my office.

207
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,486
All I remember them saying was...

208
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,924
...she'd been shot.

209
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,244
Murdered. In the Glades.

210
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,562
After the cops left...

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,441
...I sat in my office the rest of the
night, listening to Rebecca's messages.

212
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,928
She kept calling my name.

213
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,320
Asking for help.

214
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,886
Until she was just struggling
to breathe.

215
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,162
Gasping for air.

216
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,608
I listened to my wife die
over and over and over again.

217
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,683
- I can't imagine, Malcolm.
- Try.

218
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,844
Imagine it was Moira lying on
that pavement, bleeding, calling your name.

219
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,370
And then tell me you wouldn't be prepared
to do what I am.

220
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,326
What do you want?

221
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,650
Is that any way to treat a girl who
just walked up six flights of stairs?

222
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,282
No, it's not. Where are my manners?
Come on in.

223
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,041
Thank you.

224
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,651
Welcome.

225
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,366
Did you do these?

226
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,568
You know, Felicity, Oliver and I don't need
a relationship counselor.

227
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,644
That hasn't been my experience.
We have a lead on Walter.

228
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,090
I need you to come back
and help us find him.

229
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,011
- Oliver put you up to this?
- No. Heh.

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,725
He doesn't even know I'm here.

231
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,486
Look, I know Oliver didn't help you
find your brother's killer...

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,449
...and that hurts and that sucks.

233
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,642
But you gotta know if it was your
life on the line and not just your...

234
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,801
...very understandable vendetta,
he would be there for you. No hesitation.

235
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,800
And I don't want a partnership with
those kind of qualifications, Felicity.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,131
Look, I know Oliver's religiously against
admitting he's wrong...

237
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,443
...but the truth is, he needs you.

238
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,131
Yeah.

239
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,686
And when Oliver is ready to say that,
he knows where I live.

240
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,369
- Sorry for bothering you.
- It's no bother, I hope you find him.

241
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,040
Wow, you really look like your father.

242
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,249
I never thought so before,
but just now I saw him in you.

243
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,763
What are you doing here?

244
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,246
We need to talk.

245
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,560
- I've said everything I have to say.
- Well, I haven't.

246
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,286
Tommy, I love you, and
I think that you still love me...

247
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,246
...so whatever problems you think that we have,
I know that if we face them together...

248
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,011
- You don't understand.
- Then help me understand.

249
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,926
If our relationship is gonna end,
at least let it end with honesty.

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,525
Okay, Laurel.

251
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,011
Honestly...

252
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,642
...you belong with Oliver.

253
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,841
Excuse me?

254
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,289
He's still in love with you.

255
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,204
I have a meeting.

256
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,204
- Are you ready?
- I think so.

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,010
Just to be clear, the
plan is for me to get

258
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,826
caught counting cards in
a underground casino...

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,570
...filled with hardened criminals.

260
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,007
So you can get a friendly warning
from Alonzo...

261
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,202
...and plant a bug on his office computer.

262
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,802
Right. Which will hopefully lead us
to Walter.

263
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,524
That is, assuming I get the
friendly warning and not a bullet.

264
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,442
- Hey. You don't have to do this.
- Yes. I do.

265
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,201
Okay. If anything happens,
I'm right outside.

266
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,164
Okay. Heh.

267
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,367
- Password?
- Snapdragon.

268
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,171
The password is Snapdragon.

269
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,406
- Password?
- Snapdragon.

270
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,086
Hi.

271
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,244
What do you see?

272
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,490
Six armed guards. Two pit bosses.

273
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,125
And a floor man.

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,368
No slot machines. How can you call
yourself a casino without lucky sevens?

275
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,564
Stay focused, please.
I'll be with you the entire time.

276
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,040
Thanks.

277
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,962
It feels really good having you inside me.

278
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,960
And by "you" I mean "your voice,"
and by "me" I mean "my ear."

279
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,482
- I'm gonna stop talking right now.
- That would be my preference.

280
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,446
One stack of high society, please.

281
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,289
Thank you for stopping by.

282
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,326
Of course. Uh, you said you had news.

283
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,931
I do.

284
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,686
It's ready.

285
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,322
The Markov device passed
its final beta test this morning.

286
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,929
Applied Sciences is loading it on a truck
bound for Starling City as we speak.

287
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,245
Well...

288
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,128
...congratulations are in order then.

289
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,727
To both of us.

290
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,728
Moira, you may be surprised to know
that I sometimes waver in my convictions.

291
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:07,371
But your friendship, your endless support,
always gives me the strength to carry on.

292
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,122
After all, you and I
will always have a connection.

293
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,487
I'm just sorry that Robert's not here
to celebrate with us.

294
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,851
I'm sorry I had to take him from you.

295
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,451
If anyone's to blame for
his death, it's me.

296
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,206
To Robert.

297
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,084
To Rebecca.

298
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,722
Are you feeling all right?

299
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,244
I know tonight was just another Ted Kord
fundraiser, but you were surprisingly quiet.

300
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,044
Moira, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

301
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,684
Robert, if this is what I think it is,
I don't want to know her name.

302
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,922
No, it's about Malcolm.

303
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,127
He wants to level the Glades.

304
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,849
And how does Malcolm propose
to evacuate an entire section of the city?

305
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,164
He doesn't.

306
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,089
Robert...

307
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,886
...this doesn't sound like you.

308
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,202
Because I'm not the man you think I am.

309
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,364
About a month before the opening of the
steel factory, the one in the Glades...

310
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,530
...I was approached by a local councilman.

311
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,050
He wanted money. He told me that's
the way everything was done in the Glades.

312
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,889
I told him I'd never
paid a bribe in my life.

313
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,128
We got into an argument.

314
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,322
I didn't want to hurt him.

315
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,523
I swear, Moira.

316
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,525
But he fell.

317
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,089
Oh, dear God.

318
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,649
- Oh, dear God.
- The work I'm doing with Malcolm...

319
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,444
...with the list...

320
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,405
...it's my penance, Moira.

321
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,288
What, so you'll atone for one murder
by committing hundreds? Thousands?

322
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,209
Robert, you listen to me.

323
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,406
Whatever wrongs you've committed,
whatever mistakes you've made...

324
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,288
...preventing this horror
is your chance to make it right.

325
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,449
Please.

326
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,481
Please, Robert,
promise me you won't let this happen.

327
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,604
Oh!
Blackjack!

328
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,131
Ha-ha-ha!
- Wow!

329
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,243
Yes. Ha-ha-ha!

330
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,651
Miss, can you come with me?

331
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,571
- Is something wrong?
- Get up.

332
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,240
Well, since you asked so nicely.

333
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,044
Oh, look, there's the bathroom. Heh.

334
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,201
I should've known the manager's office
would be to the right of the bathroom.

335
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,890
Mr. Alonzo.

336
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,286
Yeah.

337
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,129
Have a seat.

338
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,165
- What's your name?
- Megan.

339
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,727
Do you know where the term "86"
comes from, Megan?

340
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,321
Yes, as it happens, I do.
It's from prohibition.

341
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,171
There was an illegal casino...

342
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,083
...not like this one, located
at 86 Bedford Street in New York and...

343
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,966
- Ah. You know, I'm just gonna stop talking.
- And now it means to ban someone.

344
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,768
Someone who's cheating. You're 86'd.
Leave your chips and go.

345
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,009
Thank you. Thank you.

346
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,723
Oh, yeah, Megan. One more thing.

347
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,400
See, the thing about card counters...

348
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,926
...is, uh, that sometimes they work
with a partner.

349
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,126
You're gonna be really upset
when you meet my partner.

350
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,166
- I heard you never miss.
- I don't.

351
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,724
Where's Walter Steele?

352
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,721
- What? What are you talking about?
- Six months ago, you had him kidnapped.

353
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,481
It was just a job. I was given a name.
I didn't ask any questions.

354
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,449
Last chance. Where is he?

355
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,041
- Below ground.
- You're lying.

356
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,602
I'm not. I delivered him
and they killed him.

357
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,762
I heard the gunshot. He's dead.

358
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,923
Oh, let's see that blouse
in a violet shade.

359
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,211
You're a miracle worker, Thea.

360
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,370
Oh, when it comes to shopping,
it's not work, really. Heh.

361
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,960
Hey. Just teaching Mom
the joys of online clothes shopping.

362
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,450
Ollie.

363
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,044
Are you okay?

364
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,328
I need to talk to you both.

365
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,965
What is it?

366
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,405
It's about Walter.

367
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,444
Did the police contact you?

368
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,524
One of Mr. Diggle's army buddies
works for the FBI now...

369
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
- ...and they got news tonight.
- No.

370
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,647
I'm very sorry.

371
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,443
No, no, no. There must be some mistake.

372
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,642
Who did Mr. Diggle talk to?

373
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,281
- Did they find a body?
- Mom.

374
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,360
- Walter's gone.
- This isn't right.

375
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,364
- Where are you going?
- Out.

376
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,085
- It's 10:00.
- I need some air.

377
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,171
- Mom, you're in shock.
- Don't tell me what or how I feel, Oliver.

378
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,250
Why is she acting like that?

379
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,971
Come here.

380
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,163
I suspect I know what this is about.

381
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,882
You and I got in bed with Malcolm
to cure what ails this city.

382
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,761
But I think you agree killing thousands
of people is not the answer.

383
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,204
Indeed. if we were to wage a war
with Malcolm Merlyn, we will lose.

384
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,048
My family has already suffered enough.

385
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,005
And I have no desire to endanger mine.

386
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,441
Fortunately, there's another option.

387
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,527
Six months ago, Malcolm started
buying up buildings in the Glades...

388
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,041
...through an off-shore company
called Sagittarius.

389
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,001
He made it sound as if this undertaking
of his was a recent inspiration.

390
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,247
If you're right,
he has been thinking about this for months.

391
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,481
If he can't rebuild it,
he'll abandon the project.

392
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,080
How much of the Glades
does he already have?

393
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,691
About a third.

394
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,401
Now, if we can quietly buy up the rest...

395
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,968
...before he can, he won't be able
to gain the control he needs.

396
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,808
- We will need capital.
- Do you still have your contacts in China?

397
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,721
I already have a flight planned
for Shanghai tomorrow.

398
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,482
- Come with me.
- We shouldn't travel together.

399
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,287
Malcolm might get word.
He already knows I have my doubts.

400
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,804
Besides, I'm getting the urge to take out
the Queen's Gambit for another voyage.

401
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,086
Dad, do you have any cash?
This jerk pizza guy can't break a hundred.

402
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,009
- Oliver, you remember Mr. Chen?
- Hi.

403
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,010
- Hey.
- Waiting. Thank you.

404
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,767
Pizza.

405
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,809
My hero. I'm starved.

406
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,406
- Hey, Ollie.
- Yeah?

407
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,284
Where do you keep the
bottle opener in this thing?

408
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,682
Bottom drawer.

409
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,923
- Did you talk to Ray today?
- About the ski trip?

410
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,040
No. He asked Jean to move in with him
last night.

411
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,045
Oh. Guess they've been together forever.

412
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,729
We've been together longer.

413
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,241
Guess we have.

414
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,610
I only bring this up
because your mom busted me yesterday.

415
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,491
And obviously we can't hang out
at my house...

416
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,041
Why? Because your father threatened
to Taser me...

417
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,607
...the last time I closed the door
to your bedroom?

418
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,043
- Well, wouldn't it be nice to have a little place of our own?
- Yeah.

419
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,771
Maybe.

420
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,770
This is a little fast, Laurel.

421
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,362
I know that you like to think of yourself
as a bad boy, Oliver Queen...

422
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,724
...but I feel like we're ready
to take the next step.

423
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,730
Yeah.

424
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,366
Let's do it.

425
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,081
You lied to me. We had a deal.

426
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,285
- What?
- You promised if I cooperated...

427
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,807
...with the Undertaking,
Walter wouldn't be harmed.

428
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,891
- He hasn't been, I'm a man of my word, Moira.
- I think we both know better than that.

429
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,241
And I know...

430
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,123
I know you've had him killed.

431
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,681
Turn on the camera.

432
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,001
Walter.

433
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,168
Like you said, Moira, we have an agreement.

434
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,967
Walter would stay in my custody
until the Undertaking was complete.

435
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,288
We're both in this together.

436
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,441
I've been sitting in the
dark all night too.

437
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,804
All these months, I kept thinking if I
could find a clue or get a lead on him...

438
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,208
I guess it wouldn't have mattered.

439
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,011
I can't imagine what your family's
going through.

440
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,522
Walter's alive.

441
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,730
What?

442
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,001
But Alonzo said...

443
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,283
I need you to pull up
Malcolm Merlyn's phone records.

444
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,121
He made a call from his office to wherever
Walter is being kept at 10:30 p.m.

445
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,443
Malcolm Merlyn? Tommy's father?
Why would he kidnap Walter?

446
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,687
Felicity.

447
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,127
LUDs show he made a call to a tenement
complex located in Bludhaven.

448
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,211
- Can you pull up a satellite view?
- Uh, yeah.

449
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,248
A lot of security for low-income housing.

450
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,762
There's two guards stationed
at all access points.

451
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,166
There's just one on the roof.

452
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,283
Exactly. There's no other buildings
in that area.

453
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,366
If you wanna get onto the roof, you're
going to have to jump off of something.

454
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,521
I've got something.

455
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,484
There's a problem in Quadrant 4.

456
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,724
Mr. Steele?

457
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,170
Walter.

458
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,049
What's happening?

459
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,685
You're going home.

460
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,923
I thought I'd never see you again.

461
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,403
I'm all right.

462
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,890
Welcome home, Walter.

463
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,287
Thank you, son.

464
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,204
Thea.

465
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,086
This is totally a family thing, isn't it?

466
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,608
I'm sorry. Who are you?

467
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,929
This is Felicity. She's my friend.

468
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,691
Mine too. It's good to see you.

469
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,367
You too. Uh, I'll let you guys
get back to your hugging.

470
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,325
Oliver.

471
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,411
We're all together again.

472
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,329
Everything is going to be all right.

473
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,725
Robert, I don't like the idea of this.

474
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,287
- It's gonna be okay.
- How long will you be gone?

475
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,404
A few weeks.
Maybe more, depending on weather.

476
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,729
- Why can't you just fly to China?
- I think it's better the less you know.

477
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,281
I just hate that stupid boat.

478
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,847
Look at me.

479
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,801
I love you.

480
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,641
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- I know.

481
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,604
Hey.

482
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,768
Got room for one more?

483
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,804
- No, no.
- Mom. Let me keep Dad company.

484
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,287
- Oliver, you're in school.
- Not really.

485
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,330
- I forgot to tell you that.
- I could use an extra hand on the ship.

486
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,445
- Robert.
- Moira, let the kid take the boat out...

487
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,290
...with the old man.

488
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,803
All right. All right. But you promise
me that you'll behave yourself.

489
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,405
Oh, yeah, I promise.

490
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,369
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

491
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,211
I totally spaced. I gotta call Tommy and let
him know I'm out of town for a few weeks.

492
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,482
See you on board in five.

493
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,441
Sara, you here? Ahem.

494
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,803
Yeah, you might wanna
circle around the block a few times...

495
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,162
...because your sister just showed up.

496
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,727
Hi. What are you doing here?

497
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,968
You're leaving for three weeks.

498
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,771
I wanted to come say bye to you in person.

499
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,690
I'm glad you did.

500
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,042
And I wanted to bring you something.

501
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,681
In case you get lonely oversea.

502
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,324
Thank you.

503
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,685
Hey, is everything okay?

504
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,959
I mean, I didn't totally
freak you out when I brought

505
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:47,948
up the whole apartment
thing earlier, did I?

506
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,683
- No.
- Good.

507
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,370
No.

508
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,244
Mm. But I do have to get back to the boat.

509
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,327
Yeah.

510
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,890
Is it done?

511
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,445
Yes.

512
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,886
The bomb is in place.

513
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,921
And there's a storm front moving in
along the Gambit's projected course.

514
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,167
Good.

515
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,411
When the Queen's Gambit goes down...

516
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,444
...no one will suspect it's anything
other than an act of God.

517
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,044
Oliver.

518
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,171
Oh. What a miracle.

519
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,691
How's Walter?

520
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,850
The police are saying
he was rescued by the vigilante.

521
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,840
- Yes, he was.
- Has he said anything about his ordeal?

522
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,930
Was he able to identify any of his captors?

523
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,884
No.

524
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,129
Hmm. That's too bad.

525
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,567
They'll get what's coming to them.

526
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,961
I'm just glad that my family
is back together.

527
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,448
We all are.

528
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,162
Ollie.

529
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,970
Excuse me.

530
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,729
Is Walter okay? I saw it on the news.

531
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,206
Yeah.

532
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,366
Are you okay?

533
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,204
Of course.

534
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,686
- I promise you, now is not the time.
- Oh.

535
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,730
- It's you and Tommy.
- You and me, actually.

536
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,491
I talked to Tommy yesterday,
and the reason he broke up with me...

537
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,843
...is because he thinks that you and I
still belong together.

538
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,964
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

539
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,128
He walked out on me.

540
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,201
I just want you to be happy.

541
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,725
It's what I've always wanted.

542
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,362
Then will you please go talk
to Tommy for me?

543
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,800
And say what?

544
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,721
Say that you and I are over.
That you're not still in love with me.

545
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,448
I can't do that.

546
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,764
Why not?

547
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,647
Because it wouldn't be true.

548
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,925
And I have enough lies in my life already.

549
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,362
- I guess you do know where I live.
- I've always known where you live.

550
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,760
May I?

551
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,170
I'm sorry.

552
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,444
You were right and I was wrong.

553
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,610
- About Deadshot?
- About everything.

554
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,600
About my mother. And about her
involvement in the Undertaking.

555
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,568
She lied to me.

556
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,524
To Thea.

557
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,444
She's working with Malcolm Merlyn.

558
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,487
And they're planning something.

559
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,801
Something terrible.

560
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,007
I don't know what yet...

561
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,000
...but I just know one thing...

562
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,690
...I need your help to stop them.
