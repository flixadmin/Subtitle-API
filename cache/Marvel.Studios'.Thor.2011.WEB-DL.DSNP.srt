328
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,880
He said it was Thor?

T-H-O-R.

330
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
And your
relationship to him?

331
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,360
I've never met him before.

332
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,920
Until she hit him with a car.

333
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,720
I grazed him,
but she tasered him.

334
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,360
Yes, I did.

335
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Hi.

336
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
Just taking a little blood.

337
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,920
How dare you attack
the son of Odin?

338
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,880
MALE NURSE:
I need some help!

339
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,560

<i>this was just</i>
<i>a magnetic storm, do you?</i>

344
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,320
Look, the lensing
around these edges

345
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,800
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

346
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
A what?

347
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,200
I thought you were
a science major?

348
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Political science.

349
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,160
She was
the only applicant.

350
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,920
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

351
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,280
between two
different points
of space-time.

352
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,640
It's a wormhole.

353
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,640
Erik, look.
What do you see?

354
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,760
Stars.

355
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,640
Yeah, but not our stars.

356
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,640
See, this is
the star alignment

357
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,480

358

decided to take
a day off,

359
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,000
these are someone
else's constellations.

Hey! Check this out.

361
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,520
No, it can't be.

362
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,680
I think I left something
at the hospital.

363
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,320
It's not possible!

DARCY: Oh, my God.

367
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,560
I just lost
my most important
piece of evidence.

368
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,680
Typical.

369
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,800
So now what?

370
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,880
We find him.

371
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,400
Did you see what
he did in there?

372
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,240
I'm not sure finding
him is the best idea.

373
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,680
Well, our data can't
tell us what it was like
to be inside that event,

374
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,400
and he can.
So, we're gonna find him.

375
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,560
DARCY: Okay.

376
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,240
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

377
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,720
Exactly.

378
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
JANE: What?

379
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing
this on purpose.

There was no stopping him.

FANDRAL: Well, at least
he's only banished, not dead.

Which is what we'd all be

404

if that guard
hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

405
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,080
How did the guard
even know?

406
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
I told him.

407

What?

408
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,800
I told him to go to Odin
after we'd left.

409
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,640
He should be flogged
for taking so long.

410
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

411

You told the guard?

412

I saved our lives.

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,080
And Thor's.

414
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,600
I had no idea
Father would banish him
for what he did.

Loki.

416

You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change
his mind.

And if I do, then what?

418
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,400
I love Thor more
dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

419
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,240
He's arrogant.
He's reckless.
He's dangerous.

You saw how he was today.

421
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,640
Is that what Asgard
needs from its king?

422
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,040
He may speak
of the good of Asgard,

423
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,480
but he's always
been jealous of Thor.

424
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,640
We should be
grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

there were traitors
in the House of Odin.

427
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,320
A master of magic
could bring three
Jotuns into Asgard.

428
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,840
FANDRAL:
Loki's always been
one for mischief,

429
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,360
but you're talking
about something
else entirely.

430
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,200
ODIN: Stop!

431
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,360

432
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,880
ODIN: No.

wasn't the only thing

Why?

449
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,600
You were
knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

450
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,240
You were an innocent child.

451
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
No. You took me
for a purpose.
What was it?

(SHOUTING) Tell me!

453
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,440
I thought
we could unite our

What?

457
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
But those plans
no longer matter.

458
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,080
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

459
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,600
locked up here
until you might
have use of me.

460
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,160
Why do you twist my words?

461
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
You could have
told me what I was
from the beginning,

462
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
why didn't you?

463
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,760
You're my son.

464
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,840
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

465

Because I'm the monster

their children about
at night?

No, no.
You know,
it all makes sense now!

468
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,680
Why you favored Thor
all these years!

469
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

inside that cloud?

475

you eat an entire box
of Pop-Tarts

476
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,680
and still be this hungry?

477

Well, you could
have just said so.

all the excitement
out at the crater.

some kind of satellite
landed out in the desert.

I don't know
anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

I mean, nobody could lift it.

(ALARM BEEPS)

805
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,760
TECHNICIAN: Sir?

806
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,760
It says here
that he's an M.D.

807
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,240
Well, he is! Or he was.

808
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,920
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

809
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,920
A brilliant physicist.

810
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,280
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

811
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,480
ERIK: Oh, Donny,
Donny, Donny!

812
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,960
There you are.
You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

813
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,960
COULSON: Dr. Selvig!

814
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,440
Just keep him away
from the bars.

815
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,280
I will!

816
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,520
Where are we going?

817
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,960
To get a drink.

818
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,640
Follow them.

819
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,200
You know,
I had it all backwards.

820
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,800
I had it all wrong.

821
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,840
It's not a bad thing
finding out that you don't
have all the answers.

822
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,160
You start asking
the right questions.

823
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,320
For the first time
in my life,

824
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:19,000
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do.

825
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,000
Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

826
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,200
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know
where the hell he is.

827
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,800
Thank you for
what you've done.

828
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,400
No, don't thank me.
I only did it for Jane.

829
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,520
Her father and I taught
at university together.

830
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,400
He was a good man.

831
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,520
He never listened.

832
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,400
Neither did I.

833
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,720
My father was trying
to teach me something,

834
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,720
but I was
too stupid to see it.

835
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,880
I don't know
if you're delusional

836
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,880
or if you're pulling
some kind of con,

837
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,320
I don't care.

838
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,720
I just care about her.

839
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,520
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

840
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,400
I swear to you,
I mean her no harm.

841
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,720
Good.

842
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,400
In that case,
I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

843
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,400
Two boilermakers.

844
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,560
LAUFEY: Kill him.

845
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,120
After all I've done for you?

846
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,120
So you're the one
who showed us
the way into Asgard.

847
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,640
That was just
a bit of fun, really.

848
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,800
To ruin
my brother's big day.

849
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,480
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule
for a while longer.

850
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,120
I will hear you.

851
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,960
I will conceal you
and a handful
of your soldiers,

852
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,960
lead you into
Odin's chambers,

853
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,640
and you can slay him
where he lies.

854
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,800
Why not kill him yourself?

855
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,200
(SNORTS)

856
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,520
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

857
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,360
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

858
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,160
Once Odin is dead,
I will return
the Casket to you

859
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,200
and you can return
Jotunheim to all its...

860
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,480
Glory.

861
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,040
I...

862
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,400
Accept.

863
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,840
What troubles you,
Gatekeeper?

864
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,560
I turned my gaze
upon you in Jotunheim,

865
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,080
but could neither
see you nor hear you.

866
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,040
You were
shrouded from me,

867
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,240
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

868
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,240
Perhaps your senses
have weakened

869
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,920
after your
many years of service.

870
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,720
Or perhaps
someone has found a way

871
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,880
to hide that which he
does not wish me to see.

872
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,200
You have
great power, Heimdall.

873
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,200
Did Odin ever fear you?

874
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,080
No.
And why is that?

875
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,680
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

876
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,920
He was your king
and you're sworn
to obey me now.

877
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,880
Yes?

878
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,720
Yes.

879
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,120
Then you will open
the Bifrost to no one

880
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,080
until I have
repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

881
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,280
(BANGING ON DOOR)

882
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
(GASPS) Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

883
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,120
He's fine.
Not injured at all.

884
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,600
(GROANS)
I'm sorry, my friend.

885
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,480
What happened?
We drank, we fought,

886
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,080
he made his ancestors proud.

887
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,400
Put him on the bed.

888
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,160
(GROANS)

889
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,720
(LAUGHING)

890
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,160
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

891
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,000
But you ought to be.

892
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,640
Are these your chambers?

893
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,680
It's more of a temporary
living situation.

894
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,360
I'm sorry.
I don't usually
have guests.

895
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,080
Actually, I never
have guests.

896
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,200
That's not
the right place for it.

897
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,840
I'm sorry.

898
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Can we go outside?

899
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,320
Yes, of course.

900
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,120
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

901
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,480
or I'm trying to
reconcile particle data,

902
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,320
or when Darcy's
driving me crazy.

903
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,880
I come up here a lot,
actually, now that
I think about it.

904
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,840
I'm really glad you're safe.

905
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,400
You've been
very kind to me,

906
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,360
and I've been
far less grateful
than you deserve.

907
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,200
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

908
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,360
so I think that kind
of evens things out.

909
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,560
Perhaps I had it coming.

910
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,760
Oh, my God!

911
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,360
I don't believe it!

912
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,040
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not
as much as I promised.

913
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,400
No, no, this is great!
This is...

914
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,760
I don't have to start
from scratch now.

915
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,400
Thank you.

916
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,560
What's wrong?

917
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,920
S.H.I.E.L.D.

918
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,400
Whatever they are,

919
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,520
they're gonna do
everything in their power

920
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,280
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

921
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,760
No, Jane.

922
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,280
Listen to me.
You must not give up.

923
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
You must finish
what you've started.
Why?

924
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,400
Because you're right.

925
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,240
Here, look.

926
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,280
Your ancestors
called it magic,
and you call it science.

927
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,600
Well, I come from a place
where they're one
and the same thing.

928
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,800
What is that?

929
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,920
My father explained it
to me like this,

930
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,760
that your world

931
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,720
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

932
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,920
linked to each other
by the branches
of Yggdrasil,

933
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,120
the Worlds Tree.

934
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,000
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

935
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,960
The images
glimpsed through...

936
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,320
What did you call it?

937
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,080
This Hooble Telescope.

938
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,440
Hubble.

939
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,000
Hubble Telescope.

940
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,280
(LAUGHS)

941
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,480
Tell me more.

942
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,520
So, the Nine Realms.

943
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,680
Now, there is Midgard,
which is Earth.

944
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,520
This is Alfheim.

945
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,520
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

946
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,680
And Asgard.

947
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,120
<i>And that's where</i>
<i>I come from.</i>

948
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,880
Thank you, Jane.

949
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,280
FANDRAL:
Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,

950
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,720
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

951
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,000
four wild boar, six pheasant,
a side of beef,

952
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,520
and two casks of ale.
Shame on you.
Don't you care?

953
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,400
Do not mistake
my appetite for apathy!

954
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,520
Stop it, both of you!

955
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Stop.

956
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,480
We all know
what we have to do.

957
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,560
We must go.

958
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,520
We must find Thor.

959
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,840
It's treason.

960
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,680
To hell with treason,
it's suicide.

961
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,920
Thor would do
the same for us.

962
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,360

I hope it's true,

how you sent the Destroyer

What?

Why, it must
have been enforcing
Father's last command.

You're

It's good to have you back.

I have to destroy Jotunheim.

To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

I will have saved his life.

I will have destroyed
