1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,967
Peter.

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,393
Your momma wants 
to speak with you.

3
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:45,684
Come on, Pete.

4
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:48,188
Take these fool things off.

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,883
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

6
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,686
Peter?

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,897
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,738
Smushed it with a stick.

9
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,909
You're so like your daddy.

10
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:42,843
You even look like him.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,911
And he was an angel.

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,331
Composed out of pure light.
Mer?

13
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,509
You got a present there for Peter,
don't you?

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,680
Of course.

15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,042
There.

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,419
I've got you covered, Pete.

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,144
You open it up when I'm gone, ok?

18
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:13,873
Your grandpa...

19
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,040
is gonna take such good care of you.

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,029
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

21
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,779
Take my hand.

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,411
Peter.

23
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,340
Pete, come on.

24
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:36,030
Take my hand.

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,447
Mom?

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,810
No! No! No! No!

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,246
Mom! No!

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,925
Come with me.
No!

29
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,062
No!

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,698
You've got to stay here.

31
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,732
Please.

32
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:55,447
No...

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,664
Ok?

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,375
No.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,964
Mom!

36
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,520
Drop it!

37
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,361
Hey.

38
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,661
Drop it! Now!

39
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,094
Hey, cool man. No problem.

40
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,922
No problem at all.

41
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,285
How do you know about this?

42
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,830
I don't even know what that is.

43
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,521
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

44
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:45,278
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

45
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,598
This is just an outfit, man.

46
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,377
Ninja Turtle, you better
stop poking me.

47
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,278
What is your name?

48
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,792
My name is Peter Quill, ok?
Dude, chill out.

49
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,051
Move!
Why?

50
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,083
Ronan may have questions for you.

51
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:58,142
Hey, you know what, there is another
name you might know me by.

52
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,566
Star-Lord.

53
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:03,965
Who?

54
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,872
Star-Lord, man.

55
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,102
Legendary outlaw.

56
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,422
Guys?
Move!

57
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:11,835
Forget this.

58
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,676
Peter?

59
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,378
What happened?

60
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:11,583
Hey...

61
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:14,948
I...

62
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,443
Bereet.
Bereet!

63
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,320
Look, I'm gonna be totally
honest with you.

64
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,709
I forgot you're here.

65
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:47,345
<i>Scattered riots broke out
across the Kree Empire today</i>

66
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:50,894
<i>protesting the recent peace treaty
signed by the Kree Emperor</i>

67
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,940
<i>and Xandar's Nova Prime.</i>

68
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,610
Peter, you have call.

69
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,163
No, wait, don't!

70
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:00,182
<i>Quill?</i>

71
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,378
Hey, Yondu.

72
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:05,175
<i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

73
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,228
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

74
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,427
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

75
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:10,718
<i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

76
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,291
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

77
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,844
<i>I slaved putting this deal together.</i>
Slaved?

78
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:18,037
Making a few calls is slaved? It's really...
<i>And now you're gonna rip me off!</i>

79
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,080
<i>We do not do that to each other.</i>

80
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,098
<i>We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

81
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,631
Yeah and that code is
steal from everybody.

82
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,211
<i>When I picked you up on Terra...</i>

83
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,242
Picked me up.
<i>These boys of mine wanted to eat you.</i>

84
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:28,767
Yeah?

85
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,513
<i>They ain't never tasted 
any Terran before.</i>

86
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,081
<i>I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!</i>

87
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,345
<i>I Will find you,</i>

88
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,361
I Will...

89
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:37,240
Put a bounty on him!

90
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:38,561
Forty K.

91
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,358
But I want him back alive.
Yeah, Cap.

92
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,870
Alive?
That's what I said.

93
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,595
I told you when you picked that kid up,

94
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,368
you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do!

95
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,005
He was cargo!

96
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,960
You have always been soft on him.

97
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,411
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

98
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,366
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

99
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,600
As soon as we get him back here,

100
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,341
I'm gonna kill him myself.

101
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:01,961
What we do need to worry about,

102
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,895
Is who else out there wants that Orb!

103
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,758
They call me terrorist,

104
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,385
Radical, Zealot,

105
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:35,916
because I obey the ancient laws
of my people, the Kree,

106
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,169
and punish those who do not.

107
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:42,576
Because I do not forgive your people

108
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:44,949
for taking the life of my father,

109
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,820
and his father,

110
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,749
and his father before him.

111
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:55,244
A thousand years of war between us
will not be forgotten!

112
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:56,528
You can't do this!

113
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,745
Our government signed a peace treaty.

114
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,825
My government knows no shame.

115
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:07,017
You Xandarians and your culture
are a disease.

116
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,240
You

117
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,918
will never rule Xandar.

118
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,172
No.

119
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:15,047
I will cure it!

120
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,390
Ronan,

121
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,283
Korath has returned.

122
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:34,129
Master, he is a thief,

123
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,133
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

124
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,518
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

125
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,816
to retrieve the Orb for an
intermediary known as The Broker.

126
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,522
I promised Thanos
I would retrieve the Orb for him.

127
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,512
Only then will he destroy
Xandar for me.

128
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:54,953
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

129
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,506
It will be my honor.

130
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,003
It will be your doom.

131
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,518
If this happens again,

132
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,100
you'll be facing our
father without his prize.

133
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,897
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

134
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,558
Just like you.

135
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,991
But I know Xandar.

136
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:09,798
Ronan has already decreed that I...

137
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,301
Do not speak for me.

138
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,282
You will not fail.

139
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:20,531
Have I ever?

140
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,531
Xandarians.

141
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,847
What a bunch of losers.

142
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:44,534
All of them in a big hurry
to get from something stupid,

143
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,923
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

144
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,079
Look at this guy!

145
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,679
Can you believe they call us criminals,

146
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,830
when he's assaulting us
with that haircut?

147
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:55,128
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

148
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:56,454
It's not cool to get help!

149
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,562
Walk by yourself,
you little gargoyle.

150
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:01,028
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

151
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,712
Where's your wife, old man?

152
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:05,146
What a class-A prevert.

153
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,414
Right, Groot?
Groot?

154
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,638
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

155
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,045
That's disgusting!

156
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,559
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

157
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,686
Why are you lying?

158
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,565
Looks like we got one.

159
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,025
Ok humie,

160
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:26,829
how bad does someone
wanna find you?

161
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,808
40,000 units?

162
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,045
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

163
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,292
Mr. Quill.

164
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:48,009
Broker.

165
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,333
The Orb.

166
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,746
As commissioned.

167
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:53,878
Where's Yondu?

168
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,019
Wanted to be here.

169
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:56,921
Sends his love.
And told me to tell you,

170
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,381
that you got the best eyebrows
in the business.

171
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:02,614
What is it?

172
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,668
It's my policy never
to discuss my clients,

173
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:06,608
or their needs.

174
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,638
Yeah, well, I almost died
getting it for you.

175
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,979
An occupational hazard I'm sure,
in your line of work.

176
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,156
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

177
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,999
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

178
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,047
I truly am.

179
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,332
But I want no part of this transaction
if Ronan is involved.

180
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,086
Who's Ronan?

181
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:28,376
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

182
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:31,694
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture,

183
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:32,805
my culture,

184
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,431
is wiped from existence!

185
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,135
Come on.

186
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,744
He's someone whose bad side
I'd rather not be on.

187
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,082
What about my bad side?

188
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:40,387
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

189
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,083
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

190
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,446
What happened?

191
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,379
This guy just backed out
of a deal on me.

192
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,482
If there is one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

193
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,800
Peter Quill.
People call me Star-Lord.

194
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,181
You have the bearing
of a man of honor.

195
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,767
Well, you know, I would not say that.

196
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,550
People say it about
me, all the time,

197
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:11,796
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

198
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:31,663
This wasn't the plan.

199
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,054
Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

200
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,727
No! Not her, him!

201
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,543
Learn genders, man.

202
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,729
Biting? That's not fair!

203
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:48,583
Take it easy!

204
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,748
Fool. You should have learned.

205
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,765
I don't learn. One of my issues.

206
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
What the...

207
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,730
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

208
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,945
You got to be kidding me.

209
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:41,770
Hey!

210
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,425
I live for the simple things.

211
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,822
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

212
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,106
Yeah. Writhe little man.

213
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,013
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

214
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,066
Quit whining.

215
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,720
<i>Subject 89P13,</i>

216
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:28,952
<i>drop your weapon.</i>

217
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:30,831
Crap.

218
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:33,884
By the authority of the Nova Corps,
you are under arrest.

219
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:34,518
Alright. Come on up.

220
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,926
<i>For endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.</i>

221
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:37,540
Hey!

222
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:39,613
If it isn't Star-Prince.

223
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,125
Star-Lord.

224
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:43,141
Sorry. Lord.

225
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,638
I picked this guy up a while back
for petty theft.

226
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,821
He's got a code name.

227
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,278
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

228
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:50,395
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

229
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,436
Just relax, pal.

230
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,365
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

231
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,072
Fascists.

232
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,919
Ronan is destroying

233
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,279
Xandarian outposts
throughout the galaxy.

234
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,306
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

235
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,054
<i>We signed your peace treaty,
Nova Prime.</i>

236
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,133
<i>What more do you want?</i>

237
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,405
At least a statement
from the Kree Empire

238
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,696
saying that they condemn his actions.

239
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:28,244
He is slaughtering children.

240
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:29,906
Families.

241
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,118
<i>That is your business.</i>

242
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,214
<i>Now, I have other matters to attend to.</i>

243
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,710
Prick.

244
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:40,538
Some good news.

245
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:43,525
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

246
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,112
Gamora.

247
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:48,076
Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

248
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,899
The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

249
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:54,617
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

250
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:57,691
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

251
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:00,743
Subject 89P13.

252
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:02,229
Calls itself Rocket.

253
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:05,330
The result of illegal genetic
and cybernetic experiments

254
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:06,646
on a lower life form.

255
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,984
What the hell?

256
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:10,725
They call it Groot.

257
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,565
A humanoid plant
that's been traveling recently

258
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,917
as 89P13's personal houseplant/muscle.

259
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:20,898
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

260
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,192
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

261
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:26,078
led by Yondu Udonta.

262
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,133
Oh, I'm sorry.

263
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,049
I didn't know how this machine worked.

264
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,622
What a bunch of a-holes.

265
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,846
Transport all four to the Kyln.

266
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,780
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

267
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,608
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

268
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,196
But hey, that's not my problem.

269
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,957
I ain't gonna be here long.

270
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:53,282
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

271
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,118
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise me and Groot

272
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,963
would be collecting that bounty
right now,

273
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,135
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

274
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,550
I've had a lot of folks
try to kill me over the years.

275
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:06,960
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

276
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:08,503
Hold.
What's a raccoon?

277
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,984
What's a raccoon?
It's what you are, stupid.

278
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,645
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

279
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,832
So, this Orb has
a real shiny blue suitcase,

280
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,729
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

281
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,001
What is it?
I am Groot.

282
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,450
So what? What's the Orb?

283
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,804
I have no words for an honorless thief.

284
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,317
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

285
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,403
Yeah, I know who you are.

286
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,482
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

287
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:34,998
Yeah, we know who you are.

288
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,766
Who is she?
I am Groot.

289
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,427
Yeah, you said that.

290
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:43,085
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

291
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,543
I was betraying him.

292
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,852
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

293
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,433
I am Groot.

294
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,915
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

295
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,241
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

296
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,287
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

297
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,445
So his vocabulistics is limited
to I and am and Groot.

298
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,170
Exclusively in that order.

299
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,734
I tell you what, that's gonna wear
real thin, real fast

300
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:08,447
by now.

301
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:09,541
Hey!

302
00:24:10,252 --> 00:24:11,207
Put that away.

303
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:13,349
Hey!

304
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,395
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

305
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:18,135
That's mine.
Those belong to impound.

306
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,993
That tape and that player is mine!

307
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,428
Hooked on a Feeling,
Blue Swede, 1973.

308
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,124
That song belongs to me!

309
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,724
You first! You first!
Murderer!

310
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,891
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

311
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,044
You're scum! You're scum!

312
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:03,315
It's like I said, she's got a rep.

313
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,606
A lot of prisoners here have lost their
families to Ronan and his goons.

314
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:10,065
She'll last a day, tops.

315
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,655
Murderer!

316
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,158
The guards will protect her, right?

317
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,034
They're here to stop us from getting out.

318
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,141
They don't care what we do
to each other inside.

319
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:20,759
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

320
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,446
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

321
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:28,483
Check out the new meat.

322
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:32,409
I'm gonna slather you up
in Gunavian jelly,

323
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,046
and go to town...

324
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,606
Let's make something clear.

325
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,448
This one here is our booty!

326
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,949
You wanna get to him,

327
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,306
You go through us!

328
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,681
Or, more accurately,

329
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,426
we go through you.

330
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,727
I'm with them.

331
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:10,358
I hate you.

332
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,567
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

333
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,050
You're dead!

334
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,241
Dead!

335
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:57,290
Take her down to the showers.

336
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,596
It'll be easier to clean up
the blood down there.

337
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:14,518
Quill, where you going?

338
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:16,643
Quill.

339
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:18,440
Quill!

340
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:20,509
Gamora.

341
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:22,996
Consider this a death sentence

342
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,598
for your crimes against the galaxy.

343
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,014
You dare?

344
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,311
You know who I am, yes?

345
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,566
You're Drax.

346
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,595
The Destroyer.

347
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:39,814
Quill!

348
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:41,154
And you know why they call me this.

349
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,472
You slayed dozens
of Ronan's minions.

350
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:48,119
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

351
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,482
and my daughter, Camaria.

352
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,689
He slaughtered them
where they stood.

353
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:56,009
And he laughed!

354
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Quill?

355
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,286
Her life,

356
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,827
is not yours to take.

357
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,140
He killed my family.

358
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,651
I shall kill one of his in return.

359
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:10,446
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

360
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,651
Quill! What are you doing?

361
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:22,764
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

362
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,124
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

363
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,371
Woman, your words
mean nothing to me!

364
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,046
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Oh, crap.

365
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,439
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

366
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:45,287
I don't think this is the best way
to go about it.

367
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,523
Are you not the man
this wench attempted to kill?

368
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,041
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

369
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:54,784
Look, this is from
a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

370
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,038
Stabbed me with a fork.

371
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,088
Didn't like me skipping out on her
at sunrise I got...

372
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,809
right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

373
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:04,063
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

374
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,730
I was trying to get information.

375
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,467
You ever see an A'askavariian?

376
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,409
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

377
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,625
If you think I'm seriously interested
in that, then...

378
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:13,971
You don't care.

379
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:15,836
But here's the point.

380
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,522
She betrayed Ronan.

381
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,351
He's coming back for her.

382
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:21,795
And when he does,

383
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,942
that's when you...

384
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,771
Why would I put
my finger on his throat?

385
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,247
What?

386
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:32,659
Oh, no, it's a symbol.

387
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:35,037
This is a symbol for you...

388
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:36,885
slicing his throat.

389
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,368
I would not slice his throat.

390
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,018
I would cut his head clean off.

391
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,869
It's a general expression for you...

392
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,416
killing somebody.
You've heard of this.

393
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:46,345
You've seen this, right?

394
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,802
You know what that is.
Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,619
Everyone knows.
No, no.

396
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:54,484
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

397
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,785
Don't do his work for him.

398
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:12,962
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

399
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:16,264
That was my favorite knife.
Listen!

400
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,403
I could care less whether
you live or whether you die.

401
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:21,568
Then why stop the big guy?

402
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:22,551
Simple.

403
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:24,238
You know where to sell my Orb.

404
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,107
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

405
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,493
My friend Rocket here,

406
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,295
has escaped 22 prisons.

407
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,551
Oh, we're getting out.

408
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:35,778
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

409
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:38,955
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

410
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,999
Four billion units.

411
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,794
What?
Holy shit.

412
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:47,572
That Orb is my opportunity
to get away from Thanos and Ronan.

413
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,841
If you free us,

414
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,919
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

415
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,949
and I'll split the profit
between the three of us.

416
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,684
I am Groot.

417
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,119
Four of us.

418
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:02,133
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per fricking usual.

419
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,949
<i>You have been betrayed, Ronan.</i>

420
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,444
We know only that
she has been captured.

421
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,922
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

422
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,773
<i>No!</i>

423
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:15,933
<i>Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

424
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,105
<i>Look, your partnership
with Thanos is at risk.</i>

425
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:22,881
<i>Thanos requires your presence.</i>

426
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,440
<i>Now!</i>

427
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,126
With all due respect Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

428
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:35,923
and yet you summon me.

429
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:37,999
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

430
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,082
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

431
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,869
Thanos put Gamora
under your charge.

432
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:44,733
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

433
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,718
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

434
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:50,966
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

435
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,266
Lower your tone!

436
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:53,269
I may be your...

437
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:05,041
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

438
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,281
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

439
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,966
is you.

440
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,128
Your politics bore me.

441
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,095
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

442
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,056
And apparently,

443
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,467
you alienated my
favorite daughter, Gamora.

444
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:28,203
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

445
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,185
if you bring me the Orb.

446
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:34,205
But return to me again empty-handed,

447
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,404
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

448
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,209
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

449
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,519
This is one fight you won't win.

450
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,764
Let's head to the Kyln.

451
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,520
If we're gonna get out of here,

452
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:02,360
we're gonna need to get
into that watchtower.

453
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,251
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

454
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:06,905
The guards wear security bands

455
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,483
to control their ins and outs.
I need one.

456
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:11,030
Leave it to me.

457
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,210
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

458
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
His leg?
Yeah.

459
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:18,191
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

460
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:19,805
Alright.

461
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,006
And finally, on the wall back,
there is a black panel.

462
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,139
Blinky yellow light.

463
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,278
Do you see it?
Yeah.

464
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,375
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.

465
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:30,411
Purplish box, green wires.

466
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:32,843
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

467
00:34:32,968 --> 00:34:34,165
How are we supposed to do that?

468
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,527
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

469
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:38,250
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

470
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:39,660
You must be joking.

471
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,369
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

472
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,212
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

473
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,854
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

474
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:48,333
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

475
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:49,638
I got one plan,

476
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,826
and that plan requires
a fricking quarnyx battery,

477
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,042
so figure it out!

478
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,162
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

479
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,841
Now, this is important.

480
00:34:58,422 --> 00:34:59,992
Once the battery is removed,

481
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,367
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

482
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,114
Once we have it,
we got to move quickly,

483
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,083
so you definitely need
to get that last.

484
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,042
Or we could just get it first
and improvise.

485
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,890
I'll get the armband.
Leg.

486
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,281
<i>Prisoner,</i>

487
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:34,888
<i>drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,</i>

488
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,467
or we will open fire.

489
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,525
I am

490
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:47,556
Groot!

491
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:48,727
Fire!

492
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.</i>

493
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,765
You idiot!

494
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,742
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

495
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:21,298
The animal is in control.

496
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,767
Fire on my command!

497
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,941
Creepy little beast!

498
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,776
Yeah.

499
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,291
You need my what?

500
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:25,498
I need this.
Good luck.

501
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,242
It's internally wired.

502
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,575
I'll figure something out.

503
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:33,884
Drop the leg!

504
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,618
Drop the leg and move back
to your cell!

505
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,628
Rocket!

506
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,624
Move to the watchtower!

507
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:30,405
You!

508
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:32,777
Man who has lain
with an A'askavariian!

509
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,122
It was one time, man.

510
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,635
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

511
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,794
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

512
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:06,689
Why is this one here?

513
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,719
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

514
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,390
I always keep my promises,

515
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:12,776
when they're
to muscle-bound whack-jobs

516
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:14,323
who will kill me if I don't.
Here you go.

517
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:17,491
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

518
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,767
What?
No, I thought it'd be funny.

519
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:20,437
Was it funny?

520
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,426
Wait, what did he look
like hopping around?

521
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:24,588
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

522
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,586
How are we going to leave?

523
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,045
Well, he's got a plan.

524
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,920
Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

525
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,787
I have a plan! I have a plan!

526
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:39,079
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

527
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

528
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

529
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,959
It's just a metaphor, dude.

530
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,050
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

531
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,702
Nothing goes over my head.

532
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:55,174
My reflexes are too fast.
I would catch it.

533
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:59,131
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

534
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,851
Those are some big guns.

535
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,875
On my command!

536
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:11,382
Number one!

537
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,784
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

538
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:15,736
Hold on!

539
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:18,683
Number two!

540
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,649
I recognize this animal.

541
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:23,961
We'd roast them over a flame pit
as children.

542
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,497
Their flesh was quite delicious.

543
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:26,601
Not helping!

544
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,180
Number three!

545
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,861
All fire on my command!

546
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:38,231
Three!

547
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:39,846
Two!

548
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,357
One!

549
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,854
He turned off the artificial gravity,

550
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:59,548
everywhere but in here.

551
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,323
I told you I had a plan.

552
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,633
That was a pretty good plan.

553
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,186
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

554
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:19,687
It's the Milano, the orange
and blue one over in the corner.

555
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,764
They crumpled
my pants up into a ball.

556
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,812
That's rude! They folded yours.

557
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,728
The Orb's there. Let's go.

558
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,913
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

559
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,354
What?
That bastard didn't put it back.

560
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,205
Put what back?

561
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:41,687
Here.

562
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,923
Get them to the ship.

563
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:43,755
I will be right back.

564
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:46,140
How are you gonna possibly...
Just keep the Milano close by.

565
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,939
Go.

566
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:48,303
Go!

567
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,978
My neck!

568
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,266
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

569
00:43:17,615 --> 00:43:19,583
He declined to share
that information with me.

570
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,302
Well, screw this, then!

571
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,568
I ain't waiting around
for some humie with a death wish.

572
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,926
You got the Orb, right?

573
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,088
Yes.

574
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:52,128
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

575
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:52,999
No!

576
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,202
We're not leaving without the Orb.

577
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:04,956
Behold.

578
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,251
This one shows spirit.

579
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,526
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

580
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,861
Companion,

581
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:21,048
what were you retrieving?

582
00:44:26,683 --> 00:44:28,208
You're an imbecile.

583
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:40,674
Yo, Ranger Rick!
What are you doing?

584
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,946
You can't take apart my ship
without asking me!

585
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,843
See, what is this?
Don't touch that!

586
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:45,921
It's a bomb.

587
00:44:46,078 --> 00:44:47,079
A bomb?

588
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,851
And you leave it lying around?

589
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,616
I was gonna put it in a box.

590
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,879
What's a box gonna do?

591
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:54,030
How about this one?
No! Hey!

592
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:55,348
Leave it alone.
Why? What is it?

593
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,913
Shut up.
Hey!

594
00:44:58,347 --> 00:44:59,278
What is that?

595
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:01,589
That's for if things get really hardcore.

596
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:03,798
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

597
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,338
No one's blowing up moons.

598
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,522
You just wanna suck
the joy out of everything.

599
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:10,235
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

600
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,120
We're heading in
the right direction.

601
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:13,131
For now.

602
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,907
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

603
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,449
And how much do you trust me?

604
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,450
I'd trust you a lot more
if you told me what this was.

605
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,663
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

606
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:25,726
I don't know what it is.

607
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,988
If it's a weapon,
we should use it against Ronan.

608
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,412
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

609
00:45:30,414 --> 00:45:31,718
Or just you, murderess!

610
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:33,238
I let you live once, princess!

611
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,288
I am not a princess!
Hey!

612
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,851
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

613
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,578
We're stuck together,
until we get the money.

614
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:45,327
I have no interest in money.

615
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:46,903
Great.

616
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,274
That means more money
for the three of us.

617
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,038
For the four of us.

618
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:57,352
Partners.

619
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,759
We have an agreement,

620
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,201
but I would never be partners
with the likes of you.

621
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,209
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

622
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,448
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

623
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,605
Oh, she has no idea.

624
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,552
If I had a black light,

625
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,478
the place would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

626
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,641
You got issues, Quill.

627
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,880
I swear.

628
00:46:30,366 --> 00:46:32,735
I don't know where
they went! I swear.

629
00:46:33,635 --> 00:46:36,115
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

630
00:46:36,117 --> 00:46:37,118
Yeah.

631
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,561
Ronan,

632
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,154
the Nova Corps sent a fleet
to defend the prison.

633
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,770
Well then...

634
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,280
send Necrocraft
to every corner of the quadrant.

635
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,884
Find the Orb.

636
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:49,947
Any means, any price.

637
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,325
And this place?

638
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:53,473
The Nova can't know what we're after.

639
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,789
Cleanse it!

640
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,440
Do you got any other
cute little buggers like this one?

641
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,641
I like to stick them all in a row
on my control console.

642
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,922
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

643
00:47:08,404 --> 00:47:10,104
He's being fully serious.

644
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,586
In that case,

645
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:12,602
I can show you...

646
00:47:13,336 --> 00:47:15,561
But first, you gonna tell me
what this Orb is,

647
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,017
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

648
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,909
And then you gonna tell me,

649
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:22,127
who out there might wanna buy it.

650
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,382
Sir,

651
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:25,589
the high-end community is a...

652
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,079
The high-end community is a...

653
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:31,903
It's a tight-knit...

654
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,908
Tight-knit...

655
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,080
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

656
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,165
I cannot possibly betray

657
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,720
the confidentiality of my buyers!

658
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,447
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

659
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,372
Carina.

660
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,726
Yes, Master.

661
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,561
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

662
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,541
We do, Master.

663
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,850
Then use them.

664
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,684
I don't have to remind you

665
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:13,592
what happened to the last attendant
who disappointed me.

666
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,378
Do I?

667
00:48:18,138 --> 00:48:19,254
Chop, chop.

668
00:48:19,874 --> 00:48:22,148
Our guests will be here soon.

669
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,498
Heads up! We're inbound.

670
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,321
What is it?

671
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,114
It's called Knowhere.

672
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,124
The severed head
of an ancient celestial being.

673
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,569
Be wary headed in, rodent.

674
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,279
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

675
00:49:26,357 --> 00:49:29,388
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

676
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,598
to mine the organic matter
within the skull.

677
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:34,087
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

678
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,082
All rare resources,

679
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,067
highly valued in black
markets across the galaxy.

680
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,593
It's dangerous and illegal work,

681
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,158
suitable only for outlaws.

682
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:45,374
Well, I come from
a planet of outlaws.

683
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,535
Billy the Kid,

684
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:47,807
Bonnie and Clyde,

685
00:49:47,871 --> 00:49:48,899
John Stamos.

686
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,917
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

687
00:49:50,919 --> 00:49:51,966
Yeah, you should.

688
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,127
Excuse me.

689
00:49:54,395 --> 00:49:56,540
Watch your wallets.
Can you spare any units?

690
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,336
Get out of here.

691
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,443
Your buyer's in there?

692
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,348
We are to wait here
for his representative.

693
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,241
Get out of here!

694
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,862
This is no respectable establishment.

695
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,328
What do you expect us to do
while we wait?

696
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,246
Yes! Yes!

697
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:43,274
My Orloni has won,

698
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,184
as I won at all things!

699
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,725
Now, let's put more of this liquid
into our bodies.

700
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:52,929
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

701
00:50:54,704 --> 00:50:56,798
Man, you would not believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

702
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,661
I might actually lose money on this job.

703
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,542
My connection is making us wait.

704
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,820
It's just a negotiation tactic.

705
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:04,666
Trust me, this is my specialty.

706
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,541
Where yours is more,

707
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,695
Stab, stab. Those are my terms.

708
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,156
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

709
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,418
Thanos?

710
00:51:15,787 --> 00:51:17,152
He's not my father.

711
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,172
When Thanos took my home world,

712
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:22,038
he killed my parents in front of me.

713
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:24,512
He tortured me,

714
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,080
turned me into a weapon.

715
00:51:27,673 --> 00:51:31,089
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

716
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,648
I couldn't stand by and...

717
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,204
Why would you risk your life for this?

718
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:44,178
My mother gave it to me.

719
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:48,991
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

720
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:51,474
I happened to have it on me,
when I was...

721
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:54,472
The day that she...

722
00:51:57,485 --> 00:51:59,249
You know, when I left Earth.

723
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,246
What do you do with it?

724
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,812
Do? Nothing.

725
00:52:02,814 --> 00:52:03,673
You listen to it.

726
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:05,455
Or you can dance.

727
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:07,909
I'm a warrior and an assassin.

728
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:09,804
I do not dance.

729
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:10,945
Really?

730
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,889
On my planet,

731
00:52:13,595 --> 00:52:15,571
there is a legend about people like you.

732
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,737
It's called...

733
00:52:17,446 --> 00:52:18,439
Footloose.

734
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:19,765
And in it,

735
00:52:20,946 --> 00:52:22,199
a great hero...

736
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:24,336
named Kevin Bacon,

737
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:29,855
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

738
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,569
It's the greatest thing there is.

739
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:35,440
Who put the sticks up their butts?

740
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,005
What? No, that's just a...

741
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,992
That is cruel.
It's just a phrase

742
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,413
people use.

743
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:01,693
The melody is pleasant!

744
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:19,819
No!

745
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:21,150
What the hell?

746
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:22,878
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

747
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:26,131
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

748
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:28,492
Your pelvic sorcery!

749
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:30,201
That is not what is happening here.

750
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:36,796
Oh, no.

751
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,395
Stop it!

752
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,546
What are you doing?

753
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:52,403
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

754
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,693
That is true!
He has no respect!

755
00:53:54,695 --> 00:53:56,023
That is also true!

756
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,158
Hold on! Hold on!

757
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,349
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

758
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,768
You just wanna laugh at me
like everyone else!

759
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,348
Rocket, you're drunk. Alright?
No one's laughing at you.

760
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:07,158
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

761
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:09,303
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

762
00:54:09,773 --> 00:54:11,775
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

763
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,076
and put back together, over and over

764
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:15,616
and turned into some...

765
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:17,856
Some little monster!

766
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:19,720
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

767
00:54:19,813 --> 00:54:21,369
He called me vermin!

768
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,745
She called me rodent!

769
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,275
Let's see if you can laugh

770
00:54:26,277 --> 00:54:29,049
after five or six good shots
to your fricking face!

771
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,955
No, no, no, no!

772
00:54:30,957 --> 00:54:33,158
Four billion units! Rocket!

773
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,051
Come on, man. Hey!

774
00:54:34,053 --> 00:54:36,673
Suck it up for one more
lousy night and you're rich.

775
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:46,571
Fine.

776
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,952
But I can't promise, when all this is over
I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.

777
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,236
See? That's exactly
why none of you have any friends!

778
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,675
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

779
00:54:57,677 --> 00:55:01,181
We have traveled,
halfway across the quadrant.

780
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,682
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

781
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:07,806
Drax!
Let him go.

782
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:09,540
We don't need him.

783
00:55:12,128 --> 00:55:13,628
Milady Gamora.

784
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,712
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

785
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,123
Ok, this isn't creepy at all.

786
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,511
We house the galaxy's largest collection

787
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:28,648
of fauna,

788
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,295
relics and species of all manner.

789
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,795
I present to you,

790
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,734
Taneleer Tivan,

791
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,730
The Collector.

792
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,598
Oh, my dear Gamora.

793
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,776
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

794
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,440
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

795
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,768
We have what we discussed.

796
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,237
What is that...

797
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,923
thing there?

798
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,536
I am Groot.

799
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,530
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

800
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:21,802
Sir...

801
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,083
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

802
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:28,577
At the moment of your death, of course.

803
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,526
I am Groot.

804
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,445
Why, so he could turn you
into a fricking chair?

805
00:56:33,886 --> 00:56:35,035
That's your pet?

806
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,324
What?

807
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:37,057
Tivan.

808
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,569
We have been halfway
around the galaxy,

809
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:42,042
retrieving this Orb.

810
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,790
Very well, then.

811
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,013
Let us see what you brought.

812
00:56:59,846 --> 00:57:01,291
Three quarnyx batteries,

813
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,041
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

814
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,781
No, cases.

815
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,656
Last time, you sent me...

816
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,895
You shall send a message for me.

817
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,067
Oh, my new friends.

818
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,793
Before creation itself,

819
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:20,253
there were six singularities.

820
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:25,401
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

821
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:27,335
and the remnants of these systems

822
00:57:27,337 --> 00:57:30,899
were forged into concentrated ingots.

823
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,910
Infinity Stones.

824
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,544
These stones, it seems,

825
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:39,140
can only be brandished

826
00:57:39,142 --> 00:57:42,480
by beings of extraordinary strength.

827
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:43,898
Observe.

828
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,869
These carriers can use the Stone,

829
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:52,939
to mow down entire civilizations

830
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:55,784
like wheat in a field.

831
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:00,236
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

832
00:58:01,013 --> 00:58:02,444
Once, for a moment,

833
00:58:02,765 --> 00:58:06,518
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

834
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,997
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

835
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,891
Beautiful.

836
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,261
Beyond compare.

837
00:58:23,895 --> 00:58:27,871
We're all very fascinated whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

838
00:58:29,454 --> 00:58:30,994
How would you like to get paid?

839
00:58:31,196 --> 00:58:32,659
What do you think, fancy man?

840
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:33,326
Units!

841
00:58:34,122 --> 00:58:35,364
Very well, then.

842
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,151
Carina.

843
00:58:43,214 --> 00:58:44,215
Stand back.

844
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,278
I will no longer be your slave!

845
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,159
No!

846
00:59:36,297 --> 00:59:37,378
What the...

847
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:49,754
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

848
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:51,765
What do you still have it for?

849
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:53,111
What are we gonna do,
leave it in there?

850
00:59:53,113 --> 00:59:55,706
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

851
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:57,351
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

852
00:59:57,353 --> 00:59:59,167
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

853
00:59:59,398 --> 01:00:00,994
There's a chance they can contain it.

854
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,343
Are you kidding me?

855
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:04,945
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

856
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,495
So he can destroy the galaxy?

857
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:08,222
What are you
some saint all of a sudden?

858
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,309
What has the galaxy
ever done for you?

859
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:11,425
Why would you wanna save it?

860
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:13,311
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

861
01:00:13,313 --> 01:00:14,763
Peter, listen to me.

862
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:18,227
We cannot allow the Stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

863
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:21,370
We have to go back to your ship,
and deliver it to Nova.

864
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,922
Right, right, ok.
I think you're right.

865
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,484
Or...

866
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:28,944
we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

867
01:00:28,946 --> 01:00:31,551
who's really nice
for a whole lot of money.

868
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:34,812
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

869
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:36,015
You're despicable.
I...

870
01:00:36,685 --> 01:00:37,801
Dishonorable.

871
01:00:38,141 --> 01:00:39,342
Faithless!

872
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,330
Oh, no.
At last!

873
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,234
I shall meet my foe,

874
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:46,584
and destroy him.

875
01:00:46,606 --> 01:00:48,335
You called Ronan?

876
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,794
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

877
01:00:57,498 --> 01:00:59,626
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

878
01:01:03,549 --> 01:01:05,533
Ronan the Accuser!

879
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,438
You are the one
who transmitted the message?

880
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,109
You killed my Wife.

881
01:01:10,923 --> 01:01:12,938
You killed my daughter!

882
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:21,907
I told you, you can't fit.

883
01:01:21,909 --> 01:01:23,295
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

884
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:30,570
It is Gamora.

885
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:32,712
She is escaping with the Orb.

886
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:42,960
No!

887
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,321
Nebula,

888
01:01:45,065 --> 01:01:46,087
retrieve the Orb.

889
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,064
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

890
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,188
Bring it down!

891
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,929
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

892
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:39,804
How?

893
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:41,638
We've got no weaponry
on these things.

894
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:43,558
These pods are industrial grade.

895
01:02:43,736 --> 01:02:44,967
<i>They're nearly indestructible.</i>

896
01:02:45,115 --> 01:02:47,276
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

897
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,164
That's not what I'm saying.

898
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,324
Let me borrow your ride.

899
01:04:11,802 --> 01:04:14,151
I don't recall killing your family.

900
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,234
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

901
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:38,694
Quill, I'm trapped.

902
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:40,591
I can't make it to the Milano.

903
01:04:41,118 --> 01:04:42,269
I have to head out.

904
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,563
Wait! These things aren't meant
to go out there.

905
01:04:53,395 --> 01:04:55,284
You are a disappointment, sister.

906
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,803
Of all our siblings,

907
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:00,304
I hated you least.

908
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:01,932
Nebula, please.

909
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,799
If Ronan gets this stone

910
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,632
he'll kill us all.

911
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:06,725
Not all.

912
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:09,204
You will already be dead.

913
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,656
<i>Ronan,</i>

914
01:06:05,259 --> 01:06:06,352
<i>it is done.</i>

915
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:11,166
<i>Quill, come on.</i>

916
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,979
<i>Her body mods should keep
her alive a couple more minutes,</i>

917
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,818
<i>but there is nothing we can do for her.</i>

918
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,913
<i>These pods aren't
meant to be out here.</i>

919
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,932
<i>In a second, we're gonna be
in the same boat.</i>

920
01:06:28,774 --> 01:06:30,007
Damn it.

921
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,283
<i>Quill?</i>

922
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:34,935
Yondu! Yondu.

923
01:06:35,456 --> 01:06:36,238
<i>This is Quill!</i>

924
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,579
<i>My coordinates are</i>

925
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:39,869
<i>227K324.
Quill?</i>

926
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,132
<i>Quill, what are you doing?</i>

927
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:42,958
<i>Just outside Knowhere.</i>

928
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,088
If you're there, come get me.

929
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,921
I'm all yours.

930
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,728
<i>Quill, don't be ridiculous.</i>

931
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,859
<i>Get back into your pod!</i>

932
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,580
<i>You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.</i>

933
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,089
<i>You'll die in seconds!</i>

934
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,187
<i>Quill.</i>

935
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:12,460
Quill?

936
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:16,107
What happened?

937
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,108
I saw you out there.

938
01:08:21,172 --> 01:08:23,106
I don't know what came over me.

939
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,203
But I couldn't let you die.

940
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,441
I found something inside of myself.

941
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,586
Something

942
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,868
incredibly heroic.

943
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,999
I mean, not to brag,

944
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,886
but, objectively...

945
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,194
Where's the Orb?

946
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,349
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

947
01:08:47,702 --> 01:08:48,749
What?

948
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,401
Welcome home, Peter.

949
01:09:16,555 --> 01:09:17,809
Blasted idiot.

950
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:19,131
They're all idiots!

951
01:09:20,644 --> 01:09:22,577
Quill just got himself captured.

952
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:26,644
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

953
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:28,740
take on a fricking army!

954
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,461
You're right.

955
01:09:34,388 --> 01:09:35,685
I was a fool.

956
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,642
All the anger,

957
01:09:41,395 --> 01:09:43,003
all the rage,

958
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,146
was just to cover my loss.

959
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:57,241
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.

960
01:09:57,243 --> 01:09:59,560
My wife and child are dead.

961
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,039
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

962
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:05,543
Everybody's got dead people.

963
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,099
It's no excuse to get everybody else
dead along the way!

964
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,511
Come on, Groot.

965
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:15,945
Ronan has the Stone.

966
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,802
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

967
01:10:19,804 --> 01:10:21,529
as fast as we can and maybe,

968
01:10:21,755 --> 01:10:26,621
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

969
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:30,492
I am Groot.

970
01:10:30,624 --> 01:10:32,758
Save them? How?

971
01:10:33,102 --> 01:10:35,138
I am Groot.

972
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:38,438
I know they're the only friends
that we ever had,

973
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,053
but there is an army
of Ravagers around them.

974
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,682
And there is only two of us!

975
01:10:44,124 --> 01:10:45,176
Three.

976
01:10:54,468 --> 01:10:56,709
You're making me

977
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:58,446
beat, up,

978
01:10:58,651 --> 01:10:59,652
grass!

979
01:11:02,086 --> 01:11:03,989
The Orb is in my possession,

980
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,365
as I promised.

981
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,115
<i>Bring it to me.</i>

982
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,975
Yes, that was our agreement.

983
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,930
Bring you the Orb,

984
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,954
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

985
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,847
However,

986
01:11:19,028 --> 01:11:22,363
now that I know it
contains an Infinity Stone,

987
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,662
I wonder what use I have for you.

988
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,185
<i>Boy,</i>

989
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:29,179
<i>I would reconsider your current course.</i>

990
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,949
Master! You cannot!

991
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,604
Thanos is the most powerful being
in the universe.

992
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,330
Not anymore.

993
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,401
You call me boy!

994
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:07,044
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice
on Xandar,

995
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,587
and burn it to its core!

996
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,586
Then Thanos,

997
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,258
I am coming for you.

998
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,324
After Xandar,
you are going to kill my father?

999
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,643
You dare to oppose me?

1000
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,643
You see what he has turned me into.

1001
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,870
If you kill him,

1002
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:28,760
I will help you destroy
a thousand planets.

1003
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,285
You betray me?

1004
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,318
Steal my money?

1005
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,474
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1006
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,293
When I picked you up as a kid,

1007
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,881
these boys wanted to eat you.

1008
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,548
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

1009
01:12:42,884 --> 01:12:44,456
I saved your life!

1010
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,740
Oh, will you shut up about that? God!

1011
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:49,158
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

1012
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,891
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

1013
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:55,639
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

1014
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,166
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

1015
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:00,346
You abducted me, man.

1016
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:02,878
You stole me from my home
and from my family.

1017
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,008
You don't give
a damn about your Terra!

1018
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,670
You're scared because
you're soft in here.

1019
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:10,319
Here, right here!

1020
01:13:10,418 --> 01:13:11,321
Yondu!

1021
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,720
Listen to me.

1022
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,274
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

1023
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,007
I know what he's got, girl.

1024
01:13:17,009 --> 01:13:18,931
Then you know we must get it back!

1025
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:22,373
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

1026
01:13:22,886 --> 01:13:24,312
We have to warn them.

1027
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:26,334
Billions of people will perish.

1028
01:13:26,347 --> 01:13:28,658
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

1029
01:13:29,069 --> 01:13:30,270
Sentiment?

1030
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,617
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1031
01:13:37,885 --> 01:13:38,618
That's it.

1032
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:41,402
No!

1033
01:13:43,349 --> 01:13:46,447
But a captain's got to teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

1034
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,240
Captain's got to teach stuff!

1035
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,985
If you kill me now,

1036
01:13:53,252 --> 01:13:56,747
you are saying goodbye to the biggest
score you have ever seen.

1037
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,638
The Stone?

1038
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,488
I hope you got something
better than that.

1039
01:14:06,827 --> 01:14:09,478
Because ain't nobody stealing
from Ronan.

1040
01:14:10,519 --> 01:14:11,850
We got a ringer.

1041
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,371
Is that right?

1042
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,340
She knows everything there
is to know about Ronan.

1043
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:18,404
His ships,

1044
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,451
his army.

1045
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,588
He's vulnerable.

1046
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:24,393
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

1047
01:14:24,395 --> 01:14:27,671
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1048
01:14:35,761 --> 01:14:36,842
Let him go!

1049
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,958
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1050
01:14:41,186 --> 01:14:43,443
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1051
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,968
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1052
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,327
<i>Attention, idiots.</i>

1053
01:14:57,884 --> 01:15:00,785
<i>The lunatic on top of
this craft is holding a...</i>

1054
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:02,358
<i>Hadron Enforcer.</i>

1055
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:04,188
It's a weapon of my own design.

1056
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,461
What the hell?

1057
01:15:05,613 --> 01:15:08,509
<i>If you don't hand over
our companions now,</i>

1058
01:15:08,829 --> 01:15:10,711
<i>he's gonna tear
your ship a new one.</i>

1059
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:12,739
<i>A very big new one!</i>

1060
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:14,048
I ain't buying it.

1061
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,364
I'm giving you to the count of five.

1062
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:18,868
Five! Four!
No, no, no. no, no!

1063
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:20,061
Three
No! Wait, hold on!

1064
01:15:20,139 --> 01:15:21,678
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1065
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,377
We figured it out! We're fine!

1066
01:15:23,871 --> 01:15:25,700
<i>Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on?</i>

1067
01:15:27,183 --> 01:15:28,807
You call that figured it out?

1068
01:15:28,837 --> 01:15:31,158
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1069
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,789
Oh, you want to talk about senseless?

1070
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:35,145
How about trying to save us
by blowing us up?

1071
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:38,202
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1072
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:39,958
And how on earth
were they gonna turn us over

1073
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,802
when you only gave them
a count of five?

1074
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:45,186
We didn't have time to work
out the minutiae of the plan.

1075
01:15:45,277 --> 01:15:47,598
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

1076
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,136
I am Groot.
They are ungrateful.

1077
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,363
What's important now,

1078
01:15:51,365 --> 01:15:54,272
is we get the Ravagers' army
to help us save Xandar.

1079
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:56,158
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1080
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,881
who's just gonna sell
to somebody even worse?

1081
01:15:58,092 --> 01:15:59,594
We'll figure that part out later.

1082
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:01,200
We have to stop Ronan.

1083
01:16:01,202 --> 01:16:02,156
How?

1084
01:16:02,772 --> 01:16:03,853
I have a plan.

1085
01:16:03,948 --> 01:16:04,949
You've got a plan?

1086
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:06,329
Yes.

1087
01:16:06,534 --> 01:16:08,892
First of all, you're copying me from
when I said I had a plan.

1088
01:16:08,894 --> 01:16:09,889
No, I'm not.

1089
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,598
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1090
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,599
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1091
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,478
I have part of a plan!

1092
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,005
What percentage of a plan, do you have?

1093
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,878
You don't get to ask questions

1094
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,639
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

1095
01:16:22,641 --> 01:16:24,214
I just saved Quill.

1096
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:27,209
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

1097
01:16:27,241 --> 01:16:29,318
When did we establish it?
Like three seconds ago!

1098
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,254
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1099
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,637
She's right.
You don't get an opinion.

1100
01:16:34,077 --> 01:16:35,158
What percentage?

1101
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,544
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1102
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,004
Twelve percent?

1103
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,180
That's a fake laugh.

1104
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:43,233
It's real!
Totally fake.

1105
01:16:43,235 --> 01:16:45,636
That is the most real, authentic,

1106
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:49,341
hysterical laugh of my entire life
because that is not a plan.

1107
01:16:49,383 --> 01:16:50,451
It's barely a concept.

1108
01:16:50,453 --> 01:16:51,751
You're taking their side?

1109
01:16:51,876 --> 01:16:53,082
I am Groot.

1110
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:54,923
So what, it's better than 11%?

1111
01:16:54,925 --> 01:16:56,255
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1112
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:58,214
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1113
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,327
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1114
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,361
Guys.

1115
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:12,489
Come on. Yondu is gonna
be here in two seconds.

1116
01:17:12,491 --> 01:17:14,971
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1117
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,363
I need your help.

1118
01:17:20,258 --> 01:17:21,542
I look around at us.

1119
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,927
You know what I see?

1120
01:17:25,364 --> 01:17:26,365
Losers.

1121
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,130
I mean, like,

1122
01:17:30,629 --> 01:17:32,248
folks who have lost stuff.

1123
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,657
And we have, man.
We have, all of us.

1124
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:36,931
Our homes,

1125
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:38,920
our families,

1126
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:41,498
normal lives.

1127
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,778
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1128
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,316
Today, it's given us something.

1129
01:17:47,385 --> 01:17:48,955
It has given us a chance.

1130
01:17:49,293 --> 01:17:50,658
To do what?

1131
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,612
To give a shit.

1132
01:17:54,605 --> 01:17:55,460
For once.

1133
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,820
Not run away.

1134
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,840
I for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1135
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:06,866
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1136
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,207
But Quill,

1137
01:18:09,755 --> 01:18:11,063
stopping Ronan,

1138
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,199
it's impossible.

1139
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,906
You're asking us to die.

1140
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,209
Yeah, I guess I am.

1141
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,166
Quill.

1142
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,752
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1143
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,092
I will be grateful,

1144
01:18:52,781 --> 01:18:54,780
to die among my friends.

1145
01:18:59,427 --> 01:19:01,469
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1146
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,860
I will fight beside you.

1147
01:19:06,428 --> 01:19:07,735
And in the end,

1148
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:11,909
I will see my wife
and daughter again.

1149
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,579
I am Groot.

1150
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,483
Oh, what the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1151
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,892
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1152
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,098
We're all standing up now.

1153
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:48,808
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1154
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,900
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1155
01:19:57,947 --> 01:19:59,838
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1156
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,194
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1157
01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:04,864
All plants, animals,

1158
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,062
Nova Corps.
Everything will die.

1159
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,270
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1160
01:20:12,192 --> 01:20:14,308
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1161
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,265
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1162
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,104
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1163
01:20:20,668 --> 01:20:23,478
Won't there be hundreds of
Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1164
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,945
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1165
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,640
Once they know we're on board,

1166
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:37,221
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1167
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:39,669
Which I can disable
by dismantling the power source.

1168
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:41,529
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1169
01:20:41,726 --> 01:20:44,889
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer
to kill Ronan.

1170
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:50,286
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1171
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,912
Use these devices to contain it.

1172
01:20:53,694 --> 01:20:55,025
If you touch it,

1173
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,691
it will kill you.

1174
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,543
I'll contact one of the Nova officers
who arrested us.

1175
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,898
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1176
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,243
There's one more thing
we need to complete the plan.

1177
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,206
That guy's eye.

1178
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:14,798
No! No, we don't.
No, we don't need

1179
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,131
that guy's eye.

1180
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,846
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1181
01:21:24,594 --> 01:21:26,278
<i>Ronan's fleet has been spotted,</i>

1182
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,406
<i>and will arrive in T-minus</i>

1183
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,164
<i>fifteen minutes.</i>

1184
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:30,798
Remember, boy.

1185
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,993
At the end of all this,

1186
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,806
I get the Stone.

1187
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:37,773
You cross me, we kill you all.

1188
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,371
Let's go get them, boys!

1189
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,120
This is a terrible plan.

1190
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,720
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1191
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:21,019
Nova Prime.

1192
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:24,499
I received a transmission
from one of the Ravagers.

1193
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:27,958
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1194
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,325
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1195
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,486
Good God.

1196
01:22:30,533 --> 01:22:32,925
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1197
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:35,134
Did he say why
we should believe him?

1198
01:22:35,544 --> 01:22:37,758
He said his crew
just escaped from prison

1199
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,730
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1200
01:22:41,786 --> 01:22:42,947
He says that he's an...

1201
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,807
a-hole.

1202
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:46,338
But he's not,

1203
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,096
and I'm quoting him here,

1204
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,607
100% a dick.

1205
01:22:51,111 --> 01:22:52,319
Do you believe him?

1206
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,803
I don't know that I believe anyone
is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1207
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,804
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1208
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:03,629
Yeah.

1209
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,840
A fleet approaches.

1210
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,124
They appear to be Ravagers.

1211
01:23:28,388 --> 01:23:29,469
Fire!

1212
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:41,871
Cover it down.

1213
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:43,332
Submerge!

1214
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,046
Rocket, hurry!

1215
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,766
All pilots, dive!

1216
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,081
They're beneath us!

1217
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,331
Evacuate the city.

1218
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,962
Our priority is to get our people
away from the battle.

1219
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,681
Forward thrust, now!

1220
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,521
Come on!

1221
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,197
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1222
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,650
Hell!

1223
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,245
I'm going down, Quill!

1224
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,164
No more games with me, boy!

1225
01:25:14,619 --> 01:25:15,666
I'll see you

1226
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:17,218
<i>at the end of this!</i>

1227
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,386
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1228
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:27,464
We'll never make it up there!

1229
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,606
<i>Peter Quill.</i>

1230
01:25:43,901 --> 01:25:46,161
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

1231
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,608
For the record,
I advised against trusting you here.

1232
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:51,374
They got my dick message!

1233
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,936
Prove me wrong.

1234
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,293
Yes!

1235
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:24,673
Yes!

1236
01:26:27,985 --> 01:26:29,569
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1237
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,530
The starboard kern has been breached!

1238
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:36,758
We have been boarded.

1239
01:26:36,815 --> 01:26:38,226
Continue our approach.

1240
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,812
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1241
01:26:39,854 --> 01:26:42,505
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1242
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,758
Seal security doors!

1243
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:44,847
Now!

1244
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,014
Get out of my way!

1245
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,565
Oh, man.

1246
01:27:01,998 --> 01:27:06,248
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1247
01:27:06,357 --> 01:27:09,858
<i>The Dark Aster must
not reach the ground.</i>

1248
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,846
<i>Locked in!</i>

1249
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,846
<i>Locked in.</i>

1250
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,401
We're locked in.

1251
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,587
I can barely see.

1252
01:28:35,325 --> 01:28:37,054
When did you learn to do that?

1253
01:28:37,681 --> 01:28:40,009
Pretty sure the answer is
I am Groot.

1254
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,922
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1255
01:28:46,982 --> 01:28:50,648
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1256
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,407
It is pleasing to once again have

1257
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,041
friends.

1258
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,151
You Quill,

1259
01:28:57,943 --> 01:28:59,011
are my friend.

1260
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,042
Thanks.

1261
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:02,805
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1262
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,124
And this green whore she too.

1263
01:29:06,126 --> 01:29:07,565
Oh, you must stop!

1264
01:29:10,526 --> 01:29:11,465
Gamora,

1265
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:13,406
look at what you have done.

1266
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,601
You have always been weak.

1267
01:29:16,255 --> 01:29:18,288
You stupid, traitorous...

1268
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:25,862
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1269
01:29:27,037 --> 01:29:28,118
Head to the flight deck.

1270
01:29:28,244 --> 01:29:30,291
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

1271
01:29:38,174 --> 01:29:40,251
Yondu Udonta.

1272
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,542
Order your men
to turn on the Nova Corps.

1273
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,053
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1274
01:30:03,186 --> 01:30:04,335
Time to die...

1275
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,783
Nebula, please.

1276
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:54,257
Enough of this.

1277
01:30:54,259 --> 01:30:55,597
Necrocraft pilots,

1278
01:30:55,599 --> 01:30:57,989
enact immolation initiative.

1279
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:02,878
They're dive-bombing the city!

1280
01:31:03,013 --> 01:31:04,822
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1281
01:31:05,004 --> 01:31:06,654
No! Hold your positions.

1282
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,718
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1283
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,324
<i>We'll take care of the people
down here.</i>

1284
01:31:41,326 --> 01:31:43,907
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

1285
01:31:46,987 --> 01:31:48,227
Star-Lord.

1286
01:31:48,832 --> 01:31:49,833
Finally.

1287
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,487
You thief!

1288
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,204
You will never make it to Ronan.

1289
01:32:22,014 --> 01:32:24,338
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1290
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,205
Come on!

1291
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,205
Finger to the throat means death.

1292
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,771
Metaphor.

1293
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:29,102
Yeah, sorta.

1294
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:30,951
Oh, no.

1295
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,931
Xandar!

1296
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:03,105
You stand accused.

1297
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,405
<i>Your wretched peace treaty,</i>

1298
01:34:06,485 --> 01:34:08,509
<i>will not save you now.</i>

1299
01:34:09,072 --> 01:34:12,331
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1300
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,761
Rocket!

1301
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,729
Hold on, Saal, just...

1302
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,680
Quill, you got to hurry.

1303
01:35:08,116 --> 01:35:09,558
<i>The city's been evacuated,</i>

1304
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,892
<i>but we're getting our asses
kicked down here.</i>

1305
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,685
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1306
01:35:38,892 --> 01:35:39,893
Nebula!

1307
01:35:41,141 --> 01:35:41,969
Sister,

1308
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:43,638
help us fight Ronan.

1309
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:45,512
You know he's crazy.

1310
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,566
I know you're both crazy.

1311
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,001
No!

1312
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,573
What the...

1313
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,685
Get out!

1314
01:36:37,298 --> 01:36:38,299
You did it!

1315
01:37:04,358 --> 01:37:05,689
I was mistaken.

1316
01:37:06,078 --> 01:37:07,906
I do remember your family.

1317
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,109
Their screams were

1318
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,248
pitiful. I...

1319
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,486
No, Groot!

1320
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,206
You can't.

1321
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,770
You'll die.

1322
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,163
Why are you doing this?

1323
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,810
Why?

1324
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,970
We

1325
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,441
Are

1326
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,565
Groot.

1327
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,792
I called him an idiot.

1328
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,643
You killed Groot!

1329
01:41:04,589 --> 01:41:05,512
Behold!

1330
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,482
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1331
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,894
What fruit have they wrought?

1332
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,153
Only that my father,

1333
01:41:15,155 --> 01:41:17,251
and his father

1334
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,564
shall finally know vengeance.

1335
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,281
People of Xandar,

1336
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:25,574
the time has come

1337
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,650
to rejoice and renounce

1338
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,327
your paltry gods!

1339
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,162
Your salvation is at hand.

1340
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,445
Listen to these words.

1341
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,981
Now bring it down hard!

1342
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,681
What are you doing?

1343
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,771
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1344
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,413
Gamora.

1345
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,222
Subtle. Take it back.

1346
01:42:15,924 --> 01:42:18,468
What are you doing?

1347
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,213
I'm distracting you,

1348
01:42:20,215 --> 01:42:21,339
you big turd blossom.

1349
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,730
No!

1350
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,480
Peter! Take my hand!

1351
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,452
Take my hand, Peter.

1352
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,611
Mom.

1353
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,168
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1354
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,102
You're mortal!

1355
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,006
How?

1356
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,303
You said it yourself, bitch.

1357
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,532
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1358
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:02,144
Well, Well, Well.

1359
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,234
Quite the light show.

1360
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,524
Ain't this sweet.

1361
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,566
But you got some business
to attend to...

1362
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,889
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1363
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,150
Peter, you can't.

1364
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:20,248
Peter.
You got to reconsider this, Yondu.

1365
01:45:20,876 --> 01:45:22,362
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1366
01:45:22,364 --> 01:45:24,437
but the only way
the universe can survive

1367
01:45:24,439 --> 01:45:26,276
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1368
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,539
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1369
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:33,500
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1370
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,490
Hand it over, son.

1371
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,361
Yondu.

1372
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,980
Do not open that Orb.

1373
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,024
You know that, right?

1374
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:03,226
You've seen what it does to people.

1375
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,801
Yeah, Quill turned out ok.

1376
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,286
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

1377
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,447
like we was hired to do.

1378
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,251
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1379
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,849
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1380
01:46:35,603 --> 01:46:37,283
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1381
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,589
Oh, I know.

1382
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:44,014
But he was about the only family I had.

1383
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,607
No.

1384
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,086
He wasn't.

1385
01:47:38,436 --> 01:47:39,998
Why would you even know this?

1386
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,083
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1387
01:47:43,085 --> 01:47:44,450
so we had it checked out.

1388
01:47:45,684 --> 01:47:47,081
I'm not Terran?

1389
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,845
You are half Terran.

1390
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,575
Your mother was of Earth.

1391
01:47:50,852 --> 01:47:52,642
Your father, well...

1392
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:56,514
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1393
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,175
That could be why you were able

1394
01:47:58,177 --> 01:48:00,241
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1395
01:48:01,509 --> 01:48:02,954
Your friends have arrived.

1396
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,321
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1397
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,793
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

1398
01:48:10,331 --> 01:48:12,500
for your help in saving Xandar.

1399
01:48:13,827 --> 01:48:16,354
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1400
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,164
he has something to show you.

1401
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,816
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1402
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,952
Your wife and child shall rest well,

1403
01:48:31,453 --> 01:48:33,344
knowing that you have avenged them.

1404
01:48:33,773 --> 01:48:34,652
Yes.

1405
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,923
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1406
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,641
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1407
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,285
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1408
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,848
We salvaged as much as we could.

1409
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,961
I...

1410
01:48:53,998 --> 01:48:55,124
Thank you.

1411
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,090
I have a family.

1412
01:48:58,886 --> 01:49:00,376
They're alive because of you.

1413
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,155
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1414
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,293
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1415
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,065
Question.

1416
01:49:13,067 --> 01:49:15,863
What if I see something that I want to take
and it belongs to someone else?

1417
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,166
You will be arrested.

1418
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,481
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1419
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,962
It's still illegal.
That doesn't follow.

1420
01:49:21,964 --> 01:49:23,718
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1421
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,821
What are you laughing at?

1422
01:49:24,823 --> 01:49:26,499
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1423
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:30,802
What if someone does something irksome
and I decide to remove his spine?

1424
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,481
That's...

1425
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,341
That's actually murder.

1426
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:39,613
It's one of the worst...

1427
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:41,242
crimes of all.

1428
01:49:41,382 --> 01:49:42,202
So...

1429
01:49:42,857 --> 01:49:44,270
also illegal.

1430
01:49:48,075 --> 01:49:49,407
They'll be fine, Dey.

1431
01:49:49,596 --> 01:49:50,915
I'm gonna keep an eye on them.

1432
01:49:51,105 --> 01:49:52,086
You?

1433
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,256
Yeah.

1434
01:49:56,664 --> 01:49:57,593
Me.

1435
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:18,553
<i>Peter,</i>

1436
01:50:19,539 --> 01:50:22,614
<i>I know these last few months
have been hard for you.</i>

1437
01:50:24,093 --> 01:50:26,175
<i>But I'm going to a better place.</i>

1438
01:50:26,928 --> 01:50:28,435
<i>And I will be ok.</i>

1439
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:32,755
<i>And I will always be with you.</i>

1440
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,057
<i>You are the light of my life.</i>

1441
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,298
<i>My precious son.</i>

1442
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:42,804
<i>My little Star-Lord.</i>

1443
01:50:44,715 --> 01:50:45,600
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

1444
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,690
So, what should we do next?

1445
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,364
Something good?

1446
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,166
Something bad?

1447
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,173
A bit of both?

1448
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,539
We'll follow your lead,

1449
01:52:57,611 --> 01:52:58,915
Star-Lord.

1450
01:53:01,284 --> 01:53:02,489
Bit of both.

1451
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,483

<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections April 2020</i></font>

1452
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,801
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1453
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,685
Gross.

1454
02:00:35,175 --> 02:00:36,210
Yeah!

1455
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,856
But it burns going down.
