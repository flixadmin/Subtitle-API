11
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,401

<i>So...</i>

13
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,284

24
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:01,117
I've got some product coming in
from New York the next few days.

25
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,830
Need a nice white face
to pick it up and deliver it when the time comes.

26
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,039
What kind of product?

27
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,879
[chuckles] Okay.

28
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,965
Look, I need to know
what the fuck we're bringing up.

29
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,304
No, you ain't fixing to ask me
specifics about my product, are you?

30
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,808
Didn't mean to offend you.

31
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:29,103
No, no.
Don't tell me what you meant. I fucking heard your ass.

32
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,191
Okay. Okay.

33
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,277
I'm sorry.

[Diego] Hey,
don't come here acting

35
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,074
like you've got some
fucking weight behind your ass.

36
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,701
You know the fucking drill.

37
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,037
You gonna take the fucking job
or you're not.

38
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,375
How's that number?

39
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,503
[Kyle] Looks about right.

The fuck did you get that relic?

43
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,731
I inherited him from my old man.

44
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,483
A fucking throwback,
right there.

45
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,319
Does it talk?

46
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,697
[Kyle]
This dude was the real deal back in the day, man.

Homie past his sell-by date.

00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,832
Somebody tell this fuckpig

50
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,502
that if he don't stop
staring at me

51
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,504
I'm gonna have to break
his shoulders.

52
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,297
In the present tense.

Take it easy, man.

55
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,599
That motherfucker
still got some game, huh?

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,768
I like him.

57
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,688
So we got a deal or what?

58
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,274
Deal.

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,368
Dude, you really need
to not be saying shit like that.

60
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,869
You know who those guys are?

61
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,539
[Thug]
Somebody had to say something.

62
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,916
Never seen anyone
backpedal so fast.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,377
[Kyle] Hey!
Who's the fucking boss here?

64
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,090
You want to be a boss one day,

65
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,217
you got to start
acting like one.

66
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,471

[engine humming]

68
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,073
You really need that
to find your way home?

69
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,200
No, but my nav system

70
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,369
has real-time
traffic pattern algorithms.

71
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,460
Y-you can't smoke in here.

72
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,258
Algorithms... [mutters]

73
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,471
That blow's gonna kill you,
you know that?

74
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,599
[chuckles]

75
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,225
You think I'm a tool, don't you?

76
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,938
No, kid.
I don't think you're a tool.

77
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,440
You're just green is all.

78
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,044
There he is.

79
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,425
So, the kid bargained
a good price?

80
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,389
Ah, he got an okay price.

81
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,227
So, he shit the bed?

82
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,605
I would have been scared too
at his age, boss.

83
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,108
You know, when he managed to get
his degree from BC,

84
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,776
I wanted him
to go to law school.

85
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,070
He had other ideas.

86
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,030
He wants to be a tough guy,
like you.

87
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,660
You know, he set
this whole deal up himself.

88
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,162
He's trying to prove
to everybody he's a shot caller.

89
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,168
- What do you think?
- That ain't none of my business.

90
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,838
[Charlie] I'm not sure he's ever
gonna be ready, you know.

91
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,632
He's just not cut out for it,
like you and me.

92
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,884
He just needs some time,
Mister...

93
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,433
[Charlie] You forget
my fucking name again?

94
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,812
You forget my fucking name?

95
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,901
I've-- I've been having
trouble sleeping.

96
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,862
I get these headaches.

97
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,613
[Charlie] All right.

98
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,366
Just make sure the kid
doesn't fuck this one up.

99
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,827
[people chattering
in background]

100
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,221
[Bobby] Hey, there he is.

101
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,558
Like clockwork.

102
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,393
[Bobby] What, are you
late with the rent again?

103
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,520
You got anything or not?

104
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,064
[Kiko] I've got a hot kid
that could use some sparring.

105
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,778
I don't fucking need that.

106
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,796

[lights click and buzzing]

111
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,843
You okay?

112
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,848
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

113
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,605
What'd you think of the mick?

114
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,360
Uh, he-- he can punch,
he's got some juice.

115
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,736
Bit mouthy.

116
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,033
Ain't you forgetting something?

117
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh.

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,880

120
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,720
[Thug] Hey.

121
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,555
Tilda says only single shots

122
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,432
and to cut you off
at three drinks.

123
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,600
[Thug] I don't see Tilda.
Do you?

124
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,521
[announcer on TV
continues indistinct]

125
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,088
- [woman] You can't touch
a lady like that! - [man] Crazy bitch!

126
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,049
[woman]
Who the fuck you calling a crazy bitch?

127
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,217
You can't touch a motherfuckin'
lady like that!

128
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,720
- [man] What did I tell--
- [woman] I don't give a fuck.

129
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,597
[man] You're gonna put me
in a bad mood.

130
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,725
Fuck you! I will kill you!
I will fuck you up, bitch!

131
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,643
- You're gonna fuck me?
- [woman] Yeah, bitch ass!

132
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,228
- [man] You out of your mind?
- [woman] No.

133
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,730
- [man] Fuck, you bit me!
- Hey!

134
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,981
[man] You know what happens
when I get in a bad mood.

135
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,399
- Hey!
- [woman] Or what?

136
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,068
- You want me to put my fucking
hands on you? - Hey!

137
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,819
[Thug] Come on, pal.
Take it outside.

138
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,946
What'd you say to me?

139
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,783
I said take it outside.

140
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,535
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to your drink.

141
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,745
[man groans in pain]

142
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,958
Hey, you killed him!

143
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:33,212
[Thug] He ain't dead.
He's just stupid.

144
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,762
Hey! Hey, asshole!

145
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,306
Look lady,
I don't want no trouble.

146
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,017
You knocked out my boyfriend
and you don't want no trouble?

147
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,185
He had it coming.

148
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,482
Okay, maybe he had it coming.

149
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,736
But who's gonna walk me home?

150
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,413
Easy, babe, easy! Easy.

151
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,250
No need to be so rough.

152
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,836
We'll get there soon enough.

153
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,088
Promise.

154
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,802
Ah, easy!

155
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,931
Ea-sy.

156
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,104
[whispering] Ea-sy.

157
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,067
Ea-sy.

158
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,074
Easy.

159
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,286
[indistinct shouting outside]

160
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,040
[Thug] How you get
any sleep living here?

161
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,417
[drunk man shouting]

162
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,294
I like the noise.

163
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,838
I mean, that drunk guy,
he screams, like, every night,

164
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,965
so it's like music to me.

165
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,801
I hate silence.

166
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,761
I gathered that back at the bar.

167
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,638
[woman chuckles]

168
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,141
- Silence reminds me of home.
- [police siren wailing]

169
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,477
Where's that?

170
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,690
[woman] Wellesley.

171
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,609
Wellesley? Really?

172
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:23,739
[woman] Yeah, the good part,
big house on Cliff Road.

173
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,825
And I was a good girl, too.

174
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,204
Yeah?
What the hell happened to you?

175
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,622
Ugh...

176
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,459
[drunk man shouting
indistinctly]

177
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,587
[woman]
Yo, Larry, shut the fuck up! I've got company.

178
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,340
[Larry] Congratulations,
have a nice evening!

179
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,384
[woman] Woah! [chuckling]

180
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,722
See, you couldn't do that
in Wellesley.

181
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,433
I guess not.

182
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,561
[woman sighs]

183
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,945
- Get out.
- What?

184
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,322
- Lupe?
- Yeah.

185
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,740
That's my name.

186
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,867
You're kidding me.

187
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,370
It's not my real name,
it's my nickname.

188
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,705
Actually,
it's not even my nickname.

189
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,501
When I was at school,
they called me Loopy 'cause I was so fucking crazy.

190
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,003
It was kind of close, right?

191
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,713
That's trippy, don't you think?

192
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,549
Yeah, must be fate.

193
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:26,969
So who is she?

194
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,222
Oh, some whore.

195
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,434
That's not nice.

196
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,478
Listen,
she charged me ten bucks,

197
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,605
so I don't know
what else you would call her.

198
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,734
I thought I was in love.

199
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,239
Got her name
tattooed on my hand, went back to show her...

200
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,617
she was shagging
two of my friends.

201
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,910
That was the end of that.

202
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,374
That's fucking romantic,
is what that is.

203
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,085
[horn playing in distance]

204
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,730
[waves lapping]

205
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,066
[high-pitched ringing]

206
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,708
[high-pitched ringing]

207
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,142
[high-pitched ringing continues]

208
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,703
[huffing]

209
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,372
[phone ringing, vibrating]

210
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,174
Yeah, boss?

211
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,842
[Charlie] <i>I need you</i>
<i>to go to Dr. Gruber's</i>,

212
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,678
<i>pick something up for me.</i>

213
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,015
- Uh-huh.
- [Charlie] <i>You remember</i> <i>the address, right?</i>

214
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,392
[Thug] Of course, I do.

215
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,186
[line hangs up]

216
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,660
[indistinct chatter]

217
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,708
[Dr. Gruber] Those
are the bombers. 30 mills.

218
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,628
They're all sealed.

219
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,464
[Thug]
That's what you said last time.

220
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,425
Hey, man, they were sealed.

221
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,844
Any tampering happened,
that was on the other end.

222
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,389
You sell this shit,
you've got to put your name on it, doc.

223
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,224
Any blanks in this batch--

224
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,976
Okay, okay, I get it.

225
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,104
I'll let 'em go for 15.

226
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,609
Okay, man. 12.

227
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,570
I don't have time
for this shit, doc.

228
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,698
Fine. Ten.

229
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,663
Let me ask you something.

230
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,544
I, uh, I've been having
some memory issues lately.

231
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,212
[Dr. Gruber] Like what?

232
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:53,216
Forgetting names and directions.
Shit like that.

233
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,135
How bad is it?

234
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,929
I forgot where I lived
for a few minutes this morning.

235
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,891
It's not the first time.

236
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,519
[Dr. Gruber] It's not good.
It's not good at all.

237
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,897
You should get that checked out.

238
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,733
[rap music playing
over speaker]

239
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,910
[sounds distort]

240
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,309
[sighs deeply]

241
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,111
[door opens, closes]

242
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,571
[neurologist] Good afternoon.

243
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,739
Hey.

244
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,368
Okay.

245
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,166
Have you heard of CTE?

246
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,338
Stands for Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy.

247
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,092
Lots of football players
and boxers develop it.

248
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,471
- Too many blows to the head.
- Punch drunk.

249
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,765
That's what
they used to call it.

250
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,479
Have you sustained multiple
concussions over the course of your life?

251
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,315
[Thug] You could say that.

252
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,277
Starting at what age?

253
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,362
I don't know.

254
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,616
First one was probably
around six or seven.

255
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,993
Maybe younger.

256
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,496
So, this took place at home?

257
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,039
Just tell me what I got

258
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,875
and what I need to take
to get better.

259
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,213
There is no treatment.

260
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,216
No drugs.

261
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,261
And it's a fairly advanced case.

262
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,687
Do you have anyone?

263
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,481
Wife?

264
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,733
Kids?

265
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,986
No. I-- I don't know.

266
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,654
I've-- I've got
a couple of kids.

267
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,698
Why?

268
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,491
In the next couple of years,

269
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,202
you can expect
a fairly sharp decline.

270
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,874
Eventually, you won't be able
to care for yourself.

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,210
[laughs] Bullshit.

272
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,050
- [neurologist] I know it's hard.
- Listen, you don't know me.

273
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,844
Just tell me how long I have.

274
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,016
Until you're incapacitated?
I-- I can't predict that.

275
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,477
[Thug] Just tell me,
how long do I have?

276
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,483
I don't know.

277
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,405
A couple of years at the most.

278
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,159
Could be sooner.

279
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,536
[dull rumbling]

280
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,166

287

[engine rumbling]

288
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,064
- [woman over phone] <i>Hello?</i>
- [Thug] <i>Hello, Daisy.</i>

289
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,357
[Daisy] <i>Dad?</i>

290
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,819
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

291
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,281
- [Thug] No.
- [Daisy] <i>Did someone</i> <i>die or something?</i>

292
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,202
I-- I just wanted to say hello.

293
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,079
[Daisy] <i>Are you drunk?</i>

294
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,914
[Thug] No!

295
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,041
[Daisy]
<i>What the hell do you want then?</i>

296
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,168
Can I come by and see you?

297
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,377
[Daisy] <i>Uh, fuck no.</i>

298
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,050
Okay. Okay.
I-- I didn't mean to bother you.

299
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,010
[Daisy] <i>No,</i>
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

300
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,762
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

301
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,764
<i>I've got an okay thing</i>
<i>going on right now.</i>

302
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,432
<i>And I don't need you</i>
<i>or anyone else</i>

303
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,725
<i>fucking it up for me.</i>

304
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,228
Uh-huh.

305
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,437
Okay.

306
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,981
Have you heard from...

307
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,487
um, my-- my son?

308
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,782
[Daisy]
<i>Your son? You mean Colin?</i>

309
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,909
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Colin.

310
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,582
You-- you have his number?

311
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,417
I-- I want to go see him.

312
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,587
[Daisy] <i>Colin's dead.</i>

313
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,006
[Thug] What?

314
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,217
When?

315
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,802
[Daisy] <i>Almost two years ago.</i>

316
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,264
But--

317
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,474
What--

318
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:20,436
Why-- why didn't
anybody tell me?

319
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,147
[Daisy] <i>Why would they, Dad?</i>

320
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,274
<i>You didn't even remember</i>
<i>his fucking name.</i>

321
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,318
Where-- where is he buried?

322
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,070
[glass clinking]

323
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,870
Colin, Colin.

324
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,539
Colin.

325
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,333
Colin, Colin.

326
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,419

Fucking idiot.

329
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,008
Colin.

[♪]

332
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,008
You should take better
fucking care of this place!

333
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,512
[engine rumbling]

334
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,161
[handbrake rattling]

[kids shouting indistinctly]

337
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,731
I thought
I told you not to come.

338
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,692
[Thug] Just wanted to see you.

339
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,860
Okay. Well, you saw me.

340
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,029
You can fuck off now, Dad.

341
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:36,239
Excuse me.

342
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,121
This is un-fucking-believable.

343
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,457
And to invite you
and your family to dinner.

344
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,585
And why on earth
would I want to do that?

345
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,296
[door creaks open]

346
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,215
[Thug] Hi, sweetie.

347
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:56,718
I'm your grandfather.

348
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,887
[Daisy] Get your butt
back inside.

349
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,182
[door shuts closed]

350
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,187
[Thug] Why are you--
why are you selling the house?

351
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,982
You really think
I can afford to buy a house?

352
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,026
I rent it.
The owner died

353
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,528
and his kids are
selling it out from under us.

354
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,823
[Thug] Are you working?

355
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,576
- I'm dancing.
- [Thug] Stripping?

356
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,536
No, I joined
the fucking Bolshoi.

357
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,371
[boy] Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Mom!

358
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,664
Hi.

359
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:30,168
Um, this is your grandfather.

360
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,254
Hey.

361
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,091
So, you're the boxer?

362
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,259
Was.

363
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,014
You-- you play for Dorchester?

364
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,058
- Newton.
- [Thug] Newton?

365
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,434
They have a football team?

366
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,561
He punched out
the Dorchester coach's son,

367
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,146
and they kicked him
off the team.

368
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,441
- [Thug laughs]
- It's not funny.

369
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,069
I don't even want him
playing football.

370
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,570
You've got to go clean up.

371
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,530
I could smell you coming
from a mile away.

372
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:00,865
- Smell this!
- Goodbye.

[door shuts closed]

374
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,290
What, did you find Jesus
or something?

375
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,211
I just want to explain.

376
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,423
Uh, you-- you don't understand.

377
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,802
No, that's just it.
I do understand.

378
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,887
You were
a fucking asshole to us.

379
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,098
Just like my babies'
daddies are assholes.

380
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,724
Just like your dad
was an asshole.

381
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,684
And his dad, and on and on.

382
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,814
Back to the asshole caveman
that spawned you all.

383
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,607
It's a fucking family curse.

384
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,486
The curse of the asshole father.

385
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,659
The dinner,
just think about it, yeah?

386
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,790
Okay. I thought about it.

387
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:51,999
Fuck off.

Yeah.

- I thought you were dead.
- Nah.

395
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:07,867
It don't work that way.

396
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,881
Are you still mad?

397
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:30,223
Nah, I ain't mad no more, kid.

398
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:35,645
We gonna fish?

Where are we going?

401
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,744
[Thug's dad] You'll see.

402
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,830
I don't see any land.

403
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,293
Enjoy the ride.
There'll be land soon enough.

404
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,631

What is that sound?

407
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,931
It's a guitar.

408
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,350
It's in the engine.

Yo, you lost?

Come on!

Yeah, you're the boy
our parents warned us about.

What, you a gangster?

Huh, you a gangster?

423
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,422
Were you born without a filter,

424
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,716
or is that something
you have to work at?

425

Ah, whatever.

No, I-- It's all
just a bunch of boo-boo.

- Boo-boo?
- [woman] Well, you know.

428
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,602
You know, like,
boo-boo just means, like...

00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,312
some weak ass bullshit.

430
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,441
Life ain't weak.

Life's a shitstorm.

432
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,327
But it sure as hell
ain't a bunch of boo-boo.

433

Scars.

Cigarette burns.

I stay on I-90?

How do you even know
where I live?

I guess so, yeah.

01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:01,920
I need a drink.

892
01:13:02,004 --> 01:13:05,090
"Oh, why, thank you.
You look lovely, too."

893
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,137
Hey! Can I get a drink?

894
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,513
[waiter] Sure.

895
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,306
Uh, double bourbon, rocks.

896
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,559
- What kind?
- The cheap kind.

897
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,439
And for the lady?

898
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:23,066
Uh, just
a glass of water, please.

899
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:30,198
Calm down,
Sally, they'll be here!

900
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:31,491
It's all good. Come on.

901

[drumming fingers on table]

902
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,919
They aren't coming.
They aren't coming.

903
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:47,466
Maybe-- maybe I-- maybe
I gave her the wrong address.

904
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:50,343
Shit, I must've given them
the wrong address.

905
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:53,472
[waiter] I'm sorry, but I simply
cannot hold this table any longer.

906
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,182
Fuck off!

907
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:58,435
- Excuse me?
- I said, fuck off!

908
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,353
And who says "simply cannot?"

909
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,773
No one talks like that.

910
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,274
[waiter]
Would you speak to our manager?

911
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:07,527
No, no, no!
That's not necessary.

912
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:08,904
- Yeah--
- [Thug] No!

913
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:10,781
- Okay.
- No, no!

914
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:12,908
Hey, hey, okay--

915
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:14,951
What the fuck
are you looking at?

916
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:17,037
Huh? High-end motherfuckers!

917
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,830
Hey. Okay.

918
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:20,582
We were supposed to--
Hey, hey, hey!

919
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,167
Let's just go home.

920
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,128
Where's the person
we were supposed to meet?

921
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:26,379
Daisy.

922
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:27,589
- Daisy?
- Yeah...

923
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,341
What a-- what about Colin?

924
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,468
Colin couldn't make it.

925
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,719
Daisy?

926
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,014
Yeah, your daughter.

927
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:37,766
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

928
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,893
No, I don't think
she's going to be able to--

929
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,895
I gave her the wrong address.

930
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,480
- What-- what-- my--
- Hm?

931
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,525
My-- my daughter's not coming,
is she?

932
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,068
No, she's not coming.

933
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,820
What-- what's her name?

934
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:52,072
Your daughter's name
is Daisy, baby.

What the hell's happening here?

944
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,276
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

945
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:15,530
You told her?

946
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:17,616
[woman]
Yeah. I called her last night.

947
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,951
I mean, I thought,
you know, you were--

948
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:22,204
- You fucking told her?
- [Daisy] Hey!

949
01:16:22,287 --> 01:16:23,663
Yeah, she should know.

950
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:26,333
Get out of my house!

951
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,585
[Daisy] Dad, stop.
She didn't mean anything.

952
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,087
Get out, or I'll throw you out.
Crazy fucking bitch!

953
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,505
[Daisy] Cut it out!

954
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:36,218
So, you want to hit me?

955
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:38,929
You want to hit me? Okay.

956
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:42,515
Okay, fucking hit me.
Hit me, you fucking pussy. I know you want to.

957
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:45,560
[Daisy]
Dre, get back in the car.

958
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:48,688
Dre! Please!
Go get in the car right now.

959
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:51,107

- [Daisy sighs]

964
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,390
I didn't want you to know.

965
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:25,934
Yeah, okay, well,
she didn't deserve that.

966
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,146
Fuck.

967
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:33,900
Yeah.

968
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:41,324
Why-- why didn't you come
to dinner last night?

969
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:43,827
Says the guy who walked away,
and never came back.

970
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:46,121
[whispering] Fuck.

971
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:57,007
I've got to go pack, 'cause now
we've got to be out in two days.

972
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,301
Where-- where will you go?

973
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:01,845
I'll figure it out.

974
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:03,680
Is there--
is there anything I can do?

975
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:04,889
[Daisy laughs joylessly]

976
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:08,059
I can, uh, take care of myself.

977
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,734
Are you gonna get treatment?

978
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:16,860
I don't know.

979
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:20,989
Well, you got a doctor?

980
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,867
I did. That bitch can't help me.

981
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,035
Christ.

982
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:31,124
Hey.

983
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,335
You need my help
to find a new doctor?

984
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,213
Why-- why would you do that?

985
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:45,263
Well, if you need my help,
let me know.

986
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,525

It's, uh, it's for
a down payment on a house...

1037
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:21,122
For my daughter, Daisy.

1038
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:28,421
Mr. Connor, I know
that's a lot of money...

1039
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:34,636
I'm willing to pay
whatever interest you decide on.

1040
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:39,349
Mr. Connor...

1041
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,480
So, Mr. Connor...

1042
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:49,817
I-- I know 40-- 40,000
is a lot of money, but...

1043
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:52,987
I've been working for you
for 30 years.

1044
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:55,531

1045
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:15,927
Mr. Connor?

1046
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,055

So, uh--

01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,112
I saw Dr. Gruber yesterday.

1050
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:35,738
He came by for his Oxy money.

1051
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:39,158
[Thug] Okay.

1052
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,496
He said something about

1053
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,874
you maybe having some sort of
brain disease or something.

1054
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,418
He said I might.

1055
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:56,217
I mean, I-- I can't even put
into words how sorry I am--

1056
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,385
Get to the point.

1057
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:01,556
I have to let you go.

1058
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,268

Please.

1062
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,527
What about the other day?

1063

The-- the-- the shooters?

1064
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:18,614

01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,201
Are you okay?

1246
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:22,494
Yeah, I'm fine.

1247
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,623
Listen to me, Dre.

1248
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:30,585
You're gonna hear some bad stuff
about me in the next few days.

1249
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:38,552
Maybe the only way
for me to do something right

1250
01:41:38,635 --> 01:41:40,387
is by doing something bad.

1251
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,684
I-- I don't get it.

1252
01:41:47,352 --> 01:41:50,439
It might not make
any sense to you now, but--

1253
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:00,574
I tried.

1254
01:42:02,576 --> 01:42:03,827
I tried.

1255
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,663
Go back inside.

1256
01:42:06,747 --> 01:42:09,124
I-- I'll be fine. Go on.

1257
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,500
Go on, go on.

Anybody here?
