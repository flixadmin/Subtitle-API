1
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,238
{\an8}He's still breathing.

2
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,950
{\an8}Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

3
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,955
{\an8}I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

4
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,166
{\an8}Mum's the word.

5
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,208
Son of a bitch.

6
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,475
{\an8}Hang on, baby.

7
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,655
{\an8}<i>Hello.</i>

8
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,740
Walt? Are you in the house?

9
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,329
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

10
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,708
What? What the hell
are you doing in there?

11
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,418
I'm back.

12
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,213
{\an8}No, no, you're not back, Walt.

13
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,091
{\an8}You're not back.
Get... Get out of there.

14
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,551
- Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
- No...

15
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,596
I'm staying. End of story.

16
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,225
- We had an agreement.
- I didn't agree to anything.

17
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,592
{\an8}Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

18
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,606
{\an8}No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

19
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:43,277
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

20
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,907
{\an8}Well, suit yourself.

21
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,784
Walt.

22
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,452
Walt?

23
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,646
{\an8}What is wrong with you?

24
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,234
- Skyler, I have every right to be here.
- No, you don't.

25
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,654
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

26
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,621
- I don't agree to a divorce.
- Well, it's not up to you.

27
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,955
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police,

28
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,751
and I'm going to tell them everything.

29
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,587
I mean it, Walt.

30
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,675
There's the phone.

31
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,862
{\an8}It's ringing.

32
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,118
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>

33
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,538
<i>Operator number 314.
How may I help you?</i>

34
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,710
{\an8}<i>Albuquerque Police Department.
How may I help you?</i>

35
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:27,548
{\an8}Yes, I want to report a disturbance,
please.

36
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,595
{\an8}No, no, it's not...
It's not exactly, it's...

37
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,474
{\an8}It's a domestic issue.

38
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,601
{\an8}Okay.

39
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
They're connecting me.

40
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,319
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

41
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,030
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

42
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,576
This family is everything to me.

43
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:00,414
- Without it, I have nothing to lose.
- Fine.

44
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,753
{\an8}Yes. My name is Skyler White.

45
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,923
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

46
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,762
{\an8}My soon-to-be-ex-husband
broke into my house,

47
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,558
{\an8}and I need an officer to come
and remove him.

48
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,563
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

49
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,776
{\an8}Okay. Okay.

50
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,613
{\an8}Thank you.

51
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,037
They're coming.

52
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,255
- Dad's here?
- Great, he's home.

53
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,507
- Dad.
- Hey, son.

54
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,468
How are you?

55
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,638
Are you back for good?

56
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:43,476
- Why are you home so soon?
- I'm not.

57
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,605
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

58
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,072
- Sure.
- You want one too?

59
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,360
Walter, your dad and I
have something we need to discuss.

60
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,030
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

61
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,369
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

62
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,120
- Walter?
- How was school?

63
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,039
- It was good.
- Yeah? Homework?

64
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,501
- No, not really.
- Not really? What does that mean?

65
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,680
So are you gonna be at work tomorrow?

66
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,057
Yeah, that's the plan.

67
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,763
Hello, ma'am.
We were called about a disturbance?

68
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,078
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

69
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,706
Yeah, that was me.

70
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,335
You called the cops on Dad?

71
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,259
I came home from work and he was back.

72
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,761
He had just moved back into the house.

73
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:07,226
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. I just...

74
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,272
I want him out.
I want him out of the house.

75
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,942
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

76
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,109
It's very important you answer honestly.

77
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,114
- Did he strike you?
- No.

78
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,452
- Has he ever hit you?
- No. This is not about violence.

79
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,787
This is about trespassing.

80
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:31,751
- About him being here against my will.
- Okay. Trespassing.

81
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,545
- You're divorced, then?
- No, working on it.

82
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,383
- Right now, were separated.
- Legally separated?

83
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,049
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

84
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,057
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

85
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,810
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

86
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,895
Whose name is on the title to the house?

87
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,316
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

88
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,133
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

89
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,780
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

90
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,896
Unless he's threatened you or the kids.

91
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,996
No. Not physically.
But having him in the house is just...

92
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,085
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

93
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,674
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

94
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:25,513
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

95
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,099
That was it.

96
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,812
- I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
- Disagreements.

97
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,649
Yes, well, we've had our share of that.

98
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:42,196
I haven't... I haven't been
the most attentive husband lately.

99
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,161
Mrs. White, would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

100
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:58,838
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

101
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,604
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

102
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,514
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

103
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,179
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

104
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,559
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

105
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,311
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

106
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,730
I'll get him out of the house for you.

107
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,899
What's your take on all this?

108
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,944
It's my mom's fault.

109
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:29,743
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

110
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,413
I don't know why she's being this way.

111
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,877
My dad, he is a great guy.

112
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,755
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

113
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,049
Mrs. White.

114
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,555
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis,

115
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,516
for us to remove your husband
from the house.

116
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,686
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control

117
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,357
you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

118
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,776
I'd really look into some counseling.

119
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
Best of luck to you folks.

120
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,866
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

121
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,460
Why you gotta...?
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

122
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,714
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

123
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,720
Sorry.

124
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
Welcome home.

125
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,037
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

126
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,623
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

127
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,668
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

128
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,172
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

129
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,886
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

130
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,724
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits

131
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,185
since I didn't hear from you, you know.

132
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,813
You realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

133
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,647
What if I was trying to warn you

134
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,235
that the DEA was gonna kick down
your door? What then?

135
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,489
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

136
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,741
Fair enough.
Remember the other day

137
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,912
when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

138
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,581
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

139
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,334
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

140
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,336
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

141
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,215
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

142
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,426
So, what do you say?

143
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,888
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

144
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,516
I mean, you gonna call him?

145
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:42,853
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

146
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,897
Final thought.

147
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,860
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

148
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,281
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

149
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,867
Call him.

150
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,875
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

151
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,002
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

152
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,796
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

153
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,112
Schrader.

154
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,615
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

155
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,285
Yeah?

156
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,541
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

157
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,170
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

158
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,195
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir

159
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,675
I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

160
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,265
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

161
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,645
Merkert called in a couple of favors.
El Paso wants me back.

162
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,981
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

163
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,566
Thank you.

164
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,362
Hello.

165
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,241
But...

166
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,990
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

167
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,116
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

168
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,744
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

169
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,592
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

170
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,718
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

171
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,596
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

172
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,631
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you...</i>

173
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,980
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,526
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

175
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:37,990
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

176
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:43,746
I've got you. Yes. Yes.

177
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,459
Skyler? Want some help?

178
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,765
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

179
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,488
God...

180
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,550
- What do you mean? Against your will?
- Yes.

181
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,429
Very much against my will.
He just... He showed right back up.

182
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,767
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

183
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,896
I called the police on him.

184
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,440
I was so clo...

185
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,945
- So close to what?
- Nothing. Never mind.

186
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,575
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

187
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,120
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege

188
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,456
to keep everything you tell me a secret.

189
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,918
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

190
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,712
Even if it's something illegal?

191
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,590
Especially if it's illegal.

192
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,345
I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

193
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,440
My husband makes meth.

194
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,570
Methamphetamine.

195
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,576
- Your husband's a drug dealer?
- A manufacturer, technically.

196
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:50,747
They... They call them cooks.

197
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,250
I looked it up on the Internet.

198
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,296
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

199
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,173
Sue your husband for divorce immediately.

200
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,969
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

201
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,598
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

202
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,434
If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

203
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,271
No questions asked.
This is a no-brainer.

204
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,524
It's the best thing for you
and your family.

205
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,695
I can't.

206
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,407
I can't do it.

207
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:32,414
I don't want my son to find out
that his father is a criminal.

208
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,042
I just...

209
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:40,797
- I can't do that to him.
- In the end, it may not be up to you.

210
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,842
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

211
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,014
Walt has lung cancer.

212
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,807
His treatment bought him some time.

213
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,062
But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later...

214
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:01,818
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family

215
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,154
when things may

216
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:10,243
resolve themselves on their own

217
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,831
without anyone else knowing.

218
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,256
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

219
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,633
- What are we doing in this shithole?
- Relax, will you?

220
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,111
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

221
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,767
- We should have went to Chili's, man.
- All right, already. Jesus.

222
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,355
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

223
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,972
What's wrong with spicing things
up a little?

224
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:45,112
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

225
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,532
So when you headed back down to El Paso?

226
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,953
You know. Between all the packing,
errands, getting the ducks in a row

227
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,581
- maybe a week or two.
- Week or two?

228
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,334
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

229
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,711
It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

230
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,145
What are you talking about?

231
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,426
Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

232
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,053
I'm gonna hit the head.

233
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:46,131
Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

234
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,344
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

235
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,851
- All right.
- What you doing?

236
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,718
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?

237
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,147
Since when can't we handle
a couple dirtballs?

238
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,714
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

239
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,568
What if Vice is running
some kind of undercover op?

240
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,784
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

241
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,737
- Where you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

242
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,365
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

243
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,169
Stand up.

244
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,430
You got a problem with us, bitch?

245
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,599
Your move.

246
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,462
DEA. Don't move.

247
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,805
Go out and tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

248
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,927
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

249
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,012
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

250
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,598
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

251
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:55,403
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

252
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,156
<i>"Do Not Call..."</i>

253
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:13,297
<i>The number you have reached, 149-4985</i>

254
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:17,259
<i>in area code 505 is no longer...</i>

255
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,402
Skyler.

256
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,865
Can we talk?

257
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,507
ASAC wants to see you.

258
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,844
And?

259
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,472
We were hanging back, saw a deal go down.

260
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,348
I went outside to call it in.

261
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,565
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

262
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,936
That's when they attacked you.

263
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:42,276
What I didn't tell him is that
you left your gun under the seat

264
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,032
before you went back inside.

265
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,969
I've done a terrible thing.
But I did it for a good reason.

266
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,932
I did it for us.

267
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:17,815
That is college tuition for Walter Jr,

268
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,194
and Holly 18 years down the road.

269
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:28,492
That is health insurance
for you and the kids.

270
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:35,457
For Junior's physical therapy,
his SAT tutor.

271
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,336
It's money for groceries,

272
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,381
for gas,

273
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:47,553
for birthdays and graduation parties.

274
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,726
Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head

275
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,479
the mortgage you aren't
gonna be able to afford

276
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,274
on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

277
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,361
- Walt, I...
- Please. Please.

278
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:14,288
This money, I didn't steal it.

279
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,374
It doesn't belong to anyone else.

280
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,626
I earned it.

281
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:25,799
The things I've done to earn it...

282
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:37,519
the things that I've had to do

283
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,816
I've got to live with them.

284
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,532
Skyler...

285
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,829
all that I've done

286
00:40:55,996 --> 00:41:01,460
all the sacrifices that I have
made for this family

287
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:07,591
all of it will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've earned.

288
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,594
Please.

289
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,601
I'll be here when you get home from work.

290
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,189
You can give me your answer then.

291
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,129
Hey, Sky.

292
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:49,026
- Hey, some coffee?
- Yeah.

293
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,447
That report's looking real good.
I like how it looks.

294
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,157
Good.

295
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,584
Are your kids home?

296
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:49,419
<i>It's here! It's here!
Everybody, come on in! Look!</i>

297
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,465
Hey, Mrs. White.

298
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,468
Hey, Louis.

299
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,721
Hey, thanks for having me
over for dinner.

300
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,099
Sure.

301
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:07,813
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.

302
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,818
Pot roast. Could you...?

303
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:35,132
So how was your day?

304
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:39,553
- Good.
- Good.

305
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,762
Excellent.

306
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:46,393
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis
to stay for dinner tonight.

307
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,981
You know, as a thank-you for driving
Walter Jr. to school for us.

308
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,067
We've been kind of absent,

309
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:59,030
but, I tell you, Louis really pitched in.

310
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:10,083
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good
about our talk this morning,

311
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,712
and I'm very eager
to hear what you're thinking about

312
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,755
about what we talked about.

313
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,717
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

314
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:30,228
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

315
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:55,045
I fucked Ted.

316
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,139
Boys, dinner.

317
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,809
- Iced tea?
- Yeah.

318
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,394
- Okay.
- Thank you.

319
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,979
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

320
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,648
All right.

321
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,611
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

322
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,907
- Okay.
- I know nobody likes salad,

323
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,825
but it's good for you.

324
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,994
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
