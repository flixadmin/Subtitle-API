00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,176
- A dead mouse!
- (FEAR SCREAMS)

160
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,053
ANGER: Great. This is just great.
DISGUST: I'm gonna be sick.

161
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,554
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

162
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,097
- Get off of me!
- (FEAR SCREAMING)

163
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,474
Hey. All through the drive,

164
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,434
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

165
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,560
- (FEAR SIGHS)
- Let's go check it out!

166
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,728
DISGUST: Let's go!
ANGER: It's gonna be great!

167
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,812
FEAR: Yes, yes, yes.

168
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,105
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,482
DISGUST: I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

170
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
ANGER: Get out the rubber ball,

171
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,942
we're in solitary confinement.

172
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,027
Riley can't live here.

173
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,111
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

174
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,613
FEAR: Really bad.
DISGUST: It's absolutely the worst.

175
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,115
DISGUST: It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

176
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,785
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

177
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,162
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

178
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,663
- Where did you read that?
- It doesn't matter.

179
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,748
I read it and it's great.

180
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,916
We'll put the bed there.

181
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,084
JOY: And the desk over there.

182
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,335
FEAR: The hockey lamp goes there.

183
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,419
ANGER: Uh, put the chair there.

184
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,004
JOY: The trophy collection goes there.

185
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,672
FEAR: Stars! I like that!

186
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,840
JOY: Now we're talking!

187
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,509
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

188
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,552
DAD: All right. Goodbye.

189
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,678
Well, guess what?

190
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,388
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

191
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,973
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,309
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

193
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,685
DISGUST: That figures. The van is lost.

194
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,521
You said it would be here yesterday!

195
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,897
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

196
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,023
FEAR: Mom and Dad are stressed out!

197
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,942
ANGER: They're stressed out?
FEAR: What are we going to do?

198
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,569
- (ALL TALKING AT ONCE)
- I've got a great idea!

199
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,239
Did you even read the contract?

200
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,866
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

201
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,951
Hey! (LAUGHS)

202
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,035
DAD: Oh, no, you're not!

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,203
She's lining up for the shot!

204
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,287
DAD: Coming behind you.

205
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,123
- DAD: Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores!

206
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,791
- Yeah!
- (ALL CHEERING)

207

- Come on, Grandma!
- Ha!

208
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,170
"Grandma"?

209
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,005
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,
we're in for it!

210
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,590
Whoo!

- Ah! Sorry.

215
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,682
Hold on. Hold on.

216
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,560
- Hello?
- Wait. Wh...

217
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,853
DAD: You're kidding.

218
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,272
(SIGHS) All right. Stall for me.

219
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,398
I'll be right there.

220
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,358
The investor's supposed
to show up on Thursday,

221
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,609
not today!

222
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,111
- (SIGHS)
- I got to go.

223
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,612
It's okay. We get it.

224
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,905
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

225
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,866
See you, sweetie.

226
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,326
FEAR: Dad just left us.

227
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,995
He doesn't love us anymore.

228
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,246
That's sad.

229
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,873
I should drive, right?

230
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,457
Joy?

231
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,293
What are you doing?

232
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,961
Uh, just give me one second.

233
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,088
Um, you know what I've realized?

234
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,549
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

235
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,596
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

236
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,763
Maybe we could try that?

237
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,182
Pizza sounds delicious.

238
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,850
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

239
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,646
FEAR: What the heck is that?
JOY: Who puts broccoli on pizza?

240
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,939
That's it. I'm done.

241
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,108
Congratulations, San Francisco,

242
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,401
you've ruined pizza!

243
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,694
First the Hawaiians

244
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,987
and now you!

245
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,449
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

246
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,868
MOM: Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

247
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,245
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

248
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,289
- At that diner in Nebraska.
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,750
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

250
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,084
RILEY: That was disgusting.

251
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,628
JOY: Oh, good. Family is running.

252
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,046
RILEY: Dad's got a steel stomach.

253
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,797
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

254
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,965
What was your favorite part?

255
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,634
Spitting out the car window!

256
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,177
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

257
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,261
Wearing a seat belt!

258
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,055
Oh! What about the time
with the dinosaur?

259
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,848
- Oh, that's the one.
- Definitely!

260
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,642
DAD: Say cheese!

261
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,227
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

262
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,311
DAD: Now hold still.
MOM: The car!

263
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,939
Stop! No, no, no! (GRUNTING)

(DAD GROANS)

265
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,942
(LAUGHS) Nice one, Joy.

266
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,610
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

267
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,278
- That was pretty funny.

Wait. What? What happened?

270
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,082
FEAR: She did something
to the memory.

271
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,710
- What did you do?
- I just touched it.

272
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,671
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

273
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,005
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

274
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,049
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

275
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,801
Now when Riley thinks
of that moment with Dad,

276
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,135
she's gonna feel sad.

277
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,804
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, Joy.

278
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,138
I don't really know...

279
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,682
I thought maybe if you...

(STAMMERING)

281
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,352
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

282
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,022
Just don't touch any other memories

283
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,440
until we figure out what's going on.

284
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,733
- Okay.
- JOY: All right.

285
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,027
Get ready. This is a monster railing

286
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,071
and we are riding it all the way down!

287
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,038
- Wait, what? What happened?
- (CLATTERING)

288
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,457
- (FEAR AND JOY GASP)
- A Core Memory!

289
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,542
Oh, no!

290
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,838
Sadness, what are you doing?

291
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,922
SADNESS: It looked like
one was crooked

292
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,924
so I opened it and then it fell out.

293

I...

00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,222
Whoo-hoo!

00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,726
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

- FEAR: Joy!
- Whoa, whoa!

297
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,565
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

298
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,984
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

299
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,235
I know. I'm sorry.

300
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,070
Something's wrong with me.

301
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,072
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

302
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,241
You're not having
a breakdown. It's stress.

303
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,994
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

304
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,246
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

305
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,290
(STUTTERING) You know what?

306
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,292
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

307
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,085
There's always a way to
turn things around,

308
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,587
to find the fun.

309
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,464
Yeah. Find the fun.

310
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,257
I don't know how to do that.

311
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,717
Okay. Well,

312
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,260
try to think of something funny.

313
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,636
Um... Oh!

314
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,431
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

315
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,475
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

316
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,268
What about that time with Meg

317
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,270

That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

958
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,557
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

959
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,683
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

The station is right
through here. After you.

- Joy.
- What?

964
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,404
I read about this place

00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,114
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

966

it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

What are you talking about?

969

I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.
