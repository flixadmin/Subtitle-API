1
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,848
I'm sorry. I'm having trouble
understanding any of this.

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,560
I mean, what exactly is going on
in Hawkins? What's doing these killings?

3
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,938
- That's what we're trying to ascertain.
- Where is El, like, right now?

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,650
- For her safety, it's best you don't know.
- This is insane! This is insane!

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,571
So this training to get El's powers back,
how long is it gonna take?

6
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,948
- Could take weeks, could take months.
- Months?

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,701
Until then, agents Harmon and Wallace
will stay with you.

8
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,202
We're not in danger.

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,579
Our friends <i>live </i>in Hawkins.

10
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,164
My family lives in Hawkins.

11
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,750
I'll work to contain the situation
until Eleven is ready.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,004
In the meantime, it is of vital importance
you do not speak to anyone about this.

13
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,630
No. No way.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,009
- I know this is difficult to understand.
- It's not difficult. This is impossible.

15
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,388
There are factions within our government
who are working directly against Eleven,

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,475
who are, in fact,
searching for her as we speak.

17
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,101
We can't risk contact.

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,188
If they learned about any of this,
it will jeopardize Eleven.

19
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,775
And if Eleven is jeopardized,
so are your friends.

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,193
And so is your family.

21
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,613
So, what? We're just supposed
to trust that you're the good guys?

22
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,739
Whoever you are?

23
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,657
We're friends of Owens.

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,828
Eleven trusted us.

25
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,164
Now we're asking the same from you.

26
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,795
For you.

27
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,253
It was here.

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,420
Right here.

29
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,423
A grandfather clock?

30
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,720
It was so real.

31
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,433
<i>And then,
when I got closer, suddenly I just…</i>

32
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,520
- Max, come on.
- Max?

33
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,938
…I woke up.

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,193
<i>It was like
she was in a trance or something.</i>

35
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,445
Exactly what Eddie said
happened to Chrissy.

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,660
That's not even the bad part.

37
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,373
Fred and Chrissy,
they both came to Miss Kelley for help.

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,959
Uh, they both were having headaches,

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,753
bad headaches
that wouldn't go away. And then…

40
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,881
Then the nightmares.

41
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,758
Trouble sleeping.

42
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,303
They'd wake up in a cold sweat.

43
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,013
Then they started seeing things.

44
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,517
Bad things.

45
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,561
<i>From their pasts.</i>

46
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,397
These visions, they just…

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,692
They kept on getting worse and worse,
until eventually…

48
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,862
Everything ended.

49
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,491
Vecna's curse.

50
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,535
Chrissy's headache started a week ago.

51
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,955
Fred's, six days ago.

52
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,793
I've been having them for five days.

53
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,087
I don't know how long I have.

54
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,797
All I know is that,

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,925
for Fred and Chrissy,

56
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,928
they both died less than 24 hours
after their first vision.

57
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,765
And I just saw that goddamn clock, so…

58
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,686
…looks like I'm gonna die tomorrow.

59
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,359
Stay here.

60
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,979
- It's me!
- Lucas?

61
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,106
- It's me.
- Jesus, what's wrong with you?

62
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,192
- I'm sorry.
- I could've taken you out with this lamp!

63
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,986
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

64
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,363
I was… I was biking for eight miles.

65
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,909
Give me a second. Shit.

66
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,287
- We've got a code red.
- What?

67
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,539
Dustin.

68
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,085
I've been with Jason, Patrick, and Andy,
and they've gone totally off the rails.

69
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,922
They're trying to capture Eddie,
and they think you know where he is.

70
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,383
You're in terrible danger.

71
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,510
All right. Yeah, that definitely sucks,

72
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,929
but we've got bigger problems
than Jason now.

73
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,716
- Would you get the door?
- I'm busy!

74
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,885
I said get the door.

75
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,595
This is unbelievable.

76
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,433
Hey there. Is, uh, is Lucas home?

77
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
Negative.

78
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,353
You know where he is?

79
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,564
Uh, we're just…
We were supposed to go out and...

80
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,526
Go out? I see he's taken
a step down from Max.

81
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,738
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,701
Uh, well, you're the little sister
who plays Dungeons & Dragons, huh?

83
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,911
What's it to you?

84
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,080
Do you know Dustin Henderson?

85
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,040
Know him? I've bled with him.

86
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,709
Chances are,
he's with your cheater boyfriend.

87
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,504
Oh, if and when you do find Lucas,

88
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,383
please tell him I've been
covering for his ass for two days now.

89
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,969
Each day of covering
costs ten bucks, with a DPR.

90
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,139
That's a daily percentage rate of 7.9%.

91
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,642
Another week of this
and he's buying me a goddamn Nintendo,

92
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,060
with <i>Duck Hunt.</i>

93
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,397
Where the hell's Sinclair?

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,315
That's what we're about to find out.

95
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,192
We've been tricked, boys.

96
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,452
Okay, be honest. Uh…

97
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,745
You guys understand any of this?

98
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
- No.
- Pretty straightforward.

99
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,748
Oh, straightforward, really?

100
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,125
What's confusing to you?

101
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,335
So far, everyone Vecna
has cursed has died,

102
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,880
except for this old Victor Creel dude
Nancy found.

103
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,423
He's the only known survivor.

104
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,467
If anyone knows
how to beat this curse, it's him.

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,386
That's assuming he <i>was</i> cursed,
which we don't even know.

106
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,890
How can Vecna have existed in the '50s?
It doesn't make sense.

107
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,018
Far as we know,
Eleven didn't create the Upside Down.

108
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,436
She opened a gate to it.

109
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,898
The Upside Down has probably been around
for thousands of years. Millions.

110
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,066
I wouldn't be surprised
if it predated the dinosaurs.

111
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,943
- Dinosaurs? What are we...
- Okay.

112
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,822
But if a gate didn't exist in the '50s,
how did Vecna get through?

113
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,116
- How's he getting through now?
- And why now?

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,826
And why then? Just pops out in the '50s,

115
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,078
kills one family,
and he's like, "I'm good."

116
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,414
And poof, he just disappears. Just… gone?

117
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,875
Only to return 30 years later
and start killing random teens?

118
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,918
No, I don't buy it.

119
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,378
Straightforward, my ass.

120
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,424
Honestly, Henderson, a little humility
now and then, it wouldn't hurt you.

121
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,467
Sorry.

122
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,270
Any idea what she's writing?

123
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,526
Did she sleep?

124
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:47,944
I mean,

125
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,613
would you?

126
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,203
Okay, so…

127
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,705
…we have a plan.

128
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,375
Thanks to Nancy's minions,

129
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,711
we are now rock-star psychology students
at the University of Notre Dame.

130
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,338
- I'm now Ruth.
- And I'm Rose.

131
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,965
Ruth?

132
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,801
Nice GPA.

133
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,802
Thanks.

134
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,472
So we called Pennhurst Asylum,
told them we'd like to speak with Creel

135
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,766
for a thesis we're co-writing
on paranoid schizophrenics...

136
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,767
To which they said no.

137
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,686
But we landed
a three o'clock with the director.

138
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,773
Now all we have to do is charm him
and convince him to let us talk to Victor.

139
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,942
Then maybe we can rid Max of this curse.

140
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,610
About that.

141
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,280
We've been doing
our Victor Creel homework, and, uh…

142
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,490
…we got some questions.

143
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,658
Lots of questions.

144
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,910
So do we.
Hopefully, Victor has the answers.

145
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
Wait… Wait… Wait a second. Uh…

146
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,498
Where's mine?

147
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,795
Nancy, you're outta your mind
if you think I'm babysitting again.

148
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,881
First, they're not babies anymore.
And Max is in real danger.

149
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,593
- She needs people around her.
- I know. But why me?

150
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,178
Oh my God, you have a Tom Cruise poster.

151
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,139
You have a Tom Cruise poster.

152
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,307
That's old.

153
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,725
It's just…

154
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,270
- Can you please not touch anything?
- I can't do anything here, Nance.

155
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,023
Maybe I can be helpful
with this asylum director dude.

156
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,358
I don't know.
I could turn on my… my charm.

157
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,193
- Not the charm we need.
- Ouch.

158
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,445
No, I just…

159
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,948
I did a little digging last night,
and it turns out this Dr. Hatch

160
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,660
is a distinguished fellow
of the American Psychiatric Association

161
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,871
and a Harvard visiting scholar, okay?

162
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,999
This is a lifelong student of the world.
If we're gonna win him over,

163
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,251
we're gonna have to convince him
we are too.

164
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,586
That, like him…

165
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,672
…we are true academic scholars.

166
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,842
Holy shit.
There's a little ballerina in here.

167
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,182
Academic scholar? She's giving you
an academic scholar vibe? Yeah.

168
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,726
No, but…

169
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,894
…she will.

170
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,814
Oh, please, tell me you're joking.

171
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,028
It's busy. It's still busy.

172
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,783
Did I do something wrong?
It says dial one, then the number, which...

173
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,578
- You can check on your kids later.
- I don't understand why it's still busy.

174
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,374
Joyce, there are certain things
one can be late to in life.

175
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,958
A dentist's appointment.

176
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,544
A one-year-old's birthday party,
because who cares?

177
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,129
Little idiot's not gonna remember it.

178
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,591
But for what is essentially
a ransom exchange,

179
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,969
for that, for that,
I think you very much need to be

180
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,805
on time.

181
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm sorry. I'm very tense.

182
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,935
Clearly.

183
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,914
Head west, through forest.
You will see a church with a gray roof.

184
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,375
Wait inside. Yuri will meet you there.

185
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,627
So you heard from her?

186
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,422
Yeah, they arrived last night.

187
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,465
They're meeting Yuri soon.

188
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,635
If all goes well,
by tomorrow night you're home,

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,595
eating Enzo's with your sexy woman.

190
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,930
She's not my woman.

191
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,351
Of course not.
She saves your life because of friendship.

192
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,021
Look, American,

193
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,524
do not put too much hope into this dream.

194
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
I have thought long about this,

195
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,570
and I give you odds of success

196
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,822
fifty to one.

197
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,245
You don't even seem nervous, American.
I'm impressed.

198
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,247
You're a cool cat.

199
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,417
Like Steve McQueen. The Cooler King. Yeah?

200
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,377
Let's hope not.

201
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,298
Of course not,
because Cooler King went back to cooler.

202
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,551
So, you must be better than McQueen today.

203
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,470
I change mind.

204
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,555
Now I give you odds

205
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,682
a hundred to one.

206
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,604
Our nosy friend again.
Where do you want it?

207
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,189
Just not my face.

208
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,442
Of course not.
Must be pretty for your woman.

209
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,903
She's <i>not </i>my woman.

210
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,440
<i>Amazing you can get
this many people and have it this quiet.</i>

211
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,193
<i>Keep in mind that…</i>

212
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,486
Where are you going?

213
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,447
I'm just getting something
to drink.

214
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,492
Is that allowed or…
How does this house arrest work?

215
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
You're not under arrest.

216
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,494
Right.

217
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,539
No, no, you're… you're here to protect us.

218
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,251
And watch TV, apparently.

219
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,531
I… I mean, I don't think
they've thought this through.

220
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,285
If this goes on for a month, or months,
and people can't get a hold of us,

221
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,078
they're gonna totally freak out.

222
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,664
Meanwhile, my mom's
probably having a panic attack.

223
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,915
And what about Hawkins?

224
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,001
That lady's supposed
to keep it "contained."

225
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,379
Like you can contain any of this
without El. I mean…

226
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,047
Yeah.

227
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,511
If you keep staring at that,
it's not gonna change. You know?

228
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,099
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

229
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,818
Before the cops came,

230
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,613
me and El, we… we had a bad fight.

231
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,364
We never fight.

232
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,782
I mean, we fought before,

233
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,035
but just, like,
silly fights, stupid fights.

234
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,664
But, I don't know,
this one just felt more adult.

235
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,583
Like, it… it just felt more real.

236
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
Like, a fight you can't come back from.

237
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,299
Maybe I should've said something,
and if I would've said that thing,

238
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,260
then maybe she'd want me there with her,
wherever she is.

239
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,554
No. Look, Mike,

240
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,556
you're gonna see her again,

241
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,476
and whatever you didn't say,
you can say it to her then.

242
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,561
Okay?

243
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,521
Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
She's gonna be okay.

245
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,527
She's not in Hawkins.
That's what we should be worrying about.

246
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,237
You don't trust Owens?

247
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,656
No. I don't know.

248
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,823
I mean,

249
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,867
he's been good to us and good to El,

250
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,911
but he wasn't able to protect me.

251
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,372
That was you guys who saved me.

252
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,539
That was you guys.

253
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,462
Looks like
it's gonna be up to us again.

254
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,381
It always is, isn't it?

255
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,301
Which is why we can't stay here.

256
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,180
Listen,

257
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,393
let's assume these friends of Owens
are telling the truth.

258
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,895
We can't call Hawkins
without alerting the military,

259
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,480
putting El in danger.

260
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,399
Fine. Then we'll just go to them.

261
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
- Go to Hawkins?
- How?

262
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,070
What are you worried about?
Ponch and Jon out there?

263
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,738
They're half-asleep now watching golf.

264
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,616
No, Jonathan. I mean,
we don't have a car or money.

265
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,410
Then we'll hail ourselves a ride.

266
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,453
A cheap one.

267
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,624
Excuse me, sir?

268
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,210
Excuse me, sir?

269
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,046
What?

270
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,256
We're hungry.

271
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
I could eat.

272
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,941
Surf's up. Surfer Boy Pizza,
this is Argyle speaking.

273
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,194
We make everything fresh here
at Surfer Boy except for our pineapple,

274
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,529
which comes from a can.

275
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,283
But I still highly recommend slapping
some juicy pineapple on your pie.

276
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,577
Oh, fruit on your pizza's gnarly, you say?

277
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,288
Well, I say try before you deny.

278
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,291
Hello?

279
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,184
- I know you guys are staring at me.
- What, sorry?

280
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,519
- You said you needed something?
- Just hanging out.

281
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,355
How you think your eyes
boring into the back of my head

282
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,025
is protecting me from Vecna, I don't know.

283
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,910
- You can look at me now.
- Thank you. Sorry.

284
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:58,994
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

285
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,664
For you.

286
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
For you.

287
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,336
And, um, you.

288
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,758
Oh, and, um,
give these to Mike, El, and Will.

289
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,637
If you can ever get a hold of them again.

290
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,724
What are you doing? No, don't.
That's not for now. Don't open it now.

291
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,683
Don't… Okay.

292
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,937
I'm sorry. What is this?

293
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,979
It's, um…

294
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,899
It's a fail-safe.

295
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
For after.

296
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,320
If things don't work out.

297
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,907
Wait, whoa.
Max, things are gonna work out.

298
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,825
No!

299
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,037
No, I don't need you to reassure me
and tell me it's all gonna work out.

300
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,874
People have been telling me that
my entire life and it's almost never true.

301
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,752
It's never true.

302
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,255
I mean, of course this asshole curses me.

303
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,633
Should've seen that one coming.

304
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,520
If we go to East Hawkins,
will this reach Pennhurst?

305
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,857
- Of course. Yeah.
- Why are we talking about East Hawkins?

306
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,237
No. No. No!

307
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,073
Max, Max. Seriously.

308
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,784
Seriously, I'm not joking.
I'm not driving you anywhere.

309
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,829
If you think I'm going to spend
what is likely the last day of my life

310
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,165
in the armpit
that is Mike Wheeler's basement,

311
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,249
you're out of your mind.

312
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,751
Either take me where I need to go
or tie me down,

313
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,753
which is technically
kidnapping of a minor.

314
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,632
And if I live to see another day, Steve,
I swear to God, I will prosecute.

315
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,302
Open the door.

316
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,053
Uh, no.

317
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,180
I know a good lawyer.

318
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,441
Henderson, that super walkie of yours
better reach Pennhurst.

319
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,191
I can't breathe in this thing,
and I'm itchy. I'm itching all over.

320
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,151
It's not all about comfort.

321
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,402
Okay? We're academics.

322
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,696
Who are evidently coming
straight from Easter brunch.

323
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,533
Also, this bra that you gave me
is really pinching my boobs.

324
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,663
Okay. Could you just let me
do the talking? If that's even possible?

325
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,873
It's not only possible, it's inevitable.

326
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,626
Because shortly,
I'll be dead from strangulation.

327
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,629
3.9 GPAs.

328
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,547
Both of you.

329
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,467
Impressive.

330
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,929
And this is a recommendation
from Professor Brantley.

331
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,557
Yeah, I know Larry. Quite well, actually.

332
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,310
Eh, you know what they say.

333
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,064
"Those who can't do, teach."

334
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,363
Uh, yes, yes,
that's actually why we're here.

335
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,825
I mean, we can only
learn so much in a classroom.

336
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,742
Mmm.

337
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,662
And I'm sympathetic
to your struggle, truly.

338
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,541
But there is a protocol
to visiting a patient like Victor.

339
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,167
You put in a request

340
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,712
and then undergo a screening process,

341
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,089
at which point
the board will make a decision.

342
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,385
I can see you're disappointed.

343
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,139
But I'm more than happy
to give you a tour.

344
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,892
Perhaps you can even speak
to some patients in our low-security wing.

345
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,895
And we'd… we would love that.

346
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,523
It's just that, um…

347
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,234
…our thesis is due next month.

348
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,986
And you're out of time.

349
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,112
Whose fault is that?

350
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,031
Ours. Absolutely.

351
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,824
And I do apologize...

352
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,243
Don't apologize, Ruth. Screw that.

353
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,538
The fact is, we did put in a request
months ago and were denied.

354
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,082
And then we reapplied
and were denied again.

355
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,461
And coming here was
our last-ditch effort to save our thesis.

356
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,339
And I really…
I can't breathe in this thing.

357
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,383
Well, Rose, maybe you'd like
to go outside and get some air.

358
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,385
- Maybe I should, Ruth.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,972
Because I'm starting to think
this whole thing is a colossal mistake.

360
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,891
I'm breaking out in a rash.

361
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,560
My boobs hurt.
And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.

362
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,063
May I call you Anthony?
These aren't my clothes.

363
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,566
I borrowed them
because I wanted you to take us seriously.

364
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,986
Because nobody takes girls seriously
in this field. They just don't.

365
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,656
We don't look the part or whatever.
But can I tell you a story?

366
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,159
1978, I was at summer camp.

367
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,454
And my counselor Drew
told me and everyone in Cabin C

368
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,082
the true story
of the Victor Creel Massacre.

369
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,126
And little Petey McHew…
You know Petey, right, Ruth?

370
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,044
Of… Of course.

371
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,507
Yeah. Little Petey McHew
started sobbing right there on the spot.

372
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,384
Full-on hyperventilating.

373
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,427
The other campers
couldn't sleep for weeks.

374
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,721
I couldn't either,
but not 'cause I was scared.

375
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,723
Because I was obsessed with the question,

376
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,685
"What would drive a human being
to commit such unimaginable acts?"

377
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,356
Other kids wanted to be astronauts,
basketball players, rock stars.

378
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,732
But I wanted to be you.

379
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,526
I wanted to be you.

380
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,779
So, forgive me if I'll now
try anything in my power,

381
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,281
including wearing this ridiculous outfit,

382
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,326
if I might get to speak to the man
that ignited my passion

383
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,621
and learn a little more
about how his twisted, but let's face it,

384
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,207
totally fascinating mind works.

385
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,335
So, yes, we don't
have the official paperwork,

386
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,213
but don't tell me
that cry-baby Petey McHew

387
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,841
wouldn't have gotten
an audience with Victor in moments

388
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,008
if he'd asked politely,

389
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,177
because you and I both know that he would.

390
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,014
So… ten minutes with Victor.

391
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,559
That's all I ask.

392
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,356
I'm back in 30.

393
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,608
Mm-hmm.

394
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,056
If things go sideways, I should mention
I'm now a black belt in karate.

395
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,310
Hello?

396
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,603
Hello?

397
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,189
Hello?

398
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,858
Hello...

399
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,034
Who are you?

400
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,245
I… Uh… We're looking for Yuri.

401
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,081
Why do you need to see Yuri?

402
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,334
It's actually, uh...

403
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,836
It's a private matter. Is Yuri here?

404
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,463
I'm sorry.

405
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,382
I don't know how to tell you this,

406
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,635
but you're a day late.

407
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,387
- What?
- You see damage to this hull?

408
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,600
Yuri was on sightseeing trip
to see polar bears.

409
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,604
And then bears got into plane

410
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,650
and pull him out of cockpit and kill Yuri.

411
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,318
- No.
- Yeah.

412
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,736
And he loved bears.

413
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,488
They broke his heart.

414
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,199
Or rather punctured it

415
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,201
with their bear claws.

416
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,631
I got you. I got you good.

417
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,468
I'm Yuri. I'm Yuri.

418
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,387
- Oh.
- Oh.

419
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,056
- Uh, you… you must be Joycey?
- Just Joyce.

420
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,933
- And you are?
- Murray.

421
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,351
- Murray?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,854
Yuri. Yuri, Murray, Yuri, Murray.
We rhyme.

423
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,315
Yeah. I hear it.

424
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,031
Forty thousand American dollars,
as promised.

425
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,373
I love the smell of cash in morning.

426
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,874
Right.

427
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,879
I hope you do not mind if I count.

428
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,258
You two seem very nice,
very trustworthy people.

429
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,718
But so did my brother

430
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,470
before he stole my wife!

431
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,437
Poor bird, you're freezing.

432
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,731
Please, have some coffee. Still hot.

433
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,066
This could be a while

434
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,537
Why are you staring at me?

435
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,872
Huh? I am asking you!

436
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,123
Move, bastard!

437
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,607
Crazy American.

438
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,827
Hey! Get back! Get back!

439
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,953
Get back!

440
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,581
Broken…

441
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,418
Cannot work.

442
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,795
Cannot work.

443
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,712
Stay there.

444
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,859
Where is the American?!

445
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,094
Watch your back, American...

446
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,147
Where do you think you're going, American?

447
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,648
Stand.

448
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,194
Stand up!

449
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,324
Hands.

450
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,326
Hands!

451
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,641
Tool shed!
It came from the tool shed!

452
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,101
Open up!

453
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,520
Open the door!

454
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,896
Open the door!

455
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,981
Keep pushing! Hurry!

456
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,577
RUN!

457
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,628
There!

458
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,796
There!

459
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,469
We can't let him get to the tree line!

460
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,901
A hundred to one.

461
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,612
Son of a bitch.

- This better be fast, Mayfield.
- Twenty seconds.

468
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,443
That thing's got batteries in it, right?

469
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,156
I'm not even answering that question.

470
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,368
- Yes, it has batteries.
- Yeah, I got it.

471
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,107
Mom.

472
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,110
Hey, sweetie. I thought
you were with your friends today.

473
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,820
Yeah, I… I was. I am.

474
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,615
Shouldn't you be at work?

475
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,869
Oh, Mr. Bradley let me off early.
So I'm just catching up on some chores.

476
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,665
Um, I… I left some letters inside.

477
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,918
For you and… and Granny and Uncle Jack.

478
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,544
And Dad.

479
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,129
If you can find him.

480
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,340
Letters? I… I don't understand.

481
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,424
Uh,

482
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,635
I just… um…

483
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,640
With all the murders and everything, I…

484
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,727
I know it's stupid,
but I just started to think,

485
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,314
"What if something happens to me?"

486
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,192
Max, baby,
nothing is going to happen to you.

487
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,611
I know. But if… if it did, I just…

488
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,156
There's so many things that I want to say,
that I need to say. And…

489
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,495
- Promise you'll give the letters out?
- Max, you're scaring me.

490
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,664
- I'm not trying to scare you.
- Is something going on?

491
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,582
- No.
- Is it, baby?

492
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,336
No. No, you're right.
I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm being silly.

493
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,132
Max. Oh, sweetie.

494
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,468
Shh.

495
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,553
It's okay.

496
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,473
Nothing is going to happen, baby.

497
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,058
I promise.

498
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,312
Nothing you don't deserve.

499
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,367
Mom, let go of me.

500
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,078
Mom? Let go.

501
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,830
Maxine.

502
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,291
You think some letters

503
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,669
are going to make things right?

504
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,966
You've broken everything.

505
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,968
Billy!

506
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,553
Your time

507
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,473
is almost at an end.

508
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,599
Let go!

509
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,284
Hey, that was longer than 20 seconds.

510
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,119
Hey, whoa, whoa. You all right?

511
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,412
I'm fine. Just drive.

512
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,750
- Did something happen?
- Can we please just go?

513
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,798
These are our gardens.

514
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,674
Beautiful, aren't they?

515
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,137
We allow them two hours
of outside time a day.

516
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,847
Can't they just escape?

517
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,015
They could.

518
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,476
But the vast majority choose to be here.

519
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,603
They like it here.

520
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,904
This is one of our more popular areas.
The listening room.

521
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,240
We found that music has

522
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,909
a particularly calming effect
on the broken mind.

523
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,662
The right song,

524
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,832
particularly one which holds
some personal meaning,

525
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,834
can prove a salient stimulus.

526
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,003
But there are those who are

527
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,839
beyond a cure.

528
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,056
Uh, Dr. Hatch, do you think
it might be possible for us

529
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,642
to speak to Victor alone?

530
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,355
Alone?

531
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:54,527
I… I think that we would just love
the challenge of speaking with Victor

532
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,405
without the safety net
of an expert such as yourself.

533
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,824
Then we could really rub it in
Professor Bradley's face.

534
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,077
Professor Bradley? I don't believe
I know a Professor Bradley.

535
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,537
Brantley.

536
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,707
She… she meant to say Brantley.

537
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,834
Didn't I say Brantley? What did I say?

538
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,962
Sorry, silly me.
Words, letters.

539
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,673
Guess I'm just nervous. I mean, excited.

540
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,759
So excited to speak with Victor.

541
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,888
Preferably, as she said, alone?

542
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,523
Yes.

543
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:33,983
Why not?

544
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,569
You've caught me in a rebellious mood.

545
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,532
And there's something rather urgent
I need to check on anyway, so…

546
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,784
Sure.

547
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,539
Keep a close eye on them.

548
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,630
- Thank you so much, Dr. Hatch.
- Thank you.

549
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,978
Do not startle him.

550
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,814
Do not touch him.

551
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,109
Do not pass him anything.

552
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,822
Stand five feet away from the bars
at all times.

553
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,865
Get away.

554
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,617
Is that clear?

555
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,661
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

556
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,247
Victor.

557
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,960
Today's your lucky day!

558
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,711
You got visitors.

559
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,090
Real pretty ones.

560
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,554
Must be in one of his moods.

561
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,514
Have fun.

562
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,270
Victor?

563
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,022
My name is Nancy.

564
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,899
Nancy Wheeler.

565
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,151
And this is…

566
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,736
Robin Buckley.

567
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,698
Um, we have some questions.

568
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,491
I don't talk to reporters.

569
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,742
Hatch knows that.

570
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,953
We're not reporters.

571
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,875
We're here because… we believe you.

572
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,962
And because

573
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,964
we need your help.

574
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,633
Whatever killed your family,

575
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,635
we think it's back.

For what?

585
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,302
For knocking some sense into me.
I was being a total self-pitying idiot.

586
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,220
Oh, I didn't say it.

587

You didn't have to.

00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,103
Hey, also, about the last few days...

589
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,396
You don't have to say anything.

590
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,191
I… I was being a total jerk to El.
I deserved it.

591
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,192
No.

592
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,778
No, no, no. You didn't deserve anything.

593
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,240
Listen, the truth is, the last year

594
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,701
has been weird, you know?

595
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,120
And I mean, you know,
Max and Lucas and Dustin,

596
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,538
they're… they're great.

597
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,624
They're great. It's just…

598
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,627
It's Hawkins.
It's not the same without you.

599
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,047
And I feel like maybe
I was worrying too much about El,

600
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,176
and I don't know,
maybe I feel I lost you or something.

601
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,512
Does that make sense?

602
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,682
I have no idea what's gonna happen next.

603
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:59,021
But, whatever it is,
I… I think we should work together.

604
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,607
I think it'll be easier
if we're… we're a team.

605
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,442
Friends.

606
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,237
Best friends.

607
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,322

- Yeah.

611
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,217
Pizza time. I got it.

612
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,098
Yeah, I'm coming.

00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,820
Go in the den!

Shit!

622
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,627
- Follow me.
- Okay.

623
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,009
What the hell is going on?!

624
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,012
Just stay there.

625
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,725

00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,697
I shoot, you run!

641
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,743
Forty thousand.

642
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,162
Wow, all there.

643
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,374
Okay, now your turn.

644
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,253
Go get Hopper.

645
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,170
I will.

646
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,422
But first, I will call Enzo.

647
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,216
If your friend is dead,

648
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,510
I could save myself trouble and fuel.

649
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,598
I'm kidding. I'm sure he's not dead.

650
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,433
But still, I should check.

651
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,529
I don't like him.

652
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,742
Antonov, phone for you.

653
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,869
You realize we just had an escape?

654
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,370
They say it's urgent.

655
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,335
Hello?

656
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,838
Enzo. It is Yuri.

657
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,637
Why are you calling me here? Are you mad?

658
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:10,184
I know. I am very sorry. I just felt
you should know that there has been...

659
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:15,773
...a slight change in plans.

660
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,316
What? What has happened?

661
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,534
I just got off the phone

662
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,911
<i>with your warden.</i>

663
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,330
A very productive call.

664
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:35,918
It turns out, escaped prisoners
are worth quite a bit of money.

665
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:47,262
So Yuri thinks, why not keep
the forty grand and make extra money?

666
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,181
That wasn't the deal.

667
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:53,018
But it is
a better deal for Yuri, yes?

668
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:57,773
And you know what is worth
even more than escaped prisoner?

669
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,067
<i>Corrupt guards.</i>

670
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,944
What have you done?!

671
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,408
And worth most of all...

672
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,286
Americans...

673
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,206
...wanted by the KGB.

674
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,239
Goodbye, Enzo.

675
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,585
I'm sorry, poor bird.

676
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,504
Did I make your coffee too strong?

677
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,507
Don't worry.

678
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,344
You will be reunited
with your American boyfriend very soon.

679
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,140
Very soon.

680
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,033
Turn here.

681
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,536
Here?

682
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,148
- Max?
- Lucas, please, just wait in the car.

683
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,150
- Max, just wait. Max, please.
- Lucas, just wait...

684
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,902
Just listen to me. Just, please.

685
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,948
I know something happened there
with your mother.

686
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,327
Was it Vecna?

687
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,373
I told you, I'm fine.

688
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,832
Okay?

689
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,212
I mean, as fine as someone who's hurtling
towards a gruesome death can be.

690
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,716
Max…

691
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,387
You know you can talk to me.

692
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:34,888
Right?

693
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,350
Yeah, I know that.

694
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,769
Okay, then why do you
keep pushing me away?

695
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,063
Okay, look,

696
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,190
I don't need a letter.

697
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,817
I don't want a letter.

698
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,568
Just talk to me.

699
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,820
To your friends.

700
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,530
We're right here.

701
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,991
I'm right here.

702
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,410
Okay?

703
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,371
I'm here.

704
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,751
Wait in the car. This won't be long.

705
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:11,299
<i>When he attacks,
our friend described it as a trance.</i>

706
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,136
Like a waking nightmare.

707
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,223
That's why we think
he's coming for her next.

708
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:22,519
Does any of this, anything we've told you,
sound like what happened to your family?

709
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,106
Victor.

710
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,610
- I know this is hard...
- You don't know anything!

711
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,572
You're right.

712
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,200
We don't know. That's why we're here.

713
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,412
To learn, to understand.

714
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,999
We need to know
how you survived that night.

715
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,376
Survived?

716
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,588
Is that what you call this?

717
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,760
Did I survive?

718
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,431
No, I assure you,

719
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,768
I am still very much in hell.

720
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:16,281
<i>I had been back from the war
some 14 years.</i>

721
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,620
<i>Her great-uncle had died,
leaving us a small fortune.</i>

722
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,663
<i>Enough to buy a new home,</i>

723
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,457
<i>a new life.</i>

724
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,876
- What'd I tell ya?
- Wow.

725
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,253
This is amazing.

726
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,839
It looks like a fairy tale.

727
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,257
A dream.

728
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,343
Alice, no running.

729
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,428
It's so big!

730
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,639
This is nice.

731
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,015
Yeah.

732
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,435
<i>- It was a magnificent home.</i>
- Yeah.

733
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,982
Alice said it looked like
it was from a fairy tale.

734
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,360
Alice.

735
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,362
Was this your daughter?

736
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,197
Mmm. Yeah.

737
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,699
But Henry, my…

738
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,119
My boy,

739
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,496
<i>he was a sensitive child…</i>

740
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,543
<i>…and I could see
he felt something was wrong.</i>

741
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:14,089
We had one month of peace in that house.

742
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,675
And then it began.

743
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,514
<i>Dead animals,</i>

744
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,267
<i>mutilated, tortured,</i>

745
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,769
<i>began to appear near our home.</i>

746
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,606
<i>Rabbits, squirrels, chickens, even dogs.</i>

747
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,110
<i>The police chief
blamed the attacks on a wildcat.</i>

748
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,696
<i>This…
…this was no wildcat.</i>

749
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,490
<i>This was an evil.</i>

750
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,994
<i>And evil neither animal nor human.</i>

751
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,788
This was

752
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,833
a spawn of Satan.

753
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,168
A demon.

754
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,046
And it was even closer than I realized.

755
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:09,853
Victor!

756
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,856
<i>My family began to have encounters</i>

757
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,649
<i>conjured by this demon.</i>

758
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,109
Nightmares.

759
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,279
Waking, living nightmares.

760
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:29,497
<i>This demon, it seemed
to take pleasure in tormenting us.</i>

761
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,792
<i>Even poor, innocent Alice.</i>

762
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:35,921
Alice!

763
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,965
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. Come here.

764
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:44,054
It wasn't long before I began
to have encounters of my own.

765
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,690
I suppose

766
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,442
all evil

767
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,779
must have a home.

768
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:14,542
<i>And though I had not
a rational explanation for it, I…</i>

769
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,254
<i>I could sense this demon,</i>

770
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,090
<i>always close.</i>

771
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:28,139
<i>I became convinced it was hiding,</i>

772
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,100
<i>nesting,</i>

773
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,603
<i>somewhere within the shadows of our home.</i>

774
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,481
It had cursed our town.

775
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,859
It had cursed our home.

776
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,071
It had cursed us.

777
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:53,623

Creel.

Creel! What the hell happened here?

789
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,965
<i>But I was back to France,</i>

790
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,133
<i>back in the war.</i>

791
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,802
It… it was a memory.

792
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,097
I had thought German soldiers were inside.

793
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,017
I ordered its shelling.

794
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,149
I was wrong.

795
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,200
This demon,

796
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,202
it was taunting me.

797
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,330
And I was sure it would take me,

798
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,333
just as he'd taken my Virginia.

799
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,876
But then…

800
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,922
I heard…

801
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,298
…another voice.

802
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,886
<i>♪ Stars shining bright above you ♪</i>

803
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,055
At first, I believed it was an angel.

804
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,557
And I… I followed her,

805
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,644
only to find myself…

806
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,480
…in a nightmare far worse.

807
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,238
<i>While I was away,</i>

808
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,366
<i>the demon took my children.</i>

809
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:59,207
<i>Henry slipped into a coma
shortly after that.</i>

810
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,336
A week later, he died.

811
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,468
I tried to join them.

812
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,638
I tried.

813
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,939
Hatch stopped the bleeding.

814
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,568
He wouldn't let me join them.

815
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,906
The angel you followed,

816
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:33,992
who was she?

817
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,002
Victor?

818
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,754
Victor.

819
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,924
Is he everything you hoped he would be?

820
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,970
I just had a very interesting conversation
with Professor Brantley.

821
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,181
Perhaps we should discuss in my office

822
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,350
while we wait for the police.

823
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,874
"Dear Billy, I don't know
if you can even hear this."

824
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,421
"Two years ago, I would have said,
'That's ridiculous, impossible.'"

825
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:34,219
"But that was before I found out about
alternate dimensions and monsters,

826
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,889
so… I'm just going to stop assuming
that I know anything."

827
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,226
"So much has happened since you left."

828
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,895
"Your dad was

829
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,856
a total mess."

830
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,028
"He and my mom
started getting into fights."

831
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,906
"Bad fights."

832
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,245
"I don't think he could stand
being here without you."

833
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,413
"So he left."

834
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,544
"And he didn't leave Mom much."

835
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:14,592
"She's taken an extra job, and we moved
to that lovely trailer park off Kerley."

836
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,137
"Basically,

837
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,765
ever since you left,

838
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,184
everything's been…

839
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,854
A total disaster."

840
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,773
"And the worst part is,

841
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,359
I can't tell anyone why you're gone."

842
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,821
"I can't tell them
that you saved El's life."

843
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,324
"That you saved my life."

844
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,373
"I play that moment back
in my head all the time."

845
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,502
"And sometimes I imagine myself

846
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,754
running to you,

847
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,382
pulling you away."

848
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,845
"I imagine that if I had,

849
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,431
that you would still be here."

850
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,351
"And everything would be…

851
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,230
…everything would be right again."

852
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,444
"I imagine that we…

853
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,030
That we could've become friends."

854
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,283
"Good friends, like…

855
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,579
like a real brother and sister."

856
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,499
"And I know that's stupid."

857
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:30,918
"You hated me."

858
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,463
"I hated you."

859
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,675
"But I thought that maybe…

860
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,136
Maybe we could try again."

861
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,477
"But that's not what happened."

862
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:50,521
"I just…

863
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,607
I stood there

864
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,401
and I watched."

865
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,156
"For a while, I tried to be happy."

866
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,201
"Normal."

867
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,205
"But I…

868
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,667
I think that maybe
a part of me died that day too."

869
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,548
"And I haven't told anyone this."

870
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,677
"I… I just can't."

871
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:25,973
"But I had to tell you."

872
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,394
"Before it's too late."

873
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,982
"If you can even hear this."

874
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,987
"I really hope that you can."

875
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,536
"I'm sorry."

876
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,874
"I'm so, so sorry, Billy."

877
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,968
"Love, your shitty little sister,

878
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,220
Max."

879
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,036
Max.

880
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,548
All right, it's been long enough.

881
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,676
- Steve, just give her some time.
- I have, all right?

882
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,262
I'm calling it.
She wants to get a lawyer, she can.

883
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,018
Max.

884
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,978
Time to giddy up, yeah?

885
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,647
Max?

886
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,818
Max. Max.

887
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,070
Max!

888
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,740
Max.

889
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,911
I've been waiting
to hear those words, Max.

890
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,958
Waiting so very long.

891
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:17,877
Wake up!

892
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,961
Hey!

893
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,507
Max, wake up!

894
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,593
Max! Wake up!

895
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,554
- Oh, something's wrong.
- Max!

896
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,514
Guys!

897
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,768
Come on, wake up!

898
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,397
But it wasn't the full truth, was it, Max?

899
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,444
You know, I think there's a part of you,

900
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,446
buried somewhere deep,

901
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,824
that wanted me to die that day.

902
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:51,244
That was maybe even relieved.

903
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,205
Happy.

904
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,998
Billy, no, that's not true.

905
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,543
That's why you stood there, isn't it, Max?

906
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,546
It's okay. You can admit it now.

907
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,506
No more lies.

908
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:06,676
- No more hiding.
- Billy, that's not true, I swear.

909
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:10,221
- I swear it's not true.
- That is why you feel such guilt.

910
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,849
- No.
- Why you hide from your friends.

911
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,393
- Why you hide from the world.
- No. No.

912
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,687
And why, late at night,

913
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:21,566
you have sometimes wished to follow me.

914
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,735
Follow me into death.

915
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:28,531
- That is why I am here, Max.
- No.

916
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,909
- To end your suffering, once and for all.
- No.

917
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,878
It is time, Max.

918
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,838
Time for you

919
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,716
to join me.

920
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,104
Max, you gotta get outta there!
Can you hear me?

921
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,356
- Max!
- You gotta get outta there!

922
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,110
Call Nancy and Robin!
Go get 'em! Call Nancy and Robin! Go!

923
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,154
- Please, Max!
- Shit!

924
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,489
Shit, shit, shit! Shit, shit, shit!

925
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:17,455
Nancy? Robin? Do you copy?
This is a code red. Do you copy?

926
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,458
Shit. Robin!

927
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,629
You're not listening.
Our friend is in danger.

928
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,673
Do you really expect me
to believe anything you have to say?

929
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,591
It's the truth.

930
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,135
You are free
to tell your sob story to the police.

931
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,305
- Move along.
- Don't touch me!

932
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,610
Victor said the night of the attack,
everything went on in the house,

933
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,654
but he made specific mention of music.

934
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,072
He said music was playing.

935
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:57,036
And then, when we asked him
about the angel, he started to hum.

936
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,541
<i>♪ Say nighty-night and kiss me
Hold me tight… ♪</i>

937
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,752
- "Dream a Little Dream of Me."
- Ella Fitzgerald.

938
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:06,295
- The voice of an angel.
- Yeah.

939
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,424
Hatch said that music can reach
parts of the brain that words can't.

940
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,843
So maybe that's the key, a lifeline.

941
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,304
- A lifeline back to reality.
- It's worth a shot.

942
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,599
- I think we can beat him.
- What?

943
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,517
To the car.

944
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,269
Okay. I'm warning you right now,
I have terrible coordination.

945
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,106
Took me six months longer to walk
than all the other babies.

946
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,358
- Just follow my lead.
- No, my God!

947
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,943
Hey! Get back here!

948
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,238
Cinderella, you dropped your shoe!

949
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,614
Stop right there!

950
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,409
Go!

951
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,745
Oh my God!

952
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:05,396
You cannot hide from me, Maxine.

953
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:10,151
Let's go!

954
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,737
Stop! Get out of there!

955
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,533
- Ah!
- Hey!

956
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,661
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Stop! Get out of the car.

957
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,705
Get out of the car.

958
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,378
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

959
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,088
You really are a weird runner.

960
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:35,426
<i>Robin, where the hell are you?
This is a code red. I repeat, a code red!</i>

961
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,803
Dustin, it's Robin. We copy.

962
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,472
Holy shit. Finally!

963
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,433
Please, please tell me you guys
have this figured out.

964
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,813
Lucas!

965
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,106
Dustin!

966
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,109
Lucas, please, help! Dustin!

967
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,929
Max, get outta there!

968
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,222

- Guys!

969
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,683
- What is this?
- What's her favorite song?

970
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,601
- Why?
- Robin said if she listens…

971
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,563
It's too much to explain now.
What's her favorite song?

972
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:40,926
What are you doing in here, Max?

973

Come back to me.

How do you like them, Max?

975
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,968
Would you like to join them?

976
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,515

01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:30,851

01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,354

- Okay, okay!

981
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,702
Lucas, which one is it?

982
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,037
What's her favorite song?

983
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,006
- Which one?
- It's right here! Got it!

984
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,967
- Give it to me.
- Go, go, go!

985
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,426
- Okay, headphones!
- Now!

987
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,976
