It is time.

3
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,855
It's beautiful, isn't it?

4
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,524
I'm Ikaris.

5
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,860
I'm Sersi.

6
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,315
It's coming! Run!

7
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,195
Father!

8
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,279
Run!

9
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,486
Good fight.

10
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,828
You, too.

11
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,182
Thank you, Ajak.

12
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,079
Shit.

13
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,461
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,981
I know I'm late, Charlie.

"In this broad Earth of ours,

16

17
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,912

"Nestles the seed Perfection."

The poet's hope and optimism in humanity

21
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,048
the return of half our population...

00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,376
And, thank God, there she is.

23

Our brilliant museum scientist,
Ms Sersi,

24
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,012
the person who will be

25
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,181
and was always supposed to be

26
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,683
giving you your presentation today.

27
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,686
Thank you, Mr Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

28
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,688
Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

29
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,732
of apex predators
in a balanced ecosystem.

30
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,068
Poetry?

31
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,630
I completely
ran out of things to say,

32
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,780
and these kids make me nervous.

33
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,157
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

34
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,784
See you tonight.

35
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,579
Ooh! "See you tonight."

36
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,330
All right, settle down.

37
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,834
So...

38
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,712
who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

39
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,880
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

40
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,215
Very good.

41
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,718
Apex predators do hunt
their prey for food,

42
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,052
like all predators.

43
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,054
But one thing that sets them apart

44
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,807
is that there are no other
animals in their habitat

45
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,851
strong enough to hunt them.

46
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,437
Who can give me an example?

47
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,605
Lions.

48
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,523
- Wolves.
- Correct.

49
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,360
Earthquake.

50
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,781
Get down. Get down!

51
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,618
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

52
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,955
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

53
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,923
It's all right. Come here.

54
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,053
You're all right. You're all right.

55
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,555
I like this song.

56
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,848
Me, too.

57
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,226
Do you wanna dance?

58
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,353
Wait, what the hell?

59
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,522
Your hand!

60
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,110
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

61
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:02,661
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

62
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,833
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dane</i>

63
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,962
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,047
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

Is this from the Middle Ages?

67
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,099
It has your family crest.

68
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,560
It must have cost a fortune.

69
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,562
I'm a good eBay bidder.

70
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,646
Thank you.

71
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,606
Happy birthday.

72
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,113
So, have you given any more thought

73
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,865
to us moving in together?

74
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,200
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

75
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,370
I can't move in with you.

76
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,372
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd say that.

77
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,582
I'm sorry.

78
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,042
And I think I know why.

79
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,421
Are you a wizard?

80
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,922
What?

81
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,091
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

82
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,176
No. I'm...

83
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,612
I've noticed some unusual things happen

84
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,636
when I'm around you.

85
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,764
Like our water always turns to coffee

86
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,992
whenever the waiter ignores us.

87
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,160
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

88
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,977
-And Sprite says things...
-Mm.

89
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,604
...like you and your ex-boyfriend

90
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,105
broke up a century ago.

91
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,732
She said that?

92
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,108
And he can fly.

93
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,194
He's a pilot.

94
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,322
Get a room, you two.

95
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,866
Can we go now? It's past my bedtime.

96
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,955
Are you really in love?

97
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,373
What if I am?

98
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,709
You better tell him
the truth, then.

99
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,503
I'm working on it.

100
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,474
You guys wanna get pizza?

101
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,892
No, thank you!

102
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,230
He won't live forever, you know.

103
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,314
Move in with him.

104
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,191
I live with you.

105
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,611
Dane.

106
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,199
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

107
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,992
Dane, run!

108
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,630
-Sersi?
-Let's go.

109
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,717
-What is that thing?
-A Deviant!

110
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,052
You said you killed them all!

111
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
You told him that?

112
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,972
-You believed me?
-I do now!

113
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,230
What are you doing?

114
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,439
Keep Dane safe!

115
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,483
Sersi, wait! What?

116
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,076
You're fine, dude.

117
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,369
Sprite!

118
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,501
No. Stairs.

119
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,207
Run! Go! Go!

120
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,751
- Go!
- Come on!

121
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,801
It knows where we are!

122
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,053
How?

123
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,180
I don't know!

124
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Sprite!

125
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,230
Sprite!

126
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,501
Ikaris!

127
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,587
Evening, ladies.

128
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,507
Watch out!

129
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,983
Wizard.

130
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,862
Sorry.

131
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,969
Did it just heal itself?

132
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,573
Ikaris.

133
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,243
It's good to see you.

134
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,537
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

135
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,545
I'm Dane.

136
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,130
Hello, Dane.

137
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,841
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

138
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,483
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

139
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,153
We came here 7,000 years ago
on the Domo,

140
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,740
our starship, to protect
humans from the Deviants.

141
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,202
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago,

142
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,912
but now they're back.

143
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,434
Look, if you don't
want to move in with me,

144
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,458
you could just say.

145
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,043
Dane, this is serious.

146
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,795
Oh, I know. I'm just still getting

147
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,239
over the fact you're not a wizard.

148
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,525
I was hoping you could
change me into a giraffe.

149
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,194
I always wanted to be
a giraffe when I was a kid.

150
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,511
It's too bad I can't change
sentient beings.

151
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,278
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

152
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,228
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

153
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,813
Or any war?

154
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,937
Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

155
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,108
We were instructed

156
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,503
not to interfere in any human conflicts

157
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,712
unless Deviants were involved.

158
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,945
Why?

159
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,907
If we'd protected humanity
from everything

160
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,325
for 7,000 years,

161
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,577
you'd never have had
the chance to develop

162
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,371
in the way you were meant to.

163
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,750
But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

164
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,210
why are you still here?

165
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,461
We've been waiting...

166
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,964
to be told we can go home.

167
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,008
So...

168
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,052
Ikaris.

169
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,805
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

170
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,641
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

171
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,227
In the fifth century BC?

172
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,937
How long were you two together?

173
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,063
5,000 years.

174
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,984
I guess you can call that long-term.

175
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,486
What happened?

176
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,572
He left.

177
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,325
I always thought he'd come back, but...

178
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,578
he never did.

179
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,538
So, I moved on.

180
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,373
I'm glad you did.

181
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,417
I'm sorry.

182
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,295
I have to go.

183
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,597
This morning,

184
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,056
<i>an unprecedented global earthquake</i>

185
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,808
<i>swept nation-states across the world,</i>

186
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,019
<i>causing damage and panic.</i>

187
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,771
<i>Many have speculated</i>
<i>its connection with the Blip.</i>

188
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,191
<i>The UN has called</i>
<i>for an emergency meeting...</i>

189
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,484
That Deviant healed itself.

190
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,529
They could never do that before.

191
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,450
And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

192
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,701
What's going on?

193
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,579
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

194
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,831
That Deviant is news to me.

195
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,628
Something's happening to Earth.

196
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,714
Can't be a coincidence.

197
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,967
We need to find the others.

198
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,553
I haven't seen
some of them for centuries.

199
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,639
I doubt much has changed.

200
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,652
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

201
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,159
But we need to stick together.

202
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,622
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

203
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,916
Let's go to Ajak first.

204
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,752
She'll know what to do.

205
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,299
You hear that, Sprite?

206
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,969
Family reunion.

207
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,512
It's about time.

208
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,235
Hey, that one was mine!
Oh, never mind.

209
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,537
Do not fear.

210
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,873
Quickly, inside the gate!

211
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,581
Ajak.

212
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,750
Arishem.

213
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,754
We continue to keep Babylon
safe from the Deviants.

214
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,423
More people have come to seek refuge.

215
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,343
It is now the largest city on Earth.

216
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,261
The Eternals serving their missions

217
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,346
across the galaxies

218
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,223
will learn from your success.

219
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,766
Thank you.

220
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,022
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

221
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,819
But I have noticed something
special about this planet.

222
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,241
And I fear that maybe
this time the cost may...

223
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,119
Do not become
attached to this planet.

224
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,123
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

225
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,042
I understand.

226
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,087
I will not let you down.

227
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:26,904
Phastos.

228
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,949
Did you go to the party
last night like I told you to?

229
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,117
The party, yeah.

230
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,965
- Yeah, it was...
- He worked all night.

231
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,347
Who was talking to you?

232
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,531
Get a life.

233
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,707
-And where is Sersi?
-Late as usual.

234
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,227
I'm sorry,
but I have something

235
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,711
very exciting to show you, okay?

236
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,713
Wait till you see this.

237
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,509
What is it?

238
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,219
It's an engine.

239
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,431
It moves steam from
high pressure to low pressure.

240
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,391
Uh, it'll help them till their fields

241
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,642
at an incredibly fast rate.

242
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,186
It's gonna freak them out.

243
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,189
I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1 ,000 years, so...

244
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,233
You know, we could do that thing

245
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,402
where you use your mind to control them

246
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,630
and then they could do it quicker.

247
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,905
Ajak, you listening to this?

248
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,908
Phastos, this steam...

249
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,076
-Engine. It's a steam engine.
-It's too soon.

250
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,661
And there she is.

251
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,538
What did I miss?

252
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,709
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

253
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,669
I am sure
you have something simpler.

254
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,795
Simple.

255
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,757
Okay, let's see. Uh...

256
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,843
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

257
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,513
the plough.

258
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,474
'Cause that's what it does.

259
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,934
Ploughs dirt.

260
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,435
I met another group of settlers

261
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,604
who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

262
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,168
They'll need to plant
their own crops.

263
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,191
- Thanks, Sersi.
- Listen,

264
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:49,237
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

265
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,240
But there is no telling what wonders

266
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,951
they will discover as they advance.

267
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:01,541
The wonders of the world await you.

268
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,753
Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu into battle.

269
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,132
Be forever inspired
by their bravery and strength.

270
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,761
You and your fellow man...

271
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,806
...will go on great adventures.

272
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,059
And become legends of your own!

273
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,209
I just saw that.

274
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,109
There's so many other chairs, man.

275
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,587
You know,
I could use my powers...

276
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,195
Come and have a drink with me.

277
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,655
No.

278
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,717
I can't let you go and fight
Deviants on your own.

279
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,909
-We need to guard the city.
-Get out of my way.

280
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,538
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

281
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,458
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

282
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,837
-Hmm.
-Thena.

283
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,675
It's an honour to fight alongside you.

284
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,553
And you.

285
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,058
My beautiful Makkari.

286
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,310
You're late.

287
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,689
I needed to get
enough artefacts to make a good trade.

288
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,505
Just lie to her.

289
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,412
I can sense vibrations.

290
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,289
Even the tiniest movement.

291
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:28,044
Including your voices when you speak.

292
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,131
Did you two just waste my time?

293
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,176
The Emerald Tablet
you're searching for...

294
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,344
...is a myth!

295
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,453
When humans have conflict,

296
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,906
Ajak tells us not to interfere.

297
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,407
Well, she also says

298
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,118
that stealing is very, very bad.

299
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,017
If you don't tell,

300
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,500
I won't tell.

301
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,293
Deal.

302
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,533
I promise I won't
let my feelings for Sersi

303
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,849
distract me from my mission.

304
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,601
Humans are far from being able

305
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,286
to protect themselves from the Deviants.

306
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,271
We still have much to do.

307
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,942
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

308
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,027
I can feel it.

309
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,365
But you are allowed
to live a life, you know?

310
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,410
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

311
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,770
Try.

312
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,064
Sorry.

313
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,399
I'm making a mess.

314
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,028
Well, not bad.

315
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,900
See you.

316
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,161
Let me help you.

317
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,549
It matches your eyes.

318
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,178
You are very kind.

319
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,235
You're learning
their language now?

320
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,529
If I want to spend more time with you,

321
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,656
I need to get to know them.

322
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,994
I am very beautiful.

323
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,183
Wait, what did I say?

324
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,417
You said, "I am very beautiful."

325
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,588
You...

326
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,093
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

327
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,565
I'm yours, Sersi,

328
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,734
if you'll have me.

329
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,322
I love you, Ikaris.

330
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,743
I love you, Sersi.

331
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,058
May the gods
hereby bond you in matrimony.

332
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,311
Congratulations.

333
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,395
Hello?

334
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,233
Ajak?

335
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,593
Ajak!

336
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,329
It was a Deviant.

337
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,131
Ourlove

338
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,634
<i>And our devotion</i>

339
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:56,306
<i>Were as deep as any ocean</i>

340
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,313
It was the last time I saw her.

341
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,027
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,

342
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,361
so I went to London.

343
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,282
Turned out, both of us were lonely

344
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,992
and we needed each other.

345
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,829
I guess, in her way,

346
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,999
Ajak never stopped
trying to take care of us.

347
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,884
Bye, Ajak.

348
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,931
It's the first time in 7,000 years

349
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,058
one of us has died.

350
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,144
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

351
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,104
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

352
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,981
Deviants have never
done that in the past.

353
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,192
It healed itself just like Ajak.

354
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,278
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

355
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,224
- Arishem.
- Sersi.

356
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,017
It is almost time.

357
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,105
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

358
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,148
What happened, Sersi?

359
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,779
The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

360
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,490
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

361
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,367
Did you talk with Arishem?

362
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,619
Yes. He said

363
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,955
it's almost time.

364
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,916
Can you try talking to him again?

365
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,252
I don't know how.

366
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,295
But she chose you to replace her.

367
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,214
And she gave you the sphere.

368
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,549
Hold on, Sprite.

369
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,616
Are you sure
you talked with Arishem?

370
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,053
What else would it be?

371
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,556
Mahd Wy'ry.

372
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,178
Where are the others?

373
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,346
We had to split up.

374
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,599
There were more Deviants
than you said.

375
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,526
Well, I'm sure
that was a lot of fun for you.

376
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,977
It was.

377
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,231
Once the others
kill these last Deviants,

378
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,234
we will have eliminated them
all from the planet.

379
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,295
Don't.

380
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,174
We don't interfere in their wars.

381
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,843
This isn't war.

382
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,803
It's genocide.

383
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,223
Their weapons have become too deadly.

384
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,309
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea

385
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,769
helping them advance, Phastos.

386
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,522
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

387
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,370
It's not exactly something
that I can stop.

388
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,360
No, you can't. But I can.

389
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,070
Stay strong.

390
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,155
It's too late.

391
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,866
- Thena?
- Everyone is going to die.

392
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,993
Are you okay?

393
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,412
Thena?

394
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,252
- Thena? Thena, no!
- Thena!

395
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,991
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

396
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,952
Listen to my voice.

397
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,330
You are safe.

398
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,042
You are loved.

399
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,713
You're our Thena.

400
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,220
Hey, Thena!

401
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,639
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

402
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,492
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

403
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,911
Sersi.

404
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,079
Thena, please.

405
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,707
Come back to us.

406
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,875
Okay.

407
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,810
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

408
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,899
There is no cure...

409
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,234
so no one really talks about it.

410
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,074
What happened?

411
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,283
Thena.

412
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,993
You attacked everyone.

413
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,788
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

414
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,915
you nearly killed Makkari.

415
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,252
I don't remember.

416
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,505
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

417
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,882
Your mind is fracturing

418
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,842
under the weight of your memories.

419
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,263
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

420
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,643
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

421
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,520
where we have the technology

422
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,687
to help you.

423
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,065
But she won't be Thena any more.

424
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,193
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

425
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,860
She could have killed all of us.

426
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,028
Please.

427
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,199
Please, I... I want to remember.

428
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,077
I want to remember my life.

429
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,204
Thena, I love you.

430
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,997
But listen to me.

431
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,751
It's not important
if you remember or not.

432
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,045
Your spirit will remain.

433
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,006
You will always be Thena deep inside.

434
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,466
Trust me.

435
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,884
Why should she trust you?

436
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,305
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

437
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,307
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

438
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,517
Upset?

439
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,396
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,

440
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,760
and look where you've gotten us.

441
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,068
I've watched humans
destroy each other

442
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,237
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

443
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,741
Do you know what that does
to someone after centuries?

444
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,120
Could our mission have been a mistake?

445
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,330
Are we really helping these people

446
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,124
build a better world, huh?

447
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,552
We're just like the soldiers down there.

448
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,555
Pawns to their leaders.

449
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,308
Blinded by loyalty.

450
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,062
It ends now.

451
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,789
Let them go.

452
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,500
You're gonna have to make me.

453
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,584
Stop.

454
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,675
If you wanna stop me,

455
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,845
you're gonna have to kill me.

456
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,371
I'll watch over Thena.

457
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,164
Let her keep her memories.

458
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,459
One day, when she attacks you,

459
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,128
you might have to kill her.

460
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,011
We'll take that chance.

461
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,981
You may all go.

462
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,151
The Deviants are gone.

463
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,989
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

464
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,740
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

465
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,701
We're a team,
we should stay together.

466
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,787
I didn't ask you for your advice,
Ikaris.

467
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,290
Do not forget your place.

468
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,753
This is where we say goodbye.

469
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,464
You are free to go.

470
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,010
I want you to go out there.

471
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,929
And live a life for yourselves.

472
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,848
Not as soldiers.

473
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,518
Not with the purpose you were given.

474
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,688
Find your own purpose.

475
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,735
And one day,
when we see each other again,

476
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,198
I want you to tell me what you found.

477
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,706
Come my way
<i>Nach, mera hero</i>

478
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,125
<i>Get the evil away</i>

479
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,418
<i>Nach, mera hero</i>

480
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,712
You came to save

481
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,130
<i>Nach, mera hero</i>

482
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,466
<i>And now you're here</i>

483
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,509
<i>Nach, mera hero, oh</i>

484
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,389
<i>Now you have come home</i>
<i>Give it all to me</i>

485
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:25,268
<i>You would risk it all</i>
<i>For the victory</i>

486
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,356
<i>Waiting for you</i>
<i>Scarcely can I</i>

487
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,976
Welcome.

488
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,979
I am Karun Patel.

489
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,356
Kingo's valet.

490
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,234
It's truly an honour
to be in the presence

491
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,568
of the great Eternals.

492
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,824
Like the fire
<i>Like the sun</i>

493
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,619
<i>You have risen, Mighty one</i>

494
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,588
Cut! Okay, everyone,

495
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,798
that was good.

496
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,717
But we could do 10% better.

497
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,969
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

498
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,887
Really, so good.

499
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,306
My friends
from college are here.

500
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,850
Hello, boss!

501
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,852
Perfect timing!

502
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,186
Welcome to the set of...

503
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,564
Legend of Ikaris

504
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,434
I'm playing you!

505
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,192
-You like the costume?
-We need to talk.

506
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,838
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

507
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,222
We need to talk to you in private.

508
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,781
Oh, Karun, he's worked
with me for 50 years.

509
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,074
I trust him completely.

510
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,660
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

511
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,508
and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

512
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,372
I have apologised so many times.

513
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,749
Not quite enough times.

514
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,269
Very close, though. I'll let you know.

515
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,770
Oh, I have to get ready
for the next scene.

516
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,295
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

517
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,773
You guys are gonna love
the next scene.

518
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,716
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

519
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,551
Wait, are we getting back together?

520
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,719
We need to talk.

521
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,072
I've been waiting for the day

522
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,240
the world learns the true identity

523
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,264
of the Shadow Warrior.

524
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,891
Ajak's dead.

525
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,355
She was killed.

526
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,649
It was a Deviant.

527
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,822
The Deviants are back.

528
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,449
We don't know how many there are.

529
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,913
You need to come with us.

530
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,298
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

531
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,868
We just started shooting this movie.

532
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,012
It's the first of a trilogy.

533
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,603
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

534
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,356
Sir,

535
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,733
-may I say something?
-Please don't say anything.

536
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,943
I think you should go.

537
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,350
I just said don't say anything.

538
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,740
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

539
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,535
Remember? It's your favourite line

540
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:33,206
<i>from The Shadow Warrior 2:</i>
<i>Voyage of Time.</i>

541
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,792
Your family needs you.

542
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,888
Seven thousand years.

543
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,600
That's how long
the battle between Eternals

544
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,394
<i>and Deviants has raged for.</i>

545
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,021
You think I'm a movie star.

546
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,024
<i>Well, I am. But I am also...</i>

547
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,527
<i>an Eternal.</i>

548
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,195
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

549
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,283
I think we should be
remembered, so...

550
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,620
I am making a documentary about us.

551
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,748
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

552
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,126
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

553
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,627
Oh, wait.

554
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,009
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

555
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,887
This is Sersi.

556
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,471
Sersi,

557
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,473
tell them about yourself.

558
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,643
<i>- Uh...</i>
- We're rolling.

559
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:36,728
<i>Well, uh...</i>

560
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,984
I can change a rock into water.

561
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,279
Uh, I could turn a rock into wood.

562
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,531
Or a rock into metal.

563
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,783
Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

564
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,910
Cut.

565
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,412
Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

566
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,122
and we'll get back to you, okay?

567
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,540
Let's go.

568
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,587
Sprite says
you're addicted to this thing.

569
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,882
Oh, this?

570
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,259
Look at this.

571
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,512
Whoa.

572
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,222
You know,
seeing as we don't age.

573
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,558
I think you look quite good.

574
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,144
Don't you?

575
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,192
Nobody ever wonders
how you managed

576
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,194
to be the leading man
for over 100 years?

577
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,042
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,239
That is my great-great-grandfather,

579
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,700
that is my great-grandfather,

580
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,868
grandfather,

581
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,079
father, and me.

582
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,956
I'm part of the greatest dynasty

583
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,248
in the history of Bollywood.

584
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,708
Pretty impressive, right?

585
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,919
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

586
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,132
Okay, I got sick
of moving every five years.

587
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,260
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

588
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,347
age.

589
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,058
I thought we were friends.

590
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,942
Do you know why I love movies?

591
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,403
Because of you.

592
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,196
I missed sitting in the audience,

593
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,364
listening to your stories,

594
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,782
watching your illusions.

595
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,789
We should've all stayed together.

596
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,876
Ajak would still be alive.

597
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,255
She should have never let us go.

598
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,851
This is the Deviant you fought
in London?

599
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:41,686
It's different.

600
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,522
There must be more out there
than we thought.

601
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:45,982
Oh.

602
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,067
Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

603
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,069
Yep.

604
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,904
It's a beautiful creature.

605
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,533
What? This? This? No. It's hideous.

606
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,327
You've never had one try
to bite your head off. Roll.

607
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,537
Oh.

608
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,017
You're about to meet
two of the greatest warriors

609
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,207
the world has ever known.

610
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,086
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

611
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,963
And her trusty friend...

612
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,214
Door.

613
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,967
...a mighty powerhouse of strength,

614
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,012
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

615
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,557
Gilgamesh!

616
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,145
<i>What took you so long?</i>

617
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,150
You look younger today,
Sprite.

618
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,794
I have the same apron.

619
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,528
Who the hell are you?

620
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,031
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

621
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,284
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in Batman.

622
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,120
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

623
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,873
No shit.
I could have used some help.

624
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,501
We were attacked
by a Deviant in London, too.

625
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,544
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

626
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,421
You couldn't?

627
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,590
I was distracted.

628
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,842
Sure, man.

629
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,553
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

630
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,432
I'm sorry, Gil.

631
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,476
Ajak's dead.

632
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,605
It's true, buddy.

633
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,440
We lost her.

634
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,598
Sersi.

635
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,893
The attack triggered her.

636
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,979
She's no fun to be around right now.

637
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,023
Hey, Thena.

638
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,317
Look who's here.

639
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,361
Give me your hand.

640
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,490
Thena.

641
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,326
Everyone in Centuri-6
is going to die.

642
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,078
Give me your hand.

643
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,455
It's too late. We can't save them.

644
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,499
Thena.

645
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,882
Thena.

646
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,302
We came to Earth
together on our ship.

647
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,306
You're an Eternal.

648
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,893
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

649
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,145
The legendary protector of Athens.

650
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,523
The goddess of war.

651
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,861
Remember who you are.

652
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,370
Remember.

653
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,222
-Thena.
-Hi.

654
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,182
Hello.

655
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,517
Hey, who's your gardener?

656
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,230
This is just what you guys
eat every day?

657
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,940
-Yeah, this is amazing.
-Every day.

658
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,192
-Thank you for this.
-Oh, you're welcome.

659
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,526
Help yourself.

660
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,863
This one is a trio of wine,
beer, and mead.

661
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,491
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

662
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,743
That's so thoughtful.

663
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,126
Should she be drinking?

664
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,798
No, hers is
non-alcoholic. For kids.

665
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,052
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

666
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,681
For kids.

667
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,393
I was just kidding.

668
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,854
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you

669
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,982
after we helped defeat
Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

670
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,568
What? Oh.

671
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:00,695
I'm a big baby.

672
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,738
Very mature. Can you stop?

673
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,949
- Stop.
- Speaking of Odin...

674
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,702
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

675
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,496
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

676
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,999
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

677
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,126
who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

678
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,295
I could lead them.

679
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,672
-I figure I'd be good at that.
-Yeah, you would.

680
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,049
Ajak didn't even choose you
to lead us.

681
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,635
- Whoa.
- Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

682
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,072
-Harsh.
-I'm gonna let that one slide

683
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,096
because, you know,

684
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,658
you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

685
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,034
Oh, so what, you can fly.

686
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,767
I'm better-looking,
everybody knows that.

687
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,615
Where you going?

688
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,605
I'm just gonna get some air.

689
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,821
Mmm. This is really good, Gil.

690
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,323
You know, I could sell this.

691
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,199
Put my face on it,
move some units.

692
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,826
I made it from corn.

693
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,621
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

694
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,638
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

695
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,766
Yeah, it's a planet.

696
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,310
She thinks she used to live there

697
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,312
until it was destroyed.

698
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,107
Always talks about massive
quakes ripping it apart.

699
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,193
Everyone died, including herself.

700
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,279
We had an unprecedented global
earthquake three days ago.

701
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,782
Oh, that's what that was.

702
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,700
I thought I was drunk.

703
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,661
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

704
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,956
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

705
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,000
I've tried so many times.

706
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,295
Maybe you're trying too hard.

707
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,840
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

708
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,389
Sersi.

709
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,349
Arishem.

710
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,810
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

711
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,396
We think it absorbed her power.

712
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,274
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

713
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:46,444
It is a side effect
of the emergence.

714
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,488
The emergence?

715
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,740
It is time for you to learn

716
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,410
the true purpose of your mission.

717
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,120
You were sent to Earth

718
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,915
to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

719
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:05,796
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

720
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,341
I plant Celestial seeds
into host planets

721
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,885
across the universe.

722
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:16,891
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

723
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,856
<i>In order to grow,</i>

724
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,609
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy</i>

725
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,860
<i>from intelligent life.</i>

726
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,364
<i>The Deviants prevented this</i>
<i>by consuming humans</i>

727
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,201
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

728
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:39,205
<i>Now, the human population of this planet</i>

729
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,749
<i>has reached the required amount.</i>

730
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,960
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

731
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,981
But...

732
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,026
everyone on Earth will die.

733
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,781
The end of one life, Sersi,

734
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,952
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

735
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:34,802
<i>Our universe is a constant</i>
<i>exchange of energy.</i>

736
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:39,848
<i>An infinite cycle of creation</i>
<i>and destruction.</i>

737
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,018
<i>Celestials use energy</i>

738
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,272
<i>gathered from host planets</i>
<i>to create suns,</i>

739
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,150
<i>generating gravity, heat, and light</i>

740
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,820
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

741
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,451
<i>Without us,</i>

742
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,788
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

743
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,418
All life will die.

744
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,379
Ajak knew the truth?

745
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,840
She has helped many Celestials

746
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,676
to emerge over millions of years.

747
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:16,969
So have you.

748
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,182
Earth was my first mission.

749
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,396
I was home, on Olympia.

750
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,150
There is no Olympia.

751
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,296
This is your true home, Sersi.

752
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,049
The World Forge.

753
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:02,139
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

754
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,094
Everything dies except us

755
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,430
because we were never alive.

756
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,436
Why don't I remember any of this?

757
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:03,033
Because your memories
are erased and reset

758
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,451
after each emergence.

759
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,121
They are stored here.

760
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,458
Why do you keep them?

761
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:15,546
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

762
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,258
I created the Deviants, Sersi,

763
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,344
for the same purpose I created you.

764
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:27,266
<i>Every Celestial host planet</i>
<i>has its own predators.</i>

765
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,106
<i>I first sent the Deviants</i>
<i>to exterminate them</i>

766
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,817
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

767
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,033
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

768
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,578
<i>They evolved.</i>

769
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,788
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

770
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,959
And I lost control of them.

771
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,047
I built and programmed you,
Eternals,

772
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:03,051
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution,

773
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,387
to correct my mistake.

774
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,810
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place

775
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,229
as the Prime Eternal.

776
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,565
Do not fail me.

777
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,795
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

778
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:41,256
And our past memories
are stored somewhere

779
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,634
in space?

780
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,178
And Arishem made the Deviants.

781
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,765
I'm sorry, Thena.

782
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,475
You tried to warn us.

783
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,603
The last time
Arishem reset your memories,

784
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,646
something must have gone wrong.

785
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,397
What do you mean?

786
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,901
Well, that's what
Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

787
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,778
All this time,
Thena was remembering

788
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,571
all the other planets we were sent to

789
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,824
and everyone dying
during the emergence.

790
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,742
I thought we were heroes.

791
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,744
Turns out we're the bad guys.

792
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,205
We're not the bad guys, okay?

793
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,706
We've helped the Celestials

794
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,250
expand life across the universe.

795
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,586
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

796
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:20,963
Every time innocent lives

797
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,687
have been sacrificed
for the greater good,

798
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,883
it turns out to be a mistake.

799
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,177
We have to stop the emergence.

800
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,973
Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

801
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,933
There has to be a way
Tiamut can emerge

802
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,177
without destroying the Earth.

803
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:38,313
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

804
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,316
Could Druig control its mind?

805
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,735
Maybe put it to sleep?

806
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,028
"Put it to sleep"?

807
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,613
Are you serious?

808
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,283
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

809
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,378
So I could take a vacation
to Fiji, you know?

810
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,121
We're talking about a Celestial, okay?

811
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,205
We have to try.

812
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,709
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

813
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,210
Right.

814
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,257
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

815
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,967
The world is ending.

816
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,594
You need to go home.

817
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,929
And do what?

818
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,181
Watch TV?

819
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,852
When I could be with the
Earth's original superheroes

820
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,438
as they try to save the world?

821
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,440
Fine.

822
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,151
If you want to, stay.

823
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,069
Thank you very much, sir.

824
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,989
Gilgamesh,

825
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,843
could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

826
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,303
I thought you like it, man.

827
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,328
We need to go. Now.

828
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,538
Find the others.

829
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,123
Once we're all together,

830
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,001
we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

831
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,867
Good afternoon.

832
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,620
It's very nice here, sir.

833
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,080
Don't be fooled.

834
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,291
Ignorance is bliss.

835
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,545
Hey. We're looking for Druig.

836
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,713
Is he here?

837
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,839
...Yes.

838
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,049
How do you know Druig?

839
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,009
We're friends...

840
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,345
...from college.

841
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,475
Hello, Sprite.

842
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,151
I missed all of you.

843
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:55,033
Please, make yourselves at home.

844
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,623
You've given me a lot of bad news

845
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,833
in one go, my lady.

846
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:04,751
Will you help us?

847
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,294
I am glad that...

848
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,886
Hey, what's your service?

849
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,430
I'm not getting any bars.

850
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:21,476
Do you all remember
this forest? Beautiful.

851
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,688
It was the last place
we all lived together.

852
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,109
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

853
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,279
from the outside world
and from themselves.

854
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,365
Your kind, my friend,
you will be responsible

855
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,159
for your own extinction one day.

856
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,244
Don't you think?

857
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,663
I think we must learn from our mistakes

858
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:42,873
and do better, sir.

859
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,916
You must not give up hope.

860
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,546
Oh, no, you didn't.

861
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:52,174
Okay, new rule, no more
possessing people's valets.

862
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,858
Oh, where is
your sense of humour, Kingo?

863
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:54,885
I'm sorry, sir.

864
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:57,262
Don't apologise, it's not your fault.

865
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,599
You are not a God.
You know that, right?

866
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,894
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

867
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,146
I've directed some things, too.

868
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,689
Oh, yeah? Like what?

869
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,900
Some Internet content.

870
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,651
How many views?

871
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,737
I don't do it for the views.

872
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,697
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

873
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,158
- We need him.
- Ikaris.

874
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,285
I missed you.

875
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,288
Are you gonna charm me
or threaten me?

876
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,499
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

877
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,459
It must be heartbreaking to find out

878
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,687
that you're not Mother's favourite.

879
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,855
And I'm sure she'd be real proud

880
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,690
-of what you've been up to.
-Druig, this is serious.

881
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,507
I'll tell you what's serious.

882
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,843
I've just been told I've been
sent on a suicide mission

883
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,386
for the past 7,000 years,

884
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,890
and that my entire existence is a lie.

885
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,770
So, excuse me for not giving a shit

886
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,396
about your plan right now.

887
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,694
Druig sucks.

888
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,196
He does, sir.

889
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,718
I don't like this place.

890
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,447
Druig needs to think,

891
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,347
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

892
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,474
-we wait.
-Mm.

893
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:29,437
I couldn't recognise myself
in Sprite's illusions.

894
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,732
Those were the good old days.

895
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,154
What if I can't fight any more?

896
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,240
-Of course you can.
-Mm.

897
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,951
What if I hurt you again?

898
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:48,540
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

899
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,796
Thank you.

900
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,507
For what?

901
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,554
-For always taking care of me.
-Oh.

902
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,640
I'd do it again.

903
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,437
On any planet.

904
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,041
I like watching him, too.

905
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,375
Jeez.

906
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,128
I don't think it's creepy at all.

907
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,758
Have you read Peter Pan?

908
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,053
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter,

909
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,429
Sersi is Wendy,

910
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,557
you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons,

911
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,144
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

912
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,104
What's your point?

913
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,107
Tinker Bell's always been
in love with Peter.

914
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,029
And it's hard for her

915
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:02,739
'cause she can never be with him.

916
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,160
I'm sorry, Sprite.

917
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,330
Kingo...

918
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,418
why did Arishem
make me this way?

919
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,964
I don't know.

920
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:27,889
I thought you broke it.

921
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,849
Always bring backups.

922
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,773
You have a very angry family, sir.

923
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,192
Yeah, it's a big issue.

924
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,278
<i>What about King Midas?</i>

925
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,631
<i>Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

926
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:43,655
<i>-Was that you?</i>
-Dane.

927
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,740
<i>-Confucius? Aristotle?</i>
-Call your uncle.

928
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,492
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

929
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,828
You've always wanted to make
amends with him, right?

930
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,372
Now is the time. Trust me.

931
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,260
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

932
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,710
Dane? Dane?

933
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,504
You're breaking up.

934
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,714
You're breaking up?

935
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,051
How did he take the news?

936
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:06,789
Couldn't bring myself to tell him

937
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,013
it was the end of the world.

938
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,432
There's nothing he could do.

939
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,599
Sersi.

940
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,688
I'm worried about you.

941
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,773
If Arishem finds out

942
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,650
you're trying to stop the emergence...

943
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,530
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

944
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,579
I'm not afraid.

945
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,249
This violent cycle has to end.

946
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,589
Hey, stop worrying about me.

947
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,008
Old habit.

948
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,267
Why did you leave?

949
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,187
I told myself

950
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,065
something must have happened to you.

951
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,233
So, I waited.

952
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,861
Days became years,

953
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,238
and you never came back.

954
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,700
Sersi,

955
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,286
oh, I've missed you.

956
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,957
I didn't want to leave.

957
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,314
There's something
I have to tell...

958
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,089
Ikaris!

959
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:25,924
Ikaris!

960
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,138
Miss?

961
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,516
You're ok?

962
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,559
Watch out!

963
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,978
Clear the camp!

964
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,690
Get behind me!

965
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,002
One of them took Ikaris.

966
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,193
It's an ambush!

967
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,162
Very nice, sir!

968
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,039
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

969
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,583
We need action sequences.

970
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,419
Sir!

971
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,796
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

972
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,926
How many cameras
did you bring, young man?

973
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,144
Kingo!

974
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:20,728
Come on!

975
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,653
This way!

976
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,988
Quickly! Come on!

977
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,870
Get in! Get in!

978
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,617
Ikaris!

979
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:35,011
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

980
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:39,307
No.

981
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,685
Terrible timing, Thena.

982
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,521
Thena!

983
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,280
Stop, Thena!

984
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:29,774
Druig!

985
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:30,900
Let them go.

986
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,527
Now is not the time, Sersi.

987
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,863
Please. I know
you're better than this.

988
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,292
Druig.
What's happening?

989
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,460
Go! Get to the river!

990
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,396
Gilgamesh.

991
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,773
A little help here?

992
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,066
Stay here.

993
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:13,735
Say it.

994
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:16,154
Stay here.

995
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,406
Good. You're okay.

996
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:31,628
They're headed for the camp.

997
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,504
Go. They need you.

998
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,089
Go, Ikaris.

999
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,183
Sprite, buy me some time!

1000
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,274
Whoa. Whoa!

1001
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,277
Can you hurry up?

1002
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,405
Now!

1003
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,161
Dishoom.

1004
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:16,714
Karun! Did you get that?

1005
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,633
I did, sir!

1006
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,420
-Kingo!
-Just go.

1007
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,046
I'm not leaving you.

1008
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:58,423
Sprite!

1009
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,083
Ikaris!

1010
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,128
Sersi! Are you all right?

1011
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,849
How did you do that?

1012
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,185
I don't know.

1013
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,367
Stop, stop, stop.

1014
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,245
Thena.

1015
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,373
No. Gilgamesh.

1016
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,166
Stay back.

1017
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,843
Ajak...

1018
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,846
Her memories...

1019
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,933
I understand now.

1020
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,353
I can see what she saw.

1021
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,648
So many planets.

1022
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,735
So much life destroyed

1023
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,030
every time a Celestial is born.

1024
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,616
Arishem used us

1025
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:16,245
and left us to die
with each emergence.

1026
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,039
We just wanted to survive.

1027
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,627
And then he sent you.

1028
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:25,588
I will kill you all

1029
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,090
for what you have done to my kind.

1030
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:31,052
You are not saviours, Eternals.

1031
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,262
You are murderers.

1032
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:37,892
Ikaris!

1033
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,325
Thena.

1034
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,579
Hey.

1035
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,083
Remember.

1036
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,842
No.

1037
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,012
No.

1038
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,892
I'll remember.

1039
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,602
I'll remember.

1040
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,544
I'll remember.

1041
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,755
When I left,

1042
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,799
I thought about taking over the minds

1043
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,135
of every human on this planet.

1044
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,306
Violence, fear, greed,

1045
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,016
all gone.

1046
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,350
Why didn't you?

1047
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:46,103
Because without their flaws,

1048
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,564
they wouldn't be human.

1049
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,570
Please, Druig.
You can't stay here any more.

1050
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:56,947
These Deviants are trying to keep us

1051
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,783
from killing their own kind.

1052
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,701
They have a conscience now.

1053
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:01,929
That makes them more dangerous.

1054
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,871
No, Sersi.

1055
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:07,374
That makes them us.

1056
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,044
Eternals and Deviants.

1057
01:24:11,254 --> 01:24:12,880
Arishem's children.

1058
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,008
But you are asking me to take control

1059
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,802
of a mind of a Celestial.

1060
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:21,222
I do not have that kind of power.

1061
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,099
We'll need Phastos.

1062
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,061
Well, good luck.

1063
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,815
He gave up on humans
a long time ago.

1064
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:04,765
I did this.

1065
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,019
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

1066
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,318
Druig was right.

1067
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,280
Our mission was a mistake.

1068
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,490
These people...

1069
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,535
they're not worth saving.

1070
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:26,537
Oh, Phastos.

1071
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,164
They're not worth saving.

1072
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,052
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

1073
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,596
- All right.
- Over here.

1074
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:44,889
And...

1075
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,075
Oh, that's great, man!

1076
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,183
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1077
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,392
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice.

1078
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,796
Good one.
All right, ready? Throw!

1079
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:51,770
Oh, so close.

1080
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,040
-Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
-Yeah, okay.

1081
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:55,024
-Watch this.
-Let me see. Let me see it.

1082
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,735
Dad. I'm only a starter.

1083
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:58,903
Hi.

1084
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,447
- Hello. Can we help you?
- Throw it again.

1085
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,700
Hey, Jack. Ben.

1086
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,871
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

1087
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:16,212
Uh, this is Sylvia
and, uh, Isaac. That's Isaac.

1088
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,714
- Isaac.
- Dad, that's Superman.

1089
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:19,965
Dad, that's Superman!

1090
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,235
Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

1091
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,301
No, no! He is Superman.

1092
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:23,571
That is definitely not Superman.

1093
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:24,762
I saw him on TV.

1094
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,514
He was in London, fighting a monster.

1095
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,683
And you were with a cape

1096
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,768
and you were shooting
laser beams out of your eyes.

1097
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,790
- I don't wear a cape.
- Oh, sorry.

1098
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,833
Okay, well, we should
just go inside, right?

1099
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,107
Can I call you Clark?

1100
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,502
Is that what you go by now?
Because, you know...

1101
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,152
You've called me worse.

1102
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,880
- You got it, Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

1103
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,989
- Way to go.
- Yes.

1104
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,676
All right.
Show me how it's done.

1105
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,285
Round and round and round
and round and round.

1106
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,750
- Yep, you got it. Keep going.
- Come on.

1107
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:05,177
Yeah.
Incredibly natural, guys.

1108
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,015
So, after all these years,

1109
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:12,268
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

1110
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:14,603
- No need to rub it in.
- Mm.

1111
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,315
It all makes sense
why she wouldn't let us interfere

1112
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,984
with human conflicts.

1113
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,194
Conflicts lead to war,

1114
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,738
and war actually leads to advancement

1115
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,949
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

1116
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,201
So our mission was never to

1117
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,121
make a peaceful or harmonious world,

1118
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:36,041
but to increase the population
at all costs.

1119
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:39,211
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

1120
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:40,379
That's bleak.

1121
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,191
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child

1122
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:43,855
that they could be dead
within a few days.

1123
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,051
Thought you'd given up on humans.

1124
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,762
I got lucky. Okay?

1125
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,058
I have a family now.

1126
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,561
They give me faith again.

1127
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,647
And I see the good
in humanity in them

1128
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,733
every single day.

1129
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,526
So, look, I cannot help you.

1130
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:03,963
-I am never leaving them.
-Phastos...

1131
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:05,070
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1132
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,678
It was wrong for me to use my powers

1133
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:08,050
without thinking about the consequences

1134
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,074
in the first place.

1135
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,702
So, now, I choose to use my hands

1136
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,620
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

1137
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,372
Do you?

1138
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,656
I don't use my powers any more.

1139
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:18,917
You sure?

1140
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,127
What are you...

1141
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:25,716
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1142
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,153
My child is right down the hallway!

1143
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,178
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

1144
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:30,448
-Oh, my God.
-I bet you've built

1145
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:31,555
the perfect safe house.

1146
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:32,806
What is this even made of?

1147
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,058
- Vibranium?
- Don't!

1148
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,064
Fall collection.

1149
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:41,482
IKEA.

1150
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:42,649
Ass.

1151
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,378
How did you even
deal with this guy

1152
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,527
for over 5,000 years?

1153
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,154
If you stay here, you might as well

1154
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:48,424
invite the Deviants to dinner.

1155
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,168
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

1156
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:51,492
He has a point.

1157
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,285
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up

1158
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:54,805
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1159
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,830
-I'm not gonna...
-You should go, habibi.

1160
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:58,916
You want me to go?

1161
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,167
You know what my mom

1162
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:01,919
would say to you right now,
right?

1163
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:06,048
Quit procrastinating, Phil,
and take care of your business.

1164
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:07,651
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1165
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,635
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

1166
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,595
I'm not happy about it,

1167
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,098
but if there's a chance for us to watch

1168
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,659
Jack grow up to live a life of his own,

1169
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,393
we should take it.

1170
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,902
<i>Why does my heart</i>
<i>Go on beating?</i>

1171
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:36,328
<i>Why do these eyes of mine cry?</i>

1172
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:44,503
<i>Don't they know</i>
<i>It's the end of the world?</i>

1173
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:50,968
<i>It ended when you said goodbye</i>

1174
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:56,140
<i>Why does my heart</i>
<i>Go on beating?</i>

1175
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:02,813
<i>Why do these eyes of mine cry?</i>

1176
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:12,531
<i>Don't they know</i>
<i>It's the end of the world?</i>

1177
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:19,455
<i>It ended when you said goodbye</i>

1178
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:47,483
The Domo.

1179
01:30:48,651 --> 01:30:50,152
Wow.

1180
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:03,081
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

1181
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,793
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

1182
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:07,961
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1183
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:09,648
<i>You know you're creeping us out.</i>
<i>You know that, right?</i>

1184
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:10,774
<i>Oh! Oh, God!</i>

1185
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,591
<i>Stay calm, T, please!</i>

1186
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:18,764
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

1187
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:20,766
<i>As you can see, being an Eternal</i>

1188
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,352
<i>does not preclude you</i>
<i>from having human emotions</i>

1189
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,312
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

1190
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,399
What has she done?

1191
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:33,237
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1192
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,783
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1193
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:39,660
None of us have seen her
for centuries.

1194
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:43,622
Ready to go home?

1195
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,791
Hmm.

1196
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,601
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1197
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,019
Excalibur.

1198
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,314
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1199
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,109
So you mean...

1200
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:16,488
I've been waiting for centuries
to go back to Olympia,

1201
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,282
and now you're telling me...

1202
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,200
...it doesn't exist?

1203
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,953
That, and the world is ending.

1204
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,415
At last my boredom is ending.

1205
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,376
Have you seen my movies?

1206
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:32,796
I don't have a DVD player.

1207
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,131
DVD?

1208
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,049
It's all about streaming now.

1209
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,135
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1210
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,345
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1211
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:42,180
You know, I just realised

1212
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:43,825
that if you don't know what an iPad is,

1213
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,059
there's almost no way
to explain it.

1214
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:54,610
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet,

1215
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:57,696
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1216
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:02,159
Miss me?

1217
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,055
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1218
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:06,140
-Is this new?
-Are you two...

1219
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,164
Because I hate it.

1220
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,415
Phastos,

1221
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:10,292
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1222
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,918
Okay, get ready for it.

1223
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:16,298
Bracelets?

1224
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:17,883
You made us bracelets?

1225
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,968
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1226
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,054
Celestials are the most powerful

1227
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,805
energy generators in the universe.

1228
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,349
When Arishem made us,

1229
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:27,225
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

1230
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,935
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1231
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,729
The bracelets, in theory,

1232
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:32,773
shut down our regeneration process.

1233
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,316
And once that happens,

1234
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,040
our bodies accumulate
extra cosmic energy.

1235
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:37,361
What for?

1236
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,322
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1237
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:44,159
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1238
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,828
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1239
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,955
one of us could become
immensely powerful,

1240
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,833
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1241
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,168
forming...

1242
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,090
a Uni-Mind.

1243
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:03,804
"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

1244
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,115
Oh, no,
we heard you the first time.

1245
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:06,819
- Terrible name.
- We'll brainstorm...

1246
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,100
"Brainstorm"!

1247
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,912
-That's a way better name!
-No, I invented it,

1248
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,038
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1249
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:15,440
So suppose Druig can,
say... put Tiamut to sleep--

1250
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:16,733
Then what?

1251
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:19,319
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1252
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,154
Are we building a big ship, too?

1253
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:22,322
Take a pair of each animal?

1254
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,842
Well, you know
what's never saved the planet?

1255
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:24,866
Your sarcasm.

1256
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:26,868
Space colonisation
could take decades.

1257
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,476
It can happen quickly with our help.

1258
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:30,997
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1259
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:33,291
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1260
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,918
not being created across the universe.

1261
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,378
Boss, am I right?

1262
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,798
Say something, Ikaris.

1263
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:41,633
You don't think
we should be doing this.

1264
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,767
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1265
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,104
Sersi should decide.

1266
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,525
Forget who Ajak chose.

1267
01:34:58,693 --> 01:34:59,693
You're the strongest.

1268
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,862
You should be making this decision.

1269
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:05,240
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1270
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:06,783
Sprite.

1271
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:17,169
Okay, this is not...

1272
01:35:17,336 --> 01:35:18,587
-Ikaris.
-Don't run after him.

1273
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:20,756
Kingo, I... You guys.

1274
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:23,633
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1275
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,821
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1276
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,179
I'm okay, Kingo.

1277
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:29,199
If you think we should
do this, I trust you.

1278
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,892
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1279
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:35,395
What did you say?

1280
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:38,106
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1281
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,943
I'm not who you think I am.

1282
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,776
How long do we have?

1283
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,778
Seven days.

1284
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,613
Good.

1285
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,992
We completed our mission.

1286
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,579
Where is she?

1287
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:35,747
London.

1288
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:38,166
She has a good life there.

1289
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,418
I'm sure she's missed you.

1290
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,711
If I'd gone back to her,

1291
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,922
I would only have told her the truth.

1292
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,384
She would've suffered

1293
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:50,053
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1294
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:51,388
Ikaris.

1295
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:54,099
We have to tell them the truth.

1296
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:55,684
What?

1297
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,602
-Why?
-Because together

1298
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,855
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1299
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:02,274
"Stop the emergence"?

1300
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,441
Listen...

1301
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:04,837
Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...

1302
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:05,861
Listen to me, Ikaris.

1303
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:08,655
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1304
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,449
And I have never doubted him.

1305
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,285
-Until now.
-Why now?

1306
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:15,620
Why now?

1307
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,669
Five years ago, Thanos erased

1308
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:25,130
half of the population of the universe.

1309
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:28,425
Delayed the emergence.

1310
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:32,429
But the people of this planet

1311
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,849
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1312
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:40,186
You know, after I let you all go,

1313
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:43,231
I travelled the world,
living among them.

1314
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,985
I have seen them fight and lie and kill,

1315
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:49,613
but I have also seen them

1316
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,198
laugh and love.

1317
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:56,369
I've seen them create and dream.

1318
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,665
This planet

1319
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,043
and these people...

1320
01:38:04,503 --> 01:38:06,171
have changed me.

1321
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:11,927
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1322
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:13,720
Not this time.

1323
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,265
I trust you, Ajak.

1324
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,188
I'll follow you to the end,

1325
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,191
as I always have.

1326
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,734
Thank you.

1327
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:31,321
We have to bring
everyone back together.

1328
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,284
There's something
I have to show you first.

1329
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,588
It's just up ahead.

1330
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,598
They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

1331
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,016
and broke free last week

1332
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:01,685
when the glacier started to melt

1333
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,479
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1334
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,108
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1335
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,568
I tracked them here.

1336
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:16,408
I suspected you might
have changed your mind.

1337
01:39:17,576 --> 01:39:19,577
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1338
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,373
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1339
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:24,624
When the others realise

1340
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:26,543
something is happening to the Earth,

1341
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,378
they'll come to you.

1342
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:30,422
When they find your body,

1343
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:31,965
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1344
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:35,051
It'll keep them busy
until the emergence.

1345
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:39,097
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1346
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:41,891
Kept your secret for centuries,

1347
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:44,978
lied to everyone I cared about,

1348
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,690
but never have I doubted my purpose

1349
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:49,774
to serve the Celestials.

1350
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:52,402
Oh, Ikaris.

1351
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,118
I've led you down the wrong path.

1352
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:02,328
It's the only path I know.

1353
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:58,046
Thought I'd find you here.

1354
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:00,965
I've thought about this place a lot.

1355
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,510
Amazing how things change over time.

1356
01:43:05,095 --> 01:43:07,222
Maybe we're the ones
who've changed.

1357
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:12,018
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1358
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:14,497
I've always thought of the Celestials

1359
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:16,147
like the ocean.

1360
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:21,486
They give life and they take life away
without bias.

1361
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:23,029
If they were gone,

1362
01:43:23,113 --> 01:43:24,614
this universe would eventually end.

1363
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:26,199
What you're trying to do

1364
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:27,677
is free humanity from the natural order.

1365
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,702
It's not natural to allow all life

1366
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,496
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1367
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,957
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1368
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:36,084
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1369
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:37,877
It'll all end soon.

1370
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,880
Except there is no end, is there?

1371
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:43,633
We'd carry on without our memories

1372
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:45,343
or free will

1373
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:47,095
for eternity.

1374
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,185
You're afraid.

1375
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:57,230
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1376
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,899
I only wish that when we do,

1377
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:03,736
I would be able to remember you.

1378
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:08,283
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1379
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:11,619
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1380
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:18,876
Ikaris.

1381
01:44:43,736 --> 01:44:45,028
Sersi?

1382
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:51,200
It's started.

1383
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:55,580
Oh, no. My God.

1384
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:57,165
What about the Uni-Mind?

1385
01:44:57,624 --> 01:44:58,977
I haven't figured out a way

1386
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,585
to connect us, but I'm close.

1387
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:02,355
- I'm very, very close.
- How much longer?

1388
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:04,380
I don't know, Sersi!

1389
01:45:07,593 --> 01:45:08,926
Find the point of emergence.

1390
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:35,370
You always knew
the end was coming.

1391
01:45:35,537 --> 01:45:38,164
It must be a relief.

1392
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,333
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1393
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:43,586
Revenge won't bring peace
for you, Thena.

1394
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,297
But killing it might.

1395
01:45:59,395 --> 01:46:00,812
Ikaris?

1396
01:46:02,231 --> 01:46:03,689
What are you doing?

1397
01:46:09,655 --> 01:46:12,281
I wanted you to leave
this world in peace.

1398
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:16,035
Without knowing
about the emergence.

1399
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:17,995
But I failed.

1400
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:23,543
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1401
01:46:30,759 --> 01:46:32,093
I'm close to figuring it out.

1402
01:46:36,598 --> 01:46:37,890
Boss, what are you doing?

1403
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:39,618
I've let this go on
long enough.

1404
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:41,644
Don't hurt him!

1405
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:44,355
He lied to us.

1406
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:46,983
He already knew about the emergence.

1407
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:49,026
No, he didn't.

1408
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,904
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1409
01:46:53,282 --> 01:46:54,282
What?

1410
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:57,618
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1411
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:58,786
No.

1412
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,748
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1413
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,750
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,

1414
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:06,377
why did she choose me?

1415
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,592
What have you done?

1416
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,553
He killed her.

1417
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:19,307
I had to.

1418
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:22,602
She loved you.

1419
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:27,064
- Did she?
- She loved you.

1420
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,777
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1421
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:34,780
To know that one day all this would end?

1422
01:47:36,909 --> 01:47:39,243
To keep on lying to you?

1423
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,914
If we gave humanity the choice,

1424
01:47:42,998 --> 01:47:45,374
how many of them would be willing to die

1425
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:48,085
so that billions more could be born?

1426
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:50,630
We're not giving them a choice.

1427
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:54,008
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1428
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,429
You are so pathetic!

1429
01:47:58,847 --> 01:48:01,140
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1430
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:04,810
I exist for Arishem.

1431
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:06,229
As do you.

1432
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:07,730
It's who you are.

1433
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:11,025
I wouldn't change a single thing

1434
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:12,568
about who I am.

1435
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:14,695
Born or made.

1436
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:17,323
But I do not exist for Arishem,

1437
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:19,367
I exist for my family!

1438
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:21,953
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1439
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:24,974
I found Tiamut.

1440
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:26,207
- No!
- Makkari!

1441
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,002
Get out of here!

1442
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:34,423
Kingo.

1443
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:44,934
You do not turn against your family.

1444
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:48,229
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1445
01:48:50,148 --> 01:48:51,628
You won't succeed against me.

1446
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,194
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1447
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,036
Wait.

1448
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:06,038
I'm going with you.

1449
01:49:06,206 --> 01:49:07,248
Sprite...

1450
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,084
What is this?

1451
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:25,766
Why did Sprite go with Ikaris?

1452
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:29,437
Because she loves him.

1453
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:33,691
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1454
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,028
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1455
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:39,196
Karun, let's go.

1456
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,092
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1457
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:43,034
I can't help you guys.

1458
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:45,661
I still think Ikaris is right.

1459
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:48,331
So, that's it, huh?
Just gonna follow him?

1460
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:51,667
I love the people of this planet.

1461
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:54,420
But if you stop this emergence,

1462
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:56,964
you are preventing so many
other worlds like this one

1463
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,716
from being created.

1464
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,260
I still have faith in Arishem.

1465
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,889
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1466
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:10,803
We need you.

1467
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:13,439
Even with my help, we're no match.

1468
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:15,858
It's Ikaris.

1469
01:50:19,237 --> 01:50:20,237
But...

1470
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:22,907
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1471
01:50:27,204 --> 01:50:29,789
Thank you for all you've done...

1472
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:33,125
...for humanity.

1473
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:36,879
It's been a great honour.

1474
01:50:39,216 --> 01:50:41,425
I will miss you all.

1475
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:51,519
Look,

1476
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:55,231
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris,

1477
01:50:56,024 --> 01:50:57,900
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1478
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,828
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

1479
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:01,545
are not enough to kill a Celestial,
so...

1480
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,198
Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

1481
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:06,283
I'm sorry, what?

1482
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,035
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1483
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:10,473
You've never been able to do it before.

1484
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:11,914
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1485
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:14,500
And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

1486
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:17,211
Well, now is the time
to try, don't you think?

1487
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:19,338
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1488
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:22,717
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1489
01:51:22,884 --> 01:51:24,260
I can't kill a Celestial.

1490
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,053
Sersi. Sersi.

1491
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:27,596
We can't!

1492
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:34,687
We can't.

1493
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:36,397
It's okay, Sersi.

1494
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:39,108
I got this.

1495
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:56,917
There's no time for that.

1496
01:51:58,086 --> 01:52:00,796
I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

1497
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:04,967
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1498
01:52:06,511 --> 01:52:08,053
I asked Gilgamesh once

1499
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,890
why he chose to protect me.

1500
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:12,725
He said,

1501
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:16,520
"When you love something,
you protect it.

1502
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:21,859
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1503
01:52:24,529 --> 01:52:29,074
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1504
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:35,873
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1505
01:52:38,376 --> 01:52:39,668
Sersi.

1506
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:43,255
Get up.

1507
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:53,641
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1508
01:52:58,605 --> 01:52:59,855
Sersi!

1509
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:01,357
Sersi!

1510
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,108
Oh, Sersi. We need you!

1511
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:04,819
I already gave that speech.

1512
01:53:04,986 --> 01:53:06,028
What?

1513
01:53:06,196 --> 01:53:07,446
You did... What...

1514
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:10,616
Sersi, the sphere inside of you,

1515
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:12,428
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1516
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:15,579
Maybe I can repurpose it

1517
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:17,998
and create a connection between, uh,

1518
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,500
well, all of us.

1519
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,253
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1520
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:24,088
-Great.
-Yeah.

1521
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,006
But, um...

1522
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:28,926
I have to take it out of you.

1523
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:33,055
Okay.

1524
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:35,641
Do it.

1525
01:53:37,269 --> 01:53:38,394
Okay.

1526
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:47,987
Don't kill her.

1527
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:49,363
Thena...

1528
01:53:50,615 --> 01:53:51,935
Do it.

1529
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:06,589
Will it work?

1530
01:54:11,303 --> 01:54:12,720
It has to.

1531
01:55:04,564 --> 01:55:06,357
I'm glad you're here.

1532
01:55:10,528 --> 01:55:12,112
Thank you, Sprite.

1533
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:28,796
Protect the emergence.

1534
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:30,714
You're really gonna kill them?

1535
01:55:38,556 --> 01:55:40,099
Where's Druig?

1536
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:41,850
He's busy.

1537
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:44,103
Thena, play nice.

1538
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:49,274
You've never had to fight me.

1539
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:50,567
But I've always wanted to.

1540
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:01,203
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1541
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:10,522
I should've done this
five centuries ago.

1542
01:57:57,779 --> 01:57:59,279
Druig's gone.

1543
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:01,573
It's over.

1544
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:09,892
Phastos.

1545
01:59:14,314 --> 01:59:16,106
I have to try and stop this.

1546
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:17,983
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1547
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:20,110
-Keep Ikaris busy.
-We've got you.

1548
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:21,278
Go.

1549
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:30,871
Enough.

1550
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:02,444
Thena, stop!

1551
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,936
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1552
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,493
We can't
let it absorb our powers.

1553
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:40,649
Too late.

1554
02:00:42,277 --> 02:00:44,903
Thena, he's trying
to goad you. Don't...

1555
02:01:00,795 --> 02:01:02,129
Makkari!

1556
02:01:10,972 --> 02:01:12,180
Where's Sersi?

1557
02:01:12,557 --> 02:01:14,725
You always did
underestimate her.

1558
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:17,436
Oh, no.

1559
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:19,896
Not so fast.

1560
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:25,694
Boss.

1561
02:01:29,866 --> 02:01:30,866
I don't know about you,

1562
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:32,743
but this is really satisfying, right?

1563
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:35,245
Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

1564
02:01:35,413 --> 02:01:36,705
I don't think so.

1565
02:01:37,123 --> 02:01:38,434
I've been wanting to clip your wings

1566
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:40,584
for a long time, Ikaris!

1567
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:54,890
Thena.

1568
02:01:57,602 --> 02:02:00,520
Oh, you've changed.

1569
02:02:01,898 --> 02:02:03,523
You're broken.

1570
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:05,817
Damaged.

1571
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:08,236
Useless.

1572
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:14,326
You can't protect any of them.

1573
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:29,800
Sersi.

1574
02:02:34,555 --> 02:02:37,474
You're not powerful enough
to do this.

1575
02:02:37,642 --> 02:02:39,559
And you won't.

1576
02:02:39,977 --> 02:02:41,728
You're not a killer.

1577
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:43,480
Maybe I've changed.

1578
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,400
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1579
02:02:46,567 --> 02:02:49,194
Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

1580
02:02:57,995 --> 02:02:59,788
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1581
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:14,469
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1582
02:03:16,556 --> 02:03:18,598
'Cause you get to live
as one of them.

1583
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,225
And I never could.

1584
02:03:21,477 --> 02:03:23,728
You know why I hated
living with humans?

1585
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:25,666
Because they reminded me of things

1586
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:27,107
I didn't even know I wanted.

1587
02:03:27,608 --> 02:03:29,025
Because of them, now I wanna know

1588
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:30,944
what it feels like to grow up.

1589
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,780
To fall in love.

1590
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:36,199
To have a family.

1591
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:41,163
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

1592
02:03:48,337 --> 02:03:49,463
It's all over now.

1593
02:03:50,298 --> 02:03:52,632
We get to start over somewhere new.

1594
02:03:56,554 --> 02:03:58,180
Well, that was very moving.

1595
02:03:58,347 --> 02:03:59,598
Druig.

1596
02:04:05,313 --> 02:04:06,855
I can't do this.

1597
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:12,360
This is your fight now.

1598
02:04:56,906 --> 02:04:58,114
Thena.

1599
02:04:59,492 --> 02:05:00,742
It's me.

1600
02:05:01,327 --> 02:05:02,494
Gilgamesh.

1601
02:05:03,913 --> 02:05:04,955
Look at me.

1602
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:07,290
Gilgamesh?

1603
02:05:07,458 --> 02:05:09,000
Stay here.

1604
02:05:11,712 --> 02:05:12,963
Say it.

1605
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:15,173
Stay here.

1606
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,759
You'll be okay.

1607
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:21,638
Give me your hand.

1608
02:05:34,902 --> 02:05:36,111
Ah, it's a shame.

1609
02:05:38,155 --> 02:05:39,781
You and I,

1610
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,284
we're just tools of a god.

1611
02:05:43,661 --> 02:05:46,871
Built to kill.

1612
02:05:49,709 --> 02:05:50,959
Thena.

1613
02:05:54,422 --> 02:05:55,797
Remember.

1614
02:06:26,245 --> 02:06:27,829
I remember.

1615
02:07:57,253 --> 02:07:58,712
Come on, Sersi.

1616
02:07:59,755 --> 02:08:00,839
Come on.

1617
02:10:10,094 --> 02:10:11,845
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1618
02:12:40,828 --> 02:12:42,370
I'm sorry.

1619
02:12:44,081 --> 02:12:45,540
I know.

1620
02:14:01,241 --> 02:14:02,283
How?

1621
02:14:02,743 --> 02:14:04,118
How did you do it?

1622
02:14:05,245 --> 02:14:08,498
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1623
02:14:08,916 --> 02:14:11,292
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1624
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,794
I always wondered how we survived

1625
02:14:12,961 --> 02:14:15,630
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

1626
02:14:16,006 --> 02:14:18,508
By being connected to
the Celestial as it emerged.

1627
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:34,023
We became one...

1628
02:14:36,193 --> 02:14:38,945
...even Ikaris and Sprite

1629
02:14:39,822 --> 02:14:45,159
all because of Tiamut.

1630
02:15:22,156 --> 02:15:23,364
Is he gone?

1631
02:15:33,041 --> 02:15:34,292
Sprite.

1632
02:15:36,795 --> 02:15:39,380
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1633
02:15:40,465 --> 02:15:42,633
I think I can make you human.

1634
02:15:44,011 --> 02:15:46,929
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1635
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:49,932
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1636
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:51,142
Are you ready for that?

1637
02:15:53,562 --> 02:15:54,979
I am.

1638
02:16:32,726 --> 02:16:33,870
<i>The sudden appearance</i>

1639
02:16:33,894 --> 02:16:36,062
<i>of an enormous stone figure</i>
<i>in the Indian Ocean</i>

1640
02:16:36,188 --> 02:16:39,482
<i>has left more questions</i>
<i>than answers for authorities.</i>

1641
02:16:39,858 --> 02:16:41,734
<i>US and Australian naval ships</i>

1642
02:16:41,818 --> 02:16:43,361
<i>are maintaining defensive positions,</i>

1643
02:16:43,528 --> 02:16:44,528
<i>but at this...</i>

1644
02:16:44,696 --> 02:16:46,572
You guys did that?

1645
02:16:47,366 --> 02:16:49,659
I love you so much.

1646
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:58,334
Are you okay?

1647
02:16:59,253 --> 02:17:01,254
I get confused sometimes.

1648
02:17:01,463 --> 02:17:03,506
Yeah. Me, too.

1649
02:17:06,093 --> 02:17:08,386
So, Dad said
you're the goddess Athena.

1650
02:17:08,553 --> 02:17:10,638
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1651
02:17:11,807 --> 02:17:13,057
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1652
02:17:13,517 --> 02:17:15,351
What's your superpower?

1653
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:21,482
Um, can you just...
Look... One second.

1654
02:17:22,234 --> 02:17:23,859
Okay. All right.

1655
02:17:24,403 --> 02:17:26,112
See, that thing is... Okay.

1656
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,924
Almost gave you a shave
and a haircut, didn't she?

1657
02:17:27,948 --> 02:17:29,407
Stand behind me, actually.

1658
02:17:29,616 --> 02:17:30,825
Um, you remember earmuffs?

1659
02:17:30,909 --> 02:17:33,494
Remember how we practised earmuffs?
Thank you so much.

1660
02:17:35,664 --> 02:17:37,290
You know that
your babysitting privileges

1661
02:17:37,374 --> 02:17:38,518
are completely revoked, right?

1662
02:17:38,542 --> 02:17:39,583
Like, it's done.

1663
02:17:40,085 --> 02:17:41,961
Thank you.
Violence... Hey.

1664
02:17:42,129 --> 02:17:43,879
Violence is never the answer.

1665
02:17:43,964 --> 02:17:44,964
- Right, T?
- Hmm.

1666
02:17:45,132 --> 02:17:47,758
You gotta always use
your brain, hmm?

1667
02:17:47,926 --> 02:17:49,635
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1668
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:51,053
Your dad

1669
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:52,763
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy

1670
02:17:52,889 --> 02:17:54,098
and he had no choice but to

1671
02:17:54,182 --> 02:17:55,342
listen to me, so no violence.

1672
02:17:55,392 --> 02:17:56,792
The kid is ten...

1673
02:17:57,227 --> 02:17:58,686
...not stupid!

1674
02:17:59,313 --> 02:18:00,957
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

1675
02:18:00,981 --> 02:18:02,857
That's happening soon, right?

1676
02:18:03,025 --> 02:18:04,294
Ah, yes, there's Druig.

1677
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:05,860
- Don't go anywhere near him.
- Oh!

1678
02:18:06,403 --> 02:18:07,528
Yeah!

1679
02:18:09,948 --> 02:18:11,426
Okay,
that's far enough, Jack.

1680
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:13,784
Wow, Dad,
the Domo's so cool.

1681
02:18:13,952 --> 02:18:15,722
Your dad fixed that
with his bare hands.

1682
02:18:15,746 --> 02:18:17,330
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1683
02:18:17,497 --> 02:18:19,999
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1684
02:18:20,876 --> 02:18:22,293
Hey, Phastos.

1685
02:18:23,128 --> 02:18:24,503
Take care.

1686
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:26,464
This world is lucky to have you.

1687
02:18:27,299 --> 02:18:28,924
Thank you.

1688
02:18:29,092 --> 02:18:30,760
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1689
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:36,474
Okay.

1690
02:18:37,934 --> 02:18:42,021
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

1691
02:18:42,189 --> 02:18:45,191
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

1692
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:51,072
...because the truth will set them free.

1693
02:19:03,126 --> 02:19:04,835
Told you that thing
was addictive.

1694
02:19:06,004 --> 02:19:07,046
Please visit?

1695
02:19:07,672 --> 02:19:08,881
I'll try.

1696
02:19:09,466 --> 02:19:10,800
When I get time off from school.

1697
02:19:10,967 --> 02:19:12,445
Oh, wow. Listen,
it's gonna be good for you

1698
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:13,636
to be in a human environment.

1699
02:19:13,804 --> 02:19:15,596
You'll pick up some social skills.

1700
02:19:16,139 --> 02:19:17,659
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1701
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:20,851
That explains so much.

1702
02:19:30,570 --> 02:19:32,113
Gonna miss you.

1703
02:19:32,656 --> 02:19:33,864
Me, too.

1704
02:19:37,536 --> 02:19:38,661
Madam.

1705
02:19:39,121 --> 02:19:40,413
Thanks, Karun.

1706
02:19:40,997 --> 02:19:43,457
Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

1707
02:19:45,085 --> 02:19:46,168
Killing Tiamut.

1708
02:19:46,336 --> 02:19:48,087
It's too late for that.

1709
02:19:48,296 --> 02:19:50,256
But you followed your heart.

1710
02:19:50,424 --> 02:19:51,882
We all did.

1711
02:19:54,094 --> 02:19:55,094
Even Ikaris.

1712
02:20:02,644 --> 02:20:04,603
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1713
02:20:05,772 --> 02:20:07,898
He's a lot cuter in person.

1714
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:11,402
So, after all that,

1715
02:20:11,486 --> 02:20:13,529
you still can't change me
into a giraffe?

1716
02:20:14,197 --> 02:20:17,867
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial

1717
02:20:18,034 --> 02:20:20,244
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1718
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:23,205
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1719
02:20:27,169 --> 02:20:28,586
What'll you do now?

1720
02:20:28,753 --> 02:20:30,045
Not sure.

1721
02:20:30,213 --> 02:20:32,214
This planet's my home, but...

1722
02:20:33,967 --> 02:20:36,677
I can't pretend to be human any more.

1723
02:20:43,226 --> 02:20:44,810
I love you, Sersi.

1724
02:20:46,354 --> 02:20:47,438
I don't care what you are.

1725
02:21:01,244 --> 02:21:03,871
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1726
02:21:04,039 --> 02:21:07,041
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1727
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:08,792
Actually,

1728
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:11,253
I have one I want to tell you.

1729
02:21:12,339 --> 02:21:15,299
What is it?

1730
02:21:15,842 --> 02:21:18,344
It turns out my family history is...

1731
02:21:19,262 --> 02:21:20,846
complicated.

1732
02:21:24,226 --> 02:21:25,601
Sersi?

1733
02:21:26,394 --> 02:21:27,895
Sersi, what's wrong?

1734
02:21:29,356 --> 02:21:30,689
Sersi?

1735
02:21:54,548 --> 02:21:55,923
Sersi?

1736
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,050
Sersi?

1737
02:21:58,927 --> 02:22:01,095
Sersi!

1738
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:19,238
You have chosen
to sacrifice a Celestial

1739
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:22,032
for the people of this planet.

1740
02:22:23,326 --> 02:22:25,119
I will spare them,

1741
02:22:25,287 --> 02:22:29,999
but your memories will show
if they are worthy to live.

1742
02:22:31,501 --> 02:22:35,713
And I will return for judgement.

1743
02:22:51,062 --> 02:22:53,105
You all right, Ted?

1744
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,692
Did you see that?

1745
02:25:56,206 --> 02:25:58,248
It's been weeks.

1746
02:25:58,416 --> 02:26:01,210
We haven't heard from any of them.

1747
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,378
It's like...

1748
02:26:03,546 --> 02:26:04,588
they've disappeared.

1749
02:26:06,299 --> 02:26:07,633
Arishem.

1750
02:26:09,886 --> 02:26:11,595
We have to go back.

1751
02:26:21,147 --> 02:26:22,467
I feel it, too.

1752
02:26:24,526 --> 02:26:25,859
What?

1753
02:26:38,748 --> 02:26:39,832
Wow.

1754
02:26:40,041 --> 02:26:43,335
Aah! My ears. My eyes are numb.

1755
02:26:43,503 --> 02:26:46,338
No more drunk teleporting for you.

1756
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:47,548
Um...

1757
02:26:47,674 --> 02:26:48,841
Hang on, hang on.

1758
02:26:54,722 --> 02:26:56,139
Behold,

1759
02:26:56,808 --> 02:26:59,393
the royal prince of Titan,

1760
02:26:59,561 --> 02:27:02,771
brother of Thanos,
the Knave of Hearts,

1761
02:27:02,939 --> 02:27:04,106
defeater...

1762
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:05,334
Thanos' brother?

1763
02:27:05,358 --> 02:27:07,317
-...of Black Robert...
-Roger.

1764
02:27:07,735 --> 02:27:09,152
Oh.

1765
02:27:09,237 --> 02:27:11,697
Defeater of Black Roger.

1766
02:27:12,323 --> 02:27:13,615
The great adventurer,

1767
02:27:14,158 --> 02:27:18,078
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

1768
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:20,873
What a pleasure
to make your acquaintance,

1769
02:27:21,416 --> 02:27:23,292
my fellow Eternals.

1770
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:25,479
You know, you really don't have to

1771
02:27:25,503 --> 02:27:26,703
do the whole thing every time.

1772
02:27:26,838 --> 02:27:28,118
Everything you do is impressive.

1773
02:27:28,214 --> 02:27:29,275
What am I gonna leave off the list?

1774
02:27:29,299 --> 02:27:31,019
- No, I know it's impressive.
- Who are you?

1775
02:27:32,719 --> 02:27:33,844
I'm Eros.

1776
02:27:34,345 --> 02:27:35,387
This is Pip.

1777
02:27:35,805 --> 02:27:38,974
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

1778
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:40,601
What do you want, lads?

1779
02:27:40,685 --> 02:27:42,352
Pip and I are here to help, aren't we?

1780
02:27:47,817 --> 02:27:49,902
Your friends are in big trouble.

1781
02:27:51,571 --> 02:27:53,655
And we know where to find them.

1782
02:34:44,984 --> 02:34:46,443
You can do this.

1783
02:34:47,069 --> 02:34:49,529
You can do this.

1784
02:35:09,967 --> 02:35:11,551
Death is my reward.

1785
02:35:13,804 --> 02:35:15,305
I'm sorry.

1786
02:35:17,475 --> 02:35:19,100
I have to try.

1787
02:35:33,199 --> 02:35:35,784
Sure you're ready
for that, Mr Whitman?

1788
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:38,808
