1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,360
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,086
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,641
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,730
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,807
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,322
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,130
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was,</i>

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,049
<i>only to find things weren't
as I left them.</i>

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,323
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,927
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,963
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,445
BARRY: <i>Previously on</i>
The Flash...

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,806
JESSE: <i>I got hit with the dark matter.</i>

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,365
That must've affected me somehow.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,641
We're going home.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,571
I went back in time
and created an alternate timeline.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,761
- THE FLASH: <i>Wally?</i>

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,887
Wally? Can you hear me?

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,811
My name is Edward Clariss.
Rivals should know each other's names.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,729
BARRY: <i>When I came back,
things weren't the same.</i>

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,921
JULIAN: I don't trust you.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,168
And I don't like things
that I don't trust.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,283
You'll always be Barry.
And I'll always be Iris.

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,766
<i>And we always find each other.</i>

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,567
- Who are you?
- I am Alchemy.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,445
- Alchemy?
- ALCHEMY: You failed, Clariss.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,560
BARRY: <i>Remember that feeling you got as a kid</i>

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,847
<i>when you were so excited about something</i>

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,804
<i>that you couldn't focus on anything else?</i>

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>That's me right now.</i>

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,444
<i>Thinking about,
well, what I always think about.</i>

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,647
Allen! Enough with the knee.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,127
- Uh, where are you going?
- I'm going on a date.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,526
Well, not yet you're not.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,806
You know,
you're not actually my boss, Julian.

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,964
Well, I am the senior lab tech.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,727
And the last time I checked,
the hours were 10:00 a.m. till 7:00 p.m.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,569
Not 6:58, not 6:59, but...

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,924
BARRY: <i>Remember that other feeling you got</i>

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,442
<i>when that thing you were excited about
seemed to take forever to arrive?</i>

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,563
<i>Imagine being a speedster.</i>

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,801
<i>Days seem like weeks.</i>

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,129
<i>Hours seem like days.
And seconds seem like...</i>

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,566
<i>You get the point.</i>

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,161
7:00.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,001
I'll see you tomorrow.

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,967
It's too much? Yeah, it's too much.
It's the heart, right?

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,083
It's too cheesy. All right, hold on.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,970
Is that better? That's... It's worse?

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,361
We'll go back to the heart.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,721
No, Barr, wait. Wait, wait.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,083
It is so beautiful. And you are so sweet.

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,568
But tonight, I wanna be with you.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,370
Barry Allen, not the Flash.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,810
- So...
- So no Flash talk, no speed.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,167
No problem. All right.

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,246
Starting now,
the Flash is officially off-limits.

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,847
So... Wow.

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,530
Um...

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,605
Where are we going?

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,450
It's a surprise.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,730
Are you planning on donating
a kidney sometime in the near future or...

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,285
"A kidney?"

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,290
This place is...

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,447
Don't look at the prices.
Just get whatever you want.

66
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,606
So...

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,083
Um, yeah, so...

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,441
How was work?

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,929
Um, yeah, super busy.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,606
How about you?

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,880
Uh, well, Julian had me write up
a carbon dating report,

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,203
then a DNA sequencing report.

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,243
A couple of chemical compound reports,

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,842
so he pretty much just gives me
all the work he doesn't wanna do, so...

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,247
- Yeah, I know. It's really boring.
- No, no. I'm so sorry, Barry.

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,363
I'm just... It's been a really long day.

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,443
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,367
Uh, what's going on?

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,649
Apparently, a robbery's in progress
across the street. Excuse me.

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,126
Go. Go, go.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,370
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. Use your speed. Go.

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,721
Okay.

83
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,123
Um, where were we?

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,810
Um...

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,245
It's Cisco.

86
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,811
We should go.

87
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,607
Yeah.

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,891
- BARRY: What's going on?
- That.

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,969
- Yeah, Why'd you open a breach?
- I didn't.

90
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,083
- What?
- That's why we called you.

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,247
Well, can you close it?

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,482
Once again,
wouldn't have called if I could.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,965
All right. Somebody's coming through.

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,531
Get back.

95
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,041
Allen.

96
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,641
Wells.

97
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,411
I need your help.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,726
With what?

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,889
- HARRISON: <i>With that.</i>
- Hey, guys.

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,242
Jesse. You're a speedster.

101
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,883
Yeah. It's pretty cool, right?

102
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,687
<i>I mean, yeah. I would say so.</i>

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,245
CAITLIN: <i>When did this happen?</i>

104
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,567
A few days ago.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,363
So when I got Allen his speed back,

106
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,726
Wally and Jesse were hit
with the dark matter.

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,922
Turns out she was affected.
She was totally affected.

108
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,930
But I didn't get speed,
so could it have been from something else?

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,487
No. I mean, I doubt it.

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
Dark matter affects different people
in different ways at different times.

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,050
Sometimes not at all.
So be thankful, but she was affected,

112
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,282
and I wanna run some tests
and find out just how much.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,289
Well, then you've come to the right place.

114
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,845
Let's go to the Speed Lab.

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,206
- "Speed Lab?"
- "Speed Lab?"

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,050
This is insane.

117
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,927
CISCO: <i>Something tells me
you've never been in this room before.</i>

118
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,121
Nope.

119
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,886
Wait, you've, you... Allen.

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,608
I suppose that means
you traveled back in time again.

121
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,961
Yeah, but I...

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,321
How many times did I tell you
not to do that?

123
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,010
Oh, you figured that out
pretty quickly, Harry.

124
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,807
Yes, Miss West, it was easy
because we've never been here either.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,001
Nope.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,844
Right. Other Earth, other timeline.

127
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,924
Yes. Exactly. So when did you do it?
After we returned to Earth-2?

128
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,887
Look, Harry, I...
Only a couple of things are different.

129
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,804
Oh, I'm sure. Not.

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,089
Really? You guys are doing "not"
on Earth-2 now?

131
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,164
Uh, no. That's all him.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,803
Okay. Let's just get Jesse
on the track and see what she can do.

133
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,610
Yeah. Let's do it.

134
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,007
All right, check this out.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,651
Damn. She really can move.

136
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,845
Yeah, she can.

137
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,842
Um, I gotta go.

138
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,162
Wally... Oh, man.

139
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,281
I'll talk to him.

140
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,251
Hey, Joe.

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,166
Um...

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,687
Look it's just,
it is better if he doesn't have speed.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,286
Oh, you don't have to convince me of that.

144
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,601
Last thing I want is

145
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,371
two of my kids zipping around the city,
running into danger.

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,682
'Cause he looked pretty disappointed.

147
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,361
This is about
that other timeline, isn't it?

148
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,888
No, I just...
I think you should keep an eye on him.

149
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,210
MAN: <i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

150
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,727
WOMAN:
<i>Hi, Charlie, how was your day?</i>

151
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,329
<i>Oh, it's so wonderful to see you.</i>

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,847
- Where's dinner?
- It's almost ready, John.

153
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,407
CHARLIE: <i>What're we having tonight?</i>
WOMAN: <i>Pot-roast it's your favorite!</i>

154
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,722
I work hard every day
to provide for this family

155
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,406
and this is what greets me now,
an empty table?

156
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,405
- Just five more minutes.
- I'm hungry now!

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,564
And you speak when you're
spoken to, girl, you understand me?

158
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,210
I saved you from the orphanage
and I provide for you every day.

159
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,563
So keep your mouth shut, Frankie,
you got it?

160
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,403
Sorry, John. Frankie's gone.

161
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,047
Hey-

162
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,611
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

163
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,205
I was trying to get some information

164
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,370
about the man who was attacked
by a lamp post last night.

165
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,602
Hey, um, just come here for a second.

166
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,450
So, uh, last night, I know our first date
didn't shatter any records...

167
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,566
- I mean it wasn't that bad.
- It was...

168
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,091
Okay, yeah it wasn't that great either.

169
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,442
- It was just kind of...
- Boring?

170
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,201
Boring, yeah.

171
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,131
Which feels like my fault.
Maybe I'm boring without my powers.

172
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,966
No, Barry, you are perfect
without your powers.

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,407
Thanks, but I mean,
what do you think it is then?

174
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,802
You don't think it's a sign
that we shouldn't...

175
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,246
No!

176
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,610
- I...
- Okay. Good, I mean, 'cause I do.

177
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,609
I wanna try this again
as soon as possible.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,290
But just with everything that's going on,

179
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,481
- this new case and...
- Yeah.

180
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,643
- Wells and Jesse showing up and I...
- Yeah.

181
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,131
No, Barr, I totally get it.

182
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,324
I get it, I should probably concentrate
on making my deadlines anyway. So...

183
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,241
Cool.

184
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,241
- Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, work.
- All right. Well, I'm gonna work now.

185
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,441
Cool.

186
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,642
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

187
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,402
- No, I was... Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah, of course. Yeah, all right.

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,649
JOE: <i>So this says you were in the room
when your father...</i>

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,649
Foster father, John.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,843
Right. Foster father.

191
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,969
You were in the room when he was struck
by the street lamp post

192
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,447
that flew into the apartment?

193
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,521
Yeah.

194
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,161
But I don't remember any of that.

195
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,641
Um...

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,531
He came home and yelled at Karen,
my foster mom, to get him dinner.

197
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,365
Mmm.

198
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,047
Is that when you blacked out?

199
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,451
Yeah, I think so.

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,681
Has that happened before?

201
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,805
You blacking out?

202
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,891
Is John gonna be okay?

203
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,371
He's in Central City Hospital. I...

204
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,563
He's pretty banged up.

205
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,565
Frankie, can you excuse me for a second?

206
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,882
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

207
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,525
- JOE: Barr.
- Yeah.

208
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,687
What'd you find out?

209
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,363
Okay, get this. So, the outer layer
of the lamp post is a half an inch thick.

210
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,409
But to bend even a quarter inch of steel

211
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,406
requires 177 tons
of tensile strength. So...

212
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,324
So, we're looking for a meta
with super-strength?

213
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,882
Well, I'm not sure yet.
But that's as much as I could find.

214
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,167
What? Why?

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,203
- Because I showed up.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,164
Yes. The only problem
with Barry's little theory

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,249
is there were no fingerprints
found on the post.

218
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,925
Again, Julian, not my theory.

219
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,764
And the meta could have been
wearing gloves.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,081
Yes, perhaps.

221
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,730
But the curvature on the post suggests

222
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,046
that equal amounts of pressure

223
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,403
were applied to the whole thing
at the same time.

224
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,247
So, unless our strong man
has a wingspan of over 20 feet...

225
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,601
Something else caused it.

226
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,081
Yes.

227
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,170
Who's that, sir?

228
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,762
That's Frankie Kane,
the victim's foster kid.

229
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,567
That poor girl's been
in and out of homes for years.

230
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,410
Listen, she said that
she blacked out during the incident.

231
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,125
- "Blacked out?"
- Yeah.

232
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,729
Repressing memories is a coping mechanism
for lots of foster kids.

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,964
- Hmm? Is it?
- It is.

234
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,441
Could be something else.

235
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,409
BOTH: What are you...

236
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,883
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

237
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,725
You okay?

238
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,281
Yeah.

239
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,131
Can I get you some more water?

240
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,446
Yes, thank you.

241
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,641
Sure.

242
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,644
Gonna need another glass, detective.

243
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,641
- Follow him.
- Mmm-hmm.

244
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,649
- See what you can get.
- What are you gonna do?

245
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm gonna finish this up

246
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,328
and convince my son that
he's not meant to be a superhero.

247
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,891
Good idea.

248
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,971
So, how'd I do?

249
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,641
Blood pressure, heart rate,
metabolic rate, all excellent,

250
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,127
- and you've got some serious speed, girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

251
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,441
I think you're good to go.

252
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,681
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

253
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,251
I just still want to run a few more tests.

254
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,002
- Like what?
- Like more tests.

255
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,845
- Uh, hey so, is Wally here?
- No, not yet.

256
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,011
Right. Mmm.

257
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,081
Okay, I'm gonna go grab some food.
I'm starving.

258
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,085
Yeah. There's some power-bars
in the workshop. Help yourself.

259
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,526
Cool.

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,771
- Harry?
- Mmm-hmm.

261
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,601
- What are you doing?
- Being thorough.

262
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,370
Yeah? 'Cause it seems like
you're stalling.

263
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,762
Okay, fine. I'm stalling, I'm stalling.
So what?

264
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,007
So what, so why?

265
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,680
"So why?" Why?
Why, I gotta explain myself to you two?

266
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,370
Oh, I guess I do
'cause you're not parents.

267
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,046
That's my daughter, okay?

268
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,607
And she spent months on this very Earth,

269
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,003
watching Barry Allen defeat meta
after meta after meta, and Zoom.

270
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,201
Then all of a sudden, bam!

271
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,205
She's got speed and now
she wants to be a hero just like him.

272
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,882
And I think that's a great idea...
Not.

273
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,049
Harry, we can help her.
We can train her just like we did

274
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,565
- with Barry.
- I don't want you to train her.

275
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,047
Okay? I brought her here
for you to talk her out of it.

276
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,566
Not talk her into it.

277
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,206
All right, Ramon?
You should talk to her. You're a meta.

278
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,368
Yeah. Which makes me the last person

279
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,244
she should talk to about
not using her powers.

280
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,205
Okay, Snow, Caitlin...

281
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,086
You and her, you've always had
such a special relationship.

282
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,281
You talk to her.

283
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,206
- No, we don't.
- Yeah.

284
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,765
And I don't know anything
about having powers,

285
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,089
so I'm the last person you should talk to
so don't ask me.

286
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,288
But...

287
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,606
WALLY: <i>Dad.</i>

288
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,205
What's going on? Why'd you want to see me?

289
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,606
Oh, hey.

290
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,121
Uh, have a seat.

291
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,328
Look, I know
it's been really hard for you.

292
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,606
Seeing Jesse with speed and...

293
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,931
I just keep thinking of what Harry said.

294
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,007
How sometimes it takes a while
for powers to manifest.

295
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,120
Yeah. Harry also said
that they may never manifest.

296
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Yes. But I got hit by that
dark matter, too, just like Jesse.

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,804
It could still happen for me somehow.

298
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,124
Look, you weren't here when
the first particle accelerator exploded.

299
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,603
That dark matter went
throughout the whole city.

300
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,961
Everybody got hit.

301
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,642
Me, your sister, this whole precinct.

302
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,846
Do you know how many metas
there have been so far?

303
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,124
I know you want this more than anything.

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,290
But you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

305
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,642
So you think just let it go?

306
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,288
Give up on wanting to help people?

307
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,643
You don't need powers to do that.

308
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,805
Look, Barry was coming to the rescue
as a CSI long before he was the Flash.

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,446
He wanted to help people then
just like you want to help people now.

310
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,971
<i>So he studied,</i>

311
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,328
he honed that brilliant mind of his.

312
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>And you have the same
brilliant mind, Wall.</i>

313
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,686
- Dad...
- No, I mean it, son.

314
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,168
Look, a lot of people dream about
making the world a better place.

315
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,209
With that mind of yours
and that engineering talent,

316
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,211
you literally could build a better world.

317
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,170
So what? I gotta stay in school?

318
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,850
Yeah, you gotta stay in school.

319
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,202
Just a couple more years.

320
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,201
What are you doing?

321
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,324
I assumed you'd taken
a DNA sample before.

322
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,487
Okay. Yes, I know what you're doing.
I mean, why are you doing it?

323
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,484
What, you're looking
to steal another sample?

324
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,570
I've isolated an element consistent
in all five of the husks that we've found.

325
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,882
Including Edward Clariss'.

326
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,521
You mean the Rival?

327
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,210
Mmm-hmm, that's what the papers
are calling him, yes.

328
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,767
What's the element?

329
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,041
I don't know.

330
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,722
But it's not one
that I've found in any other

331
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,571
meta-human samples that I've studied.

332
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,566
So you think that Frankie,
the girl downstairs,

333
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,603
has the same element in her DNA?

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,764
Well, I wouldn't be comparing samples

335
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,247
if it wasn't a possibility,
would I, Allen?

336
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,927
It's a good thing for both of us I did.

337
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,241
- What?
- Come on.

338
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,680
What?

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,528
- BARRY: Calm down, okay?
- Where is she?

340
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,922
- Julian...
- You, you girl, stop!

341
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,241
- Hey, ease up, Julian.
- Stop!

342
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,925
- You did it, didn't you?
- Me? What?

343
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,411
The lamp post. You did it, didn't you?

344
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,766
What? No, no, no, stop!

345
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,041
- You're a liar.
- Julian!

346
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,083
- You're a meta-human.
- Stop, no. Stop!

347
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,442
You put your foster father
in the hospital, didn't you?

348
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,802
- No, no. No.
- Didn't you?

349
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,731
Didn't you?

350
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,968
Oh, I wanted to do more than hurt him.

351
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,811
And, now, I'm gonna do the same to you.

352
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,967
Frankie! Frankie, stop!

353
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,646
You okay?

354
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,127
Frankie!

355
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,004
No. Frankie's gone.

356
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,005
My name is Magenta.

357
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,651
You're like this because of Alchemy.

358
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,162
<i>He changed you, didn't he?</i>

359
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,811
<i>This isn't you.</i>

360
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,530
Just come with me.

361
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,840
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

362
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,641
I can help you.

363
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,724
I don't need any more help, Flash.

364
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,005
I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

365
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,891
It's too late for that.

366
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,887
Frankie, don't!

367
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,841
It's me or him!

368
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,841
Come on.

369
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,681
Her name's Frankie Kane.
But she's calling herself Magenta.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,049
- Meh.
- And Magenta is a whole different person

371
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,044
than the scared, kind girl
I was interviewing.

372
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,210
- She's dissociative.
- You mean split-personality.

373
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,521
According to her medical records,

374
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,728
it's a condition she's been dealing with
her entire life.

375
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,730
I'm sure all the yelling at C.C.P.D.
is what triggered it.

376
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,882
So Frankie is Jekyll, Magenta is Hyde.

377
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,081
Classic, good versus evil.

378
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,210
- Or she's pulling a <i>Primal Fear.</i>
- She's faking it.

379
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,686
No, she's not faking it.

380
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,885
I saw the struggle going on inside of her.
Magenta's trying to take over completely.

381
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,520
You said she was raised
in the foster care system?

382
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
Yep. All her life.
She went from home to home.

383
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,244
Yeah, and maybe not good ones.
Her current foster father, John,

384
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,090
the one who was hurt in the attack?

385
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,129
Yeah, he's got a few disorderly conducts.

386
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,927
He might have some information we can use.
I can follow up with him.

387
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,248
Mmm-hmm. There is something else.

388
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,569
She got her powers from Alchemy.

389
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,530
When I said his name, she knew who he was.

390
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,650
So Magenta must have existed
in the other timeline, too.

391
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,245
Who's Alchemy?

392
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,367
Well, uh, Doctor Alchemy
is a magic man in a cloak

393
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,047
who can somehow restore the powers
that people had in Flashpoint.

394
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,961
Okay, and what's Flashpoint?

395
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,767
That's what we're calling the alternate
timeline that Barry created

396
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,928
when he went back in time
and saved his mom.

397
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,964
Oh, so Magenta is another
side effect from your time trip.

398
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,083
Genius... Not.

399
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,442
Um, I don't need to be reminded.
Thank you.

400
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,769
Look, anybody with those powers
and as angry as her

401
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,321
needs to be tracked down, fast.

402
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,331
Well, great. I mean, fast I can do.
Let me just go carb-load.

403
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,121
He didn't... That's... You don't...

404
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,166
Snow.

405
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,651
Please.

406
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,725
Okay, Harry. I'll talk to her.

407
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,645
But I don't know what I'm gonna say.

408
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,729
Hey, Joe, did you talk to Wally?
He still seems a little bummed.

409
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,804
It's not gonna fix itself overnight,
but it's all good. He gets it.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,365
- Okay.
- And I gotta be honest,

411
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,642
it was one of my better
"Dad-Cop" speeches.

412
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,966
What's "Dad-Cop?"

413
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,891
There's good cop, bad cop, and "Dad-Cop."

414
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,162
Firm but reassuring. Cuts to the point.

415
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,487
I don't think I know that one.

416
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,647
Yeah, I didn't use it on you.

417
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,009
Wally's different than you, Barry.
You're like a second daughter.

418
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,651
You overshare your feelings.

419
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,161
Him I gotta be a little bit more nuanced.

420
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,323
Huh? Cool.

421
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,925
I'm messing with you.

422
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,924
I'll talk at you if I get
any leads on Frankie, all right?

423
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,525
All right.

424
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,322
Second daughter, what is he talking about?

425
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,762
CAITLIN: Hey, hey.

426
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,885
Hey, sorry, um...

427
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,925
You guys were not kidding when you
said speedsters were hungry all the time.

428
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,286
Yeah.

429
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,207
Listen, Jesse,
before you speed off to find Frankie,

430
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,842
I just wanna make sure
that you feel like you're ready?

431
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,362
Why? I mean, is something wrong?

432
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,851
I mean,
did the test results say something?

433
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,884
No, not at all. All the test results
have come back fine so far.

434
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,681
It's just, maybe you should take it slow?

435
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,202
Right. This is because I'm a girl.

436
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,360
What? No, not at all. Why?

437
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,202
Well, I mean,
Barry didn't have to take things slow.

438
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,886
You know, he was stopping criminals
the second he got his powers.

439
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,766
Why can't I do the same thing?

440
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,884
Well, I mean, I'm sure you think
that it's a great thing to have powers,

441
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,129
but sometimes it's not so great, trust me.

442
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,886
I'm just saying that if I had powers,
I would probably take it slow.

443
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,243
My dad put you up to this, didn't he?

444
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,242
Yeah, I mean, of course he did.

445
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,401
Jesse, uh...

446
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,322
Hey, you don't want me
to have this speed, do you?

447
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,088
<i>I mean, that's why we're here, right?</i>

448
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,322
Not so you could test me,

449
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
but so you could get everyone
to talk me out of using my powers.

450
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,443
- I just want you to be...
- To be safe. Yeah.

451
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,803
Yeah, I know,
I've heard it my entire life.

452
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,084
This is different. This is way different.

453
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,651
Yeah, no, it is.

454
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,842
- Because I'm not Barry, right?
- Right.

455
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,281
You're not Barry.

456
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,167
Let me talk to her this time.

457
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,130
MAGENTA: She's still here.

458
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,850
I can feel Frankie trying
to stay in control.

459
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,486
You said I could beat her.

460
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,364
What I said was,

461
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,488
"I'd return to you the power you had
to inflict your pain upon others."

462
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,811
But I need Frankie gone to do that.

463
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,687
Do you remember why you came to me?

464
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,405
I came to you,

465
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,168
because you showed me a way
to stop him from hurting me.

466
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,366
Show him Magenta is in control.

467
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,690
And once you've done that,
Frankie will know it as well.

468
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,730
Here you are.

469
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,166
Hey.

470
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,163
Hey, so, where did you go yesterday?

471
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,163
Well, I didn't want to
interrupt your training.

472
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,606
Right, yeah, well, looks like
there won't be much of that anymore

473
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,084
now that my dad is getting everyone
to talk me out of using my powers.

474
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,363
Wait, that...
That's not why you're here, right?

475
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,881
No, no. This is all me.

476
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,200
You all right?

477
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,408
Uh, you know, when this whole thing
happened to me, you were...

478
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,724
You were actually the first person
I wanted to call.

479
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,887
I was sort of hoping
it happened to you, too.

480
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,042
Uh, I dreamt about it. Believe me.

481
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,565
How did this all happen?

482
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,564
I mean, it was... It was crazy.

483
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,724
So like, one day,
I was walking home from a friend's house,

484
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,651
and this car, it ran a red light,

485
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,770
and, you know,
it was speeding right at me.

486
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,086
And I just stood there, frozen.

487
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,884
You know, basically waiting to be hit.

488
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,562
And then I looked around,
and everything around me was frozen, too.

489
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,651
And it was peaceful and quiet,

490
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,765
but I felt this, like,
electricity running in me.

491
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,006
And, so, I ran out of the way.

492
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,928
Like, I kept running and running
and I mean, now I don't ever want to stop.

493
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,969
So you basically
just jumpstarted your powers.

494
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,443
I mean, I guess so, yeah, why?

495
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,001
It's good to know.

496
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,445
Wally!

497
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,451
What are you doing?

498
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,125
Getting my speed! Why would you do that?

499
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,281
To save your life?

500
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,609
- It could've worked, Jesse...
- No! Okay, look,

501
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,006
I don't think so.

502
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,486
I'm sorry.

503
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,123
Seriously, what the hell
were you thinking?

504
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,965
You can't just go
stepping into the street like that!

505
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,281
I mean, you gotta use your head.

506
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,805
Nothing happened, Barry. Chill out.

507
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,964
- Didn't you talk to Joe about this?
- Yeah, so?

508
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,282
So, it clearly didn't help.

509
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,325
I mean, what would you have done
if Jesse wasn't there, huh?

510
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,811
I don't know, man.

511
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,644
Because there's nothing
you could have done.

512
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,251
Because you don't have powers.

513
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,482
Only room in our family
for one speedster, Barry?

514
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,803
Please just stop trying,
before you get yourself killed.

515
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,087
You done?

516
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,166
- Do you have anything to say?
- No, you pretty much covered it.

517
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,201
- This has got to stop!
- Stop yelling at me, okay?

518
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,686
I saved his life,
what did you want me to do?

519
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,331
That's not the point,
that is not the point.

520
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,528
I know the point.
You don't want me to use my powers.

521
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,761
- Right, yeah.
- Fine!

522
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,002
Fine, but I don't need to stay here
and listen to this anymore.

523
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,482
No, Jesse, Jesse! Don't...

524
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,328
What did you say to her?

525
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,841
Me?

526
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,082
Yeah, you.

527
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,368
Don't blame me for this. I tried to help.

528
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,011
Help her? Or help me?

529
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,851
Listen, Harry,

530
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,008
maybe the reason she's shutting you out

531
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,687
is because you're not trying to
understand what she's going through.

532
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,604
- But I don't need to...
- Maybe if you helped her

533
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,890
navigate her powers rather than
just assuming they'll destroy her,

534
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,522
she'd turn to you
rather than push you away.

535
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,601
Can't even bring myself to
take a lap around this thing.

536
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,963
- Why is that?
- I don't know, I mean, you said it.

537
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,401
Everything's different here.

538
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,564
There's a guy creating meta-humans,
innocent people,

539
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,003
because I changed the timeline.
It's on me.

540
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,244
Yeah, well, I think I know a thing or two
about what that feels like.

541
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,729
<i>Yeah, I keep making mistakes.</i>

542
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,400
I make mistakes and then
I want to make up for my mistakes,

543
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,561
then I just make more mistakes.

544
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,240
The next thing I know, I have a daughter
that won't even speak to me.

545
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,410
How do we keep from messing things up,
when all we want to do is help?

546
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,285
I don't know.

547
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,605
But you did once tell me that,

548
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,924
<i>"You have to trust that in the long run,"</i>

549
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,447
"the decisions you make
are the right ones."

550
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,082
Yeah.

551
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,923
I was always too good
at forgiving myself, Allen.

552
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,125
You were never good enough.

553
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,611
IRIS: <i>John James?</i>

554
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,125
Who's asking?

555
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,970
Hi, I'm Iris West.

556
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,646
I'm a reporter for
<i>Central City Picture News.</i>

557
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,202
I wanted to ask you a couple questions
about Frankie Kane.

558
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,521
They find her yet?

559
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,007
I don't believe so, no.

560
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,123
What the hell's taking so long?

561
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,204
That damn meta-human freak
nearly killed me.

562
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,801
I know. I'm sorry.

563
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,128
That's what I get for taking
Frankie in, huh? This?

564
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,486
God help me if I ever see her again.

565
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,481
What does that mean?

566
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,963
It means that
she's gonna be the one in the hospital.

567
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,525
Tough love, John?

568
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,370
Yeah, you're damn right.

569
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,209
She was getting back at you
for hurting her.

570
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,007
And she's gonna try it again.

571
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,481
Nurse!

572
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,250
We need to get this man
to a safe location.

573
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,481
Why?

574
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,729
What the hell was that?

575
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,841
Oh, my God.

576
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,407
- Where are you taking me?
- Frankie is coming for you.

577
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,046
And as much as it pains me
to help an abusive dick like you,

578
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,526
I can't let you die.

579
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,085
What kind of alarm is that?

580
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,725
That's Iris' panic button.

581
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,405
- Her what?
- Her panic button.

582
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,404
We installed them on everyone's phones?

583
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,926
'Cause we kept getting kidnapped?

584
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,202
Well, at least something's an
improvement in this timeline.

585
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,121
- CAITLIN: <i>That's the hospital.</i>
- Frankie's foster father's there.

586
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,050
CAITLIN: <i>Yeah, and Iris went to see him.</i>

587
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,770
Looks like she's not the only one.

588
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,411
- Is that a tanker?
- That's a tanker, yeah.

589
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,040
She is gonna kill him
and everyone else in there.

590
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,401
- I gotta go.
- What are you gonna do?

591
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,164
<i>You don't have super strength.</i>

592
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,925
Start thinking.

593
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,081
Guys...

594
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,169
There's not enough time to get everybody
out of the hospital.

595
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,481
This thing's coming down.

596
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,966
Barry, Iris is still in there.

597
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,082
What if... What if I create a wind funnel?

598
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,521
You won't be creating enough updraft
to keep that tanker up.

599
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,331
No, no, not, not with my arms. If I run.

600
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,170
- That could...
- Propeller.

601
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,284
That could work.
Barry, run in a figure-eight fashion.

602
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,482
<i>It'll act like a propeller.
The wind will build upon itself,</i>

603
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,285
it'll create the supersonic resistance
we need.

604
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,443
- Could work.
- All right.

605
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,970
Bye-bye, Daddy.

606
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,126
Flash!

607
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,687
Okay, well that worked. But now what?
He can't stop her if he's up there.

608
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,961
Cisco's right.

609
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,490
Go help him.

610
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,327
- Dad...
- You need to get out there, now.

611
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,329
<i>Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.</i>

612
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,210
I know you can do it.

613
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,642
You're more than fast enough.

614
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,167
Now run, Jesse.

615
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,646
Run.

616
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,371
Hey, thought you could use a little help.

617
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,166
I got this, you go take care of her.

618
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,011
Magenta.

619
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,480
I got a little help.

620
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,484
So I could help you.

621
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,843
Okay, killing your foster father
and everyone else inside that hospital

622
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,525
isn't gonna give you what you need.

623
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,362
You have no idea what I need!

624
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,526
It's not just John
that I want to get rid of.

625
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,684
I want them both gone.

626
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,842
Barry, you got to stop her now,
that tanker's coming down.

627
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,043
THE FLASH:
<i>I know you're still in there, Frankie.</i>

628
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,889
Don't let John destroy the good
that's still inside you.

629
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,888
He said I was weak, that I was pathetic.

630
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,803
He said I was a horrible person.

631
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,805
He's just blaming you for all the
bad things he's caused in his life.

632
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,884
It's not your fault.
This isn't because of you.

633
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,407
I just want him to stop hurting me.

634
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,325
This isn't the way.

635
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,326
<i>Your foster father never forgave himself
for his mistakes.</i>

636
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,891
<i>That's why he took them out on you.</i>

637
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,726
He couldn't face who he really is,
he couldn't move forward.

638
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,447
But you can.

639
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,965
They did it.

640
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,929
I'm so sorry.

641
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,646
It's okay.

642
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,283
I'm so sorry.

643
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,130
It's gonna be okay.

644
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,123
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

645
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,803
So no one else got hurt?

646
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,646
Luckily, no.
You don't have to worry about that.

647
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,441
What about John?

648
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,967
JOE: <i>The DA is prosecuting him
for what he did to you.</i>

649
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,850
So I think he's gonna be serving time,

650
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,647
and he's not gonna ever be
anybody's foster father again.

651
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,170
It's just so strange being responsible
for all of this

652
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,163
and not remember any of it.

653
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,725
What do you remember?

654
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,567
About how you got your powers?
How this all began?

655
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,249
Um...

656
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,160
I started having dreams
at night of Magenta.

657
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,641
Dreams?

658
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,490
<i>Well, they were more than dreams.</i>

659
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,487
I don't know, it was like
I was living another life or something.

660
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,686
And then I started getting them
all the time, during the day...

661
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,921
And the more it happened,

662
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,210
the more painful they became.

663
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,525
<i>Then I started hearing a voice.</i>

664
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,161
What voice?

665
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,525
It was a man named Alchemy.

666
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,684
<i>He said he could give me what I wanted
and make me powerful again.</i>

667
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,568
But I didn't understand,
I thought I was going crazy.

668
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,286
Trust me, Magenta is not here
because of anything that you did.

669
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,569
There may be a darkness inside of you,
but if you face it,

670
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,201
it'll make it easier
for the good side of you to win.

671
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,211
You're letting me go?

672
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,727
None of this is your fault, Frankie.

673
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,361
<i>Caitlin found you a good home in Keystone.</i>

674
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,722
<i>People that will never hurt you.</i>

675
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,722
But what if Magenta tries to come back?

676
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,411
Fight her.

677
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,566
<i>And if you need help, we'll be there.</i>

678
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,723
We have faith in you, Frankie.

679
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,721
Thank you.

680
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,245
FRANKIE: <i>Thank you, all.</i>

681
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,606
You okay?

682
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,562
Yeah, yeah, I, um,
I just feel bad for her. You know?

683
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,080
You sure?

684
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,566
Yeah.

685
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,402
No "Dad-Cop" required.

686
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,529
- You heard about that, huh?
- Yeah, I heard about that.

687
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,807
Hey-

688
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,851
There she is.

689
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,011
You were tremendous out there.

690
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,170
You really were.

691
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,323
I guess that's your first victory
as a superhero.

692
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,851
My daughter.

693
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,290
Jesse Quick.

694
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,681
Yeah.

695
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,206
Yeah, well, I mean, I was only able to
do it 'cause you believed in me. So...

696
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,601
Uh-uh.

697
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,725
I should have been that way
a long, long time ago.

698
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,644
But I...

699
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,970
You know, one day, you'll understand.

700
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,849
I don't expect you to now, but...

701
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,650
I'm always gonna worry.

702
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,407
I'm always going to be cautious.

703
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,642
I'm always going to love you.

704
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,687
Dad, I know. I mean, of course I know.

705
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,007
And I will always love you.

706
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,004
Even when you drive me absolutely insane.

707
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,001
So...

708
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,326
So...

709
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,170
Are we going home or...

710
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,322
I think we'll stay here a few more days,

711
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,849
run a few more tests,
and also to see if this fits you.

712
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,521
Cisco did the insignia,

713
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,520
and Snow thought
this would help you, and I agree.

714
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,925
- You do?
- I do.

715
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,886
My...

716
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,241
My...

717
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,520
My fear,

718
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,365
my guilt has kept both of us back

719
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,723
for far too long.

720
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,647
You know, you've always been my hero.

721
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,731
<i>But now,</i>

722
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,041
it's time for me to let you
be one for everyone else.

723
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,050
Thank you.

724
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,608
- Hey.
- Hey, just made it?

725
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,929
Yeah, I had to make sure Frankie was okay.

726
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,764
So, you're ready to try this again?

727
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,803
Um, actually, I had a thought about
why our last date was so boring.

728
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,487
Oh, yeah?

729
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,926
Yeah, um...

730
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,171
Here you go.

731
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,362
Um, so, I know that you think
that I shouldn't use my powers.

732
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,602
And it's not that
I'm nothing without them,

733
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,007
but they are a part of me now, you know?

734
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,281
They're a part of you.

735
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,646
This is our life and I think last date,
we were ignoring that part of us.

736
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,646
We were trying to be the people
that we were before I was the Flash.

737
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,280
And that's why it wasn't working.

738
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,890
Okay, so, what are you saying?

739
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,482
I'm saying we have to stop denying
who we really are.

740
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,525
Uh, well, yeah, I mean,
when you put it that way.

741
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,161
I agree.

742
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,369
We can't pretend like
none of this has happened.

743
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,011
- I thought you'd see it that way.
- Mmm.

744
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,322
Sorry.

745
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,010
It's Joe. He needs me at the station.

746
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,605
It's fine, go.

747
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,206
- Really?
- Yeah.

748
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,402
Yeah. This has already been
a really amazing date, Flash.

749
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,929
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- There you are.

750
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,885
Listen, Singh wanted me
to show you guys this.

751
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,930
This happened a few days ago
at Iron Heights.

752
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,561
They tried to keep it under wraps,

753
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,881
'cause they didn't want anybody to think

754
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,651
there was a security issue,
but check it out.

755
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,208
- That's Clariss.
- Alchemy?

756
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,447
It was Clariss.

757
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,926
No, no!

758
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,404
Dead before he hit the ground.

759
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,241
Alchemy.

760
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,767
You ever heard that name before, Alchemy?

761
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,401
No, I haven't.

762
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,924
Maybe there's an invisible meta?

763
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,924
Maybe it's a ghost.

764
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,564
Do you believe in ghosts, Allen?

765
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,686
No?

766
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,251
Hey, do you think this thing is part
of the Flashpoint timeline, too?

767
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,163
I have a feeling a lot of things are
these days.
