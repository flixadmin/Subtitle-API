1
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,455
Get back, you lot!

2
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,100
Get to the guillotine!

3
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,834
The scourge of France!

4
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,449
Terror is nothing more than justice.

5
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,661
Prompt, severe, inflexible.

6
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:51,625
It is therefore an emanation of virtue.

7
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,547
Now, she was guilty
of three charges against you.

8
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,134
Depletion of the national treasury...

9
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:06,348
conspiracy against the internal
and external security of State...

10
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:12,438
and high treason for acting
in the interests of the enemy.

11
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,860
Mercy for the villains?

12
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,363
No.

13
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,992
Mercy for the innocent.

14
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,120
Mercy for the unfortunate.

15
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,581
Mercy for humanity.

16
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,922
An inescapable outcome
of democracy's connection

17
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,968
in relation to the nation's
immediate demands at this moment...

18
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,929
The British navy have taken
the port of Toulon.

19
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,265
Half the French fleet is trapped there.

20
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,560
If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.

21
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,231
Lucky for us, there are only
2000 English troops in Toulon.

22
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:03,572
But we are short of artillery and led by
a general who was a court painter.

23
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,284
It is not necessary
to recapture Toulon itself.

24
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:11,371
The town is not a town.
The town is a port.

25
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,917
If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,794
the town must surrender.

27
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,422
My brother, Captain Bonaparte,
as artillery officer,

28
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:24,760
has organized heated shots
against English ships.

29
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,305
He has proven
his commitment to the Republic.

30
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,725
And how do you propose to take the harbor?

31
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,020
Capture the fort that dominates the harbor

32
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,939
and you have the city.

33
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,948
We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.

34
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,909
And I, for one,

35
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,580
will never let the royalists
or the English take my region.

36
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,511
Morning, sir.

37
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,180
General Carteaux?

38
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,599
He's over there.

39
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,568
Lucien, my dear brother,
I am in Toulon already.

40
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,779
The troops are in a poor state,

41
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,741
and your conscripts untrained
and undisciplined.

42
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:34,246
Without equipment and resources,
I see only failure.

43
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,432
We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.

44
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,767
If we do not succeed,

45
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,188
those in power will only see us
as Corsican ruffians

46
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,190
unfit for higher office,

47
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,775
and our mother's ambitions
will be quashed.

48
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,541
That's it, madame. Fine eye you have.

49
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,709
There you go.

50
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,961
Reckon I'll still be here next week.

51
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:30,385
The British control the big guns
that point out at their fleet offshore.

52
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:35,641
Take those guns, and we can fire
onto them and end this blockade.

53
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:53,116
Surprise is my advantage,
but I will win by fire.

54
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,702
I cannot wait for your arrival.

55
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,163
Your brother, Napoleon.

56
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,709
Oi, shit rag! Yes, you!

57
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,092
Move along now. Go on. Move!

58
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,138
Move them fucking goats!

59
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:20,018
Last chance! Fucking move them goats!

60
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,815
Fucking move them now!

- I'm fine.

Protect the cannons!

82
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,798

Vive la France!

00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,495
Ready the cannons!

85
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,038
Sir! Yes, sir.

86
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,040
Mortars!

87
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,669
Elevation 1-6-0.

88
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,258

00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,030
Junot, fire!

92
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,782
Fire!

93
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,340
- Reload!
- Reload.

94
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,263
Fire!

95
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,765
Fire!

96
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,534
Shoulder arms!

97
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:14,789
Captain Napoleon Bonaparte,
I award you the rank of brigadier general.

98
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,587
Long live the Republic!

99
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,422
Long live the Republic!

100
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,551
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

101
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:35,352
I promised you brilliant successes,
and I've kept my word.

102
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,153
Order arms!

103
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,100
For Mother.

104
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,401
The current leadership of France
has passed from enthusiasm

105
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,777
to reckless ambition.

106
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,449
And the public perception
of the guillotine is lawless passion,

107
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,785
led by Robespierre.

108
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,246
He is unfit to rule.

109
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,921
Bonaparte.

110
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,717
Friends!

111
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,470
It has become increasingly clear,
Citizen Robespierre,

112
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:57,892
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

113
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,145
Let me speak!

114
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,692
There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.

115
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:10,405
If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!

116
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,159
You are not a defender of freedom.

117
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:20,749
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

118
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,918
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

119
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,213
You are, all of you, the traitors!

120
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,591
Arrest him!

121
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,884
Arrest him!

122
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,600
Coward!

123
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,941
- Get him!
- Get back.

124
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,863
No, no, no.

125
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,092
You missed.

126
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,014
The guillotine, my friend.

127
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,333
A seven, madame.

128
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
Deal again.

129
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,266
Deal again.

130
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,067
Your bets.

131
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,745
Seven again.

132
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,375
No. No win.

133
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,422
I'll be out first. That's mine.

134
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,142
Why are you staring at me?

135
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,060
- Am I?
- Mm.

136
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,479
- Yes.
- No, I was not.

137
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,231
Oh, you weren't?

138
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,567
I was.

139
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,030
I was staring at your face.

140
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,991
What is this costume you have on?

141
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,660
This is my uniform.

142
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,872
I led the French victory at Toulon.

143
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,547
Do not tell me your name.

144
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,232
General?

145
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:43,237
There is a very young man
who wishes to see you.

146
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,948
His name is, uh, Eugène Beauharnais.

147
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,866
Hm.

148
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,367
Ow.

149
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,167
Citizen.

150
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,052
General Bonaparte.

151
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,595
Yes?

152
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,974
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.

153
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,601
What do you want?

154
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,145
My father's saber.

155
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:21,234
It was taken from him
before he was arrested and executed.

156
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,193
Yes?

157
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,488
It would mean a great deal to me

158
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,907
and to my mother
if it were returned to us.

159
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,784
It's all we have of him.

160
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,244
The sword is a weapon.

161
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,957
I cannot allow citizens
to have weapons in their possession.

162
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,545
The sword is a keepsake for me
to remember my dear late father.

163
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,089
Perhaps, but it is a weapon nevertheless.

164
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,094
Young man, why are you here?

165
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,807
My mother said that you were the only man
of authority to retrieve the sword.

166
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,905
All of these are from officers
who were sentenced to die.

167
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,077
Did no one think
to attach names to any of them?

168
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,040
No, there are no names.

169
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,983
General Bonaparte?

170
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,244
Thank you.

171
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,253
Is there reason to introduce myself?

172
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,048
No, general.

173
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:08,966
Good.

174
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,512
My compliments
to the chef of this fine family.

175
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,369
Would you like to sit closer?

176
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,971
Do I look like I'm in love?

177
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,308
Do you find him without appeal?

178
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,188
No.

179
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,441
Then perhaps that is enough.

180
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,907
Do not underestimate your grace.

181
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,877
When you look at me,
do you see an aristocrat?

182
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,007
No.

183
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,929
My husband had more than one lover.

184
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,018
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

185
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,817
When I was in prison,

186
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,695
I was told the only way to survive
was to get pregnant.

187
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,616
So, general...

188
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,666
do I need warn you of my indiscretions?

189
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,669
No, madame.

190
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,382
Does where I have been concern you?

191
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,596
No, madame.

192
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,533
If you look down, you'll see a surprise.

193
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,286
And once you see it,
you will always want it.

194
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,680
People of France, don't be fooled.

195
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:43,763
There are more of us!

196
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,517
We can occupy this Convention!

197
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,478
Long live the king!

198
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,440
Long live the king!

199
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,525
Long live the king!

200
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,610
Long live the king!

201
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,612
Long live the king!

202
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,573
Long live the king!

203
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,199
Long live the king!

204
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,454
No doubt you've seen
the chaos in the streets.

205
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:07,537
Yes.

206
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,124
There is a belief amongst the Committee

207
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,127
that there is an attack
on the Council coming by this mob.

208
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:18,799
I have less than 4000 troops
and very little in the way of weapons.

209
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,804
There are 40 cannons in Sablons.
I could have them here in three hours.

210
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,890
This mob is 20,000 strong.

211
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:27,808
Yes.

212
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,522
As my second-in-command...

213
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,485
what would you intend to do
if this assignment of defense

214
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,944
was transferred to you?

215
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:48,746
I accept, on the condition
that I command this as I see fit.

216
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,831
Without interruption.

217
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,876
I will not lead as second-in-command.

218
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,844
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

219
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,034
Fire!

220
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,517
According to the law
of 20th September, 1792,

221
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,271
Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher,

222
00:30:55,354 --> 00:31:00,401
born 23rd June, 1767, in Martinique,

223
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,239
accepts as her husband Napoleon Bonaparte,

224
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:11,662
born February, 1768, in Ajaccio, Corsica.

225
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,790
Do you consent?

226
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,250
- Yes.
- I do.

227
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,626
Do you consent?

228
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,089
Yes. I do.

229
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,676
I declare you united in marriage.

230
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,033
To the savior of the Republic!

231
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,701
And to Madame Bonaparte.

232
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,244
To Madame Bonaparte.

233
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,889
This guy right next to me?

234
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,320
He wrenched my saber...

235
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,630
Let that good work make us a son.

236
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,106
Dear Joséphine,

237
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,277
I follow in the footsteps
of Alexander the Great and Caesar,

238
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,279
as I have been sent to liberate Egypt.

239
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,950
I have 40,000 men,

240
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,995
and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.

241
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:22,543
I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.

242
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,381
The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England

243
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,216
through their eastern empire.

244
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,846
But my achievements seem slight,
as they keep us apart.

245
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,166
Dear wife.

246
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,878
This love I have for you
is a kind of death.

247
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:09,256
There is no survival for me except in you.

248
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,591
Hello again.

249
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,967
What are you doing?

250
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,636
- No letters from you.
- Good morning, Lucille.

251
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,264
If you loved me,
you'd write me twice a day.

252
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,476
Tell me there are no snakes in your bed,

253
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,313
in your legs, inside what is mine.

254
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,565
You must write me and tell me

255
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:30,486
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,

256
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,238
that only you can please me.

257
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:59,217
Are there limits to what I can tell you?

258
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,095
There shouldn't be.

259
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,059
Should I tell you something
at the risk of giving you personal pain?

260
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,145
Yes.

261
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,823
Your wife has taken a lover
named Hippolyte Charles.

262
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,680
- You expect me to believe this?
- Yes.

263
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,226
That my wife would do this to me? Mm.

264
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,353
Yes.

265
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,116
No dessert for you. You may leave.

266
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,287
I would never lie to you.

267
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,888
How do you know this?

268
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,688
Lucille is my lover.

269
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,690
She writes to me.

270
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,527
Joséphine's lady-in-waiting is your lover?

271
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,832
Prepare two frigates
and two smaller vessels,

272
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,333
in the greatest secrecy.

273
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,045
I'm returning home.

274
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,546
Napoleon...

275
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,549
this will be seen as desertion.

276
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,554
General Kléber will be informed
of his succession to command

277
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,680
after I've left.

278
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,358
Napoleon the victorious!

279
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,827
Where's my wife?

280
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,496
She has left to greet you in Lyon.

281
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,832
Do not lie to me. Where is my wife?

282
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,667
She left earlier today, general.

283
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,710
- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,922
The entire world knows of my arrival
but not my wife?

285
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,224
What kind of creature are you?

286
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:23,899
How could you care so little
for me and my feelings?

287
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,528
- You are a selfish, little pig.
- No...

288
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,407
You think so lowly of me?

289
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,410
No. I don't.

290
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,494
Then why?

291
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,540
Because you're what?

292
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:42,792
Say it.

293
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,631
I'm sorry.

294
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,591
That's not enough.

295
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,011
What do you want me to say?

296
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:58,183
I want you to say that I am
the most important thing in the world!

297
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,144
- You are.
- Say it!

298
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:07,484
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world.

299
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,153
- You...
- And without me, you are nothing.

300
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,864
- I'm nothing.
- And you will do anything!

301
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:15,200
I'll do anything.

302
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,413
I'm not built like other men.

303
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,211
And I'm not subject to petty insecurity.

304
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,009
You're a beast.

305
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,224
I feel sorry for you.

306
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,771
You want to be great?

307
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:48,816
Hm?

308
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,073
You are nothing without me.

309
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,534
Say it.

310
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,002
Say it.

311
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:18,680
You are just a brute
that is nothing without me.

312
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:24,060
I am just a brute
that is nothing without you.

313
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:24,978
Yes.

314
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,646
You are nothing...

315
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,901
without me or your mother.

316
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,573
My mother...

317
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,797
Did you have affairs?

318
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,384
Of course I did.

319
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,226
And did you love them?

320
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,730
No. No, I did not.

321
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,237
Were they pretty?

322
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,325
Yes, some of them.

323
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,829
They served their purpose.

324
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,083
More than I do?

325
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,796
They cried less.
That made them more attractive.

326
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,175
Don't...

327
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,096
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.

328
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,267
Just don't leave me.

329
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,272
You don't have to forgive me.
Just promise me you won't leave again.

330
00:44:56,945 --> 00:45:00,698
What is it that made you desert
your troops in Egypt?

331
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:01,782
Shh!

332
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,120
Citizens...

333
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,832
what country are we in?

334
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:15,588
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

335
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,512
Who should be responsible
for her governance while I'm away?

336
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,974
Because it is not you, Citizen Gohier.

337
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:27,767
And it is not you.

338
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:31,563
It certainly is not you.
Although you're very good at scowling.

339
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,484
It's not you, Barras.

340
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:37,694
Or you, Talleyrand.

341
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,196
Or you, Sieyès.

342
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,365
So who?

343
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:46,786
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?

344
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,122
No?

345
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,169
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

346
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:58,089
Printing money
that is spent within hours...

347
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,093
the Austro-Russian overrun of Italy...

348
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,638
the Anglo-Russian occupation of Holland,

349
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:12,103
and what appears to be
the imminent invasion of France herself.

350
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:18,526
And yet, you accuse me of desertion.

351
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,364
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

352
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:41,716
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

353
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,221
What do you want?

354
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,351
Well...

355
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:57,315
the people will accept my rule
if I have your support.

356
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:04,364
Like you, though,
I believe that the Directory is corrupt.

357
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:10,787
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy...

358
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,082
and we can preserve
the ideals of the Revolution.

359
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,547
And I think
that a seizure of power is possible...

360
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,675
with your help, at the right time.

361
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,928
And I think this is the right time.

362
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,848
So you expect me to be your sword?

363
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,690
I expect that a coup d'état...

364
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,901
well-timed, well-executed...

365
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,615
could transfer power
into the hands of three consuls.

366
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,701
Myself, Ducos...

367
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,288
and you.

368
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,209
I'm inviting you to the winning side.

369
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,420
Hm?

370
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,632
It's a simple letter of resignation
we would like you to...

371
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,843
I am not signing anything.

372
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:10,221
You can piss before I sign anything away!

373
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,306
Gentlemen.

374
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,691
Who's doing this?

375
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,736
Good morning, Paul.

376
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,528
Hm?

377
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,365
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

378
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,870
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

379
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,540
You must retire
before you have your breakfast, please.

380
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:42,920
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

381
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,090
I shall.

382
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,306
There are some gentlemen here to see you.

383
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,350
Citizen Moulin.

384
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,895
We have a letter
of resignation for you to sign.

385
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,606
- No, no, no. I am eating my breakfast.
- No.

386
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,484
I am enjoying a succulent breakfast.

387
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,361
This is outrageous!

388
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,613
I shall finish my breakfast
before you touch me!

389
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,073
No!

390
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,491
Enjoy your breakfast.

391
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,514
Director!

392
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,892
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

393
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,644
Hear, hear!

394
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:44,816
Uh, this emergency session
is to draw a list of nominations

395
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:49,779
for a new Directory
to deal with the threat...

396
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,115
The threat of the royalists.

397
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,367
We are being asked to pass a resolution

398
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,412
forming a provisional government
to three consuls:

399
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:02,083
General Bonaparte
and Citizens Sieyès and Roger Ducos.

400
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,586
Where are the five members
of the Directory?

401
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,674
Have they magically disappeared?

402
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:14,846
And we are here, surrounded by troops,
isolated far from Paris.

403
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,514
Order. Order!

404
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:19,434
This is becoming increasingly clear:

405
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,312
That your brother, Napoleon Bonaparte,

406
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:28,443
with his show of military might,
is acting as an outlaw.

407
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,654
A vote will solve this matter.

408
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:35,324
And that this is a ridiculous
and poorly executed takeover.

409
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:37,785
A power-hungry upstart.

410
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,163
Enough! Enough!

411
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:44,375
If there is any question
of what has happened here, I will answer!

412
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,543
How dare you?

413
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,878
This is...

414
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,297
You have violated the constitution!

415
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,757
- You have...
- Hold him!

416
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,884
- Hold him!
- Get him!

417
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,268
Arrest him!

418
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,270
Stop him!

419
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,063
Oh, fuck!

420
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:07,523
- Get him!
- Grab him!

421
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,820
Kill him!

422
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,163
Let me through!

423
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,167
Right.

424
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,797
We are being terrorized
by deputies armed with daggers.

425
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,300
And these madmen have outlawed themselves

426
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,053
by their attempt
on the liberty of this country!

427
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:40,056
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.

428
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,308
Open these doors!

429
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:48,022
Let us out of here!

430
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:53,110
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people.

431
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,988
Get in there now!

432
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,074
Fuck!

433
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,413
Move. Move. Get back. Back.

434
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,041
Move it! Move it!

435
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,046
- Back. Back. Move back.
- Move back. Out of the way.

436
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:13,840
Move now!

437
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,924
Backwards.

438
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,682
Good luck, brother.

439
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,360
Stand aside.

440
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,165
Shall we vote?

441
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,087
Where are we going?

442
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,800
All our harsh words are behind us.

443
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,139
I need you to be my most tender friend.

444
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:10,187
Over this door is our destiny.

445
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,891
Present arms!

446
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,446
First Consul.

447
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,366
Milady.

448
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,163
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

449
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:52,707
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

450
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,208
First Consul.

451
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,838
Come, little one.

452
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:02,800
You get into the bed of your master's.

453
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,983
Hello, madame!

454
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,693
Hello, good evening.

455
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,783
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

456
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,201
It's good to meet you.

457
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,630
Could this be Joséphine?

458
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:45,342
- Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
- Good to see you.

459
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:46,969
Oh!

460
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:49,764
It's Charles. This way.

461
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,900
"Your Majesty,

462
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,235
England and France
are wasting their prosperity."

463
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,320
Let me try again.

464
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,033
Your Royal Majesty, England and France

465
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,993
are wasting their prosperity...

466
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:14,121
- Your... Your Majesty.
- What did I say?

467
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,417
"Your Royal Majesty."

468
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:20,544
Your Royal Ma...

469
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:25,800
"Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity."

470
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:30,429
I am not ashamed to take the initiative.

471
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:33,265
I have, I think,
sufficiently proven to the whole world

472
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:36,227
that I do not fear the chances of war.

473
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,941
"But peace is my heartfelt wish
for England and France."

474
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,318
Read it back to me.

475
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,531
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

476
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:52,284
I have addressed letters
to all diplomatic agents abroad,

477
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:56,580
and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

478
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:57,665
Caulaincourt.

479
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:01,377
What I need from you
is a better understanding

480
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,879
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

481
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:07,341
Would you consider the tsar
an ally to England or France?

482
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:12,763
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

483
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,223
than his trade with France.

484
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,100
And do you have a sense of...

485
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,811
British influence in the Russian courts?

486
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,522
I do not,
but I imagine it is quite robust.

487
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,899
Robust?

488
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,824
What kind of man is he? Describe him.

489
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,577
Well, he's young.

490
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:37,955
He's vain.

491
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,500
He's popular, and he wishes to remain so.

492
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,626
He's popular?

493
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,589
Really?

494
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:50,301
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

495
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:56,974
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

496
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,228
So he needs an ally
that he can also call a friend.

497
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,361
No more bets.

498
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,241
What a surprise.

499
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,827
How nice to see you out.

500
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,038
Excuse me, gentlemen.

501
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,707
Good evening.
I'm just trying to lose some money.

502
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,790
Ah.

503
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,461
Well, after this hand,
why don't you come and join me?

504
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,046
I'm at my usual table.

505
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,464
That's a lovely idea.

506
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,383
Good evening.

507
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,054
Mm. Did you hear?

508
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:41,894
Your Majesty received a letter of peace
from the First Consul today.

509
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:47,274
Monsieur Talleyrand, if I may be honest?

510
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,027
- Of course.
- Austria's coalition with England

511
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,072
is in such a strong position
against France,

512
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:58,160
that these peace overtures
are clearly only for your handling

513
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,663
of French public opinion.

514
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:02,623
Oh, my friend.

515
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,794
- You know me so well.
- Hm.

516
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:11,006
Yes, it is true,
it is public opinion Napoleon is after,

517
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:14,093
but my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

518
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,262
as any man in the history of the world.

519
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,055
So my suggestion, with respect,

520
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:22,017
would be to take
this little offering of peace from him.

521
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:30,693
Or suffer the consequences
from a man bent on peace at any cost.

522
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,990
The English ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
has arrived, Consul.

523
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:48,043
Do not look at me as if you don't know
what I'm about to say.

524
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:52,506
Are you aware of my letter of peace
to your king?

525
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:54,216
I am not.

526
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,052
Shall I repeat it?

527
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:00,180
No, you may not.

528
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:03,142
Take this as a warning to your king.

529
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,894
I will keep you guessing and scared.

530
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,147
You will watch your borders and your back,

531
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,233
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

532
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:13,569
I will offer no more letters of peace,

533
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:18,198
and I will take the lack of a swift reply
as an act of disrespect!

534
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:21,410
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

535
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:28,083
'Tis a shame such a great man
should have no manners.

536
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:42,473
Yes?

537
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,018
Are you pleased?

538
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:51,231
Are you about to tell me something
that will make me angry?

539
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,567
Let's hope not.

540
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:58,781
The European families think
nothing more of you than a Corsican thug.

541
01:00:58,864 --> 01:00:59,865
Therefore...

542
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,495
I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

543
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:10,209
I suggest that you abandon your role
as First Consul of France...

544
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,714
in exchange
for the title "Victorious Consul."

545
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,052
By another name, "king."

546
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:23,972
What?

547
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:26,558
"King."

548
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,062
Uh... yes. King.

549
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:33,649
King?

550
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:48,247
Mmm...

551
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,337
My hair has been set.

552
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,132
The way you like it.

553
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,595
Oh, you filthy man.

554
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,222
My hair has been set now.

555
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,562
I have the most beautiful wife.

556
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,730
I... All right, come on, then.

557
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,734
Hat off.

558
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,660
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

559
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:29,621
- You feel that?
- What?

560
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,292
Can you feel that? That's yours.

561
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,044
That's yours. It's yours.

562
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:37,129
Thank you.

563
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,644
Oh...

564
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,856
Mmm...

565
01:02:58,484 --> 01:02:59,735
Oh?

566
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:01,862
Stop.

567
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,198
Why aren't you pregnant?

568
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:07,701
Hm.

569
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,788
Is that a question,
or is that an accusation?

570
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:13,664
Hm.

571
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,085
It was a question.

572
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,839
Now it's an accusation.

573
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,596
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart
and he has no answer.

574
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,520
Only that I do
what Madame de Rémusat has done.

575
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:37,773
Which is?

576
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,359
Which is...

577
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,614
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

578
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,659
he suggested
I take the waters at Aix-la-Chapelle.

579
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,288
And why haven't you?

580
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,459
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

581
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,504
I spend many hours cleaning up after you.

582
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,051
Find the time.

583
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:11,557
I don't need to explain to you
the importance of this, do I?

584
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:13,976
What, you want an heir?

585
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,061
I want one now.

586
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,497
Oh, my God.

587
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:27,049
May God affirm you on His throne...

588
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,305
and Christ give you to rule with Him
in His eternal kingdom.

589
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:02,668
I found the crown of France in the gutter.

590
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:09,132
I picked it up with the tip of my sword
and cleaned it...

591
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:13,220
and place it atop my own head.

592
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:45,043
The most glorious,
the most august Napoleon,

593
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,629
emperor of the French,

594
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:51,341
is crowned and enthroned!

595
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:53,719
Long live the emperor!

596
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:56,304
Long live the emperor!

597
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,807
Long live the emperor!

598
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:40,640
I do not support this idea.

599
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:43,393
You suggest divorce after years of debate.

600
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,520
You can see that it has me divided.

601
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:53,153
I am not ambitious.
I've never declared war with anyone.

602
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,824
No.

603
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:04,498
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

604
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,541
and the world's only chance at peace.

605
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,174
The security of the empire
and peace in the world

606
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,717
depends upon an heir.

607
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:24,392
It was an option.

608
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:27,854
And I said it at the time.

609
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,613
Are you enjoying yourself?

610
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,535
I'm going to war to defend our people,

611
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,830
and my wife cannot provide me an heir.

612
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,211
If you do not bear me a child tonight...

613
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:54,506
there will be a divorce.

614
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:00,345
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

615
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:02,556
Yes, there has.

616
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,686
There have been years of it. Years.

617
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,689
And with more than just me.

618
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,316
And still...

619
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:15,569
you are empty.

620
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,320
And you're fat.

621
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,158
I enjoy my meals. I do.

622
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:24,911
Destiny has brought me here.

623
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,497
Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.

624
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,857
Joséphine.

625
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,362
Come, then.

626
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:01,948
Come.

627
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,417
I love your talents and your taste.

628
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,589
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

629
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,424
And your dignity.

630
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,594
And I will come back to you.

631
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,713
To today's victory. Hm?

632
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,966
Look, I'm always here for you, Francis.

633
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,553
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

634
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,473
I should not deceive you, Alexander.

635
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,726
This battle against him
will be brutal and terrifying.

636
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:38,378
Come on!

637
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:40,338
Get in defensive position!

638
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:52,600
My good wife, Joséphine,

639
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,936
my God, it's cold here.

640
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,272
I miss your warmth.

641
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:02,318
On this day, we celebrate
the first anniversary of our coronation.

642
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,823
My previous ally has now joined
with my enemy.

643
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:11,703
The Russian Tsar Alexander joined forces
with the prince of Austria.

644
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:14,748
I have heard
that he's been studying the art of war

645
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,292
and trying to emulate my battle tactics.

646
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,209
More fires.

647
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:19,627
He tries to copy me,

648
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,590
but he is a little boy
who will make a terrible mistake.

649
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:27,052
I am certain I will bring
the laurels of another glorious victory

650
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,219
to my army today.

651
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,347
Yours, Napoleon.

652
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:49,783
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.

653
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:50,867
That's it.

654
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,626
Fuck.

655
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,267
- Your Majesty.
- Hm?

656
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,102
We are discovered.

657
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:02,147
Good.

658
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:04,816
Tell the men to rest.

659
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,306
I...

660
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,223
N...

661
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,433
F...

662
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,560
S.

663
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,354
Infantry sighted.

664
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,368
I...

665
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,828
M...

666
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:01,414
T.

667
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,751
Imminent!

668
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,505
Stand to!

669
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:12,258
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

670
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:14,052
- Stand to!
- Stand to.

671
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:17,305
- Wake up, men. Get ready!
- Stand to!

672
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,057
Come on, get up!

673
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:48,127
Wait, wait.

674
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,212
Ready!

675
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,966
Wait! Let them think
they have the higher ground.

676
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,096
Fire!

677
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,809
Fire away!

678
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,277
Fire at will!

679
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,200
Send in the infantry.

680
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:03,745
Take their position on the higher ground.
At the double.

681
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:06,622
Take the ground!

682
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,282
Cavalry from the west.
Pierce their flanks.

683
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:58,383
Retreat! Withdraw!

684
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,134
Withdraw!

685
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:12,897
It's a trap!

686
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,320
Retreat!

687
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,945
- Uncover the cannons.
- Cannons!

688
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,285
- Fire!
- Fire!

689
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,290
Reloading!

690
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,185
Keep to the one side.

691
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,115
Off the ice!

692
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,501
Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

693
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,631
Off the ice! Withdraw!

694
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:51,639
Cut off their retreat.

695
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,693
Francis. So nice to finally meet you.

696
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:47,653
Please come in where it's warm.

697
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,073
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.

698
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,618
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

699
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:58,831
Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

700
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,958
Well, we do what we can
on the battlefield.

701
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,377
Yes, we do, don't we?

702
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,255
It's nice to finally meet another emperor.

703
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,717
Where, may I ask, is Alexander?

704
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,303
Are we waiting for his arrival
before we get started?

705
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:16,098
I do not believe he will be joining us.

706
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:18,434
He's beside himself with rage.

707
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:25,775
I realize I must compliment you
for making me commit an enormous error.

708
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:28,235
- An error?
- Yes.

709
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,197
What error have you made?

710
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:36,452
To be speaking with you here
and accepting this invitation for peace,

711
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,579
I have not followed up my victory.

712
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:43,584
I could have taken the whole Russian
and Austrian army prisoners.

713
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,004
Yes.

714
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,882
But after all, there will be less tears.

715
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,680
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

716
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,015
Thank you.

717
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:03,813
Toast?

718
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:16,409
To friendship, a glorious peace...

719
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:19,370
and the best interests of Europe.

720
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:27,586
Mmm. Burgundy.

721
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:51,402
Hold on.

722
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:52,945
Hey, whoa!

723
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:56,699
Whoa, we don't say woof. Okay.

724
01:23:57,867 --> 01:24:00,828
That's my boy. Attaboy.

725
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,455
Come here, come here. Sit.

726
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:21,766
It is time
to put this mystery to rest, emperor.

727
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:25,186
I want to know if it's you or Joséphine.

728
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:32,067
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

729
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:38,073
At the end of the hallway... Take this.

730
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:43,037
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,

731
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:48,334
is 18-year-old
Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne.

732
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,672
She's brunette with brown eyes.

733
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:58,344
And the object of this, well,
hardly unpleasant task...

734
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:01,722
is to see if you can father a child.

735
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:06,936
And then we will have an answer
to this nagging question

736
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:12,191
of who is keeping who
from an heir to the throne of France.

737
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:20,366
- Shall we go?
- May I have another, please?

738
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,470
The girl is pregnant.
You made her pregnant.

739
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,054
Hm!

740
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:39,320
I know I didn't hear her.

741
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:48,662
When are you going to insist we divorce?

742
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:51,999
Isn't that wonderful?

743
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,922
From the only woman that I've ever loved
and given all that I've conquered.

744
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,590
I'm just too tired...

745
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,094
to wait for you to tell me
what I know is coming.

746
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:07,765
If you insist.

747
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:13,270
I'll make it easier for you.

748
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:22,071
I know you will have a bastard child.

749
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:31,330
If I succeed in making the birth of a boy
that I shall call my own son,

750
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:36,126
I want you as a witness
to pretend the confinement of the empress.

751
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,255
Your Highness, you are asking me

752
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:42,883
to lie about the status
of the mother of your heir.

753
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,553
That is another way of putting it, yes.

754
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:49,890
Emperor,

755
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:56,146
it is my honor and my duty, of course,
to do as you require of me.

756
01:27:56,230 --> 01:28:00,609
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

757
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,487
And painful though it is,

758
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,614
the truth is that the empress

759
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:08,283
is no longer capable
of bearing you a child.

760
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,588
My good Joséphine.

761
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:24,882
Mmm?

762
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,387
You know how I've loved you.

763
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:34,601
It is you, to you alone...

764
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:39,398
that I owe the few moments of happiness
I have known in this world.

765
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:40,482
Hm.

766
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,156
My destiny is more powerful than my will.

767
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:55,205
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

768
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:20,189
The imperial decree
for the dissolution of the marriage...

769
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:25,110
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

770
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:39,291
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

771
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,251
would be given to my children.

772
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,924
However, I have lost hope
of having children from my marriage

773
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,802
to my beloved wife, Empress Joséphine.

774
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,765
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the State

775
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:58,393
"and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

776
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:10,155
You have embellished my life for 15 years.

777
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:17,913
The memories of which will remain
forever etched in my heart.

778
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:37,975
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France."

779
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,229
She has been deprived...

780
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:46,483
of one day being governed
by the descendants

781
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:48,944
of the man brought to us by providence

782
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:52,030
to mend the evils of a terrible revolution

783
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:55,784
"and restore faith, the throne,
and the social order."

784
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:02,666
Sorry.

785
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,421
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen. All right?

786
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:10,716
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

787
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:11,925
Now say it.

788
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:14,135
Say it.

789
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:24,313
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France."

790
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:29,318
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

791
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,987
as I must, does not change my feelings.

792
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:44,458
"The emperor will have in me
always his truest friend."

793
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,534
Emperor,

794
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:23,914
you have just pronounced the word
which separates us forever.

795
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:28,001
Your mistaken ambition has ever been...

796
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:32,881
and will continue to be,
the guide of all your actions.

797
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:34,841
Nevertheless...

798
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:39,805
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.

799
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:44,142
May it at least afford me
some consolation for my sufferings.

800
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,311
Yours...

801
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:47,229
Thank you.

802
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:48,438
...Joséphine.

803
01:32:48,522 --> 01:32:50,857
- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?

804
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:53,068
- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.

805
01:33:55,714 --> 01:33:56,715
I miss you.

806
01:34:02,179 --> 01:34:04,306
Marital life is very agreeable now.

807
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:11,313
You've shown such great courage so far.

808
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:15,275
You must maintain it.

809
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:19,696
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

810
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:27,245
You look best when you're happy.

811
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,210
Please take care of your health.

812
01:34:34,378 --> 01:34:35,754
It is precious to me.

813
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:38,340
Will you write me tomorrow?

814
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:40,716
Mm-hm.

815
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:43,929
And the next day?

816
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:45,680
Yes.

817
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,016
And the day after that?

818
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,142
Mm-hm.

819
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,063
And the day after that?

820
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,109
Good.

821
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,748
Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

822
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:16,086
He said, "You French,
you fight only for money,

823
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,547
while we English, we fight for honor."

824
01:35:19,673 --> 01:35:23,343
I replied,
"Everyone fights for what they lack."

825
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:29,516
Uh... this is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

826
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:30,725
Of course it did.

827
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,060
- Of course it did.
- What?

828
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:34,396
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

829
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,605
Do you?

830
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:37,649
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

831
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,234
Listen, there is...

832
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,697
There's nothing
I think we can agree more with...

833
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,741
than our hatred for Britain.

834
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:51,413
I just have to say that...

835
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:54,207
it actually...

836
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,794
It would be my absolute pleasure and honor
if I could call you my brother.

837
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:03,508
There is a way for you to call me brother.

838
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:08,930
Last night, at dinner, I was...

839
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,435
charmed by your sister.

840
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,146
Is she spoken for?

841
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:17,314
Ah.

842
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:21,860
Sadly, yes. She's to be married
to the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

843
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,113
And what of her younger sister? Anna?

844
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:28,033
Is there a formal offer for Anna?

845
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,287
Ha.

846
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:38,543
Uh... well, you see,
Anna, she's 15 years old.

847
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:40,837
That is a detail.

848
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:48,929
Our friendship is built
on our mutual distrust of England.

849
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:53,850
When we hold to the Continental blockade,
we choke them from the trade,

850
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:56,394
and we fight for our most sacred rights.

851
01:36:56,478 --> 01:37:00,232
That is what is important between us.
I've just had a thought.

852
01:37:00,941 --> 01:37:02,275
- No.
- No, say it.

853
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:03,985
- Should I tell you?
- Please.

854
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:08,365
Imagine an army. Fifty thousand men.

855
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:11,618
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

856
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,371
marching by way of Constantinople
into Asia

857
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:17,457
would have only to reach the Euphrates
to make England tremble

858
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,168
and bring her down on her knees
before the Continent.

859
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,006
It is incredible.

860
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:27,259
Toast.

861
01:37:34,015 --> 01:37:35,517
- To you.
- To us.

862
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:39,354
His Majesty the Emperor Napoleon

863
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:44,025
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria
and to His Majesty King Francis...

864
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:48,572
for the hand
of the Archduchess Marie Louise.

865
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:51,283
His eldest daughter.

866
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:53,659
Oh.

867
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:57,581
Uh, this union would bring together
Austria and France

868
01:37:57,664 --> 01:37:59,958
in an unbreakable matrimonial bond.

869
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:03,670
Is this a joke?

870
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:12,804
I may find it humorous...
but His Majesty does not.

871
01:38:30,739 --> 01:38:32,282
Did you have a pleasant journey?

872
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:34,159
It was wonderful. Thank you.

873
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,291
You're quite petite.

874
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:43,835
I'm not accustomed to that.

875
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,007
How do I look to you?

876
01:38:50,634 --> 01:38:52,385
Do I resemble my portrait?

877
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:53,970
Oh, yes.

878
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:57,349
And even more handsome and strong.

879
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:02,103
And you are even more handsome.
More beautiful.

880
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,566
I hope you're pleased with your choice.

881
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:10,987
I hope so too.
Would you like to see the bedroom?

882
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:13,406
Yes, thank you.

883
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:27,921
Your Majesty? Your son.

884
01:39:47,273 --> 01:39:48,983
Hello.

885
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:53,905
Fire!

886
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,199
Oh.

887
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:03,665
My little king.

888
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:11,548
Hyah!

889
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,239
Oh, sweet child.

890
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:29,667
One day...

891
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:34,380
you will understand
what I have sacrificed for you.

892
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:47,268
My dear Joséphine, I'm sad today.

893
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:51,773
Tsar Alexander has turned against me
and forced me to invade Russia.

894
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:55,026
He's decided
to open his ports to England...

895
01:41:55,568 --> 01:41:57,320
while taxing the French.

896
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:02,158
I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.

897
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:06,412
I've convinced the heads of Europe
of this resolution,

898
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:11,000
and so I command the combined forces
of France, Austria, Italy,

899
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:13,169
Germany, and Poland.

900
01:42:13,253 --> 01:42:16,089
I see nothing but success in my future.

901
01:42:16,673 --> 01:42:18,967
Keep your lines. Steady.

902
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,428
To the front.

903
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,848
Keep your step.

904
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:33,481
- Take cover!
- Get down!

905
01:42:39,946 --> 01:42:42,699
Get down! Get down!

906
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:57,046
After them! After them!

907
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,925
- Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
- Fall back!

908
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:50,868
My dear Joséphine...

909
01:44:52,745 --> 01:44:56,165
I'm writing to you because
I have just won a great battle today.

910
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:00,586
Tomorrow we will resume our advance.

911
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:03,089
Moscow is now only 200 miles away.

912
01:45:03,172 --> 01:45:06,634
And I think of you all the while.
All yours.

913
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:08,218
Nearly there.

914
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:17,478
Thank you, sir.

915
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:27,447
- Thank you, emperor.
- You are the brave of Austerlitz.

916
01:46:32,637 --> 01:46:33,846
Where are you?!

917
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:49,654
Three hundred thousand souls
lived in this city.

918
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:52,949
And they've all just left?

919
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:14,554
Little boy.

920
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:21,352
Where are you?

921
01:47:26,065 --> 01:47:27,608
Don't be frightened.

922
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:31,195
I'm just gonna give you a little spanking.

923
01:48:01,684 --> 01:48:03,227
It's not very sporting, is it?

924
01:48:05,104 --> 01:48:07,315
For his honor and Russia's, not mine.

925
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,197
There's dignity to be had in defeat.

926
01:48:57,949 --> 01:48:58,991
Who did this?

927
01:49:00,368 --> 01:49:01,369
They did.

928
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:06,707
No, they did not. Be sensible.

929
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:10,378
Who set these fires?

930
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,464
Your Majesty...

931
01:49:14,966 --> 01:49:15,967
they did.

932
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:24,267
He'd rather burn his own city
than negotiate with me.

933
01:49:25,017 --> 01:49:27,019
I didn't think he had the courage.

934
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:38,114
Well, we'll go to St. Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

935
01:49:40,491 --> 01:49:43,494
We have let too much time slip away.

936
01:49:45,288 --> 01:49:48,499
We would be marching
into the Russian winter...

937
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:53,629
with horses that are not raised
for this weather.

938
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:58,592
If we go back to Poland,
we can wait out the winter months.

939
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,095
Hm?

940
01:50:14,025 --> 01:50:17,361
Napoleon, your letters
are a soothing balm to my heart.

941
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:19,488
I fear for you.

942
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:23,951
Remember that I alone
know your health, your fears.

943
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:28,289
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.

944
01:50:28,998 --> 01:50:29,999
Joséphine.

945
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:33,377
My friend, Joséphine.

946
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:35,629
"Friend."

947
01:50:36,714 --> 01:50:39,091
It is strange to write that word to you.

948
01:50:40,092 --> 01:50:42,136
You have always been so much more.

949
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:55,024
Despite careful organization,
there have been breakdowns in supply.

950
01:50:56,734 --> 01:51:01,447
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.

951
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:04,617
We are winning.

952
01:51:16,837 --> 01:51:20,132
- That us or Cossacks?
- Us.

953
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:24,553
Joséphine.

954
01:51:26,222 --> 01:51:28,099
Fortune has abandoned me.

955
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:31,519
I know that it is what fate has for me.

956
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:34,688
Your words rattle in my head.

957
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:38,150
I am nothing without you.

958
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:46,409
Of the 600,000 men you sent to Russia,

959
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:48,744
only 40,000 have returned.

960
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:51,997
Therefore, you have been exiled...

961
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:55,000
in no uncertain terms.

962
01:51:56,919 --> 01:52:01,715
The allied coalition of Austria,
Prussia, Russia, and England...

963
01:52:03,676 --> 01:52:06,011
and with the agreement
of the French Council...

964
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:10,683
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

965
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:15,813
A revenue of 2 million francs
from the French funds...

966
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:20,109
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie Louise.

967
01:52:21,277 --> 01:52:26,449
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties...

968
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:31,871
and an allotted annual income
of 1 million francs.

969
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:02,568
I love France too much.

970
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:10,034
All I've desired was its glory.

971
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:14,997
I would never bring her misfortune.

972
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:18,918
They want me to abdicate.

973
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,171
Fine, I'll abdicate.

974
01:54:28,946 --> 01:54:29,989
Your Highness.

975
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:32,741
Empress.

976
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:48,799
Here.

977
01:54:53,554 --> 01:54:56,015
Joséphine, Joséphine. Mm.

978
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,601
I am charmed.

979
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:01,645
But...

980
01:55:06,275 --> 01:55:10,362
you do not have to lock yourself away
just because he's not here.

981
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:14,658
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

982
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:17,494
But your eyes,

983
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:19,955
your charm...

984
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,207
and your spirit...

985
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:24,627
it is in there.

986
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:29,006
It is yours, and you can use it.

987
01:56:13,008 --> 01:56:14,343
Dear Joséphine.

988
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:18,263
You are mine. You will always be.

989
01:56:19,765 --> 01:56:21,684
I cannot stand it any longer.

990
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:24,687
It has been 300 days on this rock,

991
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:28,649
and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:

992
01:56:29,358 --> 01:56:31,110
You and France.

993
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:50,629
I'm taking your ship.

994
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:54,216
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

995
01:57:12,985 --> 01:57:14,153
Napoleon...

996
01:57:15,237 --> 01:57:19,450
I'm a flower that opens its petals
and smiles to the sunshine...

997
01:57:20,451 --> 01:57:24,163
unconscious that the storm is near
which will lay me low

998
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:26,290
and scatter leaves to the heavens.

999
01:57:27,249 --> 01:57:29,168
Come quickly, my friend.

1000
01:57:58,906 --> 01:58:01,325
If you would open your mouth, please.

1001
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,581
Thank you.

1002
01:58:12,419 --> 01:58:13,420
Thank you.

1003
01:58:14,463 --> 01:58:17,883
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

1004
01:58:18,926 --> 01:58:20,844
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

1005
01:58:23,263 --> 01:58:24,723
But Napoleon is coming.

1006
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,893
It would be unwise
to receive any visitors.

1007
01:58:27,976 --> 01:58:29,603
But Napoleon is coming.

1008
01:58:29,686 --> 01:58:30,771
I understand.

1009
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:52,251
Just keep her comfortable.

1010
01:59:20,279 --> 01:59:21,321
Your Majesty.

1011
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:27,118
You may speak.

1012
01:59:27,536 --> 01:59:30,497
Bonaparte, Your Majesty. He has returned.

1013
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:32,708
A ship landed on the beach
in Antibes this morning,

1014
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:33,792
and they're on the march.

1015
01:59:33,876 --> 01:59:36,920
Napoleon Bonaparte
is marching towards Paris.

1016
01:59:40,299 --> 01:59:42,467
- More.
- Your Majesty.

1017
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:17,252
Afternoon, colonel.

1018
02:00:18,003 --> 02:00:19,212
Your Majesty.

1019
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:20,881
General Marchand,

1020
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:23,675
in defense of the royal government
of King Louis XVIII,

1021
02:00:24,259 --> 02:00:27,387
requests that you surrender your weapons
and cease your march,

1022
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,515
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

1023
02:00:31,725 --> 02:00:35,729
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

1024
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:39,650
I have no fight with my own Fifth Army.

1025
02:00:41,193 --> 02:00:43,070
Sir.

1026
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,704
He wishes to speak.

1027
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,165
Make ready!

1028
02:00:59,461 --> 02:01:00,504
Present.

1029
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:13,350
Soldiers of the Fifth Regiment,

1030
02:01:14,935 --> 02:01:16,228
do you recognize me?

1031
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:21,775
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

1032
02:01:23,944 --> 02:01:25,570
Yes, Emperor!

1033
02:01:31,743 --> 02:01:32,869
I miss you.

1034
02:01:35,789 --> 02:01:37,791
I'm melancholy for my home...

1035
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,712
and for our victories together.

1036
02:01:45,549 --> 02:01:46,967
I want to come home.

1037
02:01:48,343 --> 02:01:49,720
Will you join me?

1038
02:01:51,388 --> 02:01:53,223
Long live the emperor!

1039
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:56,476
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

1040
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,689
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

1041
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:06,737
Long live the emperor!

1042
02:02:07,487 --> 02:02:08,905
Long live the emperor!

1043
02:02:12,993 --> 02:02:15,328
Long live the emperor!

1044
02:02:17,664 --> 02:02:19,124
Long live the emperor!

1045
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:45,525
On May 26th, Dr. Corvisart was called...

1046
02:02:46,777 --> 02:02:52,074
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

1047
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:56,828
Her illness was diphtheria.

1048
02:02:59,998 --> 02:03:01,374
On May 29th...

1049
02:03:03,627 --> 02:03:06,004
last sacrament was given and she died.

1050
02:03:10,509 --> 02:03:12,427
And no one thought to notify me?

1051
02:03:22,646 --> 02:03:23,688
Hortense.

1052
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:27,567
Do you blame...?

1053
02:03:29,528 --> 02:03:30,612
Do you blame me?

1054
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:34,533
I don't blame you.

1055
02:03:34,616 --> 02:03:35,659
Of course not.

1056
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:41,540
I'm not to bear
the burden of responsibility...

1057
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:45,502
for the misfortunes of your mother.

1058
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:48,547
I want the letters that I wrote to her.

1059
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:52,801
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

1060
02:03:55,512 --> 02:03:56,930
Where did she keep them?

1061
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:01,601
In the cupboard in her bedroom,
next to her bed.

1062
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:06,731
What did he do with them?

1063
02:04:08,984 --> 02:04:10,652
Her valet sold them.

1064
02:04:18,076 --> 02:04:19,244
I'm sorry.

1065
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:22,998
I forgive you.

1066
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:31,256
Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

1067
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:34,968
the only title upon which
his very existence depended.

1068
02:04:36,303 --> 02:04:38,138
This congregation of allies...

1069
02:04:38,972 --> 02:04:43,185
shall form along the borders of France
and Belgium an army.

1070
02:04:43,768 --> 02:04:46,104
Seventy thousand troops from England...

1071
02:04:47,272 --> 02:04:49,733
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1072
02:04:51,943 --> 02:04:55,906
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe...

1073
02:04:56,823 --> 02:04:58,783
while the farmers snored.

1074
02:04:59,534 --> 02:05:01,953
We should have struck this blow long ago.

1075
02:05:02,829 --> 02:05:07,125
He has held the world hostage
with his egotism,

1076
02:05:07,209 --> 02:05:10,462
his insatiable hunger for power,

1077
02:05:11,087 --> 02:05:13,965
and his lack of simple good manners.

1078
02:05:14,883 --> 02:05:17,427
We will all sleep again without him.

1079
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:23,683
I believe I speak for all of us when I say
that the only regret we all share

1080
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:27,729
is that we allowed
this vermin to live at all.

1081
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:32,609
Two hundred and fifty thousand men
with the traitor.

1082
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:39,532
Twenty-five thousand men,
125,000 men,

1083
02:05:40,367 --> 02:05:42,077
and 100,000 men...

1084
02:05:46,081 --> 02:05:49,376
against our 125,000 men.

1085
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:53,421
This is a fight on land.

1086
02:05:55,048 --> 02:05:58,385
This is what Britain does not know
how to do that I know.

1087
02:06:00,303 --> 02:06:04,266
Strike quickly
against Wellington and Blücher.

1088
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:06,768
Defeat them separately.

1089
02:06:07,894 --> 02:06:11,356
Disallow them from uniting forces here.

1090
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:26,204
- Morning.
- Morning.

1091
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:29,457
The Prussians are advancing.

1092
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:31,793
We should begin the offensive.

1093
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:34,421
We must wait for the ground to dry.

1094
02:06:37,132 --> 02:06:40,260
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1095
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,577
I never get wet if I can help it.

1096
02:08:12,102 --> 02:08:13,520
What shall I tell the men?

1097
02:08:15,397 --> 02:08:17,107
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1098
02:08:20,235 --> 02:08:24,572
- Coming through!
- In formation!

1099
02:08:26,074 --> 02:08:28,701
Now's your time, lads. Now's your time.

1100
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:31,496
Now, listen very carefully.

1101
02:08:33,081 --> 02:08:38,044
Patience is the order of the day today.
Patience shall win the day.

1102
02:08:38,837 --> 02:08:41,172
We must hold this ground.

1103
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,633
Let him come to us!

1104
02:08:50,807 --> 02:08:52,058
Go on, boys. Go on.

1105
02:08:54,185 --> 02:08:55,185
Whoa!

1106
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:57,355
Good morning, General Blücher.

1107
02:08:57,439 --> 02:08:59,899
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1108
02:08:59,983 --> 02:09:02,360
- Officer?
- About five hours.

1109
02:09:02,444 --> 02:09:04,028
About five hours.

1110
02:09:20,712 --> 02:09:21,963
Come on, boys. Come on, boys!

1111
02:09:34,601 --> 02:09:35,768
Now, there he is.

1112
02:09:36,728 --> 02:09:38,521
He appears to be...

1113
02:09:39,314 --> 02:09:42,233
just sleeping.

1114
02:09:43,943 --> 02:09:49,365
But the one thing you cannot resist,
my friend, is a frontal attack.

1115
02:09:52,327 --> 02:09:55,288
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1116
02:09:58,166 --> 02:10:03,046
Sir. I have the emperor in my sights.
Do I have permission to fire?

1117
02:10:03,129 --> 02:10:04,172
Certainly not.

1118
02:10:04,923 --> 02:10:07,526
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do with their time

1119
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:08,760
than to shoot at one another.

1120
02:10:08,843 --> 02:10:10,720
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1121
02:10:10,803 --> 02:10:14,474
- Go on, boys. Come, come!
- A runner coming through!

1122
02:10:16,059 --> 02:10:17,644
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1123
02:10:18,478 --> 02:10:20,063
Attention. Follow me.

1124
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:23,358
- Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.

1125
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:25,527
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.

1126
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:31,991
Runner coming through! Make way!

1127
02:10:32,075 --> 02:10:33,076
Whoa!

1128
02:10:36,538 --> 02:10:39,499
Prussians on the roadside, 12 miles.

1129
02:10:45,797 --> 02:10:50,051
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1130
02:10:53,388 --> 02:10:54,472
Ready the cannons.

1131
02:10:58,101 --> 02:10:59,978
Ready the cannons!

1132
02:11:02,939 --> 02:11:04,983
Go on! Move!

1133
02:11:14,409 --> 02:11:16,953
Ready! Cannons are ready!

1134
02:11:17,036 --> 02:11:19,038
Cannons are ready!

1135
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:20,665
The rain has stopped, sir.

1136
02:11:29,591 --> 02:11:31,384
Prepare to fire!

1137
02:11:40,977 --> 02:11:43,605
- Fire!
- Fire!

1138
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:51,154
Take cover!

1139
02:11:53,948 --> 02:11:56,284
Straight into position. Steady.

1140
02:11:56,868 --> 02:12:00,288
Prepare for the advance! Get ready!

1141
02:12:01,789 --> 02:12:03,249
Prepare for the advance.

1142
02:12:03,333 --> 02:12:05,418
Readjust to 1-9-5!

1143
02:12:05,501 --> 02:12:07,462
Adjust 1-9-5!

1144
02:12:07,545 --> 02:12:10,423
Elevation 1-9-5.

1145
02:12:13,343 --> 02:12:14,469
Adjusted!

1146
02:12:16,387 --> 02:12:19,265
Prepare to fire! Fire!

1147
02:12:19,349 --> 02:12:20,350
Fire!

1148
02:12:26,064 --> 02:12:29,233
Keep your heads down. Take cover!

1149
02:12:38,076 --> 02:12:40,662
- Out the way!
- Hold fast, men!

1150
02:12:44,916 --> 02:12:48,628
Infantry, advance!

1151
02:12:48,711 --> 02:12:50,838
Left company!

1152
02:12:53,257 --> 02:12:54,884
And march!

1153
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:57,178
Get in formation. Now!

1154
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:00,139
Keep the line!

1155
02:13:01,474 --> 02:13:02,475
Join!

1156
02:13:11,818 --> 02:13:15,988
- Second wave, advance!
- Over the top, men!

1157
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:18,282
Form line!

1158
02:13:18,366 --> 02:13:20,326
Cannons!

1159
02:13:21,035 --> 02:13:22,829
Fire!

1160
02:13:26,124 --> 02:13:27,208
Make ready!

1161
02:13:28,793 --> 02:13:30,086
Hold fast!

1162
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,338
Fire!

1163
02:13:41,681 --> 02:13:43,641
You there, get on that cannon.

1164
02:13:53,818 --> 02:13:54,986
Fire!

1165
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,619
Fill the gap!

1166
02:14:05,371 --> 02:14:06,914
Keep the line!

1167
02:14:14,422 --> 02:14:16,883
Skirmishers, keep advancing!

1168
02:14:16,966 --> 02:14:18,468
Get in formation.

1169
02:14:18,551 --> 02:14:20,011
Fire at will!

1170
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:27,935
Keep them back, men. Fire!

1171
02:14:31,105 --> 02:14:34,275
Go on, go on. Don't let them rally!

1172
02:14:38,529 --> 02:14:41,240
Get that gun back in strike position!

1173
02:14:41,324 --> 02:14:43,910
Get up, boys! Go on. Go on, boys!

1174
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:46,871
Whoa. Whoa.

1175
02:14:49,373 --> 02:14:52,293
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1176
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:55,463
Five miles, maybe less.

1177
02:14:57,465 --> 02:14:59,759
We have to act before Blücher arrives.

1178
02:14:59,842 --> 02:15:00,843
Out.

1179
02:15:03,721 --> 02:15:04,722
Out!

1180
02:15:16,859 --> 02:15:18,361
Cavalry!

1181
02:15:19,612 --> 02:15:21,447
Charge!

1182
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:29,956
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1183
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:32,667
Prepare to receive cavalry!

1184
02:15:41,676 --> 02:15:45,555
We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.

1185
02:15:45,638 --> 02:15:47,807
We must not be beat!

1186
02:15:48,683 --> 02:15:50,935
Or what will they say in England?

1187
02:15:51,018 --> 02:15:54,188
- Hold the line!
- Keep tight!

1188
02:15:58,526 --> 02:16:02,029
- Steady, men!
- Stay in formation.

1189
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:07,827
Long live the emperor!

1190
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:12,123
Company, halt!

1191
02:16:12,748 --> 02:16:16,127
Form square! Form square!

1192
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:34,353
Long live the emperor!

1193
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:41,360
One section, fire. Two section, fire.

1194
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:57,418
Hold that line! Fire!

1195
02:16:57,501 --> 02:17:00,421
What do we do, sir?
We can't break through.

1196
02:17:00,504 --> 02:17:02,965
- Keep them running.
- Get them back in the square!

1197
02:17:05,176 --> 02:17:07,261
Show them your British steel.

1198
02:17:19,065 --> 02:17:20,858
Present arms!

1199
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:26,197
Shoulder arms!

1200
02:17:30,618 --> 02:17:32,495
They're here, the Prussians.

1201
02:17:35,665 --> 02:17:37,541
First over the rise, emperor.

1202
02:18:03,067 --> 02:18:05,152
We need to find a way through!

1203
02:18:07,989 --> 02:18:09,991
- Break the square.
- Break the square!

1204
02:18:20,501 --> 02:18:21,919
Charge bayonets.

1205
02:18:22,712 --> 02:18:24,755
Charge bayonets!

1206
02:18:26,632 --> 02:18:30,970
Your emperor is with you!
You are the brave of Austerlitz!

1207
02:18:32,138 --> 02:18:33,681
Never surrender!

1208
02:18:34,473 --> 02:18:36,934
For homeland and glory!

1209
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:46,527
Shoulder to shoulder! Form lines!

1210
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:47,945
Shoulder to shoulder.

1211
02:18:55,327 --> 02:18:56,996
Infantry, advance.

1212
02:18:57,079 --> 02:19:00,499
Battalion and infantry!

1213
02:19:00,583 --> 02:19:03,002
Advance!

1214
02:19:08,674 --> 02:19:09,967
Keep the line!

1215
02:19:12,344 --> 02:19:14,680
First rank, fire!

1216
02:19:18,476 --> 02:19:20,728
Second rank, fire!

1217
02:19:24,482 --> 02:19:26,317
Prepare to charge!

1218
02:19:28,277 --> 02:19:29,653
Charge!

1219
02:19:36,494 --> 02:19:38,621
Go on! Batter them!

1220
02:19:40,623 --> 02:19:43,250
Advance! Advance!

1221
02:19:55,012 --> 02:19:56,388
Cavalry advance, sir?

1222
02:19:57,515 --> 02:19:58,766
Cavalry advance.

1223
02:20:04,939 --> 02:20:06,649
Full support!

1224
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:45,396
No. He can't help himself.

1225
02:20:46,647 --> 02:20:48,357
Sir, Blücher.

1226
02:20:55,197 --> 02:20:56,490
Thank God.

1227
02:20:56,574 --> 02:20:58,909
Your Majesty!

1228
02:20:59,869 --> 02:21:01,537
Your Majesty!

1229
02:21:02,788 --> 02:21:05,708
Come see how a Marshal of France dies!

1230
02:21:05,791 --> 02:21:07,209
Hyah!

1231
02:21:35,321 --> 02:21:36,989
Hyah! Hyah!

1232
02:22:11,232 --> 02:22:15,903
The battle is mine.
There will be an end to the war.

1233
02:22:23,452 --> 02:22:25,120
Senior officer, on deck!

1234
02:22:27,831 --> 02:22:29,875
Good day. Good day. Good day.

1235
02:22:32,962 --> 02:22:35,214
I am the first to admit
when I make a mistake.

1236
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:37,758
But I never do.

1237
02:22:38,384 --> 02:22:40,177
Because it is geometry.

1238
02:22:41,679 --> 02:22:44,515
I simply know precisely
where to place a cannon.

1239
02:22:45,683 --> 02:22:50,354
But, tragically, I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals.

1240
02:22:51,313 --> 02:22:54,441
That might be
what is most difficult in life.

1241
02:22:56,485 --> 02:22:58,279
Accepting the failures of others.

1242
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:00,656
You must not do that.

1243
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:04,493
Encourage greatness.

1244
02:23:09,623 --> 02:23:10,874
Mind your head, sir.

1245
02:23:13,877 --> 02:23:15,379
Mind your head, sir.

1246
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,848
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1247
02:23:25,931 --> 02:23:26,932
Get them out.

1248
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:29,101
Clear the room. Quickly.

1249
02:23:45,409 --> 02:23:47,453
- Your Grace...
- Good morning, general.

1250
02:23:47,536 --> 02:23:49,079
These boys are delightful.

1251
02:23:50,622 --> 02:23:52,583
- May I sit down?
- Please.

1252
02:23:54,335 --> 02:23:55,544
And this breakfast.

1253
02:23:56,628 --> 02:23:59,131
Now I know why you have
such a successful navy.

1254
02:24:00,174 --> 02:24:01,175
Thank you.

1255
02:24:06,764 --> 02:24:09,266
I've never visited
the English countryside.

1256
02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:11,352
I imagine I'll love the Cotswolds.

1257
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:18,108
Soft rolling hills, gentle light.

1258
02:24:19,735 --> 02:24:24,073
My dear sir,
it is only by a narrow margin of opinion

1259
02:24:24,156 --> 02:24:26,408
that you have been spared
the fate of being shot.

1260
02:24:28,243 --> 02:24:30,496
Politically, I'm afraid it's impossible

1261
02:24:30,579 --> 02:24:33,916
for the British government
to allow you to stay in England.

1262
02:24:35,918 --> 02:24:38,921
You are permitted three officers
and 12 servants

1263
02:24:39,004 --> 02:24:41,340
to accompany you into exile.

1264
02:24:42,174 --> 02:24:45,886
Exile will be contained
to the island of Saint Helena,

1265
02:24:45,969 --> 02:24:50,432
under the watchful eye
of Governor Hudson Lowe and his family.

1266
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:53,811
Saint...

1267
02:24:55,062 --> 02:24:56,062
Helena.

1268
02:24:57,064 --> 02:24:58,273
It's a small island.

1269
02:24:59,483 --> 02:25:00,859
More of a rock, really.

1270
02:25:02,027 --> 02:25:04,822
A thousand miles
from the mainland of Africa.

1271
02:25:05,531 --> 02:25:09,993
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1272
02:25:11,662 --> 02:25:13,872
Your correspondence will be monitored,

1273
02:25:13,956 --> 02:25:17,501
your presence verified twice daily
by the orderly officer.

1274
02:25:27,803 --> 02:25:31,140
- Fix that rigging line.
- Draw in the sails!

1275
02:25:32,599 --> 02:25:33,851
Go below deck!

1276
02:25:43,068 --> 02:25:47,364
What will you do now?
I hate to see you alone.

1277
02:25:48,782 --> 02:25:50,200
Will you come to me?

1278
02:25:52,161 --> 02:25:53,579
Will I forgive you?

1279
02:25:55,247 --> 02:25:57,416
My sweet, stubborn emperor.

1280
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,336
I let you loose and let you come to ruin.

1281
02:26:02,671 --> 02:26:07,718
Next time, I will be emperor
and you will do as I say.

1282
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:17,936
Well, you were right.

1283
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:21,857
Every night I beg to see you in my dreams.

1284
02:26:22,774 --> 02:26:26,028
And when I do, you turn me away.

1285
02:26:58,644 --> 02:27:00,854
Girls, what's the capital of France?

1286
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:03,941
Paris.

1287
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:05,692
And Russia?

1288
02:27:06,401 --> 02:27:08,779
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1289
02:27:10,656 --> 02:27:11,657
Moscow.

1290
02:27:13,116 --> 02:27:15,202
And who burnt Moscow to the ground?

1291
02:27:19,373 --> 02:27:20,457
I don't know, sir.

1292
02:27:21,833 --> 02:27:22,834
I did.

1293
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:27,965
I believe, sir, the Russians burnt it
to get rid of the French.

1294
02:27:28,048 --> 02:27:29,132
Who told you that?

1295
02:27:29,841 --> 02:27:31,468
It's common knowledge, sir.

1296
02:27:35,430 --> 02:27:37,808
Go. Go play.

1297
02:27:43,564 --> 02:27:46,149
Can I tell you
what I have waiting for you?

1298
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:52,531
It is a secret.
And I will show you when you arrive.

1299
02:27:56,076 --> 02:27:57,995
Come to me, Napoleon.

1300
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,498
And let's try this again.
