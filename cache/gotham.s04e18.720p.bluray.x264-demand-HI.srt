I know my recent appointment

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,649
and perhaps a bit
of a shock to some.

Did you see what just happened?

That man's a raving bloody lunatic.
He can't be trusted.

330

For once, I agree with Alfred.

we can prevent more deaths.

What's the plan?

334
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,488
Jerome is using
a short-wave radio trigger

335
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,663
with a dead man's switch.

336
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,785
If we can cut the signal,

337
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,457
he won't be able to activate
the explosives.

338
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,876
This emits a powerful signal

339
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,874
that disables all radio waves
close to it.

340
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,956
Once within a few feet
of Jerome's device,

341
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,210
his trigger will be useless.

342
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,883
It will give us the time
for the snipers

343
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,131
to get a clean shot on Jerome,
Firefly, and the others.

344
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,757
If I wear this, then that gives you
time to take them out?

345
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,929
Correct.

346
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,257
Are you sure it's gonna work?

347
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,225
