What do I want from him? He's my father.

167
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,156
Do I need to want something?

168
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,372
I'm sure he loves me dearly,
as any father loves his child, his baby boy.

169
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,084
Yet he hasn't come to visit once...

170
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,961
- Hmm.
- ...since arriving in King's Landing.

171
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,005
I lay here, my face split in half,

172
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,424
but Father never came.

173
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,141
You're going to make me cry.

174
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,643
Why do you care what I want from him?

175
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,188
Because
you've slandered me to Father before.

176
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,440
Slandered? When?

177
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,361
You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

178
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,698
You did have your
guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.

179
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,575
I was nine, too.

180
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,493
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

181
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,287
If I remember correctly,

182
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,122
she never stole a necklace again. (LAUGHS)

183
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,835
It's not slander if it's true.

184
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,671
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

185
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,508
Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?

186
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,802
Because you're a liar.

187
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:54,055
I expect you'll
tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

188
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,558
Any lies in particular?

189
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,812
(SIGHS) You're a clever man,

190
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,898
but not as clever as you think you are.

191
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,817
Mmm. Still makes me more clever than you.

Ah.

194
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,741
Look at these two shining warriors.

195
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,454
Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.

196
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,331
Ser Meryn Trant.

197
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,875
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

198
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,710
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

199
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,048
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
was anointed by the king himself.

200
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:32,219
You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.

201
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,304
That's exactly who I am.

202
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,264
And you're a grub in fancy armor

203
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,601
who's better at
beating little girls than fighting men.

204
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,354
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

205
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,065
You put your hand on that door,

206
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,483
you lose the hand.

207
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,253
As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine,

208
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,296
I am wondering why you sent for me.

209
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,925
Many people in this
city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.

210
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,261
I've been doing that for a while now.

211
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,595
Do you grow bored protecting me?

212
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,013
I grow poor protecting you.

213
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,599
Poor? Poor?

214
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,434
Under my patronage you've become a knight,

215
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,478
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

216
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,854
Briefly.

217
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,314
I'm sure you filled your pockets.

218
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,441
And now my pockets are empty.

219
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,777
You've given me a taste for the finer things.

220
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,322
And if you want me
protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

221
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,490
I thought we were friends.

222
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,700
We are.

223
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,994
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.

224
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,288
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

225
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,747
- How much?
- Double.

226
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,832
Double?

227
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm a knight now.

228
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,459
Knights are worth double.

229
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,920
I don't even know
how much I'm paying you now.

230
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,047
Which means you can afford it.

Who are you?

240
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,921
I was in the battle at Blackwater.

241
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,967
I was a captain and a knight.

242
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,970
Aye, ser, and serving which king?

243
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,104
The one true king of Westeros,

244
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,151
Stannis Baratheon.

245
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,287
I thought you were dead.

246
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,832
Everyone thought you were dead.

247
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,337
And your son?

248
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,720
He may have swam ashore as you did.

249
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,849
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

250
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,278
I'm so sorry, my friend.

251
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,907
I, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.

252
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,413
But, Davos, you were a good father.

253
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,375
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

254
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,588
Stannis lives?

255
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,047
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

256
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,591
Will you take me there?

257
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,844
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

258
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,429
This war is not over.

259
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,683
Not for you, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

260
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,602
We're both sworn to King Stannis.

261
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,979
I am sworn to no man.

262
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,900
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.

263
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,401
I delivered the ships.

264
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,653
Stannis never gives up. Never.

265
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,863
Now he will regroup...

266
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,156
He's a broken man.

267
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,700
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

268
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,078
They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.

269
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:15,585
Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames

270
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,505
and burning men alive.

271
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,797
What?

272
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,551
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.

273

All those who spoke
against her she called servants of darkness.

274

They say she sang to them as they burned.

275

I'm a pirate.

276

You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.

277
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,283
I'm thinking Dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.

278
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,868
Take me back there, please.

279
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,663
(SCOFFS) You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

280
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,915
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

281
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,124
You could try.

282
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,419
If you fail, they will burn you.

283
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,214
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

284
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,424
And you've only just come back to life.

285
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,718
(CHUCKLES) Stay alive
a little longer, my friend.

286
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,471
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.

287
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,557
And you drank with me on four of mine,

288
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,725
but I don't ask you for favors.

289
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,980
I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.

290
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,735
When you are dead,

291
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,238
I will gather your bones in a little sack

and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

We should set
the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

294

There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

have been running from us since Oxcross.

I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.

298

Are you enjoying your new position?

328
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,644
Am I enjoying it?

329
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:25,895
I was very happy as Hand of the King.

330
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,188
(TYWIN CHUCKLES)

331
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,108
Yes. I heard how happy you were.

(BLOWS)

333
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,655
You brought a whore into my bed.

334
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,033
It wasn't your bed at the time.

335
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,704
I sent you here to advise the king.

336
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,875
I gave you real power and authority.

337
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,169
You chose to spend your days

338
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,463
as you always have,

339
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:57,093
bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.

340
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,973
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

341
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,308
What do you want, Tyrion?

342
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,395
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

343
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,273
Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?

344
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,026
My beloved father who

345
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,320
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son

346
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,698
after he fell on the battlefield.

347
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:22,118
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

348
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,705
I organized the defense of this city

349
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,624
while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.

350
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,168
I led the foray
when the enemies were at the gate

351
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:36,257
while your grandson,
the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.

352
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:40,344
I bled in the mud for our family.

353
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:45,141
And as my reward,
I was trundled off to some dark little cell.

354
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,977
But what do I want?

355
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,397
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

356
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,609
Jugglers and singers require applause.

357
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,153
You are a Lannister.

358
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,239
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses

359
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,742
every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?

360
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:03,826
Hmm?

361
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,580
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after

362
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,416
and three of them are in open rebellion.

363
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:15,838
So tell me what you want.

364
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,511
I want what is mine by right.

365
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,850
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

366
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:32,021
But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

367
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,357
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,

368
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,734
he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

369
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,072
I am your son and lawful heir.

370
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,493
You want Casterly Rock?

371
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,495
It is mine by right.

372
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,082
(SIGHS)

373
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,753
We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name

374
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,090
and as a reward for your accomplishments

375
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,926
during the battle of Blackwater Bay.

376
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:07,098
And when the time is right, you will be given a
position fit for your talents

377
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:11,018
so that you can
serve your family and protect our legacy.

378
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:15,856
And if you serve faithfully,
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

379
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,360
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

380
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:24,031
before mocking the family
name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

381
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,951
Why?

382
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,327
Why?

383
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,621
You ask that?

384
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,833
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

385
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:38,087
You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature

386
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,173
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

387
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:46,220
Men's laws give you the right to bear my
name and display my colors

388
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,265
since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

389
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,394
And to teach me humility,
the Gods have condemned me

390
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,939
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

391
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:00,776
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

392
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,695
But neither Gods nor men

393
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,656
will ever compel me to
let you turn Casterly Rock

394
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,533
into your whorehouse.

395
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,328
Go, now.

396
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:18,294
Speak no more of
your rights to Casterly Rock.

397
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,922
Go.

398
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,475
One more thing.

399
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:39,482
The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.

400
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:50,076
SANSA: Dorne. It's going to Dorne.

401
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,452
SHAE: Why Dorne?

402
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,870
It's carrying silk

403
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:56,457
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

404
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,922
But it's not coming back.

405
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,382
The captain's tired of risking his life

406
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,551
so King's Landing lords and ladies

407
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,846
can get drunk
on better wine than they deserve.

408
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,225
He's going to stay in Dorne.

409
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,770
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.

410
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,482
I met some people in Dorne
who weren't so beautiful and warm.

411
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,901
Don't ruin the game.

412
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,570
I told you, I don't want to play.

413
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,448
What about that one there?

414
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,952
SHAE: That one? It's going to Volantis.

415
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,203
Why?

416
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:38,874
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.

417
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,459
That's not how the game works.

418
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:44,130
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

419
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:48,092
You've got to invent a story about
where the ship is going and why.

420
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,263
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

421
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,809
Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.

422
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,561
Lovely day for it.

Might I speak
with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?

426
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,669
I saw your mother not long ago.

427
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,381
She's very eager to see you.

428
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,968
And your sister.

429
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:33,721
Arya's alive?

430
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,186
You said you'd take me home.

431
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,939
You said King's Landing was your home.

432
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,693
You are the property
of the crown. Stealing you would be treason.

433
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,361
If you were to tell just one person...

434
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,571
I won't tell anyone.

435
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,822
How do I know?

436
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,866
Because I'm a terrible liar.

437
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,243
You said so yourself.

438
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00,289
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

439
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:07,796
I'm waiting for word on an assignment
that will take me far away from the capital.

440
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,301
When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.

441
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,596
But you'll need to
be ready to leave on a moment's notice.

442
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,808
You're her handmaiden?

443
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,855
Yes. And you're his...

444
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,982
I help manage his affairs.

445
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,526
He's an important person.

So is she.

I always do.

456
