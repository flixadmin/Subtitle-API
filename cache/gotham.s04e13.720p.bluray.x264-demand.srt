1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,376
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,455
<i>I'm arresting you for the
murder of the boy you blew up</i>

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,040
<i>under the Crown Point Bridge.</i>

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,342
And how can you help me?

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,212
What do you say, pal?
Give me a smile...

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,091
<i>I'm not who my parents
might've wanted me to be.</i>

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,472
- And I'm okay with that.
- I'm not okay with it.

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,183
I went to my lawyer to have him
draw up emancipation papers.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,931
Alfred, you're fired.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,311
<i>Now get the hell
out of my house.</i>

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,317
I am in control!

12
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,644
But why would you want that?

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,151
We had so much fun
when we were me.

14
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,816
Surprise.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,117
I needed the police
to turn on Penguin.

16
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,070
So you sent this monster
to my city?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,287
I need you
at the head of the GCPD.

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,664
Let them think you're a hero.

19
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,081
This is Gordon.
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

20
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,670
<i>Ivy?</i>

21
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,753
<i>What happened to you?</i>

22
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,257
<i>I've been reborn.</i>

23
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,850
<i>And I will never
be underestimated</i>

24
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,802
or ignored ever again.

25
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,104
Let's make Gotham our bitch.

26
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,874
Can I help you?

27
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,965
You're so beautiful.

28
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,133
Thanks.

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,636
Now, move.

30
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,599
<i>Hey, Dad, guess what happened
at school today.</i>

31
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,717
<i>Oh, my God,
you're gonna love this.</i>

32
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,389
<i>- Can I just tell him?
- Wait. No, can I tell him?</i>

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,515
Just let me tell him.

34
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,642
Nice score.

35
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,270
Cindy, who are these two...

36
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:57,775
Well, what a charming
young lady.

37
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,951
She's so beautiful, Mom.

38
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,575
- That's cool.
- So your perfume

39
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,077
turns people
into your super fans?

40
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,250
Like all good things,
it'll fade.

41
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,326
But until then,

42
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:09,994
they're mine.

43
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,706
Freeze.

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,937
Not bad.

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,556
I'll check out
the rest of the house.

46
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,408
My friend thinks
we're here to rob you.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,702
But I know who you work for,

48
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,247
Roland Charles, PhD.

49
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:55,632
How you torture plants
in the name of science.

50
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,764
Do you ever wonder
how those plants feel?

51
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,566
Soon, you'll share more
with them

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,233
than you ever could've imagined.

53
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,460
What did you do to him?

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,513
I gave him what he deserves.

55
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,326
Captain, Captain Gordon. Yoo hoo.

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,075
Captain, Captain Gordon.

57
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,626
Chaz Carmichael.

58
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,212
- Congratulations.
- The Boss ain't gonna be happy

59
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,288
I'm in here.

60
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,418
Let's say
I got a lot of responsibility

61
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,874
in my organization.

62
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,051
Well, you seem like a real
responsible guy.

63
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,971
My boss is Sofia Falcone.

64
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,724
Oh, yeah?
What's that got to do with me?

65
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,978
Easy, all I know is, she told me,
if I ever got pinched,

66
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,517
to tell you to give her a call.

67
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,519
Is that so?

68
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,775
You can't do this. I got rights!

69
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,902
Oh yeah, how about you exercise
your right to remain silent?

70
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,067
Hey, Cap.

71
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,862
Got something.

72
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,833
Victim is Roland Charles,
over in R&D, Wayne Enterprises Biotech.

73
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,455
Did you know him
from when you worked at Wayne?

74
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,538
I met him in passing, not that
I recognized him right away.

75
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,050
It's like the tweaker
we found last week.

76
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,631
The toxin entered the bloodstream

77
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,007
through the cuts on the neck.

78
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,015
If it is the same as the last victim,
the toxin creates vines

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,682
that feed off
of the victim's body,

80
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,135
while also attacking
the hippocampus

81
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,346
like some plant-based psychedelics.

82
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,022
So it kills you
and makes you hallucinate?

83
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,438
- Any witnesses?
- The family is saying

84
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,610
that it was two women.

85
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,812
Redhead and a brunette.

86
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,273
The redhead used some kind
of hypnosis on them,

87
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,029
and the brunette
wore a leather whip.

88
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,034
Selina Kyle?

89
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,700
Murder's not really her thing.

90
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,907
The family says
the redhead killed Roland.

91
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,245
She left with his briefcase.

92
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,369
If his briefcase is missing,

93
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,704
maybe this is related to his work

94
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,460
- at Wayne Biotech?
- Doubtful.

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,294
He oversaw standard projects,
pharmaceuticals, pesticides.

96
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,846
What?

97
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,089
Nothing.

98
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,217
I'll track down Selina.

99
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,486
<i>This is Bruce. Leave a message.</i>

100
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,318
Bruce, I know
we haven't talked in a while.

101
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,242
But someone just killed
Roland Charles.

102
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,451
We may have a problem.

103
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,325
Roland Charles asked
for clearance

104
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,332
for some top-secret
biotech experiment.

105
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,837
Project M.

106
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,586
Ivy, do you think I care
about that?

107
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,753
You just killed a man in front
of his family.

108
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,008
He had it coming. You have
no idea what these people do.

109
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,596
We need to find out everything
we can about Project M.

110
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,807
And whatever it is,

111
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,398
all access would've had to have
been approved by Bruce Wayne.

112
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,729
You know, I really thought

113
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,531
that doing a crime spree
with you would be fun.

114
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,109
But...

115
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,784
I was wrong.

116
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,367
- Selina.
- Leave me alone.

117
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,995
Enjoy your shrubs.

118
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,918
We don't need her.

119
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,384
Now let's show everyone
just how strong we are.

120
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,982
Pour me another shot.
Pour me another shot.

121
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,613
Party time.

122
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,494
Party time.

123
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,002
- Shut up.
- Gonna throw up.

124
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,578
Gonna throw up.

125
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,671
You know,
I've had some crazy nights.

126
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,920
But I've never bought
a talking bird.

127
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,966
Sorry, party's over.

128
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,338
I wasn't at the party.

129
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,097
I've seen you before.

130
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,851
At The Sirens.
What are you doing here?

131
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,815
I'm here to speak for those

132
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,771
who can't speak
for themselves, Bruce.

133
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,733
I'm here to speak
for the plants.

134
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,869
Okay.

135
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,165
My head hurts. Please get out.

136
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,417
First,

137
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,378
tell me about Project M.

138
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,179
How do you know about that?

139
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,131
Oh, I know a lot of things,

140
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,885
billionaire boy.

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,596
Ivy?

142
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,648
You're so beautiful.

143
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,946
Now, Project M.

144
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,423
Hi, guys.

145
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,340
Get it off!

146
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,362
Is this seat taken?

147
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,193
If I say "yes,"
will it make a difference?

148
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,528
You know,
I've always been a fan.

149
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,865
When you got locked up
in this loony bin,

150
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,622
I expected great things,
a murder or two,

151
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,455
maybe a prison break.

152
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:56,548
But all you've done is mope
for the last six weeks.

153
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,723
You must know I cannot escape.

154
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,017
Why?

155
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,474
None of your business.

156
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,314
Because Sofia Falcone is holding
someone important to me captive.

157
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,985
And if I escape,
she will kill him.

158
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,448
Wow, what a boring story.

159
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,154
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's someone boring.

160
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,490
The last person who bored me
was Dietrich.

161
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,202
- Dietrich.
- I had to sneak into his shock therapy

162
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,253
session and goose the juice.

163
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,049
Now he pees himself 10 times
a day and sometimes, uh...

164
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,130
Poos himself.

165
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,556
Well, that's very sad.

166
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,273
I'm gonna cure you
of this attitude, Oswald.

167
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,111
I'm gonna find
that entertaining guy

168
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,238
I know is inside of you.

169
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,912
And when I do, ooh,

170
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,207
we are gonna have
so much fun together.

171
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,382
That's quite a story.

172
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,419
Not what I was expecting.

173
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,422
You're just so easy to talk to.

174
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,014
Normally, I'd make this quick

175
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,265
like I did with Roland.

176
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,472
But it's your name
on the company

177
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,523
that murders
my little green friends.

178
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,067
I'm so sorry, Ivy.

179
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,480
I would never want to upset you.

180
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,065
But you have, Bruce.

181
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,740
Hide out here all you want.

182
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,617
Bury your head in the sand.

183
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,463
You're still guilty.

184
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,847
It'll be slow.

185
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,933
and it'll be painful.

186
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,934
But it's what you deserve.

187
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,705
I'm just sorry I won't be here
to see you bloom.

188
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,940
Nope, nope.

189
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,481
No. None of these will do.

190
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,990
Where's Ivy?

191
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,113
What did she do to me?
Where am I?

192
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,239
Ah!

193
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,612
Just the thing.

194
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,160
Ra's al Ghul?

195
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,449
Ra's al Ghul?

196
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,955
Nope, never heard of him.

197
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,379
I'm Dr. Greenthumb, just here
to do a little light pruning, really.

198
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,300
No!

199
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,301
There.

200
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,636
That's better.

201
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,392
Mummy always used to say,

202
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,474
"A little pruning
encourages growth."

203
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,403
- Where are you taking that?
- Thanks, poppet.

204
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,980
Where are you taking my face?

205
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,484
Please, what's happening to me?

206
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,327
My dear boy,

207
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,908
you're dying.

208
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,163
Just hold still,
while I put these in place.

209
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,663
- No.
- Good Lord.

210
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,264
Jim, what a pleasant surprise.

211
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,596
- I'm looking for Selina.
- Haven't seen her.

212
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,681
She's more of an alley cat
than a house cat.

213
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,687
- Now I'm just in the middle...
- Let him in.

214
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,318
Hello, James.

215
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,199
It's been a while.

216
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,443
Barbara, can you give us
a moment?

217
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,280
Sure.

218
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,706
Have fun, lovebirds.

219
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,130
What is your business
with Barbara Kean?

220
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,834
You're worried that I told her
about our arrangement?

221
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,795
I know how to keep a secret.

222
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,391
Now, I want my man Carmichael
released from GCPD custody.

223
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,638
That wasn't the deal.

224
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,436
You run the underworld.
I run the GCPD.

225
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,731
Your guy got arrested.
That's on him.

226
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,062
Let me make something clear.

227
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,653
Our deal is
whatever I say it is.

228
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,361
Unless you want people
to know you're responsible

229
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,066
for bringing the Pyg to town.

230
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,285
You brought him to Gotham.

231
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,612
I was just trying to stop Penguin.

232
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,869
But you covered it up
and took credit for killing him.

233
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,246
Word gets out, you're destroyed,

234
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,919
along with your beloved GCPD.

235
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,046
And if I go down,

236
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,707
so will you.

237
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,794
And I think you like
being Queen of the Underworld.

238
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,094
You still think you know
what I will and won't do?

239
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,966
I know a bluff when I see one.

240
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,267
I have a job to do.

241
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,938
Selina.

242
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,733
Hey, Jim, I found Selina.
She went that way.

243
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,154
No! No! No!

244
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,614
Shut your beak.

245
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,542
No, no!

246
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,252
What do you want?

247
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,633
I told you, Pengy.

248
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,842
I'm gonna cure you
of this sad sack mopey act.

249
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,267
And the best cure
is the laughing cure.

250
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,642
Make me laugh.

251
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,520
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

252
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,822
So what'll you be performing?

253
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,784
Contortionism, juggling act,
a tight five?

254
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,328
Oh. What's that?

255
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,290
You want to do a clown dance?

256
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,283
- Yeah!
- Wonderful.

257
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,296
I will not!

258
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,748
Ooh.

259
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,007
No.

260
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,839
Get your hands off. No!

261
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,509
Make him laugh!
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

262
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,308
In your own time.

263
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,110
You have no idea how I've suffered.

264
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,854
The betrayals I've endured.

265
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,815
Just leave me alone.

266
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,693
- Leave me alone!
- Cut!

267
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,372
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald.

268
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,167
You are trapped in a prison

269
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,965
in here.

270
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,298
And I'm offering you the key.

271
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,092
So, dance!

272
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,888
Make him laugh!
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

273
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,719
Now we're talking.

274
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,893
I can feel the funny coming.
Here it comes!

275
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,650
Here comes the funny. Again!

276
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,536
Fred Astaire, you are not.

277
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,078
I'll try again tomorrow.

278
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,096
What the hell, man?

279
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,805
Why were you running, Selina?

280
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,606
'Cause a jerk with a badge
was chasing me.

281
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,480
So not because you were
in Roland Charles' house

282
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,277
last night when he was turned
into a tree?

283
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,609
His family saw a redhead
and a brunette.

284
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,986
The brunette was carrying
a leather whip just like yours.

285
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,112
Tell me I'm crazy.

286
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,948
I swear, I was only there
to rob the place.

287
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,613
So what about the redhead?

288
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,791
She killed some tweaker
in The Narrows the same way.

289
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:48,958
I need a name.

290
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,957
Ivy Pepper.

291
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,871
Try again. I know Ivy.

292
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,627
No, Gordon, she's changed.

293
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,915
Like a lot.

294
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,052
She can use plants to hypnotize
people and poison them.

295
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,338
So why'd she wanna kill Roland?

296
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,048
'Cause he works
for Wayne Enterprises.

297
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,558
Wayne Enterprise?

298
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,261
She's obsessed with a super
secret project they're doing.

299
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,683
Lucius lied.

300
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:10,981
Come on, let's go.

301
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,323
Admiring my handiwork?

302
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,150
Excuse me?

303
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,663
Look how beautiful he became.

304
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,826
And all it took

305
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,747
was a little scratch.

306
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,592
What do you want from me?

307
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,671
I wanna know about Project M.

308
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,719
- What is Project M?
- Mmm-mmm.

309
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,341
Bruce Wayne told me everything.

310
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,390
How he didn't even trust himself
with the location

311
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,937
but that you know where it is.

312
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,559
And you're gonna take me to it.

313
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,273
But first,

314
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,614
you probably wanna tell me
I'm beautiful.

315
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,828
Yes.

316
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,876
Help.

317
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,377
<i>Help! Somebody help me!</i>

318
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,356
Beautiful.

319
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,734
Jim. Jim, you need to help me.

320
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,031
Ouch.

321
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,404
Looks like you cut yourself
shaving, old man.

322
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,156
Jim, it's me. It's Bruce.

323
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,404
I'm Bruce Wayne.

324
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,997
Honey, I think we'd know
if you were Bruce Wayne.

325
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,577
He's the one throwing this shindig.

326
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,503
That's him yonder.

327
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,211
Bruce, you're incorrigible.

328
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,587
I may bust a gut.

329
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,049
Luckily, I am a doctor.

330
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,181
Ain't he the cat's pajamas?

331
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,718
Go on.

332
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,973
Easy there, sport.

333
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,432
It's Italian velvet.

334
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,188
What did you do?
Where's Ra's al Ghul?

335
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,228
Ra's al who?

336
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,353
It's my face.

337
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,360
He gave you my face.
That's my face.

338
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,157
I think you've been hitting the gin.

339
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,786
Give me back my face.
I'm Bruce Wayne.

340
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,364
Get off of me.

341
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,824
You're ruining my fun.

342
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,669
Everything all right?

343
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,372
- Master Bruce?
- Yes, thank you.

344
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,292
Just getting rid of the riffraff.

345
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,057
Dude, what is it with you
and arm-grabbing?

346
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,809
Harper, I need keys to lockup.
And is Lucius in his office?

347
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,599
Lucius? No, he left with Ivy
a little while ago.

348
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,020
- Ivy Pepper? She was here?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,945
She asked me
to introduce her to everyone.

350
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,239
Isn't she the coolest?

351
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,234
She's a psycho who turned
a guy into a potted plant.

352
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,161
What's going on with you?

353
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,748
Did he just say
that Ivy's a psycho?

354
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,491
But Ivy's the best.

355
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,209
Is this the hypnosis I've been
hearing about?

356
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,460
I'm gonna say yeah.

357
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,301
Until it fades, they'll
do anything for her.

358
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,341
And think she's the coolest.

359
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,516
What do you mean by,
"Ivy's a psycho"?

360
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,852
Hold that thought, Harper.

361
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,429
We'll be right back.

362
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,773
You hear what
the Captain said about Ivy?

363
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,648
- But Ivy's awesome.
- Yeah, she is the coolest.

364
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,993
No more! No more!

365
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,744
You have a visitor.

366
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,087
Hello, Oswald.

367
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,004
I see Arkham's
treating you well.

368
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,758
I take it you're here to gloat.

369
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,426
You are correct.

370
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,062
And why not?

371
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,106
I am in an insane asylum,

372
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,148
being pummeled by lunatics.

373
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,981
Then again,

374
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,735
at least I'm not a moron.

375
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,369
I may not be the man I once was.

376
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,623
But I have many things
that you do not have.

377
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,125
A purpose.

378
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,203
Friends.
You have neither of those.

379
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,755
And I wanted you to see that.

380
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,218
No.

381
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,713
I know you.

382
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,222
There's something else going on.
Something else brought you here.

383
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,680
There's nothing else.

384
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,604
I wanted you to see
how well I am doing.

385
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,644
And I wanted to see
how miserable you are.

386
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,105
Mission accomplished.

387
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,363
Ed.

388
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,651
I'm going to be out of here soon.

389
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:20,579
And once I am,
I am going to wipe

390
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,330
that smile off your face.

391
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,961
Preferably with a chainsaw.

392
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,214
Now, how are you going
to do that?

393
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,001
You have no friends,

394
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,919
no one to help you escape.

395
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,013
You are utterly alone.

396
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,135
Goodbye, Oswald.

397
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,603
Sorry, but I don't put
too much stock

398
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,106
in the opinions of simpletons!

399
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,828
"I am held captive all day,
my brilliance locked away.

400
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,215
"This prison must be broken.
The key?

401
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,007
"My name which must be spoken."

402
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,806
You're still in there.

403
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,556
That's why you came.

404
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,400
You're still there.

405
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,186
And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.

406
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,899
Hello? We should be leaving.

407
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,235
Not until we find out
where Ivy took Lucius.

408
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,535
There has to be something.

409
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,832
<i>You know where it is and
you are going to take me to it.</i>

410
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,756
<i>Mmm. You're so incredible.</i>

411
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,802
<i>Uh-huh. Where is Project M?</i>

412
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,635
<i>Wayne Biotech has a secret
facility outside the city</i>

413
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,390
<i>at the edge of Kane Park.</i>

414
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,062
Good man, Lucius.

415
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,314
<i>In here.</i>

416
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,144
Hey, Cap, the boys and I
were talking,

417
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,444
and we didn't really like
the way

418
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,862
that you were talking about Ivy.

419
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,905
I told you we should've left.

420
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,070
Look, I think you misinterpreted
what I was saying.

421
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,239
You called Ivy a psycho.

422
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,533
That's a term of endearment.

423
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,127
I love Ivy. I think she's great.

424
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,920
What about you?

425
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,292
Do you love Ivy?

426
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,587
Yeah, I love Ivy.

427
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,715
How much?

428
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:42,720
I love Ivy so much that I wish
I could be her.

429
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,761
You're not really selling it.

430
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,438
And you think you did?

431
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,268
Run.

432
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:51,812
Get them!

433
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,611
Selina!

434
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,382
All right, Oswald,
old buddy, old pal.

435
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,884
Tonight, we're gonna cure you.

436
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,177
Make me laugh or else.

437
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,225
Let's call this
the sudden death round.

438
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,232
Dietrich?

439
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,166
Okay, that was clever-ish.

440
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,085
Yeah, that's a spoon.

441
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,007
It is also a fork!

442
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,009
Looks like you got
some fight in you still.

443
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,638
But it's just too little,
too late, too...

444
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,475
Boring.
Lobotomize the little bird.

445
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,435
Wait. Wait.

446
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,648
You said this prison
was all in my mind.

447
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,362
Maybe I'm in a prison right now.

448
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:26,491
A prison where
you can't get to me.

449
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,045
Okay.

450
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,057
You really are nuts.

451
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,599
Try laughing now,
you ginger sap!

452
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,684
Yes!

453
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,656
See? I told you I'd cure you.

454
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,615
Don't flatter yourself!

455
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,042
One more.

456
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,884
And so I said to the guy...
You wanna know what I said?

457
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,299
I said, "What is this?

458
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,880
"A three-ring circus?"

459
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,428
And keep them coming.

460
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,651
How long do you think
you can hide in here?

461
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,069
Look.

462
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,652
Out there.

463
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,746
He's going to find you eventually.

464
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,916
I don't understand.

465
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,118
Who's going to find me?

466
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,430
Alfred?

467
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,929
Special Agent Pennyworth
to you, you scumbag!

468
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,269
The kid's secured,
requesting extraction.

469
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,014
No!

470
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,697
Just be careful, here.

471
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,615
We're gonna go this way.

472
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,490
This way.

473
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,618
So this is it.

474
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,454
Project M.

475
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,135
Also called "Lazarus Water."

476
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,888
It belonged to a man
known as Ra's al Ghul.

477
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,637
It stimulates cell growth
at an alarming rate.

478
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,635
We've yet to figure out how.

479
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,895
I assumed Project M killed plants,
but it's the opposite.

480
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,905
Just like humans to lock up
something so beautiful.

481
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,987
What are you going
to do with it?

482
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,038
I'm going to make miracles happen.

483
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,547
Release me!

484
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,092
Listen to me. I'm Bruce Wayne.
I can pay you whatever you want.

485
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,551
You need to let me go now!

486
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,352
Sorry, I can't do that now, love.

487
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,264
- You see, I have a mission.
- What mission?

488
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,100
For me to bring you to him.

489
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,447
What is that?

490
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,742
Well, giddy up, son.

491
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,468
What do you want?

492
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,259
Why did you bring me here?

493
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,344
This is where
my parents were killed!

494
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,599
No.

495
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,348
This is where I was born.

496
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,562
No!

497
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,912
That's far enough.

498
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,910
Jim Gordon.

499
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,290
Ivy Pepper.

500
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,837
It's been a long time.

501
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,507
I'm not the same kid
you remember.

502
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,219
The kid who's father
you and you partner killed

503
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,386
all those years ago?

504
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,340
How is this possible?

505
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,643
Well, first, I was a seed.

506
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,263
Then a sprout.

507
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,815
Now I've bloomed.

508
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,642
Drop your gun.

509
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,485
Or your friend Lucius
becomes a flower arrangement.

510
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,621
Lucius, you okay?

511
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,371
I'm in the sweet embrace of one
of my favorite people, Jim.

512
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,746
Never been better.

513
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,132
Now I know you're tenacious,

514
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,925
Jim Gordon, gun or no gun.

515
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,882
You'll come after me.

516
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,595
But then,

517
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,306
Bruce Wayne will die.

518
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,884
What have you done to him?

519
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,266
I went to Wayne Manor
and planted a seed.

520
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,356
I imagine he's about to bloom.

521
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,899
But if you let me go,

522
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,646
you may have a chance

523
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,738
to get him the antidote.

524
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,657
This isn't over.

525
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,989
You have no idea
how right you are.

526
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,617
I love you.

527
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,041
Lucius, give me the antidote.

528
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,044
Let's just wait until
Ivy is at a safe distance.

529
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,591
Give me the antidote. Come on.

530
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,840
- Don't make me hit you.
- Jim.

531
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,839
I must warn you,
I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu.

532
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,132
Since when?

533
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,300
Night classes.

534
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,726
- The Lazarus Water.
- Come on.

535
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,062
We've got to get to Bruce Wayne.
Let's go.

536
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,550
Help!

537
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,722
Somebody help!

538
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,683
Who's there?

539
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,100
Show yourself!

540
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,026
Who are you?

541
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,156
I am the one you cannot escape.

542
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,751
The one you cannot kill.

543
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,663
You're me?

544
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,421
- Please...
- You're scared.

545
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,877
You should be.

546
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,218
It's okay, Bruce.
It's all right.

547
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,141
You're safe now.

548
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,861
According to Lucius,

549
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,945
Ivy's toxin attacks the brain
like a hallucinogen.

550
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,452
So whatever you went through,

551
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,204
I doubt it was pleasant,

552
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,792
but it wasn't real.

553
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,125
I think I saw who I really am.

554
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,130
I know what you're gonna say.

555
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,338
But what I saw, it was real.

556
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,178
Well, then you're lucky.

557
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,432
Most people go their whole lives
not ever knowing

558
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,979
- who they really are...
- I'm not lucky.

559
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,140
You didn't see it.

560
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,274
I've seen my own darkness.

561
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,823
I'll say this.

562
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,744
You have people around you
who care for you.

563
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,955
Don't fight this alone.

564
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,579
Trust us.

565
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,961
I'll leave men outside tonight.

566
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,877
I'll come by tomorrow,
check in on you.

567
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,255
Jim.

568
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,137
When I was under,

569
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,393
I saw you.

570
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,313
You had a mustache.

571
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,399
Well, clearly,
that's a very dangerous toxin.

572
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,798
Alfred, it's...

573
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,375
It's me. It's Bruce. I...

574
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,842
I need your help, Alfred.

575
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,887
Please call me.

576
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,699
We're not hypnotized.

577
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,196
Just embarrassed.

578
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,737
Good to have you back.

579
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,494
All right, listen up.

580
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,664
I want an APB on Ivy Pepper.

581
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,620
Finding her is our top priority.

582
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,001
All right, you heard him, people.
Let's get to work.

583
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,793
- What do you want?
<i>- I thought about what you said.</i>

584
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,926
How if I used the Pyg to destroy you,
I'd also destroy myself.

585
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,223
<i>And?</i>

586
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,683
And

587
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,055
you're right.

588
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,937
I've come to enjoy being
the Queen of Gotham.

589
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,268
Glad we understand each other.

590
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,476
<i>Not quite. You see, I also
realized I don't need the Pyg.</i>

591
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,029
There are other ways
for me to hurt you.

592
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,198
Thank you so much for coming.

593
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,624
I thought we were overdue
for a chat.

594
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,040
How could I say no
to my sister-in-law?

595
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,425
<i>So I strangled him
with his lower intestines.</i>

596
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,148
Relax, buddy.

597
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,104
You gave me what I needed.

598
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,527
The laugh of the century.

599
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,951
Tell me something.

600
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,863
You appear to have everyone here
under your thumb,

601
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,619
- the guards, the inmates...
- What can I say?

602
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,371
I'm a charismatic guy.

603
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,170
You could escape anytime.

604
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,914
- Why stay?
- Hmm.

605
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,425
Why indeed?

606
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,847
- You're planning something.
- Righty, old boy.

607
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:41,267
Something spectacular.

608
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,143
See, I'm in this funny farm

609
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,191
'cause I need to find
the <i>crème de la</i> crazy,

610
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,193
which is why I need you.

611
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,699
Ah, you get it.

612
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,251
But when we're done,

613
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,298
the world out there,
that'll be the asylum.

614
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,629
What do you say?

615
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,263
Thank you for your kind offer.

616
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,051
I don't expect
to be here very long.

617
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,728
You'll come around.

618
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,152
They always do.

619
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,120
Nope.

620
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,160
Where did these plants
come from?

621
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,575
Get out!

622
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,372
Before we call the police.

623
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,815
Oh, friends.

624
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,198
You're all so beautiful.
