1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,000
You and I dating would be
totally weird.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,080
Totally weird.

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,160
Hank is running some secret project.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,840
A man came to me, Neron.
He offered me a deal.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,840
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,400
I have a new partner now. My son.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,520
I don't need you anymore.

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,560
I don't need you anymore, either.

10
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Dad?

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,160
I didn't kill Nate's dad.

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,840
Sara, you're asking me
to risk everything

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,080
for some conspiracy theory?

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,240
For a bunch of monsters?

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,840
- Ava, don't do this.
- I'm done.

17
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,320
Even I didn't just get into
an argument she asked me to leave.

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
Come on, Ava, open up.

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Look, I...

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,120
I miss you.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm sorry things went down the way
they did, but...

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,760
Please just open the door.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,160
Well, technically this is still
our apartment.

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Ava.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,960
Nora, what are you doing here?

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,760
- I can explain.
- I can explain.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
I didn't kill Hank, it was a demon.

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Yeah, I know.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
{\an5}His name is Neron
and he's wearing Desmond

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,840
{\an5}as a bleeding suit.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Ray!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,160
Sara! Great news.

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
Hank was killed by a demon.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,520
{\an5}"Great" was not the word
he was looking for.

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,720
- Poor Nate.
- Look, Ava is missing.

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,800
- Missing?
- I should have checked

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
- on her sooner...
- It's Neron.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,440
He has his sights set
on the Time Bureau

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
and the creatures,
and if he got to Hank,

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,680
then dingdongs to donuts,
Ava was next.

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,880
Hey, she is not dead.

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,760
Listen, when Neron was out
the Bureau,

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
he and I shared a connection.

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,120
If you can take me to Ava's place,

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
I might be able to know
where he took her.

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,000
{\an5}Demons communicate,
he'll know your past,

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,160
{\an5}how susceptible you are.

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,480
You're a liability.

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,920
She's not a liability.

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,280
She's a survivor.

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,920
Unlike you, she's turned her
dark experiences

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,440
into a source of strength,

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,480
not an excuse for alcoholism
or chain smoking.

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,840
She also saved your life.

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,440
Sorry.
Would you like to add anything?

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,920
No, that about covers it.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't care if she's a liability.

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,800
If Neron has Ava,

59
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,400
then I need all the magical firepower
that we've got.

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
You two with me.

61
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Woman the ship.

62
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
This is from two weeks ago.

63
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
She's been gone a tick.

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
That's not good.

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,520
Yeah, thanks.

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
There.

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
What? What do you see?

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
He had her.

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Here.

70
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Ava.

71
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
That doesn't mean she's dead.

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
It doesn't mean she's alive, either.

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
I know where she is.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
{\an5}Conspiracies, embezzling,
paper trails...

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
I feel like Julia Roberts
in <i>Erin Brockovich.</i>

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,680
We're more Pacific Gas
and Electric, Gary.

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,520
Wait, we're the bad guys?

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,880
I don't know who we are,
Gary, all right?

79
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,280
We're the guys trying to keep
my dad's cracked out idea

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,360
{\an5}of Jur-magic Park from tanking
the Time Bureau.

81
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,040
All right? So anything that has to do
with Heyworld, get rid of it!

82
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
How am I gonna explain
all this to Director Sharpe?

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,960
Actually, Ava's missing.

84
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
I knew it.

85
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,560
{\an5}I knew it, you know, I had a dream
about her

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,600
{\an5}where she was driving
and I was in a car seat in the back.

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,280
{\an5}- We were headed to Schul.
- Gary.

88
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
She needs me.

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
I got... I got...

90
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
{\an5}Sara, Constantine, and Nora are...

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
{\an5}looking for her.

92
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,320
- Nora?
- Look, she didn't kill Hank.

93
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
- Come on, man.
- Just listen, okay?

94
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,160
Your dad made a deal
with a demon named Neron.

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,960
{\an5}I guess something went wrong
and the demon killed him.

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
I'm sorry, buddy.

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,040
{\an5}My dad made a deal with a demon
to open a theme park?

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
Oh, Ray,

99
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,960
{\an5}I don't know how much more
of this I can take, man.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
- Is that you?
- No.

101
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,360
{\an5}If this is my dad's mistress,
I'm gonna jump out a window.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,040
{\an5}- Hello?
<i>- Yo, Mr. H. It's Mikey T.</i>

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,720
{\an5}<i>Listen, got a question for you
about the dragon lair.</i>

104
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,640
<i>Could sure use your eyes down here.</i>

105
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,040
Do...down where?

106
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,840
<i>What? Here, at the site.</i>

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
Buckwood Downs?

108
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
<i>Yeah, where else?</i>

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Talk to you later.

110
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Who was it?

111
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
{\an5}I don't know,
he sounded like a Soprano,

112
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,120
but apparently my dad started
building this theme park.

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,280
{\an5}The guys who were working with him,

114
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,880
{\an5}maybe they know something
about this Neron

115
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,840
and why he killed my dad.

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
Come on!

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm Steel, you're The Atom.

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,280
There is nothing we cannot handle!

119
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
This one.

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Ava?

121
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Hey.

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Ava.

123
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
She's alive.

124
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,240
- What did he do to her?
- He's preparing her.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,280
Neron must be looking
for a new vessel.

126
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,920
{\an5}It only makes sense going after Ava,
especially if he wants control

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,240
{\an5}over the Time Bureau.

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
But when a demon possesses someone,

129
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,080
the body has to be willing,
and if it's not,

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,640
the demon has to force his way in
by sending the soul to purgatory.

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
That's where the real fight begins.

132
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,160
How do we save her?

133
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,680
Some souls go up and some go down.

134
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
But if she's been there
as long as she has,

135
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
then she's not coming back, Sara.

136
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,640
I'm not giving up on her, John.

137
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,640
You're going to send me
to purgatory to get her.

138
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
If I send you down there with her,

139
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,320
there's nothing that I can do
to protect you.

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
I'll take my chances.

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,760
This isn't something you can
just fight your way through, love.

142
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,200
John, please!

143
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Fine.

144
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Lay down.

145
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,760
Our purgatory is designed to drive
the soul to breaking point.

146
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,840
It's tailored to drive
the captive mad.

147
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,040
Now where you're going,
that's Ava's personal nightmare.

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,200
I've died, lost my soul,
and escaped a demon realm.

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm pretty sure I can handle
Ava's purgatory.

150
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,320
Well, prepare for the worst,
Sara Lance.

151
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Welcome.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
Do you need a bag?

153
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,560
I got to get out of here.

154
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,720
I can't do this anymore.
I just gotta get out of here.

155
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Ava!

156
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,640
Hey. Hey.

157
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,880
Oh, thank God.

158
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
Oh, my God.

159
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,000
Sara, is that really you?

160
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,720
It's me. I got you.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,880
What the hell happened? Am I dead?

162
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,600
You were kidnapped by a demon

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,520
and he's trying to take over
your body

164
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,680
so he trapped your soul here
in your own personal purgatory.

165
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,280
But Ava, if you check out, you die.

166
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,960
Well, that's kind of on the nose,
isn't it?

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
Wait, does that mean
that he got you too?

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
No.

169
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm taking you home.

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,880
I got it! Natari!

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm gonna regret asking this,
but what's that?

172
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
It's your couple's name.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Nat for Nate and of course Ari
is for you.

174
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,240
You know I'm a superhero, right?

175
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,280
With a flick of my wrist I could
blast you with my wind powers.

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,720
Being honest, wind powers,
just not that scary.

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah, you're like
a magical hair dryer.

178
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,720
What is this? "Legends Eye
for the Straight Guy"?

179
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
You're straight?

180
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Where's Sara?

181
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,960
She's with Constantine
and Nora, trying to find Ava.

182
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,320
<i>Actually, they've just returned,
and Mr. Constantine</i>

183
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,920
<i>has called a team meeting in the lab.</i>

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,520
- He can do that?
- No.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go, dummies.

186
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,200
- Ava's in hell?
- She's not in hell.

187
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Her soul is trapped in limbo.

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,240
And I am right there with her.

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,160
- Oh, Gary.
- Emotionally, poor Director Sharpe.

190
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
I've sent Sara down there
to try and pull her out.

191
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,120
I thought that they broke up.

192
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,760
She still loves her.

193
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,280
- What can we do?
- Sara chose to go in after her

194
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
so unless praying is your thing,

195
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,080
then the best thing
you can do is wait.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You don't have to worry.

197
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,840
- Oh, he's all right.
- I'll take good care of her.

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Them.

199
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
All right, Charlie, you're with me.

200
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
This should be interesting.

201
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,640
Let's go find out what
this demon wants, shall we?

202
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
You up for it?

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,040
All right then,
let's raise some hell.

204
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, how you doing?

205
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,840
Can I help you guys?

206
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,600
Yeah, we're looking for Mister...

207
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,360
Mr. T.

208
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Who's asking?

209
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,600
Because no one's allowed
on this site unle...

210
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,800
Hey, I know you.

211
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,120
I'd recognize that Heywood
jawline anywhere.

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,520
You must be "And Son."

213
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,480
You kidding me?
Hank is always going on about you.

214
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
Where, where is he?

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hank passed.

216
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
What?

217
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,960
Jeez, I... sorry to hear that.

218
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,560
You mind if we take a look around?

219
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Hey,

220
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
it's all yours now, kid.

221
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Question, did my dad ever mention
a man by the name of Neron?

222
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,600
Neron?

223
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
What is that, Greek?

224
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,520
No, it's Demonic... Danish, actually.

225
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,120
No, never heard of the guy.

226
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,400
Actually, to be honest with you,
Hank didn't really tell me a lot.

227
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
All he gave me was... was this.

228
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
We're building that right now.

229
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,160
A unicorn rodeo.

230
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Can you imagine?

231
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,960
Two unicorns jousting?

232
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
I'd rather not.

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
Hey, come here, come here.

234
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,680
This. This is what I was
calling you guys about.

235
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
About the...

236
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Dragon lair.

237
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Yeah, I know.

238
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
I drew it.

239
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,200
- I drew all of this.
- Great, tell me something.

240
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
Look at this. See this here?
What is this?

241
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,520
Is this supposed to be real flame,
or were you thinking, like, plexi?

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,520
Because I got a guy that can do fire.
Like forget about it.

243
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
I can't believe he did it.

244
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
I know you and your dad struggled

245
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,680
and even if you got
your wires crossed,

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,440
you never stopped trying to connect.

247
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,520
I just hope my dad knew I loved him.

248
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Oh, he knew.

249
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Look at this place.

250
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,040
You know, I just wish
he would have found

251
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,520
a better way to, you know,
tell me he loved me.

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,560
One that didn't involve teaming up
with a demon

253
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,400
and embezzling money
from the government.

254
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,840
It's a bit much.

255
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
Mikey T!

256
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Mikey T!

257
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Change of plans.

258
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Tear it down.

259
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,880
The dragon lair?

260
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
The whole thing.

261
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
Waiting sucks.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Sexting Nate?

263
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,320
Boundaries, Mona.

264
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I need vicarious feels.

265
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
There are more important things
to focus on right now

266
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
and Nate's got a lot going on.

267
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,120
It's not the right time.

268
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
What are you typing?

269
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Hey, what's up?

270
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,320
Okay, I don't even know
why I'm talking to you two about it.

271
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,720
You don't even date humans.

272
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,280
Love's love.

273
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,400
Whatever you need, I'm here.

274
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,320
Whatever you need, I'm here.

275
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,320
Why is Gary in your subconscious?

276
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,960
I may have some Gary issues
that need working out.

277
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay, we just, we need to find
the door that you came in.

278
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,200
Does any of this look familiar?

279
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
No, it all looks exactly the same.

280
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,400
Why don't we just try to follow
the arrows back?

281
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,760
Maybe they'll take us
to the entrance.

282
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,440
<i>Reminder, shoppers, the store
will be closing in one hour.</i>

283
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,560
Constantine didn't say anything
about that.

284
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
What does it mean?

285
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,120
It means we take shortcuts.

286
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Come on.

287
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,840
Hello, again, ladies.

288
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Damn it.

289
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
- Okay, this way.
- No!

290
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,760
Or we could just ask Gary.

291
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,200
How do we get to the entrance?

292
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,960
We're not really allowed to give
that kind of advice.

293
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
- Come on. -
But,

294
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,960
the Ergrik wardrobe might be
just the thing you're looking for.

295
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,160
Looks like the wardrobe section.

296
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Now what?

297
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,920
I think we're supposed
to put it together.

298
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
No sweat.

299
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Here.

300
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,440
Wait, wait, wait.
Step one, insert the dowel.

301
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
- Here, babe.
- I got this.

302
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
- Shut up, man!
- No, you shut up!

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
You kidding me?

304
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Why, you brain-damaged?

305
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Papa's home.

306
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Miss me?

307
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,680
I missed you.

308
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,280
We'll be together soon, my pet.

309
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,240
Not bloody likely.

310
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,040
Oh, Nora.

311
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,800
There's nowhere for you to run now,
you bile bladder.

312
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Me, run?

313
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,760
You're the one who ran.

314
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,960
All I had to do was say,
"I'm coming for you, Johnny."

315
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,720
And you left 2018 to me.

316
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,920
It's delicious how easily humans
are corrupted,

317
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,240
especially here in D.C.

318
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
So that's your game?

319
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,680
You inflict fear and anger
on humanity?

320
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
I merely fan the flames.

321
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,000
People are primed to give in
to what they fear most.

322
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,480
You know what, mate?
I am going to send your ass

323
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,080
straight back to hell.

324
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,240
John, this isn't the plan.

325
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
Nora, we finally get to talk.

326
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,000
Hope you've enjoyed your little
dalliances inside my mind.

327
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
<i>But it's not a one way street.</i>

328
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,120
<i>Is it, Nora?</i>

329
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
I knew you were a liability.
We should be off with him.

330
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,600
You're playing right into his hands,
John.

331
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
You're the one who can't handle this.

332
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,240
Oh, yes, says Miss Lock Herself Up

333
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
because she can't handle
her own demons.

334
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,400
Well, this is me handling mine,
all right?

335
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Out!

336
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,520
- He's getting to you.
- Oh, he's getting to me?

337
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
- Yeah.
- He's inside your head.

338
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,000
What, you don't think
I haven't seen you struggling?

339
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,920
Humanity hasn't exactly been
kind to you, has it, Nora?

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,080
You're addicted to this kind
of power,

341
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,280
and believe me, it doesn't go away.

342
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,320
No it doesn't and it hasn't
been easy, but if I can trust myself,

343
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,760
I don't think it's too much
to ask for you to try too.

344
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,920
Oh, it's killing you to look
at his face.

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,480
I know how hard it is to watch
someone you love become a demon.

346
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,840
Yeah, well too bad there
aren't any Beebos around

347
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,280
to hug it to death.

348
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
We can't just...

349
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,160
keep him locked up in there,
driving us all mad.

350
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,680
Yeah, well, I think
between the two of us,

351
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,080
we can figure something out.

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
Ta-dah!

353
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,520
- Damn it.
- What a surprise.

354
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
You followed none of the instructions
and it didn't work.

355
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm sensing that this isn't
about the dresser.

356
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,320
No, this is what you always do.

357
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,600
- Just bulldoze your way though.
- I do not always do this.

358
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
Like lying to me about the Kaupe?

359
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,840
You were defending
torturing creatures.

360
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,000
Defen... I wasn't defending it.
I was defending myself.

361
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,560
Of course, I don't believe that
we should be intentionally hurting

362
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,120
anything or anyone but when we fight,
Sara, I get really scared,

363
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
and I just go to my corner.

364
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,320
Look, it's just fight or flight.

365
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,440
It couldn't be any more human.

366
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,800
I just really need to know
that you're on my team.

367
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,080
I am always on your team,
even when we disagree.

368
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Now,

369
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,200
should we give it another go?

370
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Thank you.

371
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
See?

372
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
Following instructions
is not that bad.

373
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,680
Oh, don't gloat.

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's get out of here.

375
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Something's wrong.

376
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
Did we miss a screw or something?

377
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
No.

378
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
We missed this.

379
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,120
- It's...
- How the hell did we

380
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,240
possibly miss this?

381
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,040
- Damn it.
- Hey, look.

382
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
It's not perfect, but it's ours.

383
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Can you live with that?

384
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Hey?

385
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
Don't go in your corner.

386
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Yeah,

387
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
I can live with it.

388
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Hell yeah. Let's go to Narnia.

389
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Are we out?

390
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,280
We're out of the closet
but not the store.

391
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,040
<i>- Touché.</i>
- Welcome to our mattress showroom.

392
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,320
If you'll follow me?

393
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,240
The mattress you choose
will be the most important

394
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
decision of your life.

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
Wait, you're showing them
the mattresses?

396
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
We need everyone out
before Tabitha gets here.

397
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Who the hell is Tabitha?

398
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,400
You don't want to know Tabitha.

399
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,320
Best of luck in your mattress choice.

400
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,080
- Wait, we need to...
- Gary, wait...

401
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,920
This is starting to feel like
that escape room we did.

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
Okay, so, subconscious Gary said
this would be the most important

403
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,680
choice of our life.
What do you think that means?

404
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,240
That even subconscious Gary needs
to get a life?

405
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,160
No, it's a puzzle.
Do you... what does it mean?

406
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Do you think we need to...

407
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,280
It means we need to pick a mattress.

408
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
How about this one?

409
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
What?

410
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,520
Whoa, 600 bucks?

411
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
- That is ridiculously...
- Three year warranty?

412
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,720
Expensive, right?

413
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I was thinking, like, 250.

414
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Wha... Are you kidding?
It would be saggy in like a year.

415
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
So you just flip it over.

416
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,480
You just flip it over?

417
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,480
Is that what you do when things
get saggy, you just flip them over

418
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,280
so you don't have to look
at their saggy faces?

419
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Okay.

420
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
How about this one?

421
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Fifteen years.

422
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Oh, that's better.

423
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh, when did you start going grey?

424
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,640
This place has been really stressful.

425
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Yeah.

426
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,360
I think it's the mattress.

427
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,280
Apparently your purgatory is...

428
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,960
your anxieties.

429
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,360
One of which must be getting old.

430
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm not worried
about getting old, Sara.

431
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm worried about
getting old with you.

432
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
So, were...

433
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
talking about marriage.

434
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
You look...

435
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,000
still really hot, but...

436
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
You too.

437
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,120
Oh, well, 50 years is a long time.

438
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Sleeping on one mattress.

439
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
Sure is.

440
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,840
Look, I know it's a lot.

441
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,280
Fifty years with just one person.

442
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
Well, it's... its not
the one person thing.

443
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,120
I just...

444
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,000
I've never really thought that much
pass tomorrow.

445
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,840
Even with my past.

446
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
Planning anything for the future
it's just...

447
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
fees like tempting fate.

448
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,280
And I convince myself that I like it
that way.

449
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,840
Until you came along.

450
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
You just freaking came to purgatory
for me.

451
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,760
How's that forgiving middle finger
the fate?

452
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Look, you're allowed to want things
sometimes, Sara.

453
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,000
But what if I can't be?

454
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,040
The person that you need.

455
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,360
Let's be honest neither of us
needs anybody.

456
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Right?

457
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
But you...

458
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,920
are who I want.

459
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,880
I bet you there's some good liquor
in Ava's office.

460
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
I mean,

461
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,920
my dad's old office.

462
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,200
Oh, man. Things are bleak.

463
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Hey, Ray,

464
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
thanks for sticking around here.

465
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Yeah, buddy, of course.

466
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
That's what friends are for.

467
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,120
I just wish I wasn't such an idiot
at my dad's funeral.

468
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,640
I had a chance to talk to him,
but I blew it.

469
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Now I'll never know what happened.

470
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,840
Well, maybe Constantine can get you
some answers.

471
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Looks like they caught Neron.

472
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Son of a bitch.

473
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,280
Is that the demon who killed my dad?

474
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,560
Whoa, there, Squire.
You take it easy, all right?

475
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,880
Nate, you don't want to go in there.

476
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
- Just walk away.
- No.

477
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,200
- Wait!
- Not a chance.

478
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Wait!

479
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Wait!

480
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,680
Hello, Nathaniel.

481
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,360
I've heard so much about you.

482
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,000
So predictable.

483
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,840
The son, who, in life, could never
connect with the father.

484
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,840
Here now, seeking the truth.

485
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,760
Well, here it is.

486
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,880
Hank was an unfortunate snag
in my plans so I...

487
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,920
You evil bastard.

488
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Yeah.

489
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Demon.

490
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,120
Nate's already angry,
makes him prime pickings for Neron.

491
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
No, he'll be all right.

492
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,560
As long as he doesn't cross
that bloody barrier.

493
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Why?

494
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,240
He built your theme park
just like you wanted.

495
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,160
You think I wanted a theme park?

496
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,600
I gave Hank power and in return,
he was to supply me

497
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,480
with fear mongering magical creatures
to terrorize people into giving up

498
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
their souls.

499
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,200
Instead, he went behind my back
and built some deranged zoo.

500
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
He betrayed me

501
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
because of you.

502
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,920
- No.
- If you'd had just

503
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
stayed out of our way,

504
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,160
maybe your old man
would still be alive.

505
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,520
Nate, no wait!

506
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Ray, I'm sorry.

507
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
I'm sorry, man.

508
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
It's okay, buddy,
I know it wasn't you.

509
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
It's locked.

510
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,840
There's nothing to build.

511
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,600
No furniture to choose.

512
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Dishes.

513
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Piece of cake.

514
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Go, go, go.

515
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,480
Yeah, this seems more like
one of your fantasies

516
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,440
than your fears,
watching me do dishes.

517
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,200
Please, if it were up to you,
we would only have paper plates.

518
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Here.

519
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
You on that?

520
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Got it.

521
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I'm on it.

522
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
It never ends.

523
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,400
- Did you send it?
- Honestly, mate,

524
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,440
whatever happened to just
talking to someone?

525
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Emoji's are way more fun
and if he's not that into it,

526
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,720
you can pretend like you were
talking about something else.

527
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,280
Right. Nate's gonna think I was dying
to tell him about a dancing lady

528
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,320
carrying a burning eggplant.

529
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,480
Here, use words.

530
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,120
It's erotic but vulnerable.

531
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Okay, let me see it.

532
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm not saying "bulge."

533
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,760
Sula the Wolf Witch talked
about smothering a demon.

534
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,720
Does that make sense to you?

535
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,760
When Mallus was a part of me
I could feel his fear.

536
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,760
He was vulnerable here on Earth.

537
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
It made him nervous.

538
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,520
So if we can separate the demon
from his earthly vessel,

539
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,240
it will suffocate him.

540
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,040
Just like a fish out of water.

541
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,240
<i>Why are you even working
with that arrogant dick?</i>

542
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,360
<i>He'll never value your true power.</i>

543
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,120
<i>Not like I will.</i>

544
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,400
You all right there, love?

545
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Yeah.

546
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,000
I just need some coffee.

547
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
I'm fine.

548
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,200
And I'm sober.

549
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Hey.

550
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Are you okay?

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm all right.

552
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Thanks.

553
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,520
You best let her alone, Squire.

554
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
This is all your mail!

555
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
You deal with it.

556
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,520
It's not like you have an address
to even get mail, so...

557
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,520
We both talked about it and agreed
that now wasn't the right time for me

558
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
to move in with you.

559
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,520
- But we're making it work.
- Are we?

560
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,080
Because, how I see it we're living
completely separate lives, so...

561
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,440
Ava, I want this
just when the time is right.

562
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Timing doesn't just happen, Sara.
Okay, you have to make a choice.

563
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
So what?

564
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,560
What? This... this is what you want?

565
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,600
No, of course nobody just wants
dirty dishes but, yes.

566
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,360
Ava, we are time traveling
superheroes.

567
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,680
Okay, fine. But I'm not just my job.

568
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,120
I want some hobbies.
I want... I want a life with you

569
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,560
And sometimes life is... is...

570
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,440
just this, okay?

571
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
It's boring.

572
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,560
What then?
You hop to the next adventure?

573
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,160
No, but I can't just aside
every single moment of forever

574
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,280
right this instant.

575
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,400
So, please just...

576
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,280
Tell me what you want me to say

577
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,520
and I'll say it when we get out
of here.

578
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,640
I can't tell you what to say Sara
because that wouldn't mean anything.

579
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Okay, well...

580
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's just... let's go
to the suburbs

581
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,600
and we'll just recycle until we die.

582
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Can we go now?

583
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,440
Oh, no.

584
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,400
It's just me.

585
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,040
Let's talk.

586
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,560
I've admired your...

587
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,960
power for a long time, Nora.

588
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,920
I don't take compliments from people
who frame me for murder.

589
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
All in the interest
of self-preservation.

590
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
You understand.

591
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,000
Do they even know
what you're capable of?

592
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
They have no idea.

593
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
Then why waste your time
with that arrogant bastard

594
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,440
and his pathetic delusion
that the world needs him to save it?

595
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,240
When I met John, I was just a kid.

596
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
<i>He was kind.</i>

597
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,640
Mallus wanted me, but I wasn't ready.

598
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,480
But I'll tell you this.

599
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,840
John did everything he could
to save me.

600
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,080
But when he failed, he abandoned me.

601
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,480
John knew what the Order were doing
to me and he just let them.

602
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,240
And he's the one who decides
who to send to hell.

603
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,920
Cocky cowboy wearing his hangover
like a 10 gal hat.

604
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,720
He might have won that last battle,
but the war is mine.

605
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,040
My Tabitha will be free soon...

606
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,320
and when she is, we're gonna
put John away for good.

607
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Tabitha?

608
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,520
That's why you needed Ava
as a vessel.

609
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,600
There's a model for everyone.

610
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,160
Are you looking for one to clean?
One to keep you safe?

611
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,760
One to please you?

612
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
No, you creep.

613
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,520
I'm looking for Ava.

614
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,720
They're all Ava.

615
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,480
No, they're not.

616
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,400
Just remember, pick quickly.

617
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,120
Tabitha will be here soon
and once she's here...

618
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Oh, no.

619
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
Once she's here, what?

620
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,160
<i>Attention, the store will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

621
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,000
I can't believe I got my dad killed.

622
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,800
No, it was Hank's choice
to make a deal with a demon.

623
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,280
That is not your fault.

624
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,080
You spending time with him
inspired him.

625
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,040
Made him happy.

626
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,760
I don't think you doomed him.

627
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,040
I think you saved him.

628
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,040
Here's to the man you helped
your dad become.

629
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,600
You know what, Ray?

630
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,760
You're right. I shouldn't be
embarrassed, I should be proud.

631
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,880
Yeah, my dad was a little wacky,
but most of the good ones are.

632
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,240
He was a Legend and he should be
remembered that way.

633
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Mikey T!

634
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,080
I got to stop him.

635
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,840
Sara will never let you take Ava.

636
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,320
If not her, I'll find someone else.

637
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
You know,

638
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,880
I can bring back other people.

639
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,760
Damien misses you so much.

640
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,040
- You can bring my father...
- Of course.

641
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,480
Now be a lamb and let me out,

642
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Nora, doll.

643
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,400
You know, you can't just walk out
of here.

644
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,440
Constantine will never let you
do that.

645
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,560
Maybe as Desmond.

646
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,680
But if you let me in,

647
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,920
you, with my power?

648
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,240
Nobody could stop us.

649
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,360
The monitors were wonky.
Are you all right?

650
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,720
Of course.

651
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,840
You shut them down.
I should have never trusted you.

652
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,520
Shut up, John.

653
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,840
<i>Attention, the store will be closing
in two minutes.</i>

654
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Where is she?

655
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,960
None of these are Ava.
I'm not leaving without her!

656
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Ava.

657
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,720
But you could have chosen
any one of those other women.

658
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,360
I don't want other women.

659
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
But I'm...

660
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Hey.

661
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Hey.

662
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You did it.

663
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
No.

664
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
We did it.

665
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,680
We did it.

666
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Let's do this.

667
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Nora.

668
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Now!

669
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,200
Vessel, what a pretty word
for victim.

670
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,200
Oh, I don't need your power, Neron.

671
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,120
I have my own.

672
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
We've got him.

673
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
Oh, just a few minutes more.

674
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Nora!

675
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Ray, no!

676
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,320
Guys, guys, guys.

677
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay, mate.

678
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
It's all right.

679
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Where am I?

680
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
You're safe.

681
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Nora?

682
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Nora?

683
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,160
Eggplant's a little obvious.
I say you go with mushroom.

684
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,320
Mushroom...

685
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,680
Ava! You're back from the dead.

686
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
- I knew you'd do it, Captain.
- Gently.

687
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

688
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,560
Oh, nice job, boss.

689
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
Okay, serious,

690
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,840
- which emoji's like...
- All right, enough with the emoji.

691
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,400
- Hey!
- Just... just leave while you can.

692
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
You should just...

693
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,080
-Okay.
-Maybe...

694
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,360
You know, we should probably talk
about whether or not we want kids.

695
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,920
Let's wait until the other eight
are old enough to handle the news.

696
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,240
I don't even know
what this text means anymore.

697
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,880
"You up? Hot dog, donut, thumbs up."

698
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
Well, you wanna snog him, yeah?

699
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,640
Or do you want him to get diabetes?

700
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,920
Okay, this doesn't sound
like me at all.

701
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,000
You like him and he likes you,
just tell him that.

702
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Okay.

703
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,000
"Want to go out sometime...

704
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,840
On a date"?

705
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh, yes. See? That wasn't so bad.

706
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Now, it's all on Nate.

707
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Oh, God.

708
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,280
Oh, God, what did I do?

709
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,920
Mikey, pick up. Mikey, pick up.

710
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,240
Yeah, you can just drop that down.
You're not gonna need it.

711
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
No. Mikey, no!

712
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Mikey!

713
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,280
Mikey, stop!

714
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Zari?

715
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,040
Is that you, And Son?

716
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,280
I changed my mind.

717
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,240
What are you doing?
You should have just called.

718
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Jeez.

719
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,800
I knew I should have synced
to the stupid cloud.

720
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Nate.

721
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
- Hey.
- Hi.

722
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
So about...

723
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
About that text.

724
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Oh, yeah.

725
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,880
My phone had an unfortunate run in
with a wrecking ball, so...

726
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,120
Oh, my God.

727
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
That sucks.

728
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
What'd you wanna talk about?

729
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,520
I just wanted to let you know that
Sara and Ava, they're good.

730
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,120
- That's great!
- Yeah.

731
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
Anything else you wanna talk about?

732
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,800
No, no, not that I can think of.

733
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Okay. Cool, cool, cool.

734
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,000
- Glah... yeah, bye.
- Bye.

735
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Zari.

736
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Bye.

737
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Hello?

738
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Is there anyone here who can call me
a cab?

739
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,320
Anything you need, mate.

740
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,960
I can get you a flight
to New Orleans,

741
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,880
anywhere in the world, you name it.

742
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
No.

743
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,960
I don't want anything from you.

744
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm not asking for forgiveness, Des.

745
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Good.

746
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,720
Just wait, wait, Des.

747
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
You saved me, Johnny.

748
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
I'm grateful for that.

749
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,080
But it doesn't change anything.

750
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I know.

751
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,920
You know I can make it
all go away, Des.

752
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,160
This will make you forget.

753
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
No.

754
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,320
You sent me to hell.

755
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,520
That's something we're both
gonna have to live with.

756
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,680
How's she holding up, old son?

757
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,480
She's stable, but unresponsive.

758
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,680
Well, that's better
than the alternative.

759
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,560
I couldn't let her get hurt again.

760
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,080
Oh, yeah, well, you just rolled
straight in there

761
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,480
like a knight in shining armor
and nearly got her killed.

762
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,480
I didn't mean to.

763
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Yeah, I know.

764
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,640
She's a brave lass,

765
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,160
nearly cost her her life.

766
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,560
But she killed that bloody demon.

767
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
She's amazing.

768
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,880
We'll get you out of this one, Nora.

769
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,400
I'm not gonna abandon you again.

770
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
It's okay, boy.

771
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,320
Dogs usually love me.
