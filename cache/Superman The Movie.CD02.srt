1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.

2
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:50,242
Come on, let's get out of here.

3
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,259
Move your ass! Come on!

4
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,688
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

5
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,195
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

6
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,061
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.

7
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:13,237
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

8
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:14,903
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

9
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,100
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.

10
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:42,959
Bad vibrations?

11
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,763
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.

12
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,764
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

13
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:54,542
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up
in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.

14
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,780
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!

15
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,247
With bright red boots?

16
00:01:58,483 --> 00:01:59,677
Take the night off.

17
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,379
Go back to Murphy's bar
and continue what you started.

18
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:05,589
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there.

19
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,135
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.

20
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,512
Frisky, will you come down from there.

21
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,253
Hi. I'll get him.

22
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,885
Come on, it's all right.

23
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,363
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.

24
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:51,993
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

25
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:56,470
'Bye.

26
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,639
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

27
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:05,645
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

28
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:08,681
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.

29
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:17,684
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

30
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:21,798
<i>Metropolis currently ceiling 500,
overcast 700 broken...</i>

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,130
<i>... visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.</i>

32
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,134
Roger.

33
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,507
Doesn't look good. What do you think?

34
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,577
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,705
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.

36
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:40,309
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.

37
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:41,477
Bring up two and three.

38
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,851
We haven't got enough pressure
to keep going.

39
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:48,722
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

40
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,996
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

41
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:55,097
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

42
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,394
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

43
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,027
Notify them the President's on board.

44
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,972
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

45
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,477
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

46
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,498
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

47
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,801
What the hell's going on out there?

48
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:34,130
Fly, don't look, just fly.

49
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,030
We got something.

50
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.

51
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,364
<i>You enjoyed it.</i>

52
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,003
I don't know what to say, Father.

53
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,104
I am afraid just got carried away.

54
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,974
<i>- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.</i>

55
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,842
You couldn't have imagined...

56
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,512
<i>How good it felt?</i>

57
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,982
<i>You are revealed to the world.</i>

58
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:19,125
<i>Very well.</i>

59
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,722
<i>So be it.</i>

60
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,757
<i>But you still must keep
your secret identity.</i>

61
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:26,421
Why?

62
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:28,363
<i>The reasons are two.</i>

63
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:32,238
<i>First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.</i>

64
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,365
24.

65
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,176
<i>As it is, it won't happen.</i>

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,640
<i>Your help will be called for endlessly.</i>

67
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:46,117
<i>Even for those tasks that human beings
can solve themselves.</i>

68
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:50,223
<i>They're happy to abuse the resources
of the world.</i>

69
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:51,816
And secondly?

70
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:52,881
<i>Secondly:</i>

71
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:54,920
<i>Your enemies will discover...</i>

72
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,826
<i>... their only way to hurt you...</i>

73
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:00,256
<i>... by hurting the people you care for.</i>

74
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:02,894
Thank you, Father.

75
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,226
<i>Lastly:</i>

76
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,465
<i>Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.</i>

77
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,871
<i>Simply learn to control them.</i>

78
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:15,213
<i>It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.</i>

79
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:19,549
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...</i>

80
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,111
<i>... who considered us indestructible.</i>

81
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,580
<i>Were it not for vanity...</i>

82
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,921
<i>... at this very moment...</i>

83
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,496
<i>... I could embrace you in my arms...</i>

84
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:40,105
<i>... my son.</i>

85
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,832
<i>Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...</i>

86
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:17,409
<i>... from almost certain destruction.</i>

87
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:21,975
<i>Rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter
from the Daily Planet, with one hand...</i>

88
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,447
<i>... and a crashed helicopter with the other.</i>

89
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,847
That'll be the day.

90
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,686
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.

91
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,860
I don't know. You would be surprised.

92
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,027
<i>Some sort of fantastic hoax.</i>

93
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,203
<i>Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?</i>

94
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,364
<i>Miracle or fraud? The answer...</i>

95
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,168
<i>- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?</i>

96
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:49,934
Turn it off.

97
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,153
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?

98
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,155
If he is, he's not from this world.

99
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:06,587
Why?

100
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:10,960
If any human being was gonna perpetrate
such a hoax, it would have been me!

101
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,706
My robe.

102
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,673
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

103
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,782
It all fits somehow,
this coming here to Metropolis...

104
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:34,984
...and at this particular time.

105
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:41,292
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.

106
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:45,928
To commit the crime of the century, a man
wants to face the challenge of the century.

107
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:53,297
Listen, maybe this guy that flies
is just sort of passing through.

108
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,832
Passing through?

109
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,175
Not on your life, Otis...

110
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,610
...which I would gladly sacrifice
by the way...

111
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,011
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

112
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:10,020
And, Otis, by the way, next time
put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.

113
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,356
Now look.

114
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:14,924
<i>The Post, "It Flies."</i>

115
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,522
<i>The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."</i>

116
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,891
<i>The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."</i>

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,499
<i>The Planet. We're sitting on top
of the story of the century here.</i>

118
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,433
I want the name
of this flying whatchamacallit...

119
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,667
<i>...to go with the Daily Planet
like bacon and eggs...</i>

120
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,802
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

121
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:33,273
I don't think that he'd...

122
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:35,941
...lend himself
to any cheap promotion schemes.

123
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,639
Exactly how would you know that?

124
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:42,481
Just first impression.

125
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,251
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.

126
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,622
- Right?
- Right, Chief.

127
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,959
I want the real story.

128
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,298
I want the inside dope on this guy.

129
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,460
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?

130
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:01,633
Tonight at 8:00. Your place.
Hopefully - A friend.

131
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,609
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

132
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,339
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?

133
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,282
Why did he show up last night?

134
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:14,277
Where does he come from?

135
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:15,820
Does he have a girlfriend?

136
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,758
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

137
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,454
Now listen to me, I tell you,
boys and girls...

138
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,888
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...

139
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:28,492
...is going to wind up with the single,
most important interview since...

140
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,169
...God talked to Moses!

141
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:37,573
What are you standing around about for?
Move!

142
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,677
Get on that story.

143
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,466
"8:00," he said. Some friend!

144
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,037
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust!"

145
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:19,976
Good evening, Miss Lane.

146
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,725
Did you have plans this evening?

147
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,323
This old thing? No.

148
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,721
- I could come back later.
- No!

149
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,030
Don't move.

150
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,102
Sure you can move.

151
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:40,933
Just don't fly away, all right?

152
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,977
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but I've been thinking.

153
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,770
There must be some questions
people'd like to know the answers to.

154
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:49,838
Yes.

155
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,283
You really shouldn't smoke.

156
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,059
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

157
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:05,589
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

158
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,797
Would you like a glass of wine?

159
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,995
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

160
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,633
Nice place.

161
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,270
Thank you.

162
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,905
Thank you.

163
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,542
Shall we get started with the interview?

164
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:31,051
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?

165
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:33,884
No, I'm not.

166
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,519
Do you have a girlfriend?

167
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,927
No, I don't. But...

168
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:40,830
If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.

169
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,332
- How old are you?
- Over 21.

170
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,672
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.

171
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,780
And how big are you? How tall are you?

172
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,174
About 6' 4".

173
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,511
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?

174
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,382
Around 225.

175
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,188
225?

176
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:13,927
I assume then that...

177
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:19,099
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

178
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:21,299
I beg your pardon?

179
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,373
Well, putting it delicately...

180
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:30,041
...do you...

181
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:33,948
...eat?

182
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,752
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.

183
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,117
You do. Of course, you do.

184
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,296
Well, then is it true...

185
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:49,092
...that you can see through anything?

186
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:51,232
Yes, I can, pretty much.

187
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:55,368
And that you're totally impervious to pain?

188
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:56,966
Well, so far.

189
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:00,609
What color underwear am I wearing?

190
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,480
Did I embarrass you?

191
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,051
- No.
- I did.

192
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:11,049
No, it's just that
this planter must be made of lead.

193
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,123
Yes, it is. So?

194
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:16,754
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

195
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,059
That's interesting.

196
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,195
Problems with lead.

197
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:25,730
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?

198
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,238
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.

199
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:29,571
Pink!

200
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:34,671
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

201
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:37,581
You didn't embarrass me.

202
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,980
What's your background?
Where are you from?

203
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:45,682
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.

204
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,089
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.

205
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:53,226
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.

206
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,525
Krypton.

207
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:00,135
Cripton! With a C-r-i...

208
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:04,807
No, actually it's Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-P-T-O-N.

209
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:09,877
Do you like pink?

210
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,778
I like pink very much.

211
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,559
Why are you?

212
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:24,059
Sorry?

213
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:28,191
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.

214
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:32,004
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice
and the American way.

215
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:36,103
You'll end up fighting every official
in this country.

216
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,976
You don't really mean that.

217
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,436
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

218
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:42,739
I never lie.

219
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,716
How fast do you fly, by the way?

220
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,786
I don't know. I've never actually bothered
to time myself.

221
00:15:58,932 --> 00:15:59,626
Say?

222
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:02,565
Why don't we find out?

223
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,168
And how do you propose we do that?

224
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:09,035
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?

225
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:11,339
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.

226
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:14,842
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

227
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,113
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

228
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,182
Don't you want to go?

229
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,048
You won't need these.

230
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:25,717
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.

231
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,229
Ready?

232
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,196
Clark said that you were just a figment
of somebody's imagination.

233
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,464
Like Peter Pan.

234
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,532
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?

235
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,246
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?

236
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:53,083
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

237
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:11,616
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

238
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,485
<i>Do you know what it is that you do to me?</i>

239
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,363
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

240
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:32,498
<i>Just a friend from another star.</i>

241
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:39,138
<i>Here I am, like a kid out of school.</i>

242
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,706
<i>Holding hands with a god.</i>

243
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:45,773
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

244
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>Will you look at me?</i>

245
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:50,687
<i>Quivering.</i>

246
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:53,655
<i>Like a little girl shivering.</i>

247
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,961
<i>You can see right through me.</i>

248
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:03,633
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

249
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,938
<i>Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?</i>

250
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:16,578
<i>Wondering why you are...</i>

251
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:21,078
<i>... all the wonderful things you are.</i>

252
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:25,217
<i>You can fly.</i>

253
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:28,350
<i>You belong in the sky.</i>

254
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:31,630
<i>You and I...</i>

255
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,294
<i>... could belong to each other.</i>

256
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,238
<i>If you need a friend...</i>

257
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,743
<i>... I'm the one to fly to.</i>

258
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,147
<i>If you need to be loved...</i>

259
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,144
<i>... here I am.</i>

260
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,218
<i>Read my mind.</i>

261
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,207
We forgot to time ourselves.

262
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:25,945
Maybe next time.

263
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:36,291
You okay?

264
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,432
Good night.

265
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:43,733
Good night.

266
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,635
What a super man!

267
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,512
Superman!

268
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:04,980
Anybody home?

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,865
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

270
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:20,738
For goodness' sake,
didn't you hear me knocking?

271
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:24,499
We did have a date tonight, remember?

272
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,509
You haven't been?

273
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:35,277
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

274
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:38,749
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.

275
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:43,224
I mean, I need a purse,
and I have to fix my hair...

276
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:45,562
...put some blusher on.

277
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,777
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...

278
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:13,753
I was at first really nervous about tonight.

279
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:19,164
But then I decided, darn it, I was going
to show you the time of your life.

280
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:20,457
That's Clark nice.

281
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:26,331
We could go for a hamburger
or whatever you want to do.

282
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:34,413
Now then...

283
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:39,084
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

284
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:42,878
...and the proximity
to our own solar system...

285
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:48,286
It's amazing. Amazing!

286
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:50,554
Too good to be true.

287
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,929
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

288
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,366
...doesn't drink or smoke
and tells the truth.

289
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:59,261
<i>Some people can read War and Peace...</i>

290
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,999
...and think it was an adventure story.

291
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:05,033
Others can read the ingredients
on a gum wrapper...

292
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:07,505
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

293
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:12,844
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

294
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:17,446
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

295
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:22,583
"N."

296
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:25,730
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

297
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,092
So there you go, "M."

298
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:31,260
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

299
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,562
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...

300
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:36,636
..."nincompoop," "nitwit,"
and "L" as in "ladder."

301
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,472
Here's a ladder, coming right up.

302
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,546
I didn't see...

303
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:42,512
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

304
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:47,648
In the interview he says
that the Planet Krypton...

305
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:51,420
...exploded in 1948.

306
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:53,719
That ridiculous little freak...

307
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,895
...took three years in a rocket
to get to earth.

308
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,257
- Ergo...
- Ergo.

309
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:02,126
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

310
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,468
He's 6' 4", you know that?

311
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,573
Do you know why the number 200 is
so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

312
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:11,600
It's your weight and my I.Q.

313
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,076
Think, people, think.

314
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,415
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.

315
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:21,319
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

316
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:24,147
...exploded and went into outer space.

317
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:26,120
It is reasonable to assume...

318
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:29,217
...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

319
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:33,062
Meteorites!

320
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,598
<i>Jawohl.</i>

321
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,197
<i>Voilà!</i>

322
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:44,306
<i>Voilà!</i>

323
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:51,248
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

324
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,976
I know I'll get rapped
in the mouth for this, but...

325
00:26:55,054 --> 00:26:56,214
...so what?

326
00:26:56,756 --> 00:26:59,418
So what? You mean to us
they're just meteorites.

327
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,326
Fair enough.

328
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:04,786
But the level of specific radioactivity...

329
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:07,526
...is so high to anyone
from the Planet Krypton...

330
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,090
...this substance is lethal.

331
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:11,669
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

332
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:14,699
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

333
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:16,307
...but this stuff here...

334
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,536
...will kill him.

335
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:24,016
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

336
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,780
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

337
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,247
Not like the shudder you'll get
when you lay that rock on him.

338
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,619
He can see you coming for miles
with those super peepers of his.

339
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:39,295
O Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see...

340
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:42,126
...nor can Superman, through lead.

341
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:46,369
He can't see through lead?

342
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:48,930
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

343
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:53,942
Any questions, class?

344
00:27:55,348 --> 00:27:57,612
I wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa?

345
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,517
Looks like a burnoose.

346
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:01,716
It's just a wraparound.

347
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:04,884
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

348
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,984
<i>Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.</i>

349
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:10,725
<i>Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.</i>

350
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:14,899
<i>Everything looks good,
see you at the base. Over and out.</i>

351
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:17,767
<i>Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.</i>

352
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:02,080
Look at this!

353
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,076
Looks pretty bad.

354
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:10,014
Take her pulse.

355
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,161
Get an ambulance down here.

356
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:24,964
I don't want to hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

357
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,106
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?

358
00:29:28,174 --> 00:29:31,166
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

359
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:33,734
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

360
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:34,835
Yes, sir!

361
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:39,815
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

362
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:41,144
Get an ambulance.

363
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,578
Gather around.

364
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:45,515
Turn around!

365
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,708
Hi.

366
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:16,478
Somebody hurt?

367
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:35,535
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

368
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:37,870
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

369
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:41,344
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.

370
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:43,506
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...

371
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:47,047
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

372
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:51,816
I set the first directional vector...

373
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:53,748
...to 38.

374
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:57,895
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.

375
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,596
What about the fourth one?

376
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,293
What fourth one?

377
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,867
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?

378
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:08,666
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!

379
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:12,834
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, 7.

380
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,141
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

381
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:20,145
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

382
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:22,379
Would you like to see a long arm?

383
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:26,179
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very, long arm?

384
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:27,452
No, Mr. Luthor.

385
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:44,970
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

386
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:50,548
MacDonald, I thought you told me
this road would be blocked off?

387
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:53,847
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't asked him, I asked you.

388
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,916
All right. Follow me, men.

389
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:01,855
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.

390
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,705
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

391
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:16,434
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

392
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,778
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.

393
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:33,416
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

394
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:44,231
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

395
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:52,535
This man is a diabetic, you see.

396
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:07,519
<i>As you know, the Daily Planet
is very interested in that dam...</i>

397
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,656
...but what I don't understand...

398
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:12,754
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person
you've never met?

399
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,230
You don't know his name.

400
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,369
At the stupid high price he offered...

401
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,873
...for this worthless piece of desert...

402
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:24,806
...I hope it's Custer!

403
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:29,174
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

404
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:33,213
<i>Reporting live from the launch site,
ground zero.</i>

405
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:37,816
<i>Today marks a historic occasion since...</i>

406
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:42,255
<i>... two XK-101 rockets will be
launched simultaneously.</i>

407
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,958
<i>One by the Army, and one by the Navy.</i>

408
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,397
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?

409
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,697
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

410
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,600
You're blocking the set, Clark.

411
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:56,033
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?

412
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:56,938
Good.

413
00:33:57,843 --> 00:33:59,140
Excuse me, Mr. White.

414
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:02,179
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?

415
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:05,447
She's out West,
looking into a land-fraud deal.

416
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:08,412
I sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

417
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:11,786
Some unidentified clown
is buying thousands of acres...

418
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:14,087
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.

419
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:15,921
That doesn't seem to make sense.

420
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:18,622
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.

421
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:21,291
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

422
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:25,660
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people, and what do they take?

423
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:28,400
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?

424
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:32,104
I've never been able
to understand violence.

425
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:34,076
I know that about you.

426
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:36,147
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

427
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:40,014
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...

428
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:43,883
...and I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

429
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:47,349
...elbow grease and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

430
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:49,123
Humility?

431
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:52,021
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.

432
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:54,726
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

433
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:57,194
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.

434
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:07,369
<i>This is Lex Luthor.</i>

435
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:11,507
<i>Only one thing alive with less than
four legs can hear this frequency.</i>

436
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,572
<i>That's you.</i>

437
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:17,684
<i>In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet
containing propane lithium compound...</i>

438
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:21,451
<i>... will be released through thousands
of air ducts in this city...</i>

439
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:24,963
<i>... effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.</i>

440
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,158
I was a reporter before most of my friends
were copy boys.

441
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,297
I want you to get Lois
to introduce you to Superman.

442
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:34,666
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?

443
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:37,603
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?

444
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,073
<i>I know it all seems a bit much...</i>

445
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:42,579
<i>... but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?</i>

446
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:45,945
<i>I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.</i>

447
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:51,517
<i>But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help...</i>

448
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:57,221
<i>I just knew you couldn't resist
that chance to sort of pitch in.</i>

449
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,361
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

450
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:35,928
<i>There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.</i>

451
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,764
<i>But then nobody's perfect.</i>

452
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,606
<i>Almost nobody.</i>

453
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:54,216
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!

454
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,555
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.

455
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,260
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

456
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:21,645
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

457
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,880
Tell me what you see?

458
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,847
Cuteness, dimples.

459
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:28,812
You like cuteness?

460
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:30,750
Dimples.

461
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,121
I'll give you dimples.

462
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,850
<i>The pressure is still on you.</i>

463
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:12,893
<i>You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...</i>

464
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,432
...get out of the tunnel.

465
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,686
It's your last chance, Superman.

466
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:43,126
<i>Why don't you do yourself a favor
and freeze.</i>

467
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,485
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

468
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,466
He's definitely coming.

469
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,345
It's open, come in.

470
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:18,318
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

471
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:20,252
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

472
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:27,961
I don't think he wants me to.

473
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,432
Where's the gas pellet?

474
00:40:29,935 --> 00:40:30,799
Somewhere.

475
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:35,229
It's in the back of my mind, actually.

476
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,205
It's a little idea I was toying with.

477
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:40,904
Is that how a warped brain like yours
gets its kicks?

478
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,106
By planning the death of innocent people?

479
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,216
No. By causing the death
of innocent people.

480
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,273
<i>Fire!</i>

481
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:52,656
<i>Navy Bird, we have a good launch.</i>

482
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,437
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

483
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:09,102
...very heavy into real estate.

484
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:14,007
To make money, you have to buy
for a little and sell for a lot, right?

485
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,346
Right.

486
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,372
So, the problem?

487
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:22,779
How to make the land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

488
00:41:22,854 --> 00:41:24,412
...and the time you sell it?

489
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:27,223
Now this is California.

490
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:30,157
The richest, most populous state
in the Union.

491
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,389
I don't need a geography lesson from you.

492
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:36,860
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

493
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:38,660
Where was I?

494
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:40,899
- California.
- California, right.

495
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:43,600
The San Andreas Fault,
maybe you've heard of it?

496
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,007
Yes. It's the joining together
of two land masses.

497
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:49,774
The fault line is shifting, which is why
you get earthquakes in California.

498
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:52,881
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.

499
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:57,984
Everything west of this line is the richest,
most expensive real estate in the world.

500
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:00,717
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

501
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,726
Everything on this side of the line...

502
00:42:02,827 --> 00:42:05,853
...is just hundreds of miles
of worthless desert land...

503
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,990
...which just happens to be owned by...

504
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,427
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

505
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:15,195
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.

506
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:19,234
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

507
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,046
...planted at just the proper point would...

508
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:24,577
Would destroy most of California.

509
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:29,814
Millions of people would be killed
and the West Coast as we know it would...

510
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:33,187
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

511
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:36,886
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

512
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,226
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

513
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,324
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

514
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:47,600
"Otisburg"?

515
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:50,104
Miss Teschmacher,
she's got her own place.

516
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:51,107
"Otisburg"?

517
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:52,876
It's a little bitty place.

518
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:54,033
Otisburg?

519
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,678
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.

520
00:42:57,816 --> 00:42:59,545
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

521
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,610
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

522
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:05,314
I'll admit there were a few problems.

523
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,384
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile.

524
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:11,987
Finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself...

525
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:16,230
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...

526
00:43:17,068 --> 00:43:17,796
...here.

527
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:44,286
That's impossible!

528
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:49,294
What's happening, Lieutenant?

529
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:50,925
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

530
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:54,102
Abort.

531
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,607
<i>All counter control units...</i>

532
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,768
<i>... remove vacuum pressure to maximum.</i>

533
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,510
Function negative, sir.

534
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,945
Can't you knock them down?

535
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:08,349
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have
the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.

536
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,887
Get me the Pentagon.

537
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:19,822
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?

538
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:22,459
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.

539
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,798
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

540
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:28,504
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

541
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,538
Fantasy?

542
00:44:29,874 --> 00:44:30,806
No.

543
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:34,208
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

544
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:36,640
Miss Teschmacher!

545
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:42,681
Yes, Lex?

546
00:44:43,054 --> 00:44:44,453
Where's the rocket now?

547
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:48,352
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon,
so is the other one.

548
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,518
The other one?

549
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:51,193
There are two of them?

550
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:56,530
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

551
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:00,137
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

552
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:03,432
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

553
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,705
All right, Luthor, where is it?

554
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:07,810
Where's the detonator?

555
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:22,816
Diseased maniac!

556
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:26,220
Do you think you could hide it from me
by encasing it in lead?

557
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:30,833
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.

558
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:32,062
Don't touch that.

559
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:39,935
I told you.

560
00:45:40,678 --> 00:45:41,940
It's Kryptonite.

561
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:44,115
A little souvenir from your hometown.

562
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,084
I've spared no expense
to make you feel at home.

563
00:45:54,592 --> 00:45:56,116
You were great in your day.

564
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:59,093
But it just stands to reason...

565
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:01,661
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

566
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,628
...this old diseased maniac
would be your banker.

567
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:12,201
Mind over muscle.

568
00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:24,982
You don't even care
where the other missile's headed, do you?

569
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:26,617
Certainly I do.

570
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,991
I know exactly where it's headed.

571
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:31,561
Hackensack, New Jersey.

572
00:46:37,368 --> 00:46:41,771
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.

573
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,030
Mine's in California.

574
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,757
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

575
00:48:08,393 --> 00:48:10,156
Please, you can't...

576
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,423
...you can't just stand there.

577
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,494
You can't just stand
and let millions of innocent people die.

578
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:22,202
Maybe.

579
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,543
Please. Please, help me to save them.

580
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,271
Would you promise
to save my mother first?

581
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,385
But, Lois, and Jimmy...

582
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:36,113
But my mother comes first.

583
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:39,645
If you promise, I'll believe you
because you always tell the truth.

584
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,687
I promise, I promise.

585
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:40,584
Why did you kiss me first?

586
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:45,784
I didn't think you'd let me later.

587
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:48,581
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

588
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:52,253
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

589
00:49:58,302 --> 00:50:00,930
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.

590
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,654
<i>Army Bird still heading due east.</i>

591

<i>Navy Bird still heading due west.</i>

<i>Next radar contact after three seconds.</i>

594
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,720
Army Bird still headed east, sir.

595
00:51:45,643 --> 00:51:47,372
<i>Army Bird gaining altitude.</i>

596
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:48,935
Miss Teschmacher!

597
00:51:49,213 --> 00:51:51,010
<i>Radar contact strong.</i>

598
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:53,347

<i>Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.</i>

<i>The force of the explosion has activated

<i>California is suffering a major earthquake.</i>

605

What's going on?

606
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:02,273
It's a quake! Look!

607
00:55:11,048 --> 00:55:12,743
Okay, kids, it's all right now.

608
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:15,075
Hey, it's Superman!

609
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:25,288
Holy mackerel!

610
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,997
We're going off the tracks.

Watch that cable!

613
00:56:26,957 --> 00:56:28,652
Someone try and pull the main.

614
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:30,858
It's impossible. It's red hot!

615
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,801
Is that man all right?

616
00:56:40,938 --> 00:56:41,905
Yeah.

617
00:57:05,796 --> 00:57:06,763
Hang on, Jim.

618
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:18,835
The dam broke.

619
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,214
You're safe here, son.

620
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,548
That's okay. Miss Lane
will be driving by any minute.

621
00:57:41,866 --> 00:57:43,561
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.

622

<i>There has been major quake damage
to Southern California.</i>

sealed itself.</i>

00:58:08,592 --> 00:58:09,388
Come on!

628
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:39,854

<i>It is forbidden.</i>

632
01:04:01,912 --> 01:04:05,245
<i>All those things I can do,
all those powers...</i>

633
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:07,807
<i>... but I couldn't even save him.</i>

634
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:13,222
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

635
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:39,370
Hi.

636
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:42,901
Don't bother, it's dead.

637
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:46,172
Sure it's dead.

638
01:05:48,018 --> 01:05:51,476
The problem with men of steel is
they're never around when you want one.

639
01:05:51,555 --> 01:05:54,285
Do you know what happened
while you were off flying around?

640
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:58,158
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.

641
01:05:58,228 --> 01:06:02,130
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.

642
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:05,259
To top the whole thing off,
this stupid car runs out of gas.

643
01:06:05,535 --> 01:06:06,763
I'm sorry about that, Lois.

644
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:09,429
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

645
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,436
I'm sorry, that's all right.

646
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:27,887
Thanks a lot, Superman.

647
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,659
Put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

648
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:34,424
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.

649
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:39,763
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

650
01:06:42,572 --> 01:06:44,164
He can't stay still for a second.

651
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,771
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.

652
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:53,577
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...

653
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,077
Clark... Wait a minute.

654
01:06:57,587 --> 01:06:58,246
What?

655
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:01,791
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

656
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:05,786
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.

657
01:07:06,096 --> 01:07:08,257
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.

658
01:07:12,602 --> 01:07:14,593
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

659
01:07:15,772 --> 01:07:19,173
<i>But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...</i>

660
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:34,023
You're messing up my suit!

661
01:07:38,428 --> 01:07:40,828
Otis! Watch the ground, you...

662
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:43,231
Good evening, Warden.

663
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,326
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.

664
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,732
Who is it, Superman?

665
01:07:49,973 --> 01:07:50,871
Lex Luthor.

666
01:07:51,675 --> 01:07:54,303
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.

667
01:07:54,411 --> 01:07:56,709
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.

668
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,372
...that these walls...

669
01:07:58,715 --> 01:08:00,706
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

670
01:08:00,884 --> 01:08:02,112
You, you nitwit!

671
01:08:02,385 --> 01:08:03,511
Nincompoop!

672
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,182
This country...

673
01:08:05,255 --> 01:08:07,849
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

674
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:09,120
No, sir.

675
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:10,523
Don't thank me, Warden.

676
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:12,691
We're all part of the same team.

677
01:08:13,196 --> 01:08:14,185
Good night.
