MELVILLE: I neglected to mention it
in my letter,

74
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,116

could surpass the success

which did quite well.

Now there's a writer.

Great writer.

But he is not here. And I am.

For my own particular reasons.

sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

What makes you so sure it's a girl?

101
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,126
Well, it has to be.

102
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,586
So she can remind me

103
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,713
why I still love you
when you're being stubborn.

104
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,633
Well, if it's to be a daughter,
she'll be a version of you, not me.

you'll be trading in

00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,989
MASON: Blood, Mr. Chase.

164
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,701
You can have all the voyages
under your belt you want,

165
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,535
but blood will always win out.

166
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,664
Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill
a ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

167
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,498
To successfully command,
a captain needs respect.

168
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,375
Now, what if the men don't respect him?

169
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,837
You will make sure that they do.

170
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,089
Ah, good day, gentlemen.

171
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,717
MASON: I understand your disappointment,

172
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,470
so, a one-fifteenth lay.

173
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:24,391
That's more than
I've ever paid any first officer.

174
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,603
And if you bring back
2,000 barrels of oil,

175
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,772
I give you my word,

176
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,317
next time, you will have your captaincy.

177
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,778
You've given me
your word before, Mr. Mason.

178
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,532
No, this time, I'll take it in writing.

179

(DOOR CLOSES)

180
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,214
Captain Pollard.

181
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,551
We've just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

182
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,595
He'll be honored to serve under you.

183
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm glad to hear it.

184
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,518
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

185
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,436
Some chinless Nantucketer

186
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,814
born with a damn silver spoon
in his mouth.

187
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,066
You know, I should've thrown
the offer back in their faces.

188
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,153
Why? You now have
the offer of command in writing.

189
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:19,989
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless,

190
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,698
even on paper.

191
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,128
You know, I'd love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain.

192
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,588
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

193
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,090
I won't be gone two years.

194
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,760
A Bedford whaler came back
last week who was gone three.

195
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,430
She lost two men
and still with her hull half empty.

196
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,722
Yeah, well, they were from Bedford,

197
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,308
and they didn't have me on board.

198
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,023
Son of a bitch!

199
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,360
I will captain my own ship!

200
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,572
A whaling ship.

201
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,826
Up to them, all we'd ever have
is this patch of dirt,

202
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,493
and that's not gonna happen, Peggy.

203
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,537
Those are your father's words, not yours.

204
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,581
What's wrong with his words?

205
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,500
He wanted things
for his family, for himself.

206
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:15,962
He was a dreamer, Owen.

207
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,880
Yes, he was.

208
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,841
Dreamed of the sea
and never got to sail it

209
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,467
because of men like them.

210
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,594
At least he got to see his children born.

211
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,938
It's all I know.

212
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,318
Sorry.

213
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,489
I married a whaleman.

214
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:51,998
Hey.

215
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,627
I'll come back as quick
as a summer's night, I swear.

216
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,847
Just come back.

217
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,475
Promise me.

218
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,522
I already swore to you.
Now you want me to promise, too?

219
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,694
I promise.

POLLARD SENIOR: Son, a word with you.

221
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,216
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

222
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,717
You are their superior.

223
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,221
Never forget that.
Never let them forget that.

224

Your great-grandfather and a few others
created this industry.

Without us, without you,
the world plunges into darkness.

We are two days behind.

478
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,267
We need to make up the time
if we're to catch the easterlies.

479
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,812

-MR. CHASE: Come on, move.
-Belay that! Set stunsails!

-The captain wants speed.
-Aye, sir.

-Trim for speed.
-Aye, sir.

486

and topgallant stunsails, men. Move it.

Make fast your stunsail halyard.

Sir, a squall on the starboard bow.

00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,010
We must shorten sail immediately.

Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

501
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,472
Sir, we are headed into a squall
at more than 8 knots,

502
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,016
and it's moving faster than that.

503
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,434
Let it come.
The men are soft from months on land.

504
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,644
They need a good baptism.

505

Let them know our work has begun.

506
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,527
If we don't shorten sail and bear off,
it'll catch us on the beam.

507
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,822
Mr. Chase, we will stand on.

you will assemble the crew.

for interfering with a captain's order,

which nearly cost the lives

That was unlucky.

No, it was bad seamanship.

And blaming misfortune
is just plain weakness.

Pollard!

00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,678
And you, Mr. Chase,
no matter how many whale pins

00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,347
you may have on your lapel,

580
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,349
are nothing more than the son of a farmer

into an officer's tunic.

Now get out.

583
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,611
To return to port
without a single barrel of oil

584
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,488
would be a mistake, sir.

585
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,574
And not behoove a man
whose name is Pollard.

586

Or Chase, for that matter.

587
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,745
And the best thing for both of us

588
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,498
would be to work all hours God sends us,

589
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,417
fill this ship with oil
and be home inside a year

590
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,753
and rid of one another
as quickly as possible.

Trust me, I am every bit
as desirous of that as you.

Of course, that is a captain's decision.

An ill-married couple
will tolerate each other, Mr. Melville.

595
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,245
But an ill-married couple
can also bring down a ship.

596
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,122
Are you married, Mr. Melville?

-I am.
-God have mercy on you.

599
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,130
So, does your good wife
know that you've brought

600
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,465
all you have in the world here tonight

601
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,800

No, sir.

603
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,805
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

604
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,723
So,

605
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,312
the <i>Essex</i> did not return to port.

She did not.

of our captain and first mate.

805
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,908
So we headed out.

806
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,494
A thousand leagues along the equator.

Well, did you correct them?

820
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,125
Did you remind them of our purpose
to fill this ship with whale oil,

821
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,128
and if the whales are 1,000 leagues out,
that that is where we will go?

You have let yourself

01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,008
Very well.

1282
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,220
-Captain.
-We will draw again.

1283
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:00,014
We will do no such thing.

1284
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,349
We'll draw again.

1285
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:04,561
POLLARD: Mr. Ramsdell,

1286
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,146
you will assume command of this vessel.

1287
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,025
Cousin, will you?

1288
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:13,861
You're our...

1289
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:16,447
You're our captain. The men need you.

1290
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,533
The men will be fine.

1291
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,119
Please.

1292
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,288
Please. Please.

1293
01:32:24,538 --> 01:32:26,540
-Henry.
-(CRYING) Let us draw again.

1294
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,876
It is an order.

1295
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,213
If you cannot do it,

1296
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,256
pass the pistol to another man.

1297
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,230
(GUN COCKING)

1298
01:33:02,284 --> 01:33:03,911
Henry, no, no, no!

1299
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,090
MR. COLE: You gotta help me, kid.
You gotta help me.

1300

NICKERSON: We were weeks in the doldrums.

1301
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:24,641
That part of the Pacific
is more desert than ocean.

1302
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:27,518
The sun beating down.

1303
01:33:28,435 --> 01:33:29,687
My fear.

1304
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,899
All I could think about

1305
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,318
was that everyone would die,

1306
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:38,237
and I'd be the last left alive.

1307
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:43,450
And as best Mr. Chase could tell,
we were still 800 miles from land.

1308
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:47,121
(THUDDING)

1309
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,167
POLLARD: Mr. Chase.

1310
01:33:57,924 --> 01:33:59,133
Ah.

1311
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,802
Captain Pollard.

1312
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,889
I am happy to see you.

1313
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:08,392
Been very little happiness
in our survival.

1314
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:11,979
Or in ours, sir.

1315
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,606
POLLARD: Barzillai?

1316
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:19,111
The third boat?

1317
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,363
They've, uh...

1318
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,533
They've been gone for days.

1319
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:26,911
I'm afraid they're lost, sir.

(RUMBLING)

1321
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,860
POLLARD: Mr. Chase,
you have the best position.

1322
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,336
It's just a whale.

1323
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:22,508
He's there! Throw the lance!

1324
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:24,718
Throw it!

1325
01:35:29,431 --> 01:35:32,601
-Throw it! Throw the lance!
-Come on.

1326
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,989
Throw it!

1327
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:46,698
Come on.

(WHALE CLICKING)

01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:57,168
POLLARD: Kill it! He's there!

1330
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:59,003
Throw the lance!

1331
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,190
Why didn't you kill it?

1332
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:47,759
You're a damn fool.

Wake up, Mr. Chase!

Here, wake up!

Please wake up, sir, there's land.

Mr. Chase, look.

1350
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,599
NICKERSON: <i>We were rescued there,</i>

1351
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:25,769
<i>off the island of Más Afuera, Chile,</i>

1352
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:29,565
<i>90 days after the sinking of the</i> Essex.

1353
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,152
<i>They gave us some old clothes.</i>

1354
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,903
<i>Fed us, too.</i>

1355
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:38,449
<i>It was hard to eat at first.</i>

1356
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:39,866
<i>Strange.</i>

1357
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,454
<i>They looked after us as best they could</i>

1358
01:40:43,537 --> 01:40:45,914
<i>till we found a ship</i>
<i>that would carry us home.</i>

1359
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,460
<i>That voyage took another three months.</i>

1360
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:02,055
<i>It looked like the whole island</i>
<i>turned out to see us return.</i>

<i>But there were no cheers.</i>

<i>Only silence.</i>

1363
01:41:09,062 --> 01:41:12,441
<i>They looked at us like</i>
<i>we were apparitions,</i>

<i>phantoms.</i>

1365
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:19,365
<i>We'd said nothing of the details</i>

01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:25,972
Oh, God.

Hey, sweetie. Who's this?

01:42:33,146 --> 01:42:34,440

(PEGGY LAUGHING)

1376
01:42:38,777 --> 01:42:40,612
Phoebe Ann Chase, huh?

1377
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,324
This is Daddy.

01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:46,660
Hey, sweetie.

1379
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,500
PEGGY: It's your daddy.

1380
01:43:01,258 --> 01:43:02,676
Oh, my God.

1381
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,519
NICKERSON: Of course,
they couldn't leave him alone.

1382
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:16,357
Mr. Chase and his wife had
scarcely walked a block towards home

1383
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,860
when he was stopped and
made to return to the Maritime office.

1384
01:43:21,027 --> 01:43:23,989
<i>There were business matters</i>
<i>still in question.</i>

1385
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,338
So, to the matter.

1386
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,304
Due to the significant loss of life
and property on our voyage,

1387
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:49,931
it seems there will be an inquiry.

1388
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:52,100
And as captain and first mate,

1389
01:43:52,183 --> 01:43:54,227
we will be expected to give an account

1390
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:55,687
of what happened.

1391
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,105
Yes, of course.

1392
01:43:57,188 --> 01:44:01,735
And having discussed this
with the ship owners and my father,

1393
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:06,615
it is clear that full disclosure
will have ramifications.

1394
01:44:07,073 --> 01:44:09,576
Terrible ramifications
for the whole industry.

1395
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:13,163
That a whale brought down the <i>Essex.</i>

1396
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:15,749
But it's the truth.

1397
01:44:23,757 --> 01:44:25,967
If the insurance houses and investors

1398
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:29,596
were to start worrying
about sea monsters sinking ships,

1399
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:33,266
sailors drawing lots to survive...

1400
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,770
We are in the oil business.

1401
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:38,730
All of us.

1402
01:44:39,147 --> 01:44:40,524
And as in any business,

1403
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:44,277
the probability of success must
always be greater than the risk incurred.

1404
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:48,824
So, what are you suggesting, George?

1405
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,951
That you say the ship ran aground.

1406
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,286
That's a lie.

1407
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:56,582
-And that the men that died, drowned.
-And that's another lie.

1408
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:58,124
Think on it. They will make you captain.

1409
01:44:58,249 --> 01:45:00,377
Well, that pledge I already have
in writing.

1410
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:04,130
Only on the condition
you bring home a ship full of oil.

1411
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,426
This way, it's guaranteed.

1412
01:45:07,509 --> 01:45:09,511
FULLER: You would be a wealthy man.

1413
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:13,056
The name Chase need
no longer be a landsman's name,

1414
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:14,391
but an established name

1415
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:17,394
that belongs among the great families
of Nantucket.

1416
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,064
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

1417
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:24,818
We are asking you to be pragmatic.

1418
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,669
The <i>Essex</i> was stove by a white whale.

1419
01:45:43,795 --> 01:45:46,965
And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whaleboats

1420
01:45:47,048 --> 01:45:50,176
had to commit abominations
in order to survive.

1421
01:45:51,094 --> 01:45:54,848
And, on our return,
we're expected to spread barefaced lies

1422
01:45:56,057 --> 01:45:58,309
so that you,
the ship owners of Nantucket,

1423
01:45:59,185 --> 01:46:02,272
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

1424
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,442
Well, I will not embroider the truth.

1425
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:08,529
Nor should you, George.

1426
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,675
NICKERSON: <i>That last time I saw him...</i>

1430
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,561
NICKERSON: <i>Perhaps there are no words.</i>

1431
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:41,895
Um...

1432
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:46,567
I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...

1433
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:50,403
It's...

1434
01:46:51,362 --> 01:46:55,033
It's been an honor, sir,
to sail with you.

1435
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:01,039
The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

1436
01:47:18,264 --> 01:47:19,432
Here.

1437
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:26,523
Good luck out there, Thomas.

1438
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,485
And you, sir.

1439
01:47:58,597 --> 01:48:01,683
Next day, George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.

1440
01:48:01,975 --> 01:48:03,476
(CROWD MURMURING)

1441
01:48:06,312 --> 01:48:08,064
MASON: Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

1442
01:48:09,315 --> 01:48:11,276
NICKERSON: <i>And all the important men</i>
<i>in Nantucket were there.</i>

1443
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:14,613
<i>It was a formality.</i>

1444
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:18,324
Good day to you, Captain.
Please sit down.

1445
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,081
For the record, then...

1446
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:30,086
The <i>Essex</i> was stove by a white whale

1447
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,756
1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.

1448
01:48:32,964 --> 01:48:35,842
It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.

1449
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,262
Told them the truth.

1450
01:48:43,349 --> 01:48:45,644
<i>Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.</i>

1451
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,396
<i>But the inquiry was a sham.</i>

1452
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:52,233
Pollard went out again,

1453
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:57,155
looking for the white whale.

1454
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,199
He never found it.

1455
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:02,994
<i>He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.</i>

1456
01:49:04,495 --> 01:49:05,872
<i>Twice cursed.</i>

1457
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:08,625
Never sailed again.

1458
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:10,335
And Owen Chase?

1459
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,089
He was a man of his word.

1460
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:17,175
First, he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.

1461
01:49:18,594 --> 01:49:20,303
Mr. Joy had passed.

1462
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:24,057
But the other three were,
incredibly, still alive.

1463
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:28,311
And then?

1464
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:32,565
And then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford.

1465
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:35,944
<i>Started over.</i>

1466
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,196
<i>Became a merchant captain,</i>

1467
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:41,074
<i>sailing on his own terms.</i>

1468
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:53,670
<i>Well, you certainly got your</i>
<i>money's worth, Mr. Melville.</i>

1469
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:56,798
These February nights
are the longest of the year.

1470
01:49:56,882 --> 01:49:58,884
Well, you can both rest now.

1471
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,301
Believe me,

1472
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,638
I shall not be resting for some time.

1473
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,597
NICKERSON: Why?

1474
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:06,767
You got your story.

1475
01:50:07,558 --> 01:50:10,395
You know, your plot. It's all there.

1476
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:14,274
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1477
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,442
No. What, then?

1478
01:50:17,235 --> 01:50:20,822
-Something else you've given me tonight.
-And what's that?

1479
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:25,702
The courage to go where
one does not want to go.

1480
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,455
Mr. Melville,

1481
01:50:29,998 --> 01:50:32,542
what you've heard, what I've told you,

1482
01:50:35,628 --> 01:50:39,758
will it all be of service to your book?

1483
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:44,429
It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,

1484
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,473
inspired by truth.

1485
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:52,228
But I don't believe
I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1486
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:03,239
-Thank you.
-Here.

1487
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:06,743
-Take that with you.
-No. The money is for you. I insist.

1488
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:09,537
I insist you keep it.

1489
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:13,666
And I insist one person
in this conversation is sober.

1490
01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:27,097
-So it's back to, uh...
-Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1491
01:51:27,848 --> 01:51:29,474
Well, good luck.

1492
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:32,477
Thank you.

1493
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,273
You know,

1494
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:41,527
I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently

1495
01:51:42,612 --> 01:51:44,197
and found oil.

1496
01:51:44,697 --> 01:51:46,074
That can't be true.

1497
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:48,034
I heard it, too.

1498
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:52,122
Oil from the ground.

1499
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,001
Fancy that.
