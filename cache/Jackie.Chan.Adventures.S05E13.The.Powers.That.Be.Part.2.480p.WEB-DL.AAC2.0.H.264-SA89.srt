00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,569
Announcer: Previously on
<i>Jackie chan adventures...</i>

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,671
Drago: Your uncle
<i>is</i> a guest of mine,

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,006
you get all 3 of 'em back

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,774
when I get
- the containment unit.

5
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,476
Show me the chi!

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:11,744
Jade: Show me the chan clan!

7
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:14,179
Drago: I told you slackers
to stay in the truck.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,681
Strikemaster ice:
Yeah, well us slackers

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,817
kinda changed our minds
about how it's gonna go down.

10
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,222
Jackie: Drago is drawing
the powers to himself!

11
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,791
Drago: And my first order
of business will be

12
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:28,794
to turn this world inside out!

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,266
(Jade and tohru grunt)

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:42,341
(Drago laughs)

15
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,144
Tohru: Oh...

16
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:48,080
(Falling cries from uncle,
tohru, Jade, and Jackie)

17
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,249
(Falling cries from uncle,
tohru, Jade and Jackie)

18
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,685
(Grunting)

19
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,356
Tohru: Puh! I hate fish.

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,332
Drago: Prepare yourselves,
my demon brethren.

21
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,534
Your liberation awaits.

22
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,737
Mc cobra: So, uh,
what do we do?

23
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,440
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
if d-boy be turnin'
the earth inside-out,

24
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,676
I'm stickin' with the man
like wax on a board.

25
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:51,944
You feel me?

26
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,813
Black: Ok, people, listen up!

27
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:59,151
At 0300 hours, drago absorbed
all 8 demon chi powers.

28
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,487
I'll need all available
equipment and personnel

29
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,222
ready to deploy by Dawn.

30
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,656
This isn't going to be easy,

31
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,492
but I know you're
up to the task.

32
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:10,696
The fate of the entire planet
rests in our hands.

33
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:11,964
Now, let's move!

34
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,832
(Agents talking excitedly)

35
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,501
Uncle: All these years,

36
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,503
black has learned nothing.

37
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,305
Magic must defeat magic.

38
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,808
Black: Drago was last seen
heading east.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,877
Jade: Agent Jade reporting
for duty, <i> sir!</i>

40
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,179
Let's head 'em up
and move 'em out.

41
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,582
Black: Jade, I think you've
done enough for one night.

42
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,152
Jade: I didn't mean for drago
to keep the demon chi.

43
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,453
I had a plan to--

44
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,722
Jackie: We know you were
trying to protect us, Jade,

45
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,624
and we appreciate it.

46
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,259
Black: But from here on out,
little lady,

47
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,896
you need to leave the fight
to the heavyweights.

48
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,900
Uncle: Drago has absorbed
all 8 demon powers.

49
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,602
Do you know of a spell
to remove them?

50
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,038
Shendu: And why
should I help you?

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,406
Uncle: Revenge?

52
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,843
Shendu: My son <i> may</i> have
betrayed me, wizard,

53
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,713
but I will watch proudly
as he destroys your world.

54
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,550
Once all 8 powers
have combined,

55
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,119
nothing can remove them...
Ever.

56
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,588
Uncle: Then conversation
is over.

57
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,889
Shendu: Wait!

58
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,457
Release me.

59
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,428
I will deal with drago
and see that you are spared.

60
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,631
Uncle: Ohh, that
uncle cannot do.

61
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,569
Shendu: Then your earth
is doomed.

62
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,938
Black: No, Mr. mayor,
this is not a drill.

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,840
We need to evacuate
the entire city immediately.

64
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,943
Uh...Meteors--that's right--

65
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,945
heading this way.
Oh! Big ones,

66
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,079
size of, um...

67
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,480
Big meteors.

68
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,482
Gotta go.

69
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,418
Tohru: Hmm. Is there also
a plan to evacuate

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,587
the rest of the planet?

71
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,955
Jade: I know I messed up,

72
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,157
but let me make it up to you,
please, Jackie?

73
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,793
You can't split up
the chan clan
at a time like this.

74
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:48,961
Jackie: No, Jade.

75
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,797
Section 13 is the safest place
in the city,

76
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,665
and you are staying
right here.

77
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,933
Jade: Awww!

78
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,336
Jackie: Tohru, I need you
to take care of Jade.

79
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,705
Tohru: I understand.

80
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,207
Strikemaster ice: Uh,
it was a misunderstanding, yo?

81
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,210
Drago: I don't
suffer traitors well.

82
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,846
Strikemaster ice, dj fist
& mc cobra: Yizow! Wah! Yeeah!

83
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,988
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, that is nasty.

84
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,389
(Uncle mumbles)

85
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,757
(Knock on door)

86
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,993
Uncle: Shop is closed!

87
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,594
(Knocking continues)

88
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,729
Go away!

89
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,364
Uncle is busy!

90
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,865
(Knocking)

91
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,137
Do you want drago
- to turn world inside-out?

92
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,008
No? Then let uncle work!

93
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,909
One more thing...

94
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,144
Aiyaaa!

95
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,114
Chow: Whoa, take it easy,
old timer.

96
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,915
Hak foo: We are not here
to harm you.

97
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,984
Finn: Yeah. We just heard
about this whole

98
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,553
drago-turning-the-
world-inside-out thing.

99
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,188
Ratso: I think there
was meteors comin'.

100
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,357
Chow: Hey, the world
can't end now.

101
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,826
We just got out
of the slammer.

102
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,194
It ain't fair.

103
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,596
Finn: So whaddya say, unc?

104
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,032
We're freelance.
We're reasonably priced.

105
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,701
Ratso: And we promise
not to steal nothin'.

106
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:08,106
Uncle: Do not just
stand there. Get cracking!

107
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,883
Strikemaster ice:
Yo! It's 5-0.

108
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,556
Black: All right, you punks.

109
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,291
Where's drago?

110
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,565
Drago: Bwa ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

111
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,168
Black: You have got to
be kidding me.

112
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,369
Jackie: Bad day.

113
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,073
Jade: We can't
just sit here, tohru.

114
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,574
Jackie needs our help.

115
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,043
Tohru: Your safety
- is Jackie's primary concern.

116
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,080
Jade: Come on, big t.
We're missing all the action.

117
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,681
Grrr.

118
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,484
Drago: I was hoping
you'd put up a fight.

119
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,186
Black: It's go time.

120
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,872
Strikemaster ice: Yo, we can't
let drago have all the fun.

121
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,076
Sorry 'bout your ride,
cueball.

122
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,014
Black: Oof!

123
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,282
Ah--uhh.

124
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,350
Mc cobra: Boo-yah!

125
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,255
Jackie: You don't talk much,
do you?

126
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,323
Oof!

127
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,231
Drago: Mmm! Tasty.

128
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,298
(Burp)

129
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,900
(Agents yell)

130
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,535
(Strength efforts
from strikemaster ice,
dj fist, & mc cobra)

131
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,743
Black: Fall back!

132
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,880
All agents fall back!

133
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,282
Drago: Bwa ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha!

134
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,151
It's pointless to run!

135
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,554
There's nowhere on earth
to hide from your new masters.

136
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,856
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
we spank those fools.

137
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,957
(Drago growls)

138
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
Drago: I should
prepare a proper welcome

139
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,394
for my demon brethren.

140
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,764
A city in ruins will
- make them feel right at home.

141
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,667
Strikemaster ice: Cool!
Let's get this party started.

142
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,404
Drago: No. I have
a special task for you.

143
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,848
I have given you each
another taste of demon chi:

144
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,982
Earth...

145
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,551
Thunder...Wind.

146
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,753
Strikemaster ice: Whoa.
What's the dilly-yo?

147
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,989
Drago: I want you to
eliminate section 13

148
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,558
and everyone in it

149
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,394
once and for all.

150
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:51,002
Drago: Bwa ha ha ha ha ha!

151
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,941
(Panicked screams
from passengers)

152
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,843
Jackie: Captain black,
on the bridge!

153
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,178
Black: I see it. Go! Go!

154
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,385
Clip your end
to the bridge!

155
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,033
(Frightened shouts
from passengers)

156
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,203
Jade: Talismans, yes!

157
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:29,140
Drago's got chi power,
but we have t-power.

158
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,942
Tohru, we have to
get them to Jackie.

159
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,410
Tohru: Jade--

160
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,346
Jade & tohru: Whoa-oh...

161
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,755
Strikemaster ice: Yo yo yo!

162
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,658
The ice crew
is in the hiz-zouse.

163
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,262
Jade: Bring it on,
crater face.

164
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,429
Hyah!

165
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,764
Tohru: Stay back, Jade.

166
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,865
Jade: Grrrr.

167
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,968
(Attack cry from tohru)

168
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,303
(Groan)

169
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,506
Strikemaster ice: Ooh...

170
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,441
That's gonna leave a mark.

171
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,422
Jade: The gecko gang
got a booster shot.

172
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:21,259
Time to give 'em a taste
of their own medicine...

173
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,661
Talisman style.

174
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,462
Tohru: Jade, no!

175
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,464
Whoa!

176
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,200
Strikemaster ice: Aw,
you're worried about
the shorty.

177
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,468
That's sweet, yo,

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,338
but you best be worried
about yourself, big man.

179
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,712
Uncle: Scale of codfish!

180
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,681
Finn: Comin' right up. Whoa!

181
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,383

183
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,953
Whoa!

184
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,490
Powdered butterfly wing!

185
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,293
Ratso: Monarch or swallowtail?

186
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,561
Black, straining: Can't...

187
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,463
Hang on much longer.

188
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,931
(Passengers fret)

189
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,767
(Rope whiplashes)

190
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,903
El toro: I thought you could
use a hand, <i> mi amigos.</i>

191
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,404
Jackie: El toro!

192
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,375
Viper: Heard you were
having a shindig, Jackie.

193
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,377
Jackie: Viper--eh, viper.

194
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,779
Paco: And do not forget
El paco fuerte.

195
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,414
Where is Jade?

196
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,821
(Tug-of-war efforts from all)

197
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,557
(Driver sighs)

198
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,158
Woman: Thank you.

199
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
Valmont?

200
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,264
El toro: Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

201
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,134
El toro fuerte
never removes his mask.

202
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,771
Black: Apparently drago's
lookin' to play a little ball.

203
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,208
Jackie: Well, he's going to
have to beat the home team.

204
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,880
(Massive strength effort
from tohru)

205
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,815
Jade! Jade!

206
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,587
Jade, what are you doing?

207
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,623
Jade: Nabbing the talisman so
we can kick that
ice twerp's butt.

208
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,427
Tohru: We must leave...Now!

209
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,463
Strikemaster ice:
You ain't goin' nowhere.

210
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,733
Tohru: Whoa! Uhh!

211
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,435
Jade: Tohru!

212
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,037
Strikemaster ice: Peace out!

213
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,372
Tohru: Jade, leave here!

214
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,342
Jade: Rat? No. Tiger? No.

215
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,843
Come on, ox, where are you?

216
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,912
Tohru: Uhh! Do as I say, Jade!

217
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,280
Leave here! <i> Now!</i>

218
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,348
Jade: Hang on, t!

219
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,549
Monkey? Rabbit?

220
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,085
No! Tohru!

221
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,465
Tohru...

222
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,402
Uncle: Aiyaaa!

223
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,137
Spell will not work.

224
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,673
Chow: So...The earth
is doomed?

225
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,676
Ratso: But I like it here.
My mom lives close.

226
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,713
Uncle: We must
get reinforcements.

227
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,753
(Drago chewing)

228
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,655
Viper: Ew. Chew
with your mouth closed.

229
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,156
Drago: Chan!

230
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:09,694
You're just in time to watch
me rip your planet <i> wide</i> open!

231
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:13,565
Paco: You'll have to get
past the j-team first. Yulk!

232
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,166
El toro: Stay
in the dugout, paco.

233
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,568
Paco: But I am ready, El toro.

234
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,536
I brought my own mask.

235
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,577
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, time to play ball!

236
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,712
Uncle: Aiyaaa!

237
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,514
Section 13 is rubble.

238
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,582
Finn: Eh, bummer.

239
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,183
Chow: Eh, I never
liked the place.

240
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,485
Ratso: They had
good doughnuts.

241
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,586
Uncle: Stop!

242
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,821
You want to earn paycheck,
yes?

243
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,590
Then start digging.

244
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,125
Finn: Sure thing, boss.

245
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,192
Chow: We're on it.

246
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,393
Ratso: I love manual labor.

247
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,696
Hak foo: Hungry gopher
digs hole.

248
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,646
Paco: The palenque
pile driver!

249
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,725
Mc cobra: Yo, mama,
can't touch this.

250
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:14,926
(Cobra sucks in deep breath)

251
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:15,994
(Blows)

252
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,829
Black & viper: Aaah!

253
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,265
Drago: <i> Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

254
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,067
<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
ààya gaa mee chi-wah

255
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,071
bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!

256
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,873
Jackie: I'll take the demon
on the left.

257
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,675
Jade: Time for
the seventh-inning butt whoop.

258
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,812
The amazing t-troop
is in the house.

259
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,814
Jackie: Jade, explain.

260
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,948
Jade: don't worry, Jackie.

261
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,250
I have the dog talisman--
immortality.

262
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,853
And I brought enough
for everybody:

263
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,588
Invisible snake for viper,

264
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,256

and speedy rabbit
for uncle Jackie.

267
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,099
Supermoose:

Paco: Hey, what about me?

270
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,206
(Attack cries from all)

271
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,708
(Big lift effort from Finn,

Tohru: Oh... <i> Sensei.</i>

275
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,486
Uncle: Uncle is very pleased
you are not pancake.

276
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,888
Where is Jade?

277
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,124
Tohru: She had the talismans.
I told her to run.

278
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,192
Finn: Hey, buddy.

279
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,694
Chow: Long time no see.

280
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,862
Ratso: Have you lost weight?

281
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,064
Uncle: Uncle did not
tell you to visit.

282
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,832
Keep digging.

283
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,834
Finn: If big t's
not our reinforcements...

284
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,302

285
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,316
Black: And <i> this</i>
is for toasting my Van!

286
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,359
(Viper stomps foot, grunts)

287
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,899
Viper: 3 strikes...
You're out.

288

have a talisman, too?

293
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,750
Jade: Well, I was saving
this one for myself,

294
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,518
but...Knock yourself out.

295
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,020

Jade: Kids.

298
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,994
Astro paco: Finish him off
with the Tijuana twister

299
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,829
or the cabo cannonball.

300

Shendu: I think not, boy.

304
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,523
First, you must pay
for your treachery!

305
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,824
Drago: Dad?

306

got it covered.

315

go get a Hot Dog?

316
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,738
Drago: You're weak, old man!

317
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,174
Conquest is a job
for a fiery <i> young</i> dragon.

Jackie: Uhh!

322
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,003
Uncle, you released shendu?

323
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,471
How? Why?

324
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,107
Uncle: Uncle still have
tricks up his sleeve.

325
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,010
Jade: Throw your talismans
to shendu!

326
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,746
Repeat: Throw your talismans
to shendu!

327
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,285
Supermoose: Mo-o-o-ose

328
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,987
muscle!

329
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,533
Shendu: I am complete!

330
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,902
Tohru: <i> Sensei,</i>

331
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,504
if we cannot remove
the demon chi from drago,

332
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,074
perhaps we can remove drago
from the earth.

333
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,309
Uncle: A reversal spell.

334
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,646
<i>Big</i> reversal spell.

335
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,747
Take this.

336
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,983
Uncle has been saving it.

337
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,486

strikemaster ice:
This is whack, yo.

341
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,711
Drago: Father! Help me!

342
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,515
Shendu: You deserve such
a fate for your disloyalty.

343
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,550
Drago: I'm sorry, father!

344
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,152
Please!

345
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,323
Jade: Jackie, wait!

346
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,159
Sometimes the greatest victory
is the battle not fought.

347
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,130
Shendu: This is my domain.

348
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,265
Remember your place!

349
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,067
Drago: Yes, father.

350
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,802
Psyche!

351

Shendu: No-o-o-o-o!

00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:04,342
Uhh!

Jade: Yes!

357
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:22,160
Ratso: Aw, we missed the end.

358
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,831
Paco: Going somewhere?

359
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,166
Viper: Nice job.

360
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,001
We should team up
more often.

361
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,102
Uncle: Keep it.

362
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,970
Graduation present.

363
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,972
You are full chi wizard.

364
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,575
Jade: Go, tohru,
you're a wizard. Oh, yeah!

365
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,711
Black: That was some
good strategic thinking
back there, young lady.

366
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,581
We could use someone like you
at section 13.

367
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,185
Jade: You want me
to be a real secret agent?

368
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,387
Can I, Jackie? <i> Please?!</i>

369
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,789
Jackie: Well...
We'll talk later.

370
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,991
Jade: Hey, that means no.

371
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,826
Come on, Jackie.
Our country needs me.

372
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,195
The <i> world</i> needs me.

373
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,629
Hak foo: Bear hug!

374
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,599
Drago: Ohh! The earth
was within my grasp!

375
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,001
You never let me
have what I want!

376
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,972
Shendu: I told you not to
play with your father's world!

377
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,074
Drago: Why not?
You aren't using it!

378
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:14,145
You're always too busy
fighting wizards!

379
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,385
Jade: Hey Jackie, have you
ever worked with a crocodile?

380
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,486
Jackie: Never.

381
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,388
That I've never done
in my life.

382
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,525
I touch rhino, lion...

383
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,626
Elephant...

384
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,795
Yeah. Not crocodile.
