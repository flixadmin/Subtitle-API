1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,780
I spotted them on Friday.

2
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,559
This is good shit. Fuck!

3
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,099
Both her and Emilie are so hot.

4
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
No...

5
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,600
She isn't doable.

6
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,119
Huh?!

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,779
What do you think?

8
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,380
I think that she's doable.

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,119
- Yeah?
- Emilie as well.

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,360
Emilie is even better.

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,519
What's up with you guys,
lowering you standards.

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,080
What's up with you?

13
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,620
What are you talking about standards? You should
be much less picky, considering how ugly you are.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Is there not a single hot girl? Not one?

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,900
- I could've gotten with all the first years.
- There is one!

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,860
Listen to me. One!

17
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,240
Short, dark hair. Don't know
what she's called. But she's hot.

18
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,920
She's pretty. I saw her.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,120
- The one resembling Natalie Portman?
- Yes, yes, yes. That one.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,740
I don't think you have a chance.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,559
Not in this life, maybe the next one.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,980
I do have a chance!

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:08,020
Last guy she was with was a 20-year-old
model. He was tall and dark. You are neither.

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,379
Why should I care about that?

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,780
Because then you know
what her standards are.

26
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,259
When a girl dates a 20-year-old model,
she won't date another guy like that.

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,540
I have a chance.

28
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,079
- You have to take the stash.
- No!

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm too stressed when I have it.
Take it yourself.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,859
I can't have it with me.

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,459
Then I'll take it. Jesus Christ!

32
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,780
It isn't yours!

33
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,540
- Just let him take it.
- I don't even know him!

34
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,479
- Don't know me? What are you talking about?
- It's 1000 kroner!

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,360
You know... What the fuck?
You're sitting here smoking it with him.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,979
Of course you know him!

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,779
He's in, I'm in, he's in...

38
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,900
Him... I don't know what he's doing.
Just let him take it. I'm really certain.

39
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,140
Thanks.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,740
What would you do without me?

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,880
What's going on? Shut the door.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,940
- I need to pee.
- Then shut the door right now.

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,219
Hello?!

44
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,999
Don't just leave.
I was stuck there with that nerd.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
I had to pee.

46
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,080
- Your girl.
- It's so boring here.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Hello.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,940
Remember when we were at Sana's
place and took some pills?

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,559
- She was so out of it.
- They weren't blue.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,140
I think they're the same.

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Do you know who you look like?

52
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Yes.

53
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,220
The little boy in Stranger Things.

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,220
You know! The little boy
who's actually a girl. Eleven.

55
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,780
So damn rude.

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
No!

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,160
She's sweet.
If you're into 13-year-old boys.

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,020
- Huh? What?
- I'm only kidding!

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
Seriously. I'm only kidding. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,359
- My name's Isak. What's yours?
- Emma.

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Emma? You're really beautiful.

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
We're leaving.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,059
Do you know how this works?

64
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,400
Let me see.

65
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,299
Zyrtec? Those are allergy pills.

66
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,160
They'll make you tired.

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
- Do you want something that works?
- Do you have that?

68
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,060
Maybe.

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm leaving.

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Uh yeah. We'll check if there's
some food around here.

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,300
Really nice, Isak.

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,780
- Hey...
- Hey, what?

73
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,460
Emma, Yousef is here.

74
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,420
- Have you seen Eva?
- No.

75
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Hi.

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,540
- Where are you going?
- Home.

77
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,400
- You're going home? Over the fence?
- Yeah.

78
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,020
Everybody else has gone
through the gate over there.

79
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,280
Do you have some ID on you?
With your name etc.

80
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,220
Bank card? Driver's license?

81
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,980
- No.
- Nothing?

82
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,779
- What's your name?
- Adrian Eksett.

83
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,760
Adrian. How old are you?
Wait a minute.

84
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes? Answer.

85
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,700
<i>[Mamma, Exodus 20:4]</i>

86
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,700
<i>[Do you still have our stash? Call me when you wake up. Police found
some stuff at Eva's place. She's really mad and thinks it's mine.]</i>

87
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:27,640
<i>[Pick up your phone then. Sorry I had to hide it at Eva's. But it's
not possible that they found it because I hid it really well.]</i>

88
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,820
<i>[Promise I'll fix it. Call me.]</i>

89
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,319
Isak! Hey, he's awake.
With morning wood straight up.

90
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,820
Look! Devil's cave is what I call it.

91
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,360
Want to say hi?
Hi, good morning!

92
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,860
Did you sleep well?

93
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Say hi.

94
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,079
- Hi.
- Say hi then!

95
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,180
Hi!

96
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
He's a bit crabby and tired.

97
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,000
- Hi Isak!
- Hi. Hi, Noora.

98
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,200
- Piss off, Eskild!
- Relax!

99
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,000
- What are you guys doing today?
- Relax, I think.

100
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,720
Yeah. Relax.
So nice.

101
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,900
I'm going to sell my Warhammer collection
on the flea market. No, I'm kidding.

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,680
I'm going to the supermarket
to buy fish cakes. Kidding.

103
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm going to fill up a big can with
Fun Light and watch a movie. With Linn.

104
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,879
- Ah, so nice.
- Yeah.

105
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,180
We'll snuggle up together.

106
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,760
What are you going to do?

107
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't know. I'll just find something.

108
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,959
Something like what?

109
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,940
William's working, so I just have to...
I don't have that many friends yet.

110
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,260
What I think, Noora...
You are in London. Best city in the world.

111
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I know! I'm having a lot fun!

112
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll have lots of fun today.
Or I'll go to a museum.

113
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,580
- You're going to a museum?
- Yeah!

114
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:20,660
Don't go to a museum, Noora. Do something fun! Don't
go to a museum and be boring. Do something fun.

115
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,900
- Go to a club. Get some drinks.
- Yeah, relax.

116
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,800
- I'm having lots of fun.
- Yeah...

117
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,940
- I want you to be doing well, Noora.
- Yeah, really well!

118
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,880
So what's it like living with Isak?
Is it all right?

119
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,200
- He doesn't pay rent, you know?
- I will pay.

120
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,940
And he smells like farts. Guy farts.

121
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,100
While you smell good.
You smell like delicious lavender.

122
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,620
Love you.

123
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,959
I hooked up with a girl of who I
legitimately thought had a cat tongue.

124
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,219
I'm not sure if it was a
tongue, or a fake tongue.

125
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,040
Fake tongue?!

126
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,920
- Like making out with a cat.
- Have you kissed a cat?

127
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,180
- No, but it was really small and thin.
- Cat size?

128
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,839
I didn't see her tongue, but...

129
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,500
You know that party at Johanna's?

130
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,380
I hooked up with a chick there.

131
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,579
- The blonde one?
- Yeah, the blonde one.

132
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,340
She didn't have a clitoris.

133
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,220
- What?!
- Yeah, I swear. She didn't have it.

134
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,140
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

135
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,240
<i>[Dad: Hi Isak. Do you want to have dinner
with me on Wednesday night? Hug from dad/]</i>

136
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,439
I saw it! I know where the clitoris is.
And I saw it when I went down on her.

137
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,880
<i>[I need money for my rent. 4000 Kroner]</i>

138
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,359
Are you joking?
<i>[I need money for my rent. 4000 Kroner]</i>

139
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,480
<i>[I need money for my rent. 4000 Kroner]</i>

140
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,399
- No...
- You went down on her?

141
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
- Yeah.
- You go down on chicks?

142
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,160
Why are you so surprised? You don't?

143
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,620
- Eh, no!
- Why not?

144
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,560
I don't know. Should we go down on chicks?

145
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,560
Why the fuck...

146
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,260
- Because they love it. Why do you ask?
- Do you also go down on chicks?

147
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,280
Isak?

148
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Hi!

149
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,300
Do you guys perhaps want to
join the theatre this year?

150
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,140
Don't really know.

151
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,859
We are group leaders of the “kose” group.
<i>(kose = a good vibe/feeling/atmosphere)</i>

152
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,600
We want to have you guys!

153
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,479
<i>Kose</i> group? What does a <i>kose</i> group do?

154
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,679
We make sure there's a good atmosphere.

155
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,960
We spread love, bake bread, we cook.

156
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,540
We have a group meeting next Friday.
Maybe you guys want to come?

157
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,940
Friday...?

158
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,940
No. I don't really know.
It's Friday, you know.

159
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,480
But you're second years.
You're neither third years nor first years.

160
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,700
You guys should make yourselves known socially
to avoid becoming completely anonymous.

161
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,780
Do you guys want that?
To walk around being a nobody?

162
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Eva!

163
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,039
Did you see my messages?
I forgot my sweater at your place.

164
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,920
Yeah, I saw. I'll look for it.

165
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,860
No, but I have to come get it at your
place because I know what it looks like.

166
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,660
Can't you just describe it?

167
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,240
Yes. I can.

168
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,360
It's black…

169
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,500
Okay... A black sweater. Got it.

170
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,180
Let us know if you want to join!

171
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,300
Yeah, we'll do that.

172
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Bye.

173
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,080
A sweater?!

174
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
What's up?

175
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,700
- I had to hide the shit at Eva's place.
- Are you kidding?

176
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,659
- I'll fix it.
- That's 1000 Kroner.

177
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Mahdi, I'll fix it.

178
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Was it not good?

179
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,300
Ask first. Cat guy.

180
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

181
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,280
- I have your drugs.
- What?

182
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,880
The stuff you left at Eva's place.

183
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,180
I have it.

184
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,240
You have it?

185
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,560
If there's one thing I don't like,
it's when someone fucks over their friends.

186
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,660
What do you mean?

187
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,880
Eva could've been in a
lot of trouble if they had found it.

188
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,900
Could have... but they didn't find it.

189
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,620
They didn't find it because I took it.

190
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,380
Okay, I'm sorry for leaving it there. Thanks
for taking it, but it's not even mine.

191
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,980
I should get something in
return for rescuing it from the police.

192
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,560
Do you think this is a fucking
Narcos episode or something?

193
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,680
Can't you just give it to me?

194
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,160
I want 10% of your drugs.

195
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,900
Do you use then?

196
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,120
No, but it's great to have.

197
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,620
I also want you and your
friends to join the <i>kose </i>group.

198
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,700
<i>Kose</i> group. That's the best
theatre group of them all!

199
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Okay.

200
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,520
Whatever. We can join the <i>kose</i> group.

201
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,019
- So then you'll give it to me?
- Yes.

202
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,620
So just give it to me now.

203
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,440
Do you think I'm dumb? You get it when I see
you and your friends at the group meeting.

204
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,539
Sana and Isak can work together.

205
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,120
Huh?! No, I'm not sitting here.

206
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,900
Can't you work with Isak? It'll be fine.

207
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,040
Guys and girls can work together.

208
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,020
We do that in Norway.

209
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,940
Hi! Welcome!

210
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,879
<i>[Where the fuck are you guys? I can't be
bothered to sit here by myself, it's your shit.]</i>

211
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:44,958
Chris! <i>[Where the fuck are you guys? I can't be
bothered to sit here by myself, it's your shit.]</i>

212
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
Chris!

213
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,140
Can Kasper join the meeting?

214
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,340
Kasper doesn't go to this school though.

215
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,680
Yes. That'll be fine.
Right Vilde?

216
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,060
It's quite unhealthy that
they're together every single second.

217
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,640
- Hello.
- Hi!

218
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,560
So nice that you wanted to come.

219
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,780
Yeah just find a seat,
then we can start.

220
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,040
Some bread? I baked it myself.

221
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,240
Cool. Looking forward to it.

222
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:44,000
<i>[Sorry man, I have to help my mom with
something. I'll come as soon as I'm done.]</i>

223
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,040
<i>[Fuck was that today]</i>

224
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,239
- Hello.
- Hello.

225
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,260
<i>- Kose</i> group, yay!
- Yay...

226
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,360
We looked at the group list during break.
Where are the awesome people of this school?

227
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,320
<i>Kose</i> group, of course.

228
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,580
Cool.

229
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,680
Hi and welcome.

230
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,699
We are overjoyed that you
guys are here today.

231
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,240
You guys can introduce yourselves.
This here is...

232
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,620
- Eva.
- Sana.

233
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,720
- Vilde!
- Vilde.

234
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,780
So I thought I'd explain
what kind of vision we have.

235
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:38,880
We have our group meeting 3 weeks before the others
because we are an important aspect of the theatre.

236
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,620
More than, for example, PR or costumes.

237
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,140
We thought it's best to have a good system
throughout the entire theatre event.

238
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,920
That's why we'll divide you into groups.

239
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,720
Or duos, so that you'll be in pairs.

240
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,080
Then it's not a group, but a duo.

241
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,020
You guys will divide the days between
yourselves. That's what we'll be doing.

242
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,620
So that... I'm a bit nervous!

243
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:20,160
So that you will pair up and
someone will cook every day.

244
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,460
It's really important in the <i>kose</i> group that
you spread a lot of good vibes, and love.

245
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,860
Spreading love is not something
that comes naturally to everyone.

246
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,780
So I thought we could all do a love
exercise. If everyone can get up...

247
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,700
If everyone can stand in a circle here,
then we'll grab each other's hands.

248
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,400
Do you also need tissues?

249
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,800
Come outside.

250
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,200
You know the group leader?

251
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,640
Vilde?

252
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,040
- With the love game?
- What was that?

253
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,780
I had to bail. I can't be bothered
with that stuff. What happened?

254
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,920
She got us to go and feel eachother in a dark room.
If you walked into a dick, you had to suck it.

255
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,820
- No?
- No!

256
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,080
- What class are you in?
- 3STB

257
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,880
You didn't go here before?

258
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,560
No, Elvebakken.

259
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,319
You transferred in your final year?

260
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Hey you.

261
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,460
- Hey.
- Hi.

262
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,460
We're setting up the cooking system.
We should be in pairs.

263
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't know that many people. Well I
know Maria, but she's going with Lea.

264
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,800
So that's why I was wondering
if you want to be in a group with me.

265
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,260
I thought we were in a group together.

266
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,360
Yeah, I had in a way already
agreed to be in a group with...

267
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,200
- With...
- Even.

268
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,620
Emma.

269
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,760
I'm sure we can be in a group of three.

270
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,400
I think she said we should
be in pairs, but I don't care.

271
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,860
It seemed like Vilde was
really clear on wanting pairs.

272
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,220
Can't you just ask?

273
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,400
Yeah, okay. Then we'll do that.

274
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,760
Yes, we'll do that.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

275
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,340
Can I have a drag?

276
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
Thanks.
