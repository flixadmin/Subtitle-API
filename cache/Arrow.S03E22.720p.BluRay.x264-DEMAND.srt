1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,083
My name was Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,442
For three years I worked to save my city...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,049
...but to save my sister,
I had to become someone else.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,730
I had to become something else.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,605
Previously on Arrow:

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,243
Roy's alive. We faked his death.
He's starting a new life.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,447
- John.
- Oliver?

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,527
Bring Nyssa to the warehouse at Fullerton
and Halsted and I'll let your wife go.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,445
- There's no way of getting him back.
- He's gone, Felicity.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,649
There's only one thing left of him now. Us.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,284
- Do you recognize this?
- The Alpha and Omega bio-weapon.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,410
You'll unleash this on Starling City.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,961
His fever is getting worse.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,928
Maseo? A pharmacy.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,088
The Romans called it vastatio.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,165
The systemic destruction of a land
to ensure its subjugation.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,685
And what they found was that immolation
left a blank slate to build anew.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,763
Until you have destroyed your home
and severed all ties from your old life...

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,082
...can you begin anew?

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,121
I did not foresee the day that
Maseo Yamashiro appeared at my door.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,529
You had the courage to demand
an audience of me.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,288
And those who do usually offer money
and treasure in exchange for my favor.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,682
But you gave me the Alpha and Omega.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,048
The plane is en route. It will be ready
tomorrow, as you've commanded.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,250
You will marry my daughter
and you will ascend to Ra's al Ghul...

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,849
...and then you will fly to Starling City
carrying death itself.

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,090
I hate when they run.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,006
Well, at least you're getting
your cardio workout in.

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,562
I still have 40 minutes on an elliptical
in my immediate future.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,967
You supposed to be undercover
or something?

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,604
I sniffed you three blocks back.

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,082
And you led me right to your gang.

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,083
- Smart plan.
- Thanks.

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,322
No, I meant smart plan...

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,605
...because it was mine.

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,086
John, I think he gives up. John. John!

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,483
Thanks for coming in through the back.

38
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,849
With Sara and Lyla gone, the last
thing I need are neighbors talking.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,810
About some strange woman
dressed in all-black leather. Yeah.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,322
You're out of ice. How
can you be out of ice?

41
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,641
- Here.
- Thanks.

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,161
Okay, so the night's young and there's
a meth dealer working a corner on Fulton.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,163
- Sounds good.
- Actually, it doesn't.

44
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,366
You were completely unhinged
out there tonight, Dig.

45
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,650
- You're in denial about how angry you are.
- No, Felicity, I'm not in denial.

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,086
But I am angry.

47
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,526
Oliver.

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,287
He was my best friend...

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,969
...and he kidnapped...

50
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,129
...my wife.

51
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,527
You think that justifies
hospitalizing people?

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,203
No, Felicity. It doesn't. You're right.
It won't happen again.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,203
I'm not saying that life doesn't suck...

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,011
...but you can't take it out
on every criminal you see.

55
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,209
How can you, out of all people,
be so sanguine after what happened?

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,567
- I know that wasn't Oliver.
- Who's in denial?

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,521
It wasn't. Our Oliver, my Oliver,
died the day he joined the League.

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,530
- This is someone else.
- You truly believe that?

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,881
I have to.

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,327
Don't try to talk me out of going.

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,608
Mr. Harper went through a lot of trouble
to fake his death.

62
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,565
- You know he can never come back here.
- Yeah, well, maybe I'm just going to go there.

63
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,882
- Permanently?
- Look, I don't know.

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,405
Honestly, I don't know anything anymore.
I barely know who I am.

65
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,767
Thea, it's understandable.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,720
You've been through something
very few people have ever experienced.

67
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,851
- Of course you feel...
- Is that what you think this is all about?

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,243
Almost dying?
Because I'd rather have died...

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,085
...than have my brother
sacrifice his life for mine.

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,444
And don't think for a second
that I forgot the whole reason...

71
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,605
...Ra's al Ghul was brought into our lives
is because of you.

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,442
You're no longer in danger from the League.

73
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,289
Maybe getting away from Starling City
for a while is what's best for you.

74
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,607
You approve? Is that supposed to worry me?
Because it actually kind of does.

75
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,247
But look, the only thing I know right now
is that I need to go be with Roy.

76
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,847
My daughter.

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,281
I am not hungry.

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,967
Yes. Many a bride has skipped
a meal or two before their wedding day.

79
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,407
I would rather die than wed this pretender.

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,486
You speak as though they are the only
two options before you, my daughter.

81
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,122
Daughter? And to think
I once wore that title with pride.

82
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,928
Perhaps "mother" will suit you better.

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,522
After your betrothal to Al Sah-him...

84
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,001
...you will extend my lineage
by having a child.

85
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,721
- If you think I will bear his child...
- Yes! I do.

86
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,290
And you will have no more say in it
than your mother was given.

87
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,802
You're quiet.

88
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,770
I'm prepared for my ascension to Ra's.

89
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,009
I'm still coming to grips with marriage.

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,367
Perhaps a walk to clear my head.

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,522
I'll send a guard to accompany you.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,208
If I can't protect myself,
I don't deserve to inherit your mantle.

93
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,410
You're late.

94
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,330
Sorry. Nanda Parbat's not exactly
the easiest place to infiltrate.

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,209
Don't joke.

96
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,362
Things are worse than we thought.

97
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,881
Tomorrow?

98
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,725
Ra's plans to transport the virus
to Starling on a plane.

99
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,929
That's oddly modern for the League.
Do you think Ra's suspects you?

100
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,368
- He has no reason to.
- I warned you it would be difficult.

101
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,170
I just thought that I'd... Ahem.

102
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,049
We'd have more time.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,685
When you explained to me
that my ascension to Ra's...

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,404
...would include the destruction of Starling...
I anticipated you wouldn't be Ra's for months.

105
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,767
More than enough time
to dismantle the League.

106
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,844
Malcolm, we need help.

107
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,722
From all accounts, you were too good
at convincing your friends...

108
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,841
...that you'd allied yourself with Ra's and I
don't think I carry much credibility with them.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,923
I know someone who they'll trust.

110
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,170
You've been gone a while.
There was concern.

111
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,687
I've just been here thinking.

112
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,044
- We need to find ibuprofen.
- You know that can't help him now.

113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,441
Why isn't the inoculant working on him?

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,649
He's young. His immune system
probably isn't strong enough.

115
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,931
Akio, swallow.

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,128
General Shrieve.

117
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,730
Maseo. I want to kill Shrieve too,
but you need to focus on helping Akio.

118
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,963
Shrieve's men made a vaccine.
Maybe they also made a cure.

119
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,647
- No, Maseo, they didn't make...
- I know it's unlikely, but I have to try.

120
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,009
Okay. I'll help you.

121
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,201
Hi, I'm looking for Jason?

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,170
Oh, yeah? Well, lucky him.

123
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,891
Yo, Jason. You got a visitor.

124
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,121
Jason?

125
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,807
That's right.

126
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,329
I have a '67 Mustang
that needs a little work on it.

127
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,161
- Somebody said you were the guy to see.
- You came to the right place.

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,726
I can't believe you're still alive.

129
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,724
I wanted to tell you.
But if you knew, you'd tell Oliver.

130
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,770
- And then Oliver would've...
- Would've broken you out of prison.

131
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,845
And probably kicked your ass.
And I would have helped him.

132
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,725
I had to do it. For Oliver.

133
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,651
You think maybe there's some other place
we could go talk?

134
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,890
There's my place.

135
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,404
That's such a good answer.

136
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,447
- Hey.
- You got it to fly. What more do you want?

137
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,290
True art is never finished, it's only abandoned.
Plus, I had this little idea I just couldn't kick.

138
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,570
Are you okay? You have this little cloud
that keeps following you around.

139
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,611
Yeah. Something happened
while you were away.

140
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,565
I'm just handling it.

141
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,807
Is it, uh, Oliver-related? It's Oliver-related.
If you want to talk about it...

142
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,009
Maybe we shouldn't cross that line.
It's a long story anyway.

143
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,610
Well, if you change your mind, I have time.
And, hey, you're my friend.

144
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,526
I'm always going to be there for you.
It's non-negotiable.

145
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,205
Thanks, Ray.

146
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,647
So while I'm waiting
to do something for you...

147
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,043
...there's a little something
that you can do for me.

148
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,331
Sign here and here.

149
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,130
Okay.

150
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,725
- What's this for?
- Just a little corporate stuff, Ms. Vice President.

151
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,291
Mm-hm.

152
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,845
Everything okay?

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,090
Probably not.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,401
- You've been quiet.
- I have a lot on my mind.

155
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,605
I meant about the virus. The Alpha Omega.

156
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,771
When did you take it?

157
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,163
From the truck, before we blew it up.

158
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,369
So before...

159
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,686
Even before Akio died, I wanted revenge
on Shrieve for the pain he caused.

160
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,003
But instead, you used it
to trade your way into the League.

161
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,242
I am not strong.

162
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,047
Not enough for myself
and certainty not enough for Tatsu.

163
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,886
- If you could go back to her, would you?
- It is immaterial.

164
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,767
- Maseo Yamashiro is no more.
- He doesn't have to be.

165
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,163
When I'm Ra's,
I can release you from your oath.

166
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,564
I can set you free.

167
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,042
The League is not my prison.

168
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,762
From my prison...

169
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,364
...there is no escape.

170
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,243
So now Malcolm Merlyn can summon us.

171
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,688
I really don't like the idea
that he can summon us.

172
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,251
Any idea what this is about?

173
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,085
No, but Merlyn assures me
he'll be waving the white flag.

174
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,567
- I'm sorry, I forgot the flag.
- That's too bad.

175
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,764
I would have told you
where you could put it.

176
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,720
- What is this about, Malcolm?
- This won't be easy for all of you to believe...

177
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,405
You're a sociopath and a liar.

178
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,042
Be that as it may, this will be
much quicker for all of us...

179
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,567
...if we could fast-forward
through the cynicism...

180
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,768
...and realize that I am telling the truth.

181
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,127
- About what?
- Oliver.

182
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,887
His allegiance with the
League is a charade.

183
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,963
Why would you even play
with our emotions?

184
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,489
This plan was born the moment Oliver realized
that he had to capitulate to Ra's to save Thea.

185
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,122
And instead of sharing this plan with us,
he trusted you.

186
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,767
The man who had my sister murdered.

187
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,247
I am better practiced in
the art of deception...

188
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,971
...and, no offense,
none of you are good actors.

189
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,451
I'm out.

190
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,843
You've seen for yourselves how dangerous
Ra's and the League are.

191
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,688
- The circle of trust had to be small as possible.
- Until now? What changed?

192
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,764
Forget it. There's nothing he could say
that we could believe.

193
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,211
Mr. Diggle's right. Which is why
I brought along a friend of Oliver's.

194
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,403
My name is Tatsu Yamashiro.

195
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,611
And your city is in great danger.

196
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,130
You expect us to believe her?
We never even met her.

197
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,850
- We never met her, right?
- No.

198
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,049
Apart from my brief time helping Oliver
recover from the wounds...

199
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,003
...Ra's al Ghul inflicted on him,
my life has been one of isolation.

200
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,529
Okay, Merlyn. This is your big plan?
A woman we've never met or even heard of?

201
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,489
Oliver doesn't speak about the past.

202
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,802
He's not forthcoming
about the present, either.

203
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,726
My son was killed by the virus
Ra's intends to use on your city.

204
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,411
- You're Akio's mother.
- Oliver was with me when it happened.

205
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,083
He knows that the danger
you all face is very real.

206
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,847
Okay, how many times are we gonna believe
him after everything that he's done?

207
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,524
I am not privy to your history with
Malcolm. This request comes from Oliver.

208
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,722
- We're not sure that's any better at the moment.
- Look, I am not playing a game here.

209
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,044
My daughter lives in this city, remember?
This is everything I have on the bio-weapon.

210
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,567
I've arranged for all of us
to go to Nanda Parbat.

211
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,726
If you're coming,
be at Ferris Air before sunrise.

212
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,211
Come.

213
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,249
- Charming.
- It's a sublet. I won't be here for much longer.

214
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,121
- What about the auto shop?
- It's temporary.

215
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,248
Sure, they don't ask a lot of questions...

216
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,290
...but it's inevitable someone
puts two and two together.

217
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,528
How about your other night job?

218
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,242
I figure I'd just leave the crime-fighting to
the cops. I kind of just want to be normal.

219
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,089
- Yeah, and how's that going for you?
- I am so bored.

220
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,089
- Ha, ha.
- Heh. Yeah, well, that's why I brought you this.

221
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,607
Malcolm stole it out of impound. Don't worry,
I made him promise nobody would get killed.

222
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,649
I never thought I'd see this thing again.

223
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,441
I figured since everybody thinks
that Roy Harper's the Arrow...

224
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,604
...they don't have to know
that he's Arsenal too, right?

225
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,609
So that's why you came here?
Just to give me this?

226
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,762
Well, yes.

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,487
This, and...

228
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,209
How could we not know about this?

229
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,931
Not know about a terrorist attack
in Hong Kong?

230
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,329
Beijing had us believing these deaths
were caused by a chemical spill.

231
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,041
- You don't really believe Merlyn.
- Looking at this, we can't afford not to.

232
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,841
He is a murderer who has lied so many
times, it should be a drinking game.

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,002
And I've never even heard of this Tatsu.

234
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,482
Felicity, I don't know if you're right
that Oliver's gone forever or not.

235
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,728
The truth is, for me it doesn't matter.

236
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,010
If there's even a possibility of this kind of
danger in my city, I'm reporting for duty.

237
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,807
- Me too.
- I don't believe them.

238
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,369
And even if I did, I can't go back there.

239
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,726
Not after what they did to Oliver.

240
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,003
- Relax, my child.
- Another order I cannot follow.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,568
You speak to me as though I'm a monster.
I am your father, Nyssa.

242
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,371
Then why do you ask me to marry someone
I do not love?

243
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,209
When I was in Odessa, tending to some
affairs, I crossed paths with a woman.

244
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,370
She was breathtaking
in both visage and fortitude.

245
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,720
Her name was Ameena Raatko.

246
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,769
I had taken other lovers before...

247
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,684
...but she was different.

248
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,404
She had a wit and a fire about her that I
found myself I could not live without.

249
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,441
So she became my concubine
and the mother of my child.

250
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,243
This was my gift to her in honor of you,
the gift that she gave me.

251
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,088
And so I kept it in the hopes that one day
you would wear it on your wedding day.

252
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,248
You expect me to marry Al Sah-him
because of some trinket?

253
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,044
I expect you to marry Al Sah-him
because it is my will.

254
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,331
You defy that and I will see you
suffer the pain of a thousand deaths.

255
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,684
I am sorry to intrude.
Mr. Merlyn said that I would find you here.

256
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,966
That might be the only thing
he's ever said that isn't a lie.

257
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,122
I did not come here to convince you
of the threat to your home.

258
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,810
There is nothing I can say that you will
believe, more than what you have seen.

259
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,647
Then why are you here?

260
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,651
To speak with you about Oliver.

261
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,484
During his recuperation,
Oliver spoke of you.

262
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,330
Of how his last thought
before the fall was of you.

263
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,051
You love him, still.

264
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,007
- Oliver belongs to Ra's now.
- If you believe that, you must fight for him.

265
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,766
There is no him left.

266
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,121
I thought as you do once.

267
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,322
My husband, Maseo,
was consumed by the League's darkness.

268
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,330
I was so convinced that he was lost to me
that I didn't even try to reach him.

269
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,210
Don't make my mistake, Felicity.

270
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,009
Are you sure Shrieve will be here?

271
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,640
Know of any other rogue
U.S. Army bases in the area?

272
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,646
Shrieve will have reinforced this station
since the last time we were here.

273
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,042
Two there. Waller took you from Lian Yu
because she saw something in you.

274
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,007
My son needs that from you.
The killer inside.

275
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,285
Sir, this is a restricted area.

276
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,682
- Is that a Masamune blade?
- A katana.

277
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,089
Passed down for centuries within my family.

278
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,131
- The first son of each generation.
- You are not a son, Tatsu.

279
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,609
No, I am not.

280
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,966
Let's get this over with.

281
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,761
The plane's ready. It should be big enough
for all of us. Including her.

282
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,884
- Thought you weren't coming.
- I changed my mind.

283
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,249
If you betray us, I'll make sure
the whole world knows you are alive.

284
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,408
And where they can find you.

285
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,330
So this is Nanda Parbat.

286
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,324
Next time we should really look
into getting some horses.

287
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,404
- You think they rent horses here?
- There won't be a next time.

288
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,489
There it is. The plane Ra's intends to use
to spread the Alpha Omega over Starling.

289
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,286
I need to be within 5O yards
to breach the plane's...

290
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,642
...navigation software
to be able to ground it.

291
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,326
- Quiet.
- I don't see anything.

292
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,490
There'll be more.

293
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,528
Get to the plane. We'll cover you. Go!

294
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,966
Close enough.

295
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,240
Surrender now and you might live.

296
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,880
- Maseo.
- Maseo is a memory.

297
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,729
Our child was gone and you left me
when I needed you most.

298
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,089
But you can still come back to me.
It's not too late.

299
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,086
Yes, it is.

300
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,881
- I wouldn't have done the same thing for you.
- I know.

301
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,642
Your husband is long dead.
If Sarab must die as well, then so be it.

302
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,405
Frak. More frak.

303
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,409
Oh, that makes more sense.

304
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,610
- Can you bring it down from the sky?
- They destroyed my gear.

305
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,604
- I had some insurance come along.
- What kind of insurance?

306
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,366
The atomic kind.

307
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,965
Ray!

308
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,165
Get down!

309
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,644
Ray-

310
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,641
You should see the other guy.

311
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,168
Tell Akio I love him.

312
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,522
You tell him for both of us.

313
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,843
Thank you...

314
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,206
...for releasing me...

315
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,766
...from my prison.

316
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,290
Enough!

317
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,248
You have failed.

318
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,722
Any further attempt to undermine
our cause would be futile.

319
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,928
Uh, you see that burning plane there?

320
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,606
We destroyed
your city-threatening bio-weapon.

321
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,125
No.

322
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,925
You merely think you did.

323
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,811
Surrender...

324
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,004
...or die.

325
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,769
Hey, Oliver. Oliver, what's going on?

326
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,440
If any of you speak, we're all gonna die.

327
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,728
- What?
- I need you to trust me.

328
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,286
Stir the grass and you startle the snake.

329
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,049
My ruse with the plane was meant to reveal
any traitors among me.

330
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,762
How did you know of the virus?

331
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,328
Of the plane?

332
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,763
Maseo told me. And I told them.

333
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,161
So a dead man told you?

334
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,770
How convenient.

335
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,844
He said only three men knew about
your plan. You, him, and Oliver.

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,368
Oliver Queen is dead. I am Al Sah-him.

337
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,569
This would not be the first time
that Sarab has betrayed me...

338
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,688
...to Maseo Yamashiro's weaknesses.

339
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,641
And though your timing was a function of
my gambit, it was nevertheless fortuitous.

340
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,089
You see, by tradition, the Ra's would
contemplate mercy upon his enemies...

341
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,722
...on the eve of a wedding.

342
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,482
You are getting married? I guess there
really is a kettle for every pot.

343
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,525
The wedding is mine.

344
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,969
I am betrothed to Nyssa al Ghul.

345
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,885
Take them below.

346
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,291
- So can you tell me now?
- Tell you what?

347
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,206
- What you're really doing here.
- Seeing you is not good enough?

348
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,566
What's going on?

349
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,688
Something happened.

350
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,969
I was hurt.

351
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,081
And to save me...

352
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,610
...Ollie had to accept Ra's' offer
to join the League.

353
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,650
Oh, my God. Thea...

354
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,564
I tried to stop him.

355
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,602
I couldn't,
and now he's become someone else.

356
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,323
Everything just is a lot easier
when I'm with you.

357
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,289
I understand that.

358
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,487
But?

359
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,645
When bad things happen,
your go-to move is to bolt.

360
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,011
To get out of Starling. I don't think
this is something you can run away from.

361
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,606
I'm not running away.

362
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,645
I'm running to you.

363
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,329
You don't want me to?

364
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,007
The only thing that I want
is what's best for you.

365
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,127
You always have.

366
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,001
Come here.

367
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,321
I can't believe he's gonna marry her.

368
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,643
You should worry more about
getting out of here alive.

369
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,209
Is that even a remote possibility?

370
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,322
- Didn't think so.
- We aren't gonna die here.

371
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,290
- Oliver would never let that happen.
- He let this happen.

372
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,448
Wah-reeth al Ghul commands your presence.

373
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,684
Leave us.

374
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,009
- Is everyone okay?
- Like you give a damn.

375
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,889
- Didn't Malcolm speak to you?
- He did.

376
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,930
You plan to leave my daughter alone
when you kidnapped my wife?

377
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,526
I had to do something
to prove my loyalty to Ra's.

378
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,406
So taking Lyla, that was your idea, Oliver?
In front of our daughter?

379
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,331
Yes. You met Tatsu.

380
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,242
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Tatsu told me that in order to beat Ra's...

381
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,526
...I would have to sacrifice all of the
things in my life that I hold most precious.

382
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,004
- And your friendship was on that list.
- Oliver, you didn't just lose my friendship.

383
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,410
You lost my trust. You lost my respect.

384
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,607
What?

385
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,371
Ra's demands that we return
this man to his friends.

386
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,402
I repeat, two assailants... Aah!

387
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,850
Johansson's down.

388
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,331
I have visuals.

389
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,289
- Give us the cure.
- You boys make quite the entrance.

390
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,482
The cure. Now.

391
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,646
The Chinese own enough of our national debt
to decimate our economy...

392
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,404
...all without firing a shot.

393
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,970
Or they could destroy us
with the largest army in human history.

394
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,326
Enough!

395
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,962
- My son needs your cure.
- What makes you think...?

396
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,570
The next one goes in your head.

397
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,482
You see that safe over there?
The passcode is 4-5-8-7.

398
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,966
You'll have to deliver the cure subcutaneously,
in the exact ratio I give you.

399
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,361
- You may want to write this down.
- You don't need to tell us.

400
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,325
You're coming with us.

401
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,480
This is so beautiful...

402
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,766
...and yet so dangerous.

403
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,206
Much like its former owner.

404
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,846
Sarab's former love.

405
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,325
Who is now my prisoner,
along with Al Sah-him's former friends.

406
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,802
You see, their treachery was anticipated.

407
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,169
Yours, however, Al Sa-her,
is disappointing...

408
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,484
...because I expected more loyalty
from a man whose daughter I saved.

409
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,362
The last time I appeared before you
in chains, I offered my fealty.

410
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,841
And I am here to offer it again.

411
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,001
You had nothing to offer then
and you have nothing to offer now.

412
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,647
I have the name of the person
who betrayed you to Al Sah-him's friends.

413
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,442
It wasn't Maseo Yamashiro,
it was Oliver Queen.

414
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,729
Heh. He's been lying to you all along.

415
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,882
- What's this?
- I'm sorry, Oliver.

416
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,725
- My name is Al Sah-him.
- Not according to Mr. Merlyn here.

417
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,930
You see, he claims that you've been
deceiving me the entire time.

418
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,401
I have killed for you.
I have severed all ties to my past.

419
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,689
I have hurt people
who were friends to Oliver Queen.

420
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,049
And if you hadn't stopped me,
I would have murdered your daughter.

421
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,562
What if this is all just part
of your own elaborate ruse?

422
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,202
Then I will have nothing
and no one to go home to.

423
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,928
Oliver Queen is dead and the Arrow is gone.

424
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,246
We shall see.

425
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,243
Roy?

426
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,362
- Excuse me, I'm looking for...
- Jason's friend. Yeah, I remember.

427
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,522
He said you'd probably be stopping by.

428
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,968
- Oh. Can I talk to him?
- I don't know where he is.

429
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,846
He came in an hour ago to quit.
He, uh, said to give you this.

430
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,090
"Dear Thea,
I wasn't supposed to make it this far.

431
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,050
I was supposed to end up in jail
or dead by now.

432
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,842
But then I met you, and you made me
want to be the man I saw through your eyes.

433
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,367
And now all I want to
do is give that back...

434
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,211
...help you be the person
you can be without Oliver...

435
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,170
...without your father and without me.

436
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,762
Living on the run from the police
isn't the life you deserve, Thea.

437
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,844
It's not what Oliver gave up his life
for you to have.

438
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,971
Whatever happens with me,
I will always love you.

439
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,762
PS, thanks for the suit, but I always
thought red was more your color anyway."

440
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,327
What did Oliver say to you?

441
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,525
Nothing worth hearing.

442
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,763
You were right about Oliver.
I should have listened to you.

443
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,809
- I told you about Oliver. You were supposed to...
- I was supposed to do what, Mr. Merlyn?

444
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,328
Grant you mercy? I am.

445
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,041
Because this death will be a lot shorter
than the one I had planned for you.

446
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,883
Oliver, if what Malcolm said is true, if
you're going to do anything, now is the time.

447
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,522
Al Sah-him has said that
the swordswoman is inoculated...

448
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,644
...so you can take her to another chamber.

449
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,441
No. Oliver. Oliver, we believed in you.

450
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,570
Seal the room.

451
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,803
Oliver, listen to me. Oliver!

452
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,167
- For the love of God.
- No, Oliver.

453
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,690
- What the hell are you doing?
- You've got to get us out of here.

454
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,730
We trusted you. You asked us to trust you
and we trusted you.

455
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,723
- Don't do this. Oliver!
- Oliver!

456
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,882
Oliver, don't do this!

457
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,845
Tatsu.

458
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,170
There's a cure
and he knows how to administer it.

459
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,689
A little help.

460
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,129
He's not breathing.
The cure, he needs it now!

461
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,526
Akio, please wake up.

462
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,207
Please wake up.

463
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,129
He was dead the moment he was exposed.

464
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,851
- But you said...
- There is no cure.

465
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,408
- Then what the hell is that?
- Insulin.

466
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm diabetic.

467
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,526
Ah.

468
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,440
I want to thank you for bringing me here.

469
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,849
It would have taken us weeks
to track you all down.

470
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,482
And I do so hate loose ends.

471
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,010
You are Wah-reeth al Ghul,
heir to the Demon.

472
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,202
Before the night is over,
you will be lbn al Ghul, son of the Demon.

473
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,328
There is no vow more sacred,
nor covenant more holy...

474
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,687
...than the one between man and woman.

475
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,690
With this ceremony, your souls
are bound together. Forever joined.

476
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,283
You will never be free. You will always be
held captive by your love for each other.

477
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,087
- Continue.
- I'm sorry, Felicity. For everything.

478
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,564
You don't have to be sorry
for anything, John.

479
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,085
And for this shared life...

480
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,850
I'm glad to have known you.

481
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,490
...we offer blessings.

482
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,369
Bara-ka t.

483
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,770
The union is sealed.
