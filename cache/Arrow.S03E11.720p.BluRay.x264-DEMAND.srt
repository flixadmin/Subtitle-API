1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,448
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,489
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,483
...I've come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,404
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,289
Now others have joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,761
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,163
To the rest of Starling City,
I'm someone else.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,449
I am something else.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,284
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,286
If you wanna go out there, I can't stop
you. But I don't have to help you.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,562
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the justice you can't run from. Aah!

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,969
Danny Brickwell. Street name's Brick.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,128
You are all part of my crew now.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,490
Together, we are gonna
take over the Glades.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,366
Oliver.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,966
I asked her to come here...

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,602
...so she could bring you back to life.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,890
This is a duel, Oliver.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,481
With one of the most dangerous men alive.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,881
I wouldn't do it if I
didn't think I could win.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,691
I don't worry that you can beat him.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,202
I am terrified you won't kill him.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,766
That's not who you are anymore.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,402
And I'm afraid that Ra's is gonna use
your humanity against you.

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,681
You're right.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,769
- I'll stay.
- Really?

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,845
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure of one thing.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,164
I love you.

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,369
Oliver.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,086
Drink this.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,128
- More herbs?
- Penicillin.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,681
For the infection.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,409
- You saved my life.
- The snow and cold helped.

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,251
And your will to live. You should be dead.

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,442
Did you know Maseo would bring me here?

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,846
He was the one who told me
to meet you at this cabin.

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,327
I didn't realize
that the two of you were still in contact.

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,925
We are not.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,684
- Maseo.
- You're in no condition to stand.

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,121
Help me.

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,648
I'm glad you stayed.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,371
Then you'll be disappointed.

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,929
When the storm passes,
I'll return to Nanda Parbat.

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,411
Maseo.

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,364
If Ra's finds out that you saved me,
betrayed him...

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,609
...he's gonna kill you.

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,207
Don't waste your breath or worries on me.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,524
Your concern should be for your home,
and what has become of it in your absence.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,086
Help.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,928
You picked the wrong alley.
You see, this one cuts off here at Carlyle.

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,163
You pick the next one,
and you're free and clear to Reimer Avenue.

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,725
Now, you wanna do this the hard way?

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,406
Or the harder way?

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,810
Hey.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,805
Run.

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,011
Heard rumors about a mask
used to protect girls around here.

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,690
Well, I guess you ain't her.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,764
This is Brick's town now.

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,131
I think we should talk.

60
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,169
This is gonna hurt a little.

61
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,560
Just one more.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,083
Sorry. I warned you it was gonna hurt.

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,810
You said a little.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,888
Yeah, well. Dig taught us how to suture.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,283
I guess Felicity got the hang of it
quicker than I did.

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,442
- Where is Felicity?
- Let's talk about you.

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,251
- What do you think you're doing out there?
- Same as you.

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,722
I've had training from Oliver
and years on the streets.

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,120
You have a law degree.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,209
Look. Heh.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,809
I get it. Heh. This?

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,204
This isn't how you deal with grief, Laurel.
This is how you get yourself killed.

73
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,691
Laurel, what the hell?

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,844
- I'm fine.
- You are certifiable...

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,322
...if you wear your sister's mask.
Yeah, you're right.

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,681
But Oliver...

77
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,887
...the Arrow.

78
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,487
He's gone now.

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,045
And like it or not,
the Canary sends the same message.

80
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,408
- They fear her.
- No, Laurel.

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,130
They fear your sister.

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,560
Yeah.

83
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,405
She's not here anymore.

84
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,246
H9)'-

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,489
What are you doing here?
Meeting's not for another three hours.

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,564
I convinced Mayor Castle
it might be a good idea to move it up.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,882
What with a murderer
running amok in the city.

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,489
- Isn't that what the police are for?
- Well, she wanted to speak to city leaders.

89
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,449
And I'll help in whatever way I can.

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,131
And by help,
you mean money and counsel...

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,208
...not a suit powered by dwarf-star alloy
that fires lasers at people?

92
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,727
Well, they aren't lasers.
That'd be ridiculous.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,526
They're compressed hard-light beams.

94
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,445
And they don't actually fire
because I can't get anyone...

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,161
...specifically you,
to help me fix the nanite chip.

96
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,042
I already told you, Ray, I'm not interested
in helping you with your suicide mission.

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,329
And there's nothing you can say or do
that is gonna change my mind.

98
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,204
Are you ready to go?

99
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,603
Hey, what are you doing here?

100
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,842
With Brick running around the Glades...

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,401
...I shouldn't leave my gear
anywhere he'd find it.

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,721
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,531
This neighborhood isn't a safe place
to hang out now.

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,843
Uh, I'm not hanging out,
I'm just doing my job.

105
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,280
Are we cool?

106
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,842
It just seems like you've been avoiding me
ever since we had that moment.

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,371
Moment?

108
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,251
You have a very high opinion
on your kissing skills.

109
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,563
Judging from your response,
you've got a high opinion of them too.

110
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,651
- Unless you need a reminder.
- No, not right now.

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,201
But, um, I'll see you later?

112
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,530
What are you doing here?

113
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,287
Went by your apartment see how packing
is going, only to discover that it's not.

114
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,329
I can't leave.

115
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,244
Not without knowing where Oliver is.

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,483
I thought I made it clear
that leaving was not optional.

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,120
No, actually,
you didn't make anything clear.

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,251
You just ordered me to uproot my life
and didn't even give me a reason why.

119
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,289
All you need to know is we're in danger.

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,250
Every day we remain in Starling,
the danger grows greater.

121
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,290
- Now get in the car, Thea.
- No.

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,761
Not until you tell me the truth.

123
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,248
You're not ready for the truth.

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,609
Then I guess I'm not ready
to leave Starling City.

125
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,401
- Yeah, I know. Yeah. Okay, I'm on it.
- Hi.

126
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,686
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

127
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,764
You're not late. Castle's still hashing
things out with her people.

128
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,009
Um, you heard from your sister?

129
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,083
No. Why?

130
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,481
Well, she's, uh, back in town.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,207
A girl came into the precinct
a few hours ago.

132
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,443
Claimed a blond in a mask
and a black leather jacket saved her life.

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,165
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

134
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,926
- Please take your seats.
- Yes, ma'am.

135
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,523
As you know, over the last week...

136
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,286
...a criminal organization
headed by Danny Brickwell...

137
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,370
...has been on a crime spree
unlike anything since Al Capone.

138
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,887
Why don't you arrest him?

139
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,329
We sent in an ESU team to do just that.
Most of those men are in the hospital now.

140
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,925
Now we don't know where he is.

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,046
Maybe if we had more men,
but that means more money.

142
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,363
Uh, I've got a few bucks. Heh. Sorry.

143
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,081
In fact, Palmer Technologies just made
a large donation to the S.C.P.D.

144
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,164
But it'll take time for that equipment
to do any good.

145
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,322
We need to consider calling in
the National Guard.

146
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,763
I've always wanted to meet the mayor.

147
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,127
Bring her and the aldermen.

148
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,361
And kill the rest.

149
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,400
Laurel.

150
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,646
See? That's why I need a technosuit.

151
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,484
Is Mayor Castle secure?

152
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,766
Yeah.

153
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,763
What about the aldermen?

154
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,209
Brick's got them.

155
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,525
Your penicillin tea taste like penicillin.

156
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,168
We can't let him go back to the league.

157
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,925
It's not our choice.

158
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,162
Maybe we could have
changed Maseo's mind.

159
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,402
But not his.

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,966
Not Sarah's.

161
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,124
"Sarab" is just a name
that Ra's al Ghul calls him.

162
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,251
He's still your husband.

163
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,081
Thank you.

164
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,927
Maseo blames himself for what happened.

165
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,811
It wasn't his fault.

166
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,204
The line between grief and guilt
is a thin one.

167
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,403
Sometimes, death is preferable
to the agony of life.

168
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
Track is in there.

169
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,326
Looks like a VIP area.

170
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,723
Probably where they're holding Tatsu.

171
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,488
- There's a lot of muscle in front of that door.
- This club is a Triad front.

172
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,450
- It will be heavily guarded.
- Will you do anything to get her?

173
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,090
Yes, I would.

174
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,323
I told you it would be heavily guarded.

175
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,926
You're late.

176
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,162
- That's funny.
- I wasn't talking to you.

177
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,210
- I was addressing your partner.
- What?

178
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,441
Did you bring the item?

179
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,965
What is she talking about?

180
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
I wanna see my wife.

181
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,090
I said, I want to see my wife.

182
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,646
Once I know she's alive,
then you can have the Alpha.

183
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm sorry, Oliver.

184
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,005
Maseo.

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,845
What are you doing?

186
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,530
H9)'-

187
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,401
- How's your heart?
- Uh...

188
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,166
Still beating. You okay?

189
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,881
Couldn't help but notice nobody
in a green hood showed up to save the day.

190
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,485
That's because he's gone.

191
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,086
- What do you mean gone?
- It means we're on our own.

192
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,489
That doesn't make any sense.
The Arrow's gone, but Sara's back.

193
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,246
Wait.

194
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,802
- What are you talking about?
- She's been taking out Brick's men solo.

195
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,440
I've been getting reports.
Blond, masked, bo-staff.

196
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,481
You didn't know?

197
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,883
I've sort of been living
under a rock these days.

198
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,683
Ask her to give me a call.

199
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,166
Yeah.

200
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,845
Will do.

201
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,882
Jim Huffman, 34, eight arrests...

202
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,769
...no convictions.

203
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,402
Grand theft auto, B and E, drugs.

204
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,847
You did pretty well flying solo.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,207
What made you decide
to start working for Brick?

206
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,368
I'm not telling you anything.

207
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,602
Sure about that?
I still have another heel.

208
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,250
Kidding.

209
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,362
You don't wanna talk about Brick?
That's fine.

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,363
Then let's talk about something else.

211
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,409
Why would you murder...

212
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,005
...Julio Salazar?

213
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,771
Salazar?

214
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,325
Head of Los Halcones?

215
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,642
I had nothing to do
with him getting popped.

216
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,529
Well, that's not what your file says.

217
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,080
See?

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,720
What kind of game is this?
You just wrote that down.

219
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,245
You making this stuff up.

220
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,244
Actually, I can charge you
with whatever crime that I want.

221
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,927
Of course, then they'd have to keep you
in custody until the trial.

222
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,210
Good news, Bell Reve, it's a lot
more comfortable than Iron Heights.

223
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,286
Bell Reve's where the Los Halcones
are locked up.

224
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,649
They'd think I offed Salazar.
I won't last two seconds in there.

225
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,326
Tell me where I can find Danny,
and you won't have to.

226
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,562
He'll kill me.

227
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,411
- Charges filed by Dinah Laurel Lance...
- Stop. Stop!

228
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,971
I'll tell you where you can find Brick.

229
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,410
If you're looking for Thea...

230
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,641
...she's not here.

231
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,881
I know.

232
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,883
- I came to see you.
- Ha, ha.

233
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,569
Following me, Mr. Harper?

234
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,643
You need to stay away from her.

235
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,282
I don't know why you want her to leave,
but I'm not letting her go with you.

236
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,126
Well, thank you for that.
I was in need of some humor.

237
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,805
I wasn't joking.

238
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,641
You're a poison.

239
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,201
You put her in Ra's al Ghul's gun sights?

240
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,328
You had her kill Sara?

241
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,686
Thea knows nothing about Sara...

242
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,080
...and she never will.

243
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,163
That's where you're wrong.

244
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,330
I know her.

245
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,251
She'll get to the truth,
no matter how well you're hiding it.

246
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,206
And when she does find out you've
been lying, you're gonna lose her forever.

247
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,529
Trust me, I know from experience.

248
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,322
This is a family matter, Mr. Harper.

249
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,761
And you are not family.

250
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,807
- Sit.
- Okay.

251
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,771
Are you okay?

252
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,007
Yeah, I'm fine.

253
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,807
Armed gunman attacking you, that had
to have brought back a few bad memories.

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,561
Yeah, when it started...

255
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,809
...all I could think about
was the night Anna died.

256
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,249
But when that gunman charged us,
all I could think about was...

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,604
...saving you.

258
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,845
You were right.

259
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,328
I've been going about this all wrong.

260
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,406
When I started the A.T.O.M. Project,
it was all about avenging Anna.

261
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,402
But what it has become about
is protecting the people I care for.

262
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,006
- You mean the city?
- No.

263
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,764
I mean you.

264
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,211
You sure you wanna use that?
We have other weapons here.

265
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,647
- It was Sara's.
- Roy.

266
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,404
I thought we're on the same page.

267
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,166
That was before Brick
kidnapped three aldermen.

268
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,125
Laurel knows where they are.

269
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,722
We put their location in Felicity's
program, but Brick's moving them.

270
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,884
We can take him out en route,
but the window's closing.

271
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,048
Laurel, monitor us from here.
Talk me and Roy in.

272
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,646
No. That's not how this is gonna work.

273
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,962
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

274
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,406
You're not your sister.

275
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,642
You think I don't know that?

276
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,330
You lost a brother.

277
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,563
If there's anyone who I thought
would understand, it would be you.

278
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,605
Stay close to her.

279
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,050
We should have got the mayor.
That was a loss.

280
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,808
You'll never get me, masked man.

281
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,049
Come on, throw everything that you got!

282
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,165
Let's go.

283
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,089
Laurel. Laurel, watch your 6.

284
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,206
Lucky for you, I don't like hitting women.

285
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,121
Go, go, go!

286
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,043
Bad choice.

287
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,284
This one's on you.

288
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,811
No. No.

289
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,041
No.

290
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,244
Danny Brickwell is still at large tonight
after abducting three aldermen...

291
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,607
...from city hall earlier this evening.

292
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,491
Though he's managed
to evade S. C. P.D. thus far...

293
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,484
- Dad.
- Hey, you okay?

294
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
- Yeah.
- Two vigilantes associated with the Arrow...

295
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,362
...the Red Arrow and the woman in black...

296
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,885
...in pursuit.

297
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,930
Reports now trickling in
suggest a confrontation...

298
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,650
Your sister did her best.

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,641
Channel 52's running cell-phone footage
of her and the guy in the red hood.

300
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,165
Did Sara talk to you?

301
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,084
What? No.

302
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,685
Uh, she hasn't, not yet.

303
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,649
She must know we're seeing this.

304
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,802
Mayor, there's a call for you on line one.

305
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,440
- Take a message.
- It's Danny Brickwell.

306
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,046
Mr. Brickwell?

307
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,569
How is your evening going, Madam Mayor?
Mine's not going too well.

308
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,042
Because your city's vigilante problem
became mine earlier tonight.

309
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,326
And he's forced my hand.

310
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,608
Look, you have demands,
just get on with it.

311
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,529
No demands, just Shakespeare.

312
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,926
Julius Caesar.

313
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,889
Act five, scene two.

314
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,202
They stand, and would have parley.

315
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,807
The war stops and together they converse.

316
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,724
I would have parley with you.

317
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,450
That isn't what we're doing now?

318
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,046
In person. Brockton Point, one hour.

319
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,964
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

320
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,884
And certainly not in person.

321
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,850
You are already going to one funeral,
Madam Mayor.

322
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,731
If you wanna make it a hat trick,
that's your prerogative.

323
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,247
Me? I'll be at Brockton Point.

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,686
If you came to see
how packing is going, it's not.

325
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,405
No.

326
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,288
I came to apologize.

327
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,569
I don't wanna lose you, Thea.

328
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,048
But at the same time,
sharing the truth with you is sometimes...

329
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,361
...difficult for me.

330
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,804
Well, maybe you'll get
better with practice.

331
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,844
- Who are we running from?
- His name is Ra's al Ghul.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,445
Why does he wanna kill you?

333
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,047
Ra's has a particular code of honor
he feels I violated.

334
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,369
And he's marked me
and my family for death.

335
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,767
I fell in with Ra's because I was consumed
by the death of my wife.

336
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,811
And I was marked for death because
of the undertaking that killed my son.

337
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,763
You're all I have left, Thea.

338
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,804
Keeping you safe is all that matters.

339
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,291
Please let me.

340
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,609
Alderman Richard Ford...

341
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,410
...was in his second term at city hall.

342
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,171
He leaves behind a wife and two children.

343
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,689
The city asks the family's privacy
be respected during this trying time.

344
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,084
- Though no official statement...
- Laurel? I'm sorry. I can come back.

345
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,123
No, it's okay. it's...

346
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,761
ls everything okay?

347
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,086
I came to ask you the same thing.

348
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,321
Canary.

349
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,722
I guess you came
to talk some sense into me.

350
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,807
Seems like you could use some.

351
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,287
I'm not sure you're gonna have to bother.

352
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,442
Brick, he...

353
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,285
He killed someone tonight.

354
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,285
In front of me.

355
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,522
I thought that being...

356
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,644
Being Sara would make it hurt less.

357
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,651
But instead, it just...

358
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,804
It caused more pain.

359
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,404
Not just for me.

360
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,842
So you don't have to worry.

361
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,486
I'm not gonna be putting
on that mask again.

362
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,362
I'm not strong enough to fight for Sara.

363
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,924
Maybe you're not supposed to.

364
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,204
Maybe it's not about Sara. Or Oliver.

365
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,001
Or anyone else
that we care about who we lost.

366
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,083
Maybe what we've been doing...

367
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,244
...we've been doing it
because there are people we care about...

368
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,290
...that are still alive.

369
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,809
Maybe we're doing it for them.

370
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,885
I thought you quit.

371
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,205
He's confident.

372
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,523
Meeting here in the open
where any police sniper could take him out.

373
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,729
Because he's got men who could take
the hostages out. Checkmate.

374
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,723
Madam Mayor.

375
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,683
All this for me?

376
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,882
I'm impressed.

377
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,924
What are you doing here, Palmer?

378
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,164
Wanna make yourself look important?

379
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,481
Good luck with that.

380
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,085
Star City.

381
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,320
Seems more like Brick City to me.

382
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,090
The night is young.

383
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,766
Tough talk.

384
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,400
Too bad all you got is money to back it up.

385
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,847
But you can't fix this with money, Palmer.

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,240
I don't know.

387
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,481
I got a lot of money.

388
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,611
Say what you came here to say.
We can all end this farce.

389
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,527
Okay.

390
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,883
I've still got two of your men.

391
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,401
If you want them back, it's simple.

392
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,130
Get out of the Glades.

393
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,966
Your city servicemen,
especially the police, evacuate.

394
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,567
- You're out of your mind.
- You've got until midnight tomorrow.

395
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,685
And if I even see a hint of a blue,
your city yes-men?

396
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,251
They will be buried.

397
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,368
We won't abandon an entire district.

398
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,322
They did in L.A. in '92, didn't they?

399
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,603
Besides, you don't want every news station
in the country...

400
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,604
...showing footage of the murders
of the aldermen, do you?

401
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,001
You have 23 hours 59 minutes.

402
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,481
I suggest you move your sweet ass.

403
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,931
Captain Lance?

404
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,687
Brick wants every cop out the
Glades, or he's gonna kill his hostages.

405
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,161
We need help. We need it now.

406
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,007
Look, I know you said the Arrow is gone.

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
Are you sure about that?

408
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,164
Yes, I am.

409
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,207
But I think I know where
to find the Canary.

410
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,806
- The storm has passed.
- Maseo...

411
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,250
...you don't have to leave.
You can still have a life.

412
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,925
Why do you assume I want one?

413
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,691
Because I know you,
and this isn't who you are.

414
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,366
I love you.

415
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,727
No matter who you think you've become.

416
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,650
Maseo?

417
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,484
They found you.

418
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,400
Sarab, what are you doing here?

419
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Ra's al Ghul wants Oliver Queen's remains.

420
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,044
I found no body, only tracks.

421
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,486
Which led here.

422
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,443
Queen is still alive.

423
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,371
But there is no one here.
I was just about to go.

424
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,247
Brothers.

425
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,890
We should go.

426
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,851
Traitor.

427
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,811
She's the mother of my son.

428
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,241
- You do not get to judge me.
- Too late.

429
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,843
This concludes our business.

430
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,890
Only if the serum is genuine.

431
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,166
It's genuine.

432
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,569
Then you should have no problem
with me testing it.

433
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,442
It's a fake. Kill them all.

434
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,406
Go, go, go!

435
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,765
That alderman died
because of the decision that I made.

436
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,562
And there's no Mirakuru
to blame this time.

437
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,121
Don't take that on yourself, man.

438
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,610
That was Brick.

439
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,325
What's that?

440
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,161
Sometimes, me and Oliver
would come down here...

441
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,846
...after, you know, tough nights.

442
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,407
He would pour this.

443
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,842
Look up and say:

444
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,481
What does that mean?

445
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,210
I have no earthly idea.

446
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,001
To Oliver.

447
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,681
To Oliver.

448
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,963
We can't do this without Oliver, can we?

449
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,445
Felicity was right.

450
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,887
Actually, I was wrong.

451
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,884
- And I'm not wrong a lot.
- I talked to my father.

452
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,407
The mayor will cave
and seek control of the Glades.

453
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,370
- They'll evacuate police force.
- It's up to us to stop Brick.

454
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,602
Us? What, are you and Laurel a team now?

455
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,411
I was wrong
when I said Oliver's mission was over.

456
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,127
Because it's not just Oliver's
mission anymore. It is ours.

457
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,725
It's our home under attack.

458
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,966
For all we know, Oliver could be dead,
and Sara certainly is.

459
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,521
But there are people that are still alive.

460
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,011
People who need us.

461
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,604
Okay.

462
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,843
First, we have to find out
where those aldermen are.

463
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,442
- It's a bad idea.
- So you've said, repeatedly.

464
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,763
But it's my decision,
so do as I tell you, and give the order.

465
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,885
You give it. You wanna pull my men
out the Glades, fine. That's your funeral.

466
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,883
I don't want any part of it. Excuse me.

467
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,521
Hello.

468
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,007
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sara.

469
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,561
Where you been?
I've been worried sick about you.

470
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,083
I'm sorry.

471
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,651
I'm here.

472
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,006
Are you okay?

473
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,811
Well, yeah. I've been better.
I'm sure you have been to.

474
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,450
Why didn't you call me sooner?

475
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,443
It's complicated.

476
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
How are you doing this?

477
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,368
I fed recordings of Sara's voice
through a symbolic algorithm.

478
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,285
Daddy, I'm sorry that I've been away...

479
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,408
...but I don't want you to worry about me.

480
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,047
I'm fine.

481
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,042
- And I'm here to help.
- Okay. What do you need from me?

482
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,441
Tell me everything about the hostages.

483
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,448
No matter how seemingly insignificant.

484
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,967
I don't know how
their favorite color will help.

485
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,360
There has to be something.

486
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,285
Intel that you couldn't use
because of the mayor's orders.

487
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,762
I wish. The clock's running down
on these guys too.

488
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,049
One has a heart condition.
If his pacemaker isn't recharged soon...

489
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,486
...we'll lose him.

490
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,404
Daddy, that actually helps.

491
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,684
But I have to go now.

492
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,571
Wait, just listen to me. Be careful, okay?

493
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,405
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

494
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,050
I'll be careful.

495
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,443
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you too, Daddy.

496
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,165
One alderman has a pacemaker.

497
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,369
If it's remote programmable...
It will have a GPS.

498
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,761
It'll take me a few minutes to log onto it.

499
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,604
Gear up.

500
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,804
This one, breakthrough.
All we need's one...

501
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,886
- Hi.
- Yeah, hey. Just one second.

502
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,170
- Sorry.
- What's going on?

503
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,044
I need the keys to your helicopter.

504
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,321
How would you fly it?

505
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,884
I got that covered, just give me the keys.
I promise I will not crash it.

506
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,366
I got to be honest.

507
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,091
I'd feel more confident
in your aeronautic abilities...

508
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,370
...if you knew, for instance,
that helicopters don't actually have keys.

509
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
They don't have keys?

510
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,564
- No, they...
- Is it on the roof?

511
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,843
- Yeah, it's on the roof.
- Thank you.

512
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,243
I'll hold you to the no-crash promise.

513
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,244
You realize it's been five years
since I've flown one of these?

514
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,085
- Like riding a bicycle, I hope.
- We have Brick's location?

515
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,527
According to the last signal
from the pacemaker...

516
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,411
...Brick has the alderman
in a warehouse at 16th and Kent.

517
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,891
Not for long, he isn't.

518
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,642
We got a chopper outside. Take a look.

519
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,041
Roger that. Checking it now.

520
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,450
I guess we're even now.

521
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,125
Follow the hallway 2O yards.

522
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,650
Turn left.

523
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,041
Aldermen.

524
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,609
Come on. Don't worry,
we're gonna get you out of here.

525
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,926
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Go, go.

526
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,368
Dig, I'm gonna need you
to find me a way out of here.

527
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,921
Copy that.

528
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,447
I still don't like hitting women.

529
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,124
But I could make an exception for you.

530
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,207
So come and get me.

531
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,522
You're getting warmer.

532
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,763
Because I will keep this city safe.

533
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,287
By killing anyone
that doesn't do what you say?

534
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,930
Something like that.

535
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,764
Warmer.

536
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,763
Warmer.

537
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,645
We're not going to let you...

538
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,881
It's done.

539
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,485
The bodies will not be found.

540
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,481
Okay, Maseo, I get that you wanted
to go back before, but that was before.

541
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,450
When Ra's finds out
that you've betrayed the league...

542
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,484
Maseo?

543
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,170
- Why the hell did you do that?
- I didn't. You did.

544
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,444
In a successful attempt to escape.

545
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,244
Or you could just come back
to Starling City with me.

546
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,482
Ahem. Can I talk to you for a minute?

547
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,086
If you're gonna bluff
with a fake virus sample...

548
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,571
...let me in on it.

549
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,290
I wasn't bluffing.

550
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,488
What does that mean?

551
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,881
That the Alpha we stole was a fake?

552
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,805
That Amanda Waller knew
I would try something like this.

553
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,128
She must've switched the vial
before I took it.

554
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,647
Maseo, you were willing to risk...

555
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,247
...letting hundreds,
maybe thousands of people die?

556
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,521
For my wife.

557
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,726
Yes.

558
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,402
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for my family.

559
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,411
Thank you.

560
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,891
You saved my life.

561
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,765
Dad.

562
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,568
Both aldermen are back with their families.

563
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,449
Nice job.

564
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,887
- For all the good it did.
- What does that mean?

565
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,963
Mayor Castle caved.

566
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,010
- She's pulling S.C.P.D. out of the Glades.
- But why?

567
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,521
Brick doesn't have the aldermen anymore.

568
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,284
No, but he has the home address...

569
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,808
...of every council member and their family
and the means to hurt them.

570
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,764
Played that card 15 minutes ago.

571
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,361
Hey, sweetheart... Hey.

572
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,490
How about we cry
over each other's shoulders...

573
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,961
...over dinner at the
Chinese place you love.

574
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,770
I can't.

575
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm sorry.

576
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,885
What's going on with you?
Why are you trying to avoid me?

577
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,642
I'll explain everything.

578
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,531
- Just not tonight.
- You okay?

579
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,205
I'm fine, Daddy. I'm fine.

580
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,725
- Are you ready to leave?
- No.

581
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,289
I'm not leaving.

582
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,770
Is this supposed to make up
for me missing your adolescence?

583
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,924
This routine of listening
and disobeying me?

584
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,491
Just hear me out.

585
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,369
You told me that we were in danger.

586
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,171
You even told me who was after us...

587
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,048
...but what you didn't tell me is why?

588
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,605
Yes, I did.

589
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,489
Because Ra's al Ghul wants us dead.

590
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,722
It's pretty much the case anywhere we go.

591
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,210
So why run?

592
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,804
Why not stay and fight?

593
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,648
Seven months ago, I asked you to teach me.

594
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,765
To teach me how to not be afraid
and how to not get hurt.

595
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,364
So why are you asking me
to be afraid now?

596
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,530
I am not asking you. I am telling you.

597
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,762
- You should be very afraid.
- Well, I'm not.

598
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,161
Because my father taught me not to be.

599
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,843
He taught me to stand my ground,
how to not give an inch in a battle.

600
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,049
I'm not afraid of this man,
and you shouldn't be either.

601
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,124
He should be afraid of us.

602
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,882
Then we'll stay.

603
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,163
Your helicopter...

604
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,004
...is back on the roof.

605
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,286
I didn't crash it.

606
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,124
It turns out...

607
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,208
...it actually had keys. And this.

608
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,565
The reason you couldn't get
the nanite chip to function...

609
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,007
...is because what you actually need...

610
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,568
...is a quantum processor.

611
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,609
- The design is elegant.
- Mm-hm.

612
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,725
I thought you weren't gonna help me
on my suicide mission?

613
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,329
Well, that's the thing.

614
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,564
With my help, you might not end up dead.

615
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,647
H9)'-

616
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,007
Thought you knew about this neighborhood
turning into a scene from The Purge.

617
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,241
We didn't open tonight.

618
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,171
I forgot my music files here,
and I've got another gig.

619
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,891
Are you cheating on me
with another club manager?

620
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,042
Well, I heard a rumor
you were leaving town.

621
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,320
Happy to say that those rumors are false.

622
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,165
That's good news. For both of us.

623
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,163
Don't get so ahead of yourself.

624
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,931
My hard drive's up there.

625
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,770
Take your time.
