1
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,972
Why is it so complicated
deciding how to have a baby?

2
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,517
The Batsuit isn't exactly baby-proof,

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,935
but I can't force Sophie into

4
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,437
nine months of indigestion
and swollen ankles.

5
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,980
Sis, you are spiraling.

6
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,001
Do you remember what I told you
when I was your maid of honor?

7
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,985
No, I was busy getting married,
not taking notes.

8
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,030
I told you to stop thinking so much
and to listen to your heart.

9
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,199
If you want to have a baby,

10
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,054
your heart will figure out the "how."

11
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,078
And then that sweet little girl

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,455
is going to grow up
and decide that she hates you.

13
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:41,918
Jenna has been thinking
the worst insults at me tonight.

14
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,229
Let me tell you something.
Teenagers...

15
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,797
Do not use the bathroom,
it's occupied.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,383
Really occupied.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,716
Thank you.

18
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,761
Allegra!

19
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,512
Hey.

20
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,473
So, how's London?

21
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,562
You calling cookies "biscuits" yet?

22
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:06,025
Nope. But actually, I might be
moving back to the States.

23
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,979
I got a job offer in Gotham.

24
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,487
Oh, my gosh. Allegra, that's great.

25
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,091
Thanks. Yeah, I haven't decided
if I'm gonna take it or not yet.

26
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,031
So...

27
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,661
If I could have
everyone's attention for a minute.

28
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,123
When you find...

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,459
the love of your life,

30
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,352
you're part of something greater, you...

31
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:31,009
You're part of something wonderful,
magical, beautiful,

32
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:36,306
and, frankly, surprising,
because you never know

33
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:38,182
what face

34
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,518
fate will be wearing

35
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:43,896
when she knocks on your door
to change your life forever.

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,775
And my only wish for you
is that when that face shows up

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,362
to change your lives,
that that face is as beautiful

38
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,325
as the one standing next to me.
To Iris West.

39
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:57,702
The love of my life.

40
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,882
What the hell is he doing here?

41
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,929
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here, Allen.

42
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,307
It's been you this whole time.

43
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,308
Despero,

44
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:22,602
Armageddon, Joe...

45
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:25,021
Don't you dare say my father's name,
you murderer!

46
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,940
Guys, it's me, Barry.

47
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,525
Iris is my wife.

48
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,613
We've all fought Thawne together.

49
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,241
My God, he actually believes
the things he's saying.

50
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,745
All right, I'll show you it's me.

51
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,088
Thawne, what did you do?

52
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,926
You're not the Flash,

53
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,635
Allen.

54
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,685
I am.

55
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,839
Team Flash,

56
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,174
suit up.

57
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,195
Guys.

58
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,450
Thawne is tricking you.
I came here from 2021.

59
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,533
Save it, Allen.

60
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,919
I'm not falling
for your mind games this time.

61
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:07,874
Put him down.

62
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,643
It's a paralysis ray.
No speed for a couple seconds, Allen.

63
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,772
- Why are you doing this?
- So I can do this.

64
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,554
That was for Ray and for Nate.

65
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,847
And that was for Sara.

66
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,725
And this...

67
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,107
...is for Cisco.

68
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,501
So sorry, Allegra.

69
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,419
But we did put a tie on the door.

70
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,421
What did we miss?

71
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,427
Get away from me.

72
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,681
Iris, you have to believe me.
Thawne's not the Flash, I am.

73
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,416
He must have changed the timeline.

74
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,641
You're my wife.

75
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,854
This is our home, our loft.
We even have kids.

76
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,314
- Bart and Nora.
- Stop!

77
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,984
Please, you have to remember us.

78
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,070
Iris, you're my lightning rod.

79
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,491
You're psychotic.

80
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:22,884
Iris West is my lightning rod now,
Reverse-Flash.

81
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,219
What the hell did you do?

82
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,722
Nothing you haven't done before.

83
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,809
You created a Flashpoint.

84
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,646
Wrong. I created a Reverse Flashpoint.

85
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:40,526
<i>I started by doing a little housekeeping
at S. T.A.R. Labs.</i>

86
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,780
<i>And then, I took care
of the one father you had left.</i>

87
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,323
Why?

88
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,367
Because after our last encounter,

89
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,578
it was clear to me
you're faster than I was.

90
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:55,041
And that the only way to defeat you...

91
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,628
was to become you.

92
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,841
So, I ran back
to the year 2013 and made sure

93
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,636
that I was the one struck by lightning.

94
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:12,058
I was the one that Iris West wrote about
as the Streak. I led Team Flash.

95
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:15,561
I was the one Iris West
fell in love with.

96
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,146
I stole your life!

97
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,191
And because every hero needs a villain,

98
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,611
I created that, too.

99
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:27,949
You wore my face.

100
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,076
<i>It was you
that attacked the city that day.</i>

101
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,721
That's why they don't trust me.

102
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,705
Made you think you were crazy,

103
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,709
crazy enough to beg,

104
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:43,214
literally beg Jefferson Pierce
to steal your speed.

105
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,297
What's it at now?

106
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:45,757
Five percent?

107
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:47,425
Maybe less.

108
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,262
Thawne, what you've done
destroys the world.

109
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,222
It creates Armageddon.

110
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,516
- No.
- No, it's true. Damn it!

111
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,435
I would not create a perfect world

112
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,021
just to watch it die.

113
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,439
As a matter of fact,

114
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,026
the only thing that is set to expire

115
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,736
is you.

116
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,489
Do you know why?

117
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,493
Because I finally did what I
set out to do all those years ago.

118
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,415
I killed you as a child.

119
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,293
You can do that all night long.

120
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:26,173
But the fact remains, at the stroke
of midnight, my timeline will solidify,

121
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,803
and you will cease to exist.

122
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,641
And your precious Speed Force
cannot help you now,

123
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:41,147
because in this timeline,
she chose me and Iris chose me.

124
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
I've won!

125
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,776
I finally won. Who's faster now?

126
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,088
<i>Earlier today,
protesters gathered downtown...</i>

127
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:10,259
<i>...outside the penthouse
of Damien Darhk, demanding justice.</i>

128
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,638
<i>Darhk, who was released from
Iron Heights Prison on a technicality...</i>

129
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,309
<i>...was convicted six months ago
for the murders</i>

130
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,186
<i>of A.R. G. U.S. director, Cisco Ramon,</i>

131
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,980
<i>the heroic team known as the Legends,</i>

132
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,150
<i>as well as tech philanthropist,
Ray Palmer.</i>

133
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,069
<i>Meanwhile, Darhk's accomplice,</i>

134
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:32,823
<i>the mass-murdering speedster,
the Reverse-Flash, is still at large.</i>

135
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,172
Barry Allen.

136
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:52,343
I was wondering when my old partner
was going to come back and say hello.

137
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,055
I hope you've been
laying low somewhere relaxing.

138
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,183
I need your help again, Damien.

139
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,684
Yeah, of course you do.

140
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,521
Whoa! Mm.

141
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,064
Huh.

142
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,444
You seem... different.

143
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,824
It seems like you're
running on empty, old friend.

144
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,907
What happened to you?

145
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,871
The Flash happened to me,
now I want payback.

146
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,707
I like where this is going.

147
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,668
Spill your tragic tale.

148
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,338
Well, after you were arrested,

149
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,967
- I fought the Flash and beat him.
- Yes!

150
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:37,221
But before I could drive a hand
through his heart,

151
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,223
he ran back in time,

152
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,725
changed things, so he had won.

153
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,936
He created an anachronism.

154
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,437
Only it wasn't just one event.

155
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,273
Thawne changed everything.

156
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,234
Trying to stop him cost me my speed.

157
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,321
Now we're living in a timeline
he constructed for his own benefit.

158
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,447
Really?

159
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,993
And that's downright villainous.

160
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Mm.

161
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:02,997
We need to put him down.

162
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,540
Yeah, we will. We will.

163
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,168
Nobody gets to rig time except me.

164
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,712
But fixing this won't be easy.

165
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,756
If the Flash created
multiple anachronisms,

166
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,344
the only way to reset the timeline is to
turn everything back at the same time,

167
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,804
which is why we need the P.E.D.

168
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,182
- The P.E.D?
- The P.E.D.

169
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,521
The Particle Eradication Distributor.

170
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,608
The thing that erases
any type of matter.

171
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,652
You yanked it out
of Ray Palmer's cold dead hands.

172
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,197
Right.

173
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,743
When you've killed as many people
as I have, you start to lose track.

174
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,119
Huh.

175
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,998
I sometimes forget...

176
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,129
you're even darker than me.
Pun intended.

177
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,417
All right, old partner.
Here's what we're going to do.

178
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,178
If we combine the P.E.D.
and my Time Stone,

179
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,598
any anachronisms on that temporal plane
will be erased.

180
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,307
So this could work.

181
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,478
Oh, it gets so much better.

182
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,313
After my arrest,
they confiscated the P.E.D.

183
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,357
Guess where it ended up?

184
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,760
Frost, Chillblaine, and Batwoman
are searching the city,

185
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,703
- but no sign of Reverse-Flash.
- And I can't feel him anymore.

186
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,081
It's like he magically disappeared.

187
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,332
Then try harder.

188
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,254
Cecile, um, we know that
you're doing your best.

189
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,547
Yes, of course you are.

190
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,009
What's up with him, anyway?

191
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,511
Has he gone crazy?

192
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,680
I mean, the guy actually thought
he was the Flash.

193
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,307
He's a sociopath.
There's no explaining a mind like that.

194
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,951
Runk, where are we with the satellites?

195
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,938
Runk?

196
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,774
- What?
- Satellites?

197
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,858
Right.

198
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:59,238
Satellites are scanning
for his negative tachyons, sir.

199
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,658
But after analyzing samples
from Robern's,

200
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,911
looks like the Reverse-Flash
is running on limited speed.

201
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,080
Less speed means lower tachyon output.

202
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,623
Making him harder to track.

203
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:13,252
But not impossible if we sync
the Atom Bracelet's micro-sensors

204
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,838
to the satellite.
That'll isolate the smallest tachyons

205
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,107
that'll give us Allen's location.

206
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,590
Consider it done, Captain Eo.

207
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,343
Horton, use The Thinker's chair
to boost your empathic scan.

208
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,321
Snow, get the med lab ready
in case there's trouble.

209
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,014
Danvers, Garcia, weapons check.

210
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,399
What are you thinking?

211
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,656
Well, I'm thinking you should be at home
resting up for our big day tomorrow.

212
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,490
I will.

213
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
What?

214
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,539
It's just that Allen seems off.

215
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,126
Baby, he called me his lightning rod.

216
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,920
Only you call me that.

217
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,671
I know.

218
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,049
But he's smart.

219
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,384
He's attacking our love.

220
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,888
We cannot let him pull us apart.

221
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,181
He won't.

222
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,475
I love you.

223
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,684
I love you.

224
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,369
What's the deal
with you and Chester?

225
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,402
Nothing.

226
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,781
- Why?
- The stolen glances,

227
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,574
the nervous energy.

228
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,204
You either hooked up, you are
hooking up, or you really need to.

229
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,707
Okay, we did once, but it was
ten years ago and it went nowhere.

230
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,375
What happened?

231
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:40,589
We'd been flirting for months,
and one night we were playing <i>D&D</i>

232
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,257
and it just happened.

233
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,387
It was a really lusty quest.

234
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,139
Anyway, I thought
something would come of it.

235
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,727
But by the time I woke up
in the morning, Chester was gone.

236
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,479
Hold up, he just left?

237
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,522
Yep.

238
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,315
And by the time we talked about it,

239
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,859
we decided it was better
just to be friends.

240
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:02,944
Bye-bye.

241
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,069
And you know how much longer
until my new look is ready?

242
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,712
I'm going to look so good
kicking bad guy butt.

243
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,961
Just making some last-minute tweaks.

244
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,588
Okay.

245
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,967
Okay, good to go.
Now we can hunt some tachyons.

246
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,885
It's working.

247
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,096
According to these readings,

248
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,265
there's a pocket
of negative tachyons in this room.

249
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,560
You had to ruin the surprise,
didn't you?

250
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,729
You find the P.E.D.,
I'll take care of these two.

251
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Hello, boys.

252
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,442
Ah-ah-ah.

253
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,781
Of course.

254
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,328
Ooh! Tupac. What an artist!

255
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,709
- I've got it.
- Already?

256
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,503
You and I, what a team!

257
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:07,964
Hurts, doesn't it?

258
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,179
Well, so will this.

259
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,195
Let's go.

260
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,281
Oh, I've got a better idea.

261
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,992
Imagine how devastating
it would be to the Flash

262
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,912
to lose his friends
on the eve of his wedding.

263
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,166
Nothing destroys a man
like losing the ones he loves the most.

264
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,253
What the hell was that?

265
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,421
We got what we wanted.

266
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,603
Killing them
wouldn't have been efficient.

267
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,304
We can kill them later.

268
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,014
Huh.

269
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,437
The Barry Allen I know wouldn't wait,

270
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,314
which means you're not
the Reverse-Flash.

271
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,733
So, who are you?

272
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,577
Don't make me ask you again.

273
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:16,995
Who are you?

274
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,915
Thawne's the Reverse-Flash...

275
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,545
Erased me from the timeline

276
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,088
at midnight.

277
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,348
Man, he is good!

278
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,184
I mean, that's like a work of evil art.

279
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,703
The question is now
what do I do with you?

280
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,438
You could still help me.

281
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,606
"Help me?"

282
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,066
Yeah, I'm the bad guy.

283
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,651
I don't help heroes.

284
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,946
But you're also a father.

285
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,448
Which means you know what it feels like

286
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,450
to love someone
with all your heart and soul,

287
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,578
like your daughter, Nora.

288
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,869
My Nora's dead.

289
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,289
I'm done listening to you.

290
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,619
She's supposed to be alive.

291
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,751
And she is, in the timeline
I'm trying to restore.

292
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,005
In my timeline,
a demon was going to take over her soul,

293
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,590
but you switched places with her.

294
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,385
You gave your own life
so she could live.

295
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,602
If you're lying to me,
I'll see you burn.

296
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,568
<i>Nora! Nora!</i>

297
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,030
- Dad, why?
- Because I love you.

298
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,618
And I couldn't watch you
become a monster like me.

299
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,085
It's true.

300
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,508
My Nora Doll's supposed to be alive.

301
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,472
I sacrificed myself to save her.

302
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,809
So honor that sacrifice.

303
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:08,148
Help me restore the timeline
and bring her back.

304
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,362
Let's go to work.

305
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,388
I guess you guys
haven't found Allen yet, huh?

306
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,412
Nope.

307
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,166
And Batwing called from Gotham.

308
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,169
- Two-Face turned up, which means...
- You have to go.

309
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,755
I will be at the ceremony tomorrow,
I promise.

310
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,508
Until then, take this.

311
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,719
It's a Velocity-Zero gun.

312
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,306
Luke designed it the last time a certain
lady-in-red tried to kill us all.

313
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,393
It will temporarily disrupt
Reverse-Flash's connection

314
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,187
to whatever speed force
he's connected to.

315
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,270
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,814
Now, uh...

317
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,372
you want to talk about
your other problem?

318
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,668
I don't know, I've been
working on it since I got home.

319
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:02,035
Every time I think about my future
with Eobard, my mind just...

320
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,497
It goes blanker than that page.

321
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,789
Any chance it's...

322
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,792
just cold feet?

323
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,960
I don't know.

324
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,171
I love Eobard, I do.

325
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,884
But when I think about what Allen said,
I mean, I just...

326
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I can't...

327
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,472
I can't get it out of my head,
it's like it's haunting me.

328
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,726
Ryan, I've won two Pulitzers.

329
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,936
Why can't I write my own wedding vows?

330
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,190
Iris.

331
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,987
Tonight, you told me to stop thinking
so much and listen to my heart.

332
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,822
Yeah, okay, I get it.

333
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,159
- That's what I'm supposed to do now.
- 'Cause it works.

334
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:48,165
Look, tonight I saved a kid
living in their van near the waterfront.

335
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,625
Just like I was
before I found the Batsuit.

336
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:56,840
Some lowlifes were mugging her,
and as I was kicking their asses,

337
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,717
my heart told me what I want.

338
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,013
I wanna save a kid, like Cora saved me.

339
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,894
So after I dropped their sorry asses off
at the nearest precinct,

340
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:09,978
I called Sophie.

341
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,731
We're gonna adopt.

342
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,693
Ryan...

343
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,739
I'm so happy for you.

344
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,114
Take your own advice.

345
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,617
Trust me,

346
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,289
if Eobard's the one, the vows will come.

347
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,874
And what if he isn't?

348
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,543
Then I will get you
out of here in a hot minute.

349
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,796
My car drives really fast.

350
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,097
That's good work.

351
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,476
- Martini?
- Dude.

352
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,062
Right, you don't drink alcohol.

353
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,355
Hey, Chester.

354
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,774
Why did you ghost Allegra?

355
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,568
- I never...
- Oh, here we go.

356
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,071
Ten years ago,
the morning after you two hooked up,

357
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,240
you snuck out while she was sleeping.

358
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,883
First of all, that's not ghosting,
that's called the French exit.

359
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,495
I never ghosted anyone, okay?

360
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,956
I went to get coffee
and blueberry muffins.

361
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,792
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

362
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:18,421
I wanted to have breakfast in bed,
watch the sun come up.

363
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,465
Had the whole day planned.

364
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,759
Because I knew even after one night,

365
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,262
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with her.

366
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,680
Dear God!

367
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,391
When I got back,
she was gone, Alex, so...

368
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,475
Allegra ghosted me.

369
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,937
Which is why we always abide
by rule number one:

370
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,605
Never return to the scene of the crime.

371
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,859
Why didn't you ever tell her?

372
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,318
I wanted to,

373
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,696
but we were attacked
by the Legion of Doom.

374
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,532
That week was seriously chaotic.

375
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,993
And when the dust settled,

376
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,121
I tried bringing it up again...

377
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,999
but she cut me off.

378
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:01,047
Told me that night was a huge mistake
and that we were better off as friends.

379
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,095
I think I'm going to get some air.

380
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,721
Yeah.

381
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,016
Uh...

382
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,855
See, this is what happens
when you try and play Cupid.

383
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,733
What is your problem?

384
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,651
Why don't you love love?

385
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,986
Okay.

386
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,656
Love is just a chemical flood
of dopamine and oxytocin

387
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,659
giving people an addictive dependence
like a bad drug.

388
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:30,701
Science.

389
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:34,080
It's taken me years to help Chuck
feel happy without Allegra.

390
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,416
By telling him to hide his heart?

391
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,419
Okay, now you're going to give me
a whole greeting-card-inspired speech

392
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,547
about your perfect wife
and how she's the love of your life.

393
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:43,715
Okay, all right.

394
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,800
All right, fine.

395
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,222
But one day you're going to
wake up alone, and you're gonna realize

396
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,892
that you missed out
on the best part of being human.

397
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:12,035
Look, um,
according to these equations,

398
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:16,373
I'd have to hit Mach 20
in order to open a time portal.

399
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,706
Really?

400
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,916
Yeah.

401
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,044
And is that a problem?

402
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,549
To reach that kind of speed,
I'd need 40,000 miles.

403
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,009
That kind of runway doesn't exist.

404
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,471
Yes, it does.

405
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,477
Is that big enough?

406
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,357
Yes, but the Earth
isn't just a solid rock.

407
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,941
It has a molten core.

408
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,045
The kind of pressure
I'd be exerting on its mantle

409
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,779
would cause cataclysmic damage.

410
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,992
We're talking volcanoes erupting,
ice caps melting, earthquake, tsunami...

411
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,910
It'd be Armageddon.

412
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,331
So in order to save the world
and bring my Nora back...

413
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,749
I'd have to risk destroying it.

414
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,128
Just like Despero predicted.

415
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:11,885
Look, uh...

416
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,515
I hate to break up your pity party,
but we're running out of time.

417
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,143
Barry, you have to do this.

418
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,771
Trust me. I want my life
and Iris back more than anything.

419
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:22,938
But I've run the numbers.

420
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,941
I will have two minutes to accelerate

421
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,585
before my destruction
destroys the world.

422
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,153
Well, then you better run fast.

423
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:32,490
Damien, the odds of me hitting Mach 20
in two minutes is two percent.

424
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:33,658
It's better than nothing.

425
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,035
Look, you don't understand,

426
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,872
Despero says I cause Armageddon.
This is exactly what he described.

427
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,500
I won't be responsible for killing
every single person on the planet.

428
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,464
And what happens to those people
if you give up?

429
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,050
You're leaving eight billion souls
in a world where Thawne has everything

430
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,551
that he wants and nothing to lose.

431
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,446
- I'm still not fast enough.
- Fast enough?

432
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,097
How dense are you?

433
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,850
Speed isn't the only thing
that guides you through these things,

434
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,286
- it never is.
- What else is there?

435
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,228
Love, you idiot!

436
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,605
You're the paragon of it.

437
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,815
I saw what you did in the Time Stone.

438
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,985
You restarted
an entire universe with love.

439
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,111
This should be peanuts.

440
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,988
That's not gonna work, not this time.

441
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,405
Really?

442
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,367
Well, it's guiding
the both of us right now.

443
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,774
Why do you think I'm helping you?

444
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,125
You think I want to die?

445
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:26,627
I don't.

446
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,589
But if sacrificing my life means

447
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,175
that Nora gets to live the life
that Thawne stole from her,

448
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,927
then yeah, I'm going to do it because...

449
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:39,099
my love for her is what keeps me going
every damn day of my life.

450
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,066
Who do you think
I built this whole empire for?

451
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:44,853
And Iris?

452
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,981
Your family? Your friends?

453
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,818
They are what keep you going.

454
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,696
Iris doesn't remember what we had.

455
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
Well...

456
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,698
That doesn't matter.

457
00:26:58,868 --> 00:26:59,868
You do.

458
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,732
You lied to me about Chester.

459
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,171
Chester loves you.

460
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,759
When he went to tell you,
you cut him off.

461
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,095
Why did you do that?

462
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:25,562
You want to know how every relationship
in my life has ended?

463
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,439
With me getting kicked to the curb.

464
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,069
Everyone I've ever loved has left.

465
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,614
When I woke up the next morning alone,

466
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,118
it was like a trigger.

467
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,956
Suddenly I was 12 years old again

468
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,960
and my mom was telling me

469
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,964
that my dad left us because of me.

470
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,261
Yep, she was a bag of crap, too.

471
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,558
The point is, I was crushed.

472
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:10,190
So, when I saw Chester walking
up the street with coffees and a bag,

473
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,234
I knew what that meant,

474
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,862
how he felt about me,

475
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,575
and I just freaked out,
and I pushed him away.

476
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:25,829
You know...

477
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,002
my wife is my rock.

478
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,839
But things were not always perfect.

479
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,758
Trust me,

480
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:41,471
putting yourself out there, it's scary.

481
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,099
But it's also so worth it.

482
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,730
But what if I lose him?

483
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,650
You'll never know unless you try.

484
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,401
Alex...

485
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:01,115
the reason why I don't love love...

486
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,703
is because nothing scares me more

487
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,956
than putting my heart out on the line.

488
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,792
So I make fun of romantics.

489
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,462
But this whole Don Juan thing,

490
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,339
it's just an act.

491
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,217
- Really?
- I knew it.

492
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,510
The truth is...

493
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,306
I don't want to wake up alone
for the rest of my life.

494
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:28,809
Look...

495
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:30,979
Chester's my boy,

496
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,274
and I know what my boy needs.

497
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:37,734
He needs you.

498
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,451
<i>Guys,
we got a hit on Reverse-Flash!</i>

499
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:47,995
Let's go.

500
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,841
I was just thinking about...

501
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,262
I just want to talk, I swear.

502
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,227
You take one more step
and I'm gonna shoot you.

503
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,098
Okay.

504
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,292
What's wrong with you? Are you dying?

505
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,858
Something like that.

506
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,739
I came here because I'm about
to do something impossible.

507
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,782
And even though it might not work,

508
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,818
I couldn't leave this world
without telling you that...

509
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,289
Nice try, Allen.

510
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,499
But she doesn't love you.

511
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,336
She loves me.

512
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,714
Tell him, Iris. Or better yet...

513
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:44,593
shoot him.

514
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,190
- Iris.
- What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

515
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,442
I need you to know,
no matter what happens,

516
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:02,685
after everything Thawne's taken from me,
he can't take away my feelings for you.

517
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,573
I love you, Iris.

518
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,158
Enough.

519
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,381
Go... before I change my mind.

520
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,535
- How'd it go with the missus?
- I don't know.

521
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,769
But she let me go.

522
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,436
Has to mean something.

523
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,437
Well...

524
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,939
Let's do this thing.

525
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,626
Now I'll stay here,
your point of origin,

526
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,193
just in case we get some visitors.

527
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,319
But I'll be in touch.

528
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:44,862
- How?
- Magic.

529
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,864
You'll hear my voice wherever you go.

530
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,617
Now remember,
you've got two minutes to reach Mach 20

531
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,860
and open the temporal portal.

532
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,412
Damien...

533
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,455
thank you.

534
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:02,921
Get outta here.

535
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,239
We tracked down the P.E.D.
and Reverse-Flash.

536
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,806
He's crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

537
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,850
What the hell is he doing?

538
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,119
<i>He's destroying the city.</i>

539
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,853
<i>It's like the end of days out here.</i>

540
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,831
Holy crap. It's not just the city.

541
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,816
Allen's speed wake is causing the globe
to tear itself apart.

542
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,336
It's an extinction-level event
in progress.

543
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,696
He's right. I'm tracking
at least a hundred earthquakes.

544
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,072
A tsunami just hit Japan.

545
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,574
Allen really has lost his mind.

546
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,469
He realized he can't win,
so he's trying to kill us all.

547
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,493
I have to go.

548
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,661
I gotta go get Jenna.

549
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,664
<i>Guys,
Mark and I could use backup.</i>

550
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,082
Go. I'll stay here.

551
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,791
Okay.

552
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,919
Hey, not to be that guy,

553
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,231
but since this could be the end
of the world as we know it,

554
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,132
if anyone has anything to say,

555
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,382
now would be the time.

556
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,637
Right.

557
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,142
The Reverse-Flash just hit Europe.

558
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,977
Where's Eobard?

559
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,062
<i>I'm right behind him.</i>

560
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,320
Hey, Flash, you've got company.

561
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:14,908
Guess what, Darhk?

562
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,411
So do you.

563
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:26,339
Frosty, Chill-Lame.

564
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,840
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy.

565
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:31,594
But you do realize my abilities
give me the power

566
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,805
to draw and quarter
with a gesture, right?

567
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,724
Oh.

568
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,268
Not for the next 24 hours, you don't.

569
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,605
Our friend, John, gave us
a badass protection spell.

570
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,858
Constantine, I hate that guy.

571
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,235
Yeah, well, too bad.

572
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,735
Looks like we get to kick
this guy's ass all night.

573
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,322
Won't even take that long.

574
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:53,698
Really?

575
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,743
Let's see how that goes.

576
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:07,713
If Boss doesn't catch Allen
in the next 90 seconds...

577
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,674
- Chester...
- Eighty-five.

578
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,425
- Chester.
- Eighty-four.

579
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:12,718
- Chuck!
- What?

580
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:13,803
I love you!

581
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,473
Yeah, well, I love you, too!

582
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,194
When did this happen?

583
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,244
This is not working!

584
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,288
I'm still not fast enough!

585
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,308
I'm trying to save
my daughter here, Allen.

586
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,501
Focus!

587
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,029
Never dance with the devil.

588
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,126
Yeah. I increased the molecular density
on that little toothpick of yours,

589
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,462
a thousand-fold at the sub-atomic level.

590
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,573
Good luck trying to lift two tons.

591
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,384
I hate science.

592
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,266
Then you are really gonna hate that.

593
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,523
- Thanks for the assist.
- Of course.

594
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,984
- Hey, nice threads.
- Thanks, man!

595
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,906
We're running out of time.

596
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:58,156
Sixty seconds.

597
00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,408
Come on, Flash.

598
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,580
You're too late, Allen.

599
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,415
You're too late!

600
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,091
Iris...

601
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,595
<i>Iris...</i>

602
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,307
Barry, I love you, too.

603
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,184
<i>I love you, too.</i>

604
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,247
You're no hero.

605
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,290
You are a monster!

606
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,085
I'm going to ask you one last time,
Miss Horton.

607
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:55,673
And if I don't like your answer, you'll
join your friends in the afterlife.

608
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:05,932
Now...

609
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,268
the Flash...

610
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,018
Where is he?

611
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,857
I told you, I don't know!

612
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,277
You know what?

613
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:19,988
I believe you.

614
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,754
What is this?

615
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,200
Flash, what did you do?

616
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,829
I went to the future.

617
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,873
Iris was right.

618
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,461
Someone manipulated the timeline
to drive me insane.

619
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,798
Turns out, in order to fix it,

620
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,008
I had to start Armageddon.

621
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,261
Only this time,
I didn't destroy the world.

622
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,473
How is that possible?

623
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:31,435
You left 2031 before the world ended.

624
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,564
What you didn't know
was that Eobard Thawne,

625
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,775
the Reverse-Flash, was chasing me.

626
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,195
He wanted to stop me
from restoring the timeline.

627
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,948
The speed wake created by us both.

628
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,035
That is what caused
the destruction you saw.

629
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,581
If that's happened, what stopped you
from tearing this world apart?

630
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Iris.

631
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,253
She helped me reconnect
to the Speed Force.

632
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,047
Now the future's safe.

633
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,886
I can see you believe it to be true.

634
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:07,638
And as a traveler in time,

635
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,766
my senses confirm this world
has been altered.

636
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:14,687
But as for the true reason...

637
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,983
well, that remains to be seen.

638
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,278
Maybe you should go to 2031

639
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,405
and see for yourself.

640
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:35,915
I shall.

641
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,210
But if you're wrong
or if I find any evidence

642
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,839
that this world is still in danger,
I will return,

643
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,550
and you will die.

644
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,306
Yeah.

645
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,810
- Gluten-free? Cecile.
- Gluten-free.

646
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,855
- Here you go.
- Nice.

647
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,482
You have yours, right?
Is there drinks?

648
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,651
Hey, babe!

649
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,423
Uh, I would've got you something,
but I thought you were

650
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,167
working through lunch
at the precinct today.

651
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,491
Don't worry, there's plenty.

652
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,155
Got a burger for you, boss.

653
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,002
I missed you so much.

654
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,005
Not that I don't love
this attention, but...

655
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,382
where's this coming from?

656
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,053
Barry, you okay?

657
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,681
Something happened, didn't it?

658
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:36,851
What was it?

659
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,231
Later, all right?

660
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,095
I just want to be here with you.

661
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,109
With all of you.

662
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,071
Okay.

663
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,782
Want me to call Dad? Frost?

664
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:52,910
Dad. Here we go.

665
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Joe...

666
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,371
Can I call him?

667
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,957
Uh, I mean, yeah, it's ringing. So...

668
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,088
Joe?

669
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:08,675
It's really you.

670
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:11,844
You're really there.

671
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:37,121
Nobody uses time against me.

672
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,750
I will live.

673
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,337
I will change what's about to happen.

674
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,425
And you will help me.
