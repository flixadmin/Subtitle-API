1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:07,090
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,014
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,017
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,854
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,408
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,494
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,748
I'm sorry I didn't believe you. You really
did see something that night your mom died.

11
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,083
And your dad is innocent.

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,293
The explosion that put you in a coma...

13
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,797
- also killed my fiancé.
- Imagine if you could control his power.

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,676
If you could harness it, you could
change what it means to be human.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,013
He's called the Flash.
Or at least he will be one day.

16
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:59,810
- Uhn!
- He must be kept safe.

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:08,235
Whether you're the slowest kid in
gym class or the fastest man alive...

18
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,654
every one of us is running.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,448
Being alive means running.

20
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,075
Running from something.

21
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,618
Running to something.

22
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,620
Or someone.

23
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,583
And no matter how fast you are,
there are some things you can't outrun.

24
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,712
Some things always manage
to catch up to you.

25
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,214
Regular movie scale,
that was a seven or an eight.

26
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,467
Zombie movie scale,
it was, like, a four. Tops.

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,177
There's a zombie movie scale?

28
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,430
Did you know that zombies exist in nature?

29
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,349
There's this species of fungi
that infects ants...

30
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,436
causing the ants to attack plants
that can release spores...

31
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,313
which in turn infect new hosts...

32
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,481
- I'm going full nerd again, aren't 1?
- Yep.

33
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,985
It's okay though.
You are still the cutest nerd that I know.

34
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,322
Anyways, I am a lot more interested
in the amazing as of late.

35
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:57,034
- Because of the Streak thing?
- He's out there. People are talking.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,286
How do you know he's a he?
Maybe it's a she.

37
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,165
It's a man, okay? You know I'm really
intuitive about this kind of stuff.

38
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,251
Someone posted a picture
after being yanked from a car accident.

39
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,380
It's a red blur leaving the scene.
Here. What do you see?

40
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,135
I see your boyfriend is calling.

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,803
Oh. I should probably get this.

42
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,973
I'm crashing at his place.
He's supposed to leave a key for me.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,767
Hey, babe. What's up?

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,270
Not much. Just hanging out with Barry.
You off yet?

45
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,652
- Hello.
- Code 237 on Waid Boulevard.

46
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,070
Public indecency?

47
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,238
Wait, I think I meant a 239.

48
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,199
Dog leash violation?

49
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,327
Bad man with a gun in a getaway car. Go.

50
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,789
You don't have a mat.
Do you have a planter?

51
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,594
He's got a gun. Look out!

52
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,601
Where'd he go?

53
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,316
What the...?

54
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,653
Key is in the mailbox.
I'll see you later. Bye.

55
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,447
- Eddie says hi.
- Nice of him.

56
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,991
You wanna grab a bite?
I feel a little famished.

57
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,744
After the Mongolian barbecue we had
before the movie...

58
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,331
and the extra-large popcorn you had
at the movie? How are you not fat?

59
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,043
I've been jogging.

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,337
Oh, okay.

61
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,009
Why so public a meeting, uncle?

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,430
We're dining out to show our enemies
we're not afraid.

63
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,098
Relax, nephew.

64
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,892
I've replaced the windows
with bulletproof glass.

65
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,730
Close it up. Come. Have a drink.

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,202
Our own drivers are ripping us off.

67
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,373
Someone is paying them...

68
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,834
to steal from us.

69
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,672
None of you will sleep
until we find out who.

70
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,008
And then those thieves...

71
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,511
Those thieves...

72
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,557
will draw their last breath...

73
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,686
Uncle!

74
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,874
- Where'd you cut him off?
- We cut him off at 8th.

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,919
The perp was in the backseat
before he even knew what happened.

76
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,547
Congratulations, Paulson,
on that arrest last night. Hell of a job.

77
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,592
Come by later, Joe.
I'll give you a driving lesson, okay?

78
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,346
- It wasn't even him last night. It was me.
- I figured.

79
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,015
I didn't realize you were helping people
for the glory.

80
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,559
It's not like I want a museum
built to my name.

81
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,522
Keeping what I can do a secret from Iris
and everyone, it's harder than I thought.

82
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,482
I know, but it is safer that way.

83
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,276
Besides, me and you got work to do.

84
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,948
The evidence from my mom's case.

85
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,618
- I had it brought up from storage.
- I've been through this a thousand times.

86
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:31,456
Before your story about what really
happened that night, the lightning storm...

87
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:36,127
the man in the middle, I thought that was a
kid trying to protect his father from prison.

88
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,798
Now that I know it's true, we're gonna
go through every scrap of evidence...

89
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,758
until we find something that helps.

90
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,886
It took the jury 52 minutes
to come back with a verdict of guilty.

91
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,721
They moved too fast.

92
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,723
Which is why we gotta take our time.

93
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,478
Barry, Joe, we got multiple homicides.

94
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,897
Do you know the Darbinyan crime family?

95
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,615
Barry?

96
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,120
- Oh. Anything?
- Signs of histotoxic hypoxia.

97
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,956
The cells in their bodies weren't able
to utilize oxygen.

98
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,500
It's consistent with
exposure to poison gas.

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,835
What kind of poison?

100
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,005
I'll need to take a lung sample,
see if I can narrow it down.

101
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,216
The only other exit was bolted
from the inside.

102
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,843
They were trapped.

103
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,596
I was thinking someone pumped gas
in from the outside...

104
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,973
but witnesses say the street was empty.

105
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,474
So it was from the inside?

106
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,312
That means there should be a canister
or a container left behind.

107
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,439
The gas just didn't come in by itself.

108
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,524
Unless it had a mind of its own.

109
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,864
Eddie, would you mind canvassing again?

110
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,450
Somebody had to have seen
something suspicious.

111
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,537
Okay, explain.

112
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,915
The boss collapsed by the table.

113
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,168
This guy made it 10 feet away.
That guy had a chance to move...

114
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,212
and fire shots into the window
trying to break the glass.

115
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,381
But they all started in the same spot.

116
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,176
They should've been affected by the gas
at the same time.

117
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,887
- But it's as if...
- They were attacked one by one.

118
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,389
My gut feeling...

119
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:16,561
If we're gonna solve this one,
you and me are gonna need backup.

120
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,772
Yeah.

121
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,566
Fascinating. A metahuman
that can manipulate poison gas.

122
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,653
Is it just poison gas
or can he control all aerated substances?

123
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,657
How is he able to formulate the connection?
Is it physiological or psychological?

124
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,910
This individual can create a mental nexus
using gaseous substances.

125
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,080
Connect with gases on a molecular level?
That's ridiculously cool.

126
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,873
They get excited about this stuff.

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,085
The only thing I'm excited about
is putting criminals behind bars.

128
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,255
Except Iron Heights isn't exactly equipped
to handle metahumans.

129
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,759
It's fortunate the ones you've encountered
so far are no longer with us.

130
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,805
Unless we're planning on executing
every super-criminal we stop...

131
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,308
you geniuses are gonna have to come up
with some place to hold them.

132
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,144
A metahuman prison. Sweet.

133
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,939
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

134
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,526
There is one place here
that might hold them.

135
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,656
You can't be serious.
We haven't been down there since...

136
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,825
- It's cordoned off.
- Cisco is right.

137
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,285
It could be modified
to act as a makeshift prison.

138
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,912
What could?

139
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,956
The particle accelerator.

140
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,882
Tonight, the future begins.
The work my team and I will do here...

141
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,595
will change our understanding of physics.
Will bring about advancements in power.

142
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,889
Advancements in medicine.

143
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,727
And trust me, that future will be here
faster than you think.

144
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,896
Dr. Wells,
we just got the latest weather report.

145
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,232
A big thunderstorm is rolling in.

146
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,278
We're not launching a space shuttle.
We'll be fine.

147
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,740
- Tahiti?
- I know it's a long flight, Ronnie.

148
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,617
But we can binge watch
Orange is the New Black.

149
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,495
Okay. But what about Italy?

150
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,832
Pizza and wine, and more pizza.

151
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,294
Yes, but Italy doesn't have mai tais.

152
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,130
And a honeymoon isn't a honeymoon
without mai tais.

153
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,176
Dr. Wells, the accelerator is primed
and ready for particle injection.

154
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,138
Well, I feel I should
say something profound.

155
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:19,517
Like, one small step for man...

156
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,355
All I can think of to say is I feel
like I waited for this day for centuries.

157
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,870
That's it? You'd think there'd be
like a loud bang.

158
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,498
If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

159
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,878
- Take it from the guy who helped build it.
- Ladies and gentlemen, we did it.

160
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,550
Mai tais it is.

161
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,861
Was that...?

162
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,321
A loud bang.

163
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,575
Caitlin.

164
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,912
Caitlin. Did you hear me?

165
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,873
We're going down to the accelerator ring.

166
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:29,671
Dr. Wells, I could use Caitlin's help
identifying the poison gas.

167
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,509
- Okay.
- If that's okay with you.

168
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,760
Let's go.

169
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,855
- Welcome to the C.C.P.D.
- So this is your day job?

170
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,439
- Mm-hm.
- Wow.

171
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm gonna rip out your hearts
and eat them for lunch.

172
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,569
Delightful.

173
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,989
Lab rats, I need prints
off this gun, pronto.

174
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,076
Allen! Where the hell is the fiber analysis
on the Orloff case?

175
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,038
Upstairs. It's all finished.
I can just run up and bring it down.

176
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,375
With you, that could be three days.
I'll go with you. Who are you?

177
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:12,297
Dr. Caitlin Snow.
Barry's personal physician.

178
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,302
The fiber analysis for the Orloff case.

179
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,763
Like you asked for, sir.

180
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,977
Clean up your lab. It's a mess.

181
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,568
The lightning was in the house.

182
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,988
I told my son to run. He disappeared.

183
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,199
And that's when I saw the blood.

184
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,242
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

185
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,538
I needed to stabilize
the knife. I'm a doctor.

186
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,124
I was trying to save her.

187
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,002
I didn't kill my wife. Joe!

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,591
Tell them! You know me. Our kids
are friends. You tell them, Joe!

189
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,762
Do I even wanna know
what you were looking at?

190
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,639
It's just work.

191
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,267
Some old cases weren't filed properly.

192
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,735
Detective, what are you doing here?

193
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,529
Joe, I thought you were at the morgue.

194
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,616
I decided to bring some work home.

195
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,825
Why are you here?

196
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,371
Yes, well, I've been looking for you.

197
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,875
I thought maybe we could go back
to the crime scene, re-canvass...

198
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,835
- see if, uh, we missed anything.
- Hm.

199
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,630
Always work the case, right?
That's what you taught me.

200
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,049
Well, you've been listening.

201
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,051
Okay, let's hit it.

202
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,471
- You mind if I use your bathroom?
- First door on the right.

203
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,556
I'll be in the car.

204
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,643
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Dad.

205
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,317
Okay, this has got to stop.
I came here to surprise my girlfriend.

206
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,987
Now I'm going to a crime scene
with her dad.

207
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,408
- Not exactly the afternoon I was planning.
- I know. It's not the right time to tell him.

208
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,743
When is, Iris?

209
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,329
I know my dad. He'll kill us.

210
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,956
Right now...

211
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,166
you're killing us.

212
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,681
The copper in the tube...

213
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,518
is arranged to form cavities
and we can use those cavities...

214
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,521
as containment cells.

215
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,277
Of course, I have to design them
to counteract metahuman abilities...

216
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,946
but it might just work.

217
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,950
We have to decouple the injection system
on the gantry level. I'll be right back.

218
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,827
Why don't I do that?

219
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,163
I need the exercise.

220
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,591
- There's an anomaly in the core chamber.
- Ring structural integrity is holding.

221
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,510
It started a chain reaction.
We need to shut it down.

222
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,680
- We can't from here. We'll do it manually.
- Go!

223
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,724
- I'll come with.
- Ronnie, no.

224
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,518
- I know how to operate the shutdown.
- It's not safe.

225
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,979
Cait, I have to go.

226
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,200
Stay here. We've only got a few minutes
before this thing blows.

227
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,452
If I'm not back in time, initiate lockdown.

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,747
No way. I am not closing this door.
I won't be able to open it.

229
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,959
If you don't seal off the blast, everyone in
this building will die, including Caitlin.

230
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,712
Okay? Now promise me.

231
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,965
Yeah.

232
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,385
Set your watch. Two minutes.

233
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,848
You're coming back.

234
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,915
Cisco.

235
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,584
Cisco, we're ready to go.

236
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,715
It must be hard coming back down here.

237
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,386
A lot happened that night.

238
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,722
- If you feel the need to talk...
- I was just thinking...

239
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,058
we need to nail those
voltage calculations.

240
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,438
One fault and the helium blowback
could damage the mountings.

241
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,606
Smart.

242
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,117
Can I ask you something?
That you don't have to answer.

243
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,202
My least-favorite kind of question.

244
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,912
Shoot.

245
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,333
Ronnie. What was he like?

246
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,254
I mean, you just never talk about him
that much.

247
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,300
We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

248
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,760
He was the structural engineer.

249
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,264
He liked to joke that he was
basically a very high-priced plumber.

250
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,977
We were very different.

251
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,440
You might've noticed
I can be a bit guarded.

252
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,692
Ronnie knew how to make me laugh.

253
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,614
He used to say we were like fire and ice.

254
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,659
He wasn't supposed to be there that night.

255
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,539
He was just there for me.

256
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,500
If he hadn't...

257
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,882
It says that there was no residue of gas
in the tissue.

258
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,759
Poisonous or otherwise.

259
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,262
Must've evaporated.
We'll need to get a fresh sample.

260
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,223
Wait, this can't be right.

261
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,727
This says that there are two distinct
strands of DNA inside the tissue.

262
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,189
How did someone else's DNA
get inside the victims' lungs?

263
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,653
Well, my docket was clear...

264
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,156
So I stopped by the mall
to pick up your homecoming dress.

265
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,534
I am a great mom.

266
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,036
I'll see you for dinner, sweetie.

267
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,044
- There's no DNA match in the database.
- I don't understand.

268
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,882
Why would a chemical attack leave behind
another person's DNA inside the victim?

269
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,304
What if the metahuman we're looking for
doesn't control gas?

270
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,014
What if he becomes it?

271
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,779
Judge Howard?

272
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,573
It's nice to see you again.

273
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,200
You died.

274
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,328
You say that like it was an accident.

275
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,582
Remember the last thing you said to me
in the courtroom?

276
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,877
"May God have mercy on your soul."

277
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,434
Available units, we have a report...

278
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,936
of a toxic gas attack
in the Central City Shopping Mall.

279
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,813
Barry. Don't.

280
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,399
We don't know enough
about what we're facing yet.

281
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,776
It's not safe.

282
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,237
Caitlin, I have to go.

283
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,586
I patched into the mall security system.

284
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,298
According to witnesses, the gas attack
was in the elevator in the north wing.

285
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,093
- Which one is the north wing?
- The one with the Big Belly Burger.

286
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,013
I eat.

287
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,058
Back up. Please. Keep back.

288
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,286
Why did you kill that woman?

289
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,794
She deserved to die.

290
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,089
Now, go run away.

291
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,341
I still have one more name on my list.

292
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,802
Don't make me add you to it.

293
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,138
Hah!

294
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,160
Barry.

295
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,621
Barry, can you hear me?

296
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,833
His vitals are weak, but he's
alive, Dr. Wells. I'm sure he's fine.

297
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,463
- I can't breathe.
- He needs oxygen. Get the crash cart!

298
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,470
Barry.

299
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,682
- Barry.
- Cut me open. The poison is still in me.

300
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,933
He brought us a sample.

301
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,770
We need to do a pulmonary biopsy.
Extract an active portion of that gas.

302
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,230
I can't give you anesthetic.

303
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,984
- Your metabolism will burn through it.
- I heal quick. Remember?

304
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,445
- Do it.
- Cisco, give me the syringe.

305
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,655
This is gonna hurt a lot.

306
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,701
- Small needle. You probably won't feel it.
- You're definitely going to feel it.

307
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,336
Mm.

308
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,547
The Streak lives.

309
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,467
You'd be dead if your lung cells
didn't regenerate quickly.

310
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,636
Oh, my chest feels like
that one time I had a cigarette.

311
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,056
Yeah. Teen me lived for danger.

312
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,642
- This isn't funny. You could have...
- I didn't.

313
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,395
Now that we have his sample,
we'll get to work.

314
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:16,025
Analyzing it, figure out the poison,
maybe get a clue as to his human identity.

315
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,153
Or at least a way to stop him
from turning into a mist.

316
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,240
The Mist. Okay, that's his name.
End of discussion.

317
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,909
I have to get to the station.

318
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,578
- You should be resting.
- I have to talk to Joe.

319
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,667
Joe. I had him.

320
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,838
The metahuman. We were wrong.
He's not controlling airborne toxins.

321
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,966
He can literally transform himself
into poison gas.

322
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,259
That's new.

323
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:48,057
The victim was a judge. We're checking
old cases to see if there's a connection.

324
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,433
It's too late.

325
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,186
I should have been faster.

326
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,231
Focus on the job.
Don't think about that right now.

327
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,901
You don't wanna know
what I'm thinking about.

328
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:10,287
My dad has spent 14 years in a 6-by-8-foot
cell for a crime he didn't commit.

329
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,124
I couldn't save my mom, but I can save him.

330
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,379
Didn't I promise you that we would
get your father out of prison together?

331
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,840
I don't need your help, Joe.

332
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,802
I could be in and out of there with him
before anyone even sees me.

333
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,222
Okay.

334
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,140
You break him out of there.

335
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,686
Then what?

336
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,189
He's on the run for the rest of his life.

337
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,985
- But he's not as fast as you are.
- You don't know what it's like.

338
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,405
You think I don't understand
what you're feeling?

339
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,117
I have been a cop
for almost as long as you've been alive.

340
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,621
So you should know, putting on that suit
does not make everybody safe.

341
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,666
For every person you save,
there's gonna be somebody you can't.

342
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,086
And the hardest thing you're gonna
have to face is not some monster.

343
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:05,092
It's gonna be that feeling of uselessness
when you can't do anything.

344
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,683
Or the guilt that weighs on you...

345
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,019
when you make a mistake.

346
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,361
Some things, Barry, you can't fight.

347
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,655
Some things...

348
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,199
you just have to live with.

349
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,427
Yes, I'm writing this down.

350
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,556
Red Streak at the mall
during the gas attack.

351
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,391
Thank you for calling.

352
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,563
Never fails. Tip lines bring out
the potheads and the crazies.

353
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,067
- Did they get a look at the Streak's face?
- Not you too.

354
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,321
What are you doing here, anyway?

355
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,199
We need to talk.

356
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,205
- I thought about what you said, and...
- I know what you're gonna say.

357
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:21,085
- I understand. I'm your dad's partner.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

358
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,922
I have never really
had a serious boyfriend.

359
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:30,386
Between Dad and Barry and work,
my life has been full.

360
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,638
And I really like you...

361
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,517
but I thought if I told my dad about us,
then it would make this real...

362
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:41,563
and suddenly, it's something that
I could lose or screw up.

363
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,984
I wanted it to be real.

364
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,403
Eddie.

365
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,427
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

366
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,641
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you,
leaving like that.

367
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,310
It's okay. I get it.

368
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,521
You had to go.

369
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,441
It's just...

370
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,570
That's the last thing
that Ronnie said to me that night.

371
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,663
My mother died 14 years ago.

372
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,295
I used to think that the further away
I got from it, the less it would hurt.

373
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,759
But some days, the pain...

374
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,470
it's worse than the
day that it happened.

375
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,932
Some things you can't fight.

376
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,229
For so long...

377
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,483
I've been terrified
of going into that hole.

378
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,944
What if I went with you?

379
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,129
Where's Ronnie? Cisco, where is he?

380
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,340
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

381
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,133
I can't. We're in lockdown mode.

382
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,385
Cisco, we have to get him out or he'll die.

383
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,930
- Cisco, can you hear me?
- Ronnie, it's me.

384
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,393
Caitlin.

385
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,775
- Is Cisco there?
- Yeah, Ronnie, I'm here. I'm listening.

386
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,027
I adjusted the magnets
to redirect the beam.

387
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,489
To try and vent the systems
so the blast goes up and not out.

388
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,575
I'll need to reset the particle parameters
to compensate.

389
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,828
Cisco's doing it.

390
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,790
There has to be another way out of there.
You have to find it.

391
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,043
Cait...

392
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,921
the chain reaction, I can't reverse it.

393
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,966
The doors need to stay shut to protect you.

394
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,388
- Are you still there?
- I'm here.

395
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,730
- Caitlin, whatever happens...
- Ronnie!

396
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,191
Ronnie!

397
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,576
He saved so many lives that day...

398
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,996
and no one will ever know what he did.

399
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,710
I do.

400
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,214
He was a hero.

401
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,385
I didn't want him to be a hero.

402
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,305
I wanted him to be my husband.

403
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,148
Barry, Caitlin, you down there?
You gotta come look at this.

404
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,029
Hey, check this out.

405
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,491
It's a 3D molecular model
of the gas from your lungs.

406
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,995
- We have identified the toxin.
- Hydrogen cyanide?

407
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:29,708
What's interesting is what's
mixed in with the cyanide.

408
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,460
A sedative.

409
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:36,632
Of course. The night of the explosion,
find out if anyone was executed.

410
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,258
- Why?
- That sedative is given...

411
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,387
to criminals on death row before they go
and breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

412
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,806
- That's right.
- There was someone executed.

413
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,391
- Kyle Nimbus.
- That's him.

414
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,936
He was a hit man
for the Darbinyan crime family.

415
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,812
They turned on him and testified.

416
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,816
Judge Theresa Howard was the judge
at his trial. She sentenced him to death.

417
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,403
He must have been affected by
the explosion while he was being gassed.

418
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,282
- Records say the execution was completed.
- That's why there wasn't a match.

419
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,327
- The database only has records of the living.
- Right.

420
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,497
There was one more person on his list.
Check the arrest record.

421
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,999
Who caught him?
That could be his next attack.

422
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,336
Barry, the lead detective.

423
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,931
- I'm here to see Henry Allen.
- Sign here, personal effects here.

424
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,784
- Eddie.
- Barry, what's up?

425
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,453
Do you know where Joe went?
He's not picking up.

426
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,414
I'm not sure.

427
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,375
It's important I speak to him.
I need to know where he went.

428
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,879
He went to Iron Heights to see your dad.

429
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:03,468
Barry, I reverse-engineered
an antidote to the toxin.

430
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,679
I hope you won't need it.

431
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:29,453
- What are you doing here? Is Barry all right?
- He's fine.

432
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,375
Then to what do I owe this visit?

433
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,086
I know I should have come
to see you sooner.

434
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,924
You just weren't up for chitchat with a man
who murdered his wife in front of his son?

435
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,012
Except now I know
you didn't kill your wife.

436
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,604
Barry, I pulled up the specs
on Iron Heights Prison.

437
00:30:55,771 --> 00:31:00,609
It's maximum security, but I think
I can talk you through breaking in there.

438
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,529
Don't bother. I've been figuring out how
to break into that place since I was 11.

439
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,158
Some new evidence has come to light.

440
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,871
I can't go into detail. It's just...

441
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,624
Look, the important thing is...

442
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,627
I'm re-opening the case.

443
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,838
I'm gonna find out
who really killed Nora...

444
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,258
and I promise you, Henry,
I'm going to get you out of here.

445
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,305
I am so sorry.

446
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,475
It doesn't matter
that you didn't believe in me...

447
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,188
because you always believed in my son.

448
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,089
Nimbus?

449
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,550
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Same to you.

450
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,347
Joe?

451
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,016
Joe!

452
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,103
Help! Guards!

453
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,438
Somebody, help!

454
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,380
Go get him.

455
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:01,813
So you come to finish
what the gas chamber couldn't?

456
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,817
You're going somewhere
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

457
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,195
Wrong.

458
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,872
He used the antidote on Joe.

459
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,460
You need to stay away from him, Barry.
Do not breathe him in.

460
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,760
I'm not sure how that helps me, guys.

461
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,773
You can't fight him, Barry.

462
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,902
Just keep him coming at you.
That should zap his strength.

463
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,946
Gas is the least stable form of matter.

464
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,657
He will not be able to stay
in his mist form for long.

465
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,450
His particles will need to reform.

466
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,178
Barry.

467
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,180
Barry.

468
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,602
We win.

469
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,116
It's been a while since
I watched you sleep.

470
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,165
Rescuing you is exhausting.

471
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:29,711
I really miss the ability
to be able to ground you.

472
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,130
Sorry I went and grew up.

473
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,057
- I could have got dad out of Iron Heights.
- I know.

474
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,518
But you were right. That's not the way.

475
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,607
- Daddy.
- Oh, baby. I'm fine, don't worry.

476
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,863
I'll let you guys talk.

477
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,282
Partner.

478
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,454
You two arrive at the same time?

479
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,418
Dad, we have something
that we need to tell you.

480
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,508
- Dad, the thing is...
- You two are dating.

481
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,344
- I know.
- You do?

482
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,262
I'm a detective, remember?

483
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,433
And both of you are lousy liars.

484
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,937
- So you're not mad?
- Oh, I'm mad.

485
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,773
If the doctor hadn't confiscated my gun...

486
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,442
we'd be having
an entirely different conversation.

487
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:40,198
Well, I should let you two talk,
and I'll just be outside...

488
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,784
looking into
the Witness Protection Program.

489
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:50,083
- I'm sorry.
- Iris, this is going to be complicated.

490
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,586
You know I don't like complicated.

491
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,798
Do you like him?

492
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,426
Yeah, I do.

493
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,472
- Then I will try hard not to shoot him.
- That is all I ask.

494
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,148
Will it hold?

495
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,360
The barrier's powered by an
8.3 tesla super-conducting electromagnet...

496
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:22,824
which is about 100,000 times
the strength of Earth's magnetic field.

497
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,118
In other words, yes.

498
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,956
He's mad.

499
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,626
Well, good night.

500
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:42,886
So we're just supposed to get used
to working above a makeshift prison...

501
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,514
housing evil people with superpowers?

502
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,225
You'd be surprised
what you can get used to, Caitlin.

503
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,900
Caitlin.

504
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,903
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure. What's up?

505
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,990
It's about the night that Ronnie died.

506
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,120
- I...
- Look.

507
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,706
Cisco, I'm okay.

508
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,336
I thought coming down here
would undo me...

509
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,006
but thinking about
what Ronnie did to protect us...

510
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,593
it just made me love him more.

511
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,143
Come on. I need ice cream or a drink.

512
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,978
Let's see which one we hit first.

513
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,823
Joe's gonna be okay.

514
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,121
You know,
lately I've been thinking about mom.

515
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,958
A lot.

516
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,711
I miss her.

517
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,550
Did I ever tell you about the time
you learned to walk?

518
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,803
A couple of times.

519
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,264
Everyone was walking before you.

520
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,684
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood. Not you.

521
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,855
But your mom was never worried.
She just said, "He'll walk...

522
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,649
when he has some place to go."

523
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,694
And sure enough...

524
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:27,740
the first time you took a few steps,
you moved so quick, you didn't just walk.

525
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,953
- You started...
- To run.

526
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,999
And you ran to your mom, Barry.

527
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,837
Right into her arms.

528
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,260
You had some place to go.

529
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,607
I thought being the fastest man
alive would make my life easier.

530
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,067
That I could outrun anything.

531
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,907
Turns out no one can outrun pain.

532
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,575
Somebody, help! Please!

533
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,160
Life is tragic.

534
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,959
But it's also precious...

535
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,421
and sweet...

536
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,637
and extraordinary.

537
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,853
And the only way I know
to honor my mom's life...

538
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,481
IS to keep running.

539
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,086
Dr. Wells.

540
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,922
Dr. Wells, Ronnie did it.
He vented the system.

541
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,590
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

542
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,550
Good man.

543
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,552
I'm on my way down.

544
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,634
See you soon, Barry.

545
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:59,658
