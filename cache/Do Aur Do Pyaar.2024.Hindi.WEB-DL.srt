1
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,333
Love is like toothpaste...

2
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,516
Toothpaste?

3
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,266
Love... is like toothpaste?

4
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,749
Ever watched a couple
brushing their teeth together?

5
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,099
It's more intimate than sex!

6
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,141
Think about it.

7
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,349
Toothpaste in their mouths,

8
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,141
foam dripping everywhere...

9
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,974
no filters.

10
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,182
Like this?

11
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,974
What they're really saying is that,
'I'm not going anywhere.'

12
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,266
<i>Get lost!</i>

13
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,599
I look like a clown.

14
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,932
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere either.

15
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,307
Love and toothpaste...

16
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,807
maybe...

17
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:38,641
When the tube is new
we handle it with care...

18
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:41,599
we squeeze gently from the bottom.

19
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:44,557
We even fold the bottom
so the shape isn't ruined.

20
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,724
As time goes by...

21
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,141
we just end up pressing
and squeezing everywhere.

22
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,391
Wherever we spot a bit of toothpaste,
we go for it.

23
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:55,349
The poor tube stays half full,
bent and squeezed...

24
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:56,932
We could just throw the damn thing out.

25
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:57,849
Go buy a new one...

26
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:58,807
But we don't!

27
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,307
What if there's some left?

28
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,682
And there always is.

29
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:06,057
If we manage to find
the leftover toothpaste...

30
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,141
There's some paste here, yes...

31
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:12,016
There it is. There is something there.

32
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,042
Give me your hands, photographer!

33
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:31,016
So you're marrying her?

34
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,307
Just because she's pregnant?

35
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:37,974
You're the one who said

36
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,057
that it's time to move on.

37
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,307
Since when did you start listening to me?

38
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,641
Why are you throwing the keys?

39
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,667
This is not my home anymore.

40
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,974
This will always be your home, Rosie.

41
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,141
Then why did you take down my curtains?

42
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,224
Why did you change the locks?

43
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,599
I never wanted to leave you, Rosie.

44
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,932
That's why I'm the one who should leave.

45
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:25,516
I said...

46
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:28,641
that's why I'm the one
who should leave, Fawad.

47
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,057
What the heck, Anirudh!

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,209
Oh my god!

49
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:39,516
I'm trying my best, Nora.

50
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:40,849
I'm not an actor!

51
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,307
Also, I got totally drenched in the rain...

52
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,307
your beloved Salman Khan also catches
a cold now and then, doesn't he?

53
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,932
Ever seen Salman Khan sneeze?

54
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:58,849
Don't touch me!

55
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,682
It's just a cold.

56
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,891
You can't touch me because I'm a ghost.

57
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,099
You can't touch a ghost.

58
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:05,099
Don't you get it?

59
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,557
I see...

60
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,141
I see now, you're a ghost.

61
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,932
You haven't even read the script!

62
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,414
Why am I wasting my time with you?

63
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:16,037
I've told you so many
times that Rosie is dead.

64
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,141
She's just a ghost...

65
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,516
...a soul flowing through the house.

66
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:24,349
Why would a ghost need keys?

67
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:25,724
She could just float right in.

68
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,432
Come on, why are you getting angry?

69
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:37,641
You know how important
this audition is for me.

70
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,557
This could be my big break.

71
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:45,807
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:47,391
Really sorry.

73
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:54,391
Fine.

74
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,057
Badminton, wine stoppers, notice boards...

75
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:01,891
that's all people think
of when we say 'cork'.

76
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,682
It's the most misunderstood product.

77
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:08,807
Do you know, half the life
jackets in the world contain cork.

78
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:13,766
Also, if you spread a layer of just
5mm cork between the floors of a building,

79
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,016
you won't hear anything
from above and below.

80
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,057
Only 5mm cock, yes?

81
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,266
Just 5mm cock? It's enough?

82
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,182
It's how you use it, Nobu San.

83
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:37,182
If the EMI works out and
we can figure out the down payment...

84
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:39,849
What?

85
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,724
Sorry, I can't hear you.

86
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,974
We can think about it - can't we, Vik?

87
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,266
We're definitely not going back
to your New York apartment anytime soon.

88
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:53,266
Even that apartment is on rent, Kavs.

89
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,266
Buying a home is a serious commitment.

90
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,057
Why do you want to stay
in Bombay all your life?

91
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:00,849
It's a whole world out there.

92
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,307
Okay.

93
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:04,849
Just imagine...

94
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,724
we'll put up black and white
photos of your favourite things...

95
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:11,682
Me.

96
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:15,599
That famous staircase
photo from your book.

97
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,099
Your couch over there and

98
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,516
what if we paint the walls blue?

99
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,599
A blue wall?

100
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,349
What are we? Twelve?

101
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,391
It will complement
the color of the sea, Vik.

102
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,682
This sea is grey, Kavs.

103
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:32,682
Gutter-like grey!

104
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,057
It's still the sea!

105
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,557
And now Bombay is your home too.

106
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,641
Gutter-like grey!

107
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:42,141
The moisture ruins electric appliances.

108
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:45,099
People would die for this view

109
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,474
and you're worried about your blender?

110
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,849
I really like this apartment.

111
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,182
You are a <i>house</i>....

112
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,016
What?

113
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,141
You mean I'm a house?

114
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,141
I meant,

115
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:12,807
wherever you are, is home.

116
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,182
<i>Get lost, rascal!</i>

117
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,141
I love it when you swear in Tamil.

118
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:22,932
Sameer, the broker,
will be back in five minutes.

119
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,891
You know what I'm thinking?

120
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:27,141
About tea?

121
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:32,307
[speaking in Tamil]

122
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,932
Sorry, I got stuck at work.

123
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,016
Happy anniversary, Rosie darling.

124
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:02,849
I didn't get the role.

125
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:04,641
What do you mean?

126
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,599
They just said 'no' right away?
No callbacks?

127
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:08,307
There won't be any callback.

128
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,557
I fell off that stupid chair
in the middle of the audition!

129
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,349
It was so bloody humiliating.

130
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,432
Why does a ghost need a chair anyway?

131
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:19,057
Sorry...

132
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:20,432
I hope you didn't get hurt.

133
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:21,432
Of course I got hurt.

134
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:22,682
Where? Show me.

135
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:32,307
The girl from the silly Paan Masala ad...

136
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,849
that's all I'll ever be.

137
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,849
Everyone loves that commercial.

138
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:37,891
It's my favorite.

139
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:41,557
Dhishoom Paan Masala... A Storm is Coming.

140
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:43,682
Is it better?

141
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,016
Listen, can we cancel
the dinner reservation?

142
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:52,349
Please?

143
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,141
I was about to say the same.

144
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,807
We'll buy some eggplants on the way home.

145
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,766
And I'll make my grandmother's special

146
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,557
'Eggplant รก la poppy seeds' for you

147
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:02,682
Eggplant for our anniversary dinner?

148
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,182
You should try it once.

149
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,016
Easy...

150
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:09,099
Is it hurting very bad?

151
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:11,932
I hope there's no fracture.

152
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,891
Should we get an X-RAY?

153
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,807
Actually, I hurt my hand.

154
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:20,599
Not my foot.

155
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,099
You're such a fraud!

156
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:33,432
<i>โช What came to me in this dream โช</i>

157
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:37,349
-<i>โช Can I tell you?</i> โช
-Happy anniversary, Mr. Ani Banerjee.

158
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,599
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

159
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:44,766
<i>โช I've brought all my love โช</i>

160
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,349
<i>โช To your doorstep โช</i>

161
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,891
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

162
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,391
<i>โช Don't make me wait
Come to me just this once โช</i>

163
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:56,141
<i>โช Come and fall into my arms โช</i>

164
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:57,557
Where did you find this?

165
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:59,391
It was in your email.

166
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,557
From some college alumni group.

167
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:04,391
It's such a beautiful song.

168
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,391
I love it.

169
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,807
You sang so well.

170
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:11,641
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

171
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,391
It's all in the past,
from a different era.

172
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,349
By the way,
what were you doing in my inbox?

173
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:31,101
Why?

174
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,258
Are you hiding something from me?

175
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,550
Let's go find eggplants.

176
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,300
Forgot to buy milk again.

177
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,050
Hi.

178
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,967
Hey.

179
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:28,842
<i>Penguins are among the 3% of the rare
animal species that are monogamous</i>

180
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,217
<i>When a penguin finds its mate,
they stay together forever</i>

181
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,258
<i>and never look at another
member of the opposite sex.</i>

182
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,008
<i>Humans are not part of that little club.</i>

183
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:42,092
I'm vegan, so no milk.

184
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,508
<i>Like the other 97% of species,
humans are not monogamous...</i>

185
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,883
Not even milk?

186
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:51,217
<i>We just pretend that we are,
but we wish we were penguins.</i>

187
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,925
Animal-based products.

188
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:55,800
<i>...they stay together forever.</i>

189
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,675
<i>The male and female share everyday duties.</i>

190
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:03,300
<i>In fact, while waiting
for their partner to return...</i>

191
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,508
But your face wash has milk.

192
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,592
<i>...even years after they mate,
penguin couples dance excitedly.</i>

193
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:23,217
Wait a minute.

194
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,175
I'll buy some small garbage bags.

195
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:42,217
Couldn't hit the jackpot last night too?

196
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,967
Suction.

197
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,633
And he didn't even realize?

198
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,133
How would he?

199
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,967
You've been married for five years, Lata.

200
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,092
So?

201
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,342
He's only bothered about his own jackpot,

202
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,258
he gets lucky every night.

203
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,383
That's it.

204
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,175
I pretend a bit.

205
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,425
How will he know if you don't tell him?

206
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,217
You know, 90% of Indian
women have never had an org--

207
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,258
er... have never hit the jackpot.

208
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:09,967
This is why!

209
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,883
Because we never tell
the men what we want.

210
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,800
I can't live like that!

211
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:19,175
What's the point of living a lie?

212
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,675
A happier marriage.

213
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:26,925
I'd rather not buy a ticket
than win a false jackpot.

214
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:29,175
Done, Rama Aunty.

215
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:41,800
Aren't there people in Cuba?

216
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:43,342
Come with me.

217
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,883
We'll go look for people together.

218
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:02,050
Raise your chin.

219
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,467
There's no internet in Cuba.

220
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,425
No one will be able to find us.

221
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:13,508
We'll be like lost lovers in Cuba!

222
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:16,092
Even Cuba has internet now, madam.

223
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,883
You won't even come to Gurgaon with me.

224
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,300
Not Gurgaon, that's near Delhi.

225
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:26,467
You mean Goregaon.

226
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:30,133
Go-re-gaon!

227
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:34,800
Will you come to Go-re-gaon with me?

228
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:41,758
I'll just take this.

229
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,217
Yes?

230
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:54,258
Anti-allergens are in the bedside drawer.

231
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,300
120mg is fine.

232
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,342
Take 180mg then.

233
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,383
It won't kill you, Ani.

234
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,508
Bye.

235
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:36,258
Feeling insecure of
all this medicine talk?

236
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:42,425
You know this is all
we ever talk about now.

237
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,258
Allergy medicine, garbage bags,

238
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,758
AC temperature...

239
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,133
Please say something.

240
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,508
Why are we looking at houses

241
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:04,758
if you're still discussing
the air-conditioning with him?

242
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,508
He just needed his medicines.

243
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,383
He forgets everything.

244
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,633
What do you want me to do, Kavs?

245
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,300
I gave up my whole life
in New York just to be near you.

246
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,383
Now it's nearly two
years and we're still--

247
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,425
I just don't know how to tell him.

248
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:22,550
We've spent half our lives together.

249
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,425
You know you have to tell him sometime--

250
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,217
I know.

251
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,258
I have an appointment
with the lawyer tomorrow.

252
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,550
Won't cancel it this time.

253
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,592
What will you tell Mum, <i>Dada?</i>

254
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,592
I can't imagine our lives without Kavu.

255
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:04,800
Don't complicate things further, Aditi.

256
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,633
I just don't get you.

257
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:09,842
You had it all and...

258
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,108
still you had to go look for someone else?

259
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,275
Come on, it has nothing to do with Nora.

260
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:17,691
Sharing a bedroom is not marriage!

261
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,525
Then just get it over with.

262
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,775
Why are you wasting each other's time?

263
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,566
She's still young,
she can meet someone new,

264
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,358
have a family, kids.

265
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,233
You know she doesn't want kids.

266
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,275
Should I talk to her?

267
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,525
It will break her heart.

268
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:37,441
It's already broken, <i>Dada</i>.

269
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:39,191
She just doesn't know it yet.

270
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,025
Was it a love marriage?

271
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,150
Yes.

272
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:47,233
We eloped and got married.

273
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,983
A court marriage.

274
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:51,983
The first few years...

275
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,650
Ani and I were happily married.

276
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,150
Now, we're just married!

277
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:58,858
Why do you want a divorce?

278
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:02,483
You can be honest with me, Kavya.

279
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,608
Everything is confidential.

280
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,900
I'm on your side. Okay?

281
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,441
Yeah.

282
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,525
Has he done anything?

283
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,316
I mean, any form of abuse?

284
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,316
Abuse?

285
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:19,650
Never!

286
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:21,025
Any affairs?

287
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,358
Cheating?

288
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:23,901
Ani is not like that.

289
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:26,568
Kids?

290
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,420
No, I didn't want kids.

291
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,330
I even had an abortion.

292
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,837
Is there someone else in your life?

293
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:42,253
Whatever happened between us, Kavya...

294
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,837
She's your wife, Anirudh.

295
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,631
Not a one-night stand.

296
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:49,253
Show some respect!

297
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,083
Kavya...

298
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:56,712
How much?

299
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:57,712
Two hundred rupees.

300
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,003
Try again.

301
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,337
Don't need the flowers.
I will do it... hang on.

302
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:10,420
Kavya, thank you.

303
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,542
Thank you for the last twelve years.

304
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,208
Kavya, thank you.

305
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:23,170
Thank you for the last fifteen years.

306
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:27,253
We dated for three years
before we got married.

307
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:29,253
Yeah, whatever. Go on.

308
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,458
It's not your fault, Kavya.

309
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,378
It is my fault.

310
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:39,170
There's someone... by mistake,

311
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:40,462
I've fallen in love with.

312
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:46,959
So I'm a mistake?

313
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:50,462
I didn't mean that.

314
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:51,958
It's just...

315
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:56,837
Why didn't you meet me last night?

316
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:57,981
Where were you?

317
00:22:58,356 --> 00:22:59,314
In office.

318
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,189
I got done with work at 11 p.m.
I was very tired.

319
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,273
I dropped Mapuskar, went home and slept.

320
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:07,148
With her?

321
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:11,898
Not with her, beside her.

322
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:15,981
Come on, married people don't have sex.

323
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,064
This is crazy, Nora.

324
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:23,814
Don't call <i>me crazy</i>.

325
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:26,898
My life wasn't this
messed up until I met you.

326
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,814
Calling someone ten times a day...

327
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,064
that's not me.

328
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:34,898
In the last two years,
I've become a crazy wreck thanks to you.

329
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:36,189
You did this to me.

330
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:47,689
Wrong time of the month?

331
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:51,773
A woman is not defined by
her time of the month, Anirudh.

332
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:54,314
That's so bloody sexist!

333
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,189
No, I didn't mean that.

334
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,148
I'm seven days late. I think...

335
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,106
I think I'm pregnant.

336
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:06,939
Shit!

337
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:09,523
That's all you have to say?

338
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:13,398
Must be mine, right?

339
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:16,106
Get out of the car.

340
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,148
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

341
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,814
Get out of the car!

342
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:24,148
Nora, seriously? Here?

343
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:25,439
Go!

344
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:35,314
Grow a spine, Anirudh.

345
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:36,314
Tell her.

346
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:38,606
Otherwise it's over between us.

347
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:51,356
It's not goodbye.

348
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,148
It's thank you.

349
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:23,898
Anirudh doesn't know,
I'll tell him when I see him.

350
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,564
Don't know what?

351
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,356
Okay, bye. He's here.

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,291
Grandpa passed away

353
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,398
in his sleep this afternoon.

354
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:38,398
Grandpa?

355
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:44,439
Grandpa has been around
since time immemorial.

356
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:46,481
How old was he?

357
00:25:46,564 --> 00:25:47,439
God knows.

358
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:49,023
On his birthday last year,

359
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:51,064
we spent more on candles than on the cake.

360
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:57,981
Why flowers?

361
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,314
Just...

362
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,064
I'm taking the morning flight tomorrow,

363
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:09,773
the cremation is in the evening.

364
00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:11,773
Karthik will also reach by then.

365
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:15,356
Karthik is coming down from LA?

366
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:17,148
He was Grandpa's favorite.

367
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:22,773
Are you okay?

368
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:28,189
I don't know.

369
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,023
I've informed the cook,
she will come in early from tomorrow.

370
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:36,439
You just tell her what to cook.

371
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:42,606
Your phone is ringing.

372
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:44,523
It's okay.

373
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:51,148
I'll come with you... to Ooty.

374
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:52,939
Why?

375
00:26:55,023 --> 00:26:57,648
At a time like this,
we need to be together as a family.

376
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:00,606
That's exactly what I'm dreading.

377
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,564
My entire family.

378
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:05,689
Everybody. Together.

379
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:08,648
I'll come along.

380
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:18,439
But... why?

381
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:21,481
You're not a favorite there.

382
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:24,314
Neither are you.

383
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:30,231
Her grandfather... they were very close.

384
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:31,898
Poor thing was crying so much.

385
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:35,314
Ani... have you seen my charger?

386
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,648
This isn't the right
time to tell her, Nora.

387
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:42,398
There's been a death in the family.

388
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:04,148
Pulli!

389
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:06,273
Welcome!

390
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:10,856
Kavu Paapa, Mapillay (son-in-law) sir...

391
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,148
All well?

392
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:13,314
All okay.

393
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:14,648
Looking superb.

394
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:18,148
Has Pulli sent his son to receive us?

395
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:20,273
Come come!

396
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:27,773
Twelve years passed by in a flash,
isn't it?

397
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:32,106
You've put on some weight, Mapillay sir.

398
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:34,273
But you still look like a movie star.

399
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:38,148
You had a big fancy wedding in Bombay...

400
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,773
but didn't invite Pulli.

401
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:42,773
Because, the Ganeshans would've
disowned you too, like us.

402
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,023
Nobody even showed Pulli a photo.

403
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:48,398
Sir, did you wear one
of those weird Bengali hats?

404
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:49,814
Yes. Look ahead, now.

405
00:28:49,939 --> 00:29:00,314
<i>โช My careless heart has lost its way โช</i>

406
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,064
<i>โช And you... โช</i>

407
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:10,273
<i>โช You sit there cold,
you sit there selfish โช</i>

408
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:13,148
Mapillay sir, why weren't
you here for Shanthi's wedding?

409
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:17,189
Kaavya didn't have fun without you.

410
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:18,731
Always on her phone.

411
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:21,648
-<i>โช In these quiet dangling moments โช</i>
-Missing you too much.

412
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:28,148
<i>โช Our silences shout out loud โช</i>

413
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:34,189
<i>โช Remember my old address? โช</i>

414
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:39,314
<i>โช I am still right there, what about you? โช</i>

415
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,689
<i>โช If you can't come in โช</i>

416
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,314
<i>โช Then meet me as you go โช</i>

417
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,648
<i>โช We'll sing a song of empty words โช</i>

418
00:29:55,814 --> 00:29:57,898
<i>โช And sing it to me โช</i>

419
00:29:58,523 --> 00:30:01,064
Kavya, your lamp post!

420
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:06,856
Stop the car.

421
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:12,814
<i>โช I don't know what I'm looking for โช</i>

422
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:17,648
<i>โช But the spaces between us keep growing โช</i>

423
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:19,189
It's still bent...

424
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:20,856
From when you crashed
your scooter into it.

425
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:24,148
Hey, I just grazed it a bit.

426
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:27,564
This stupid lamp post was always bent.

427
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:30,523
The lamp-post was straight, Kavya.

428
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:34,023
You two abandoned the scooter and fled.

429
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,856
It was such a disaster!

430
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,814
Everyone blasted Pulli!

431
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:42,273
What do you eat Pulli?
You remember everything.

432
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:47,356
Remember- <i>โช All that I have dreamt ofโช</i>

433
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:49,106
<i>โช I want to tell you โช</i>

434
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:53,314
Kavya's song!
- <i>โช In these quiet dangling moments โช</i>

435
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,939
-<i>โช Our silences shout out loud โช</i>
-Pulli is so happy to see both of you together.

436
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,773
So many years...

437
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:02,314
you'd give me the slip after your classes...

438
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:06,314
Look ahead, Pulli.

439
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:14,356
<i>โช ...where are you? โช</i>

440
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:35,023
...what audacity.

441
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:37,439
The boy has come here for the first time.

442
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,731
This is the boy that Kavya ran away with...

443
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:54,884
Ma...

444
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:56,648
Kavya.

445
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:01,356
Kavya.

446
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:08,773
Dad.

447
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:11,189
Thanks for coming.

448
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,439
Good of you to come.

449
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:15,356
Of course.

450
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,856
I'm sorry for your loss, Uncle.

451
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,564
I mean... Appa.

452
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:26,523
Uncle Appa...

453
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,481
Appa Uncle?

454
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,106
Appam (pancakes)!

455
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:39,273
How is Grandpa?

456
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:40,398
Still dead.

457
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:41,731
Right.

458
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:44,606
He was a good man.

459
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:47,731
Even in his death, he gave us no trouble.

460
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:49,898
No trouble at all.

461
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:55,606
Ani, do you want to freshen up and change?

462
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:56,856
Come.

463
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,731
You didn't wear a <i>bindi</i>?

464
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:09,648
(Indistinct)

465
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,564
Can I see Grandpa?

466
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,398
What news of Karthik?

467
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:22,898
He is stuck in Frankfurt.

468
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:24,981
His connecting flight is delayed.

469
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,689
However long it takes,
we'll have to wait for him.

470
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:29,689
It's what Grandpa would have wanted.

471
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,606
Come here, Kavya.

472
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:53,689
Have you cried yet?

473
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:58,439
I really haven't had a moment alone,
Aunt Sudha.

474
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:07,348
The whole family
has been crying nonstop.

475
00:34:10,157 --> 00:34:11,837
You are here.

476
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:14,398
So good of you to come.

477
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:18,106
His spirit is still hovering....

478
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:21,023
waiting to land.

479
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,356
This is the happiest
I've seen Grandpa look.

480
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:34,064
It's good to cry.

481
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:35,689
It will come.

482
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:38,856
When it happens,
it's going to last for days.

483
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:42,814
And you too must cry

484
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,189
and ask for his forgiveness

485
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,148
for running away with his grand-daughter.

486
00:34:52,314 --> 00:34:54,231
Aunt Sudha, Aunt Meera, Aunt Lalitha...

487
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:56,564
Aunt Sudha, Aunt Meera, Aunt Lalitha...

488
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:04,106
Alone?

489
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,189
I thought you were a singer or something.

490
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:12,939
Didn't you have a band?

491
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:17,148
Everyone has a band in college.

492
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:20,023
Coolimuttam Ramakrishnan Surya.

493
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:21,148
Uncle Ramakrishnan's son.

494
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:24,231
You can call me C.R. Surya.

495
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,523
Okay, C.R. Surya.

496
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,189
Where is the washroom?

497
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,689
What are you doing?

498
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:55,606
I thought we are going to...

499
00:35:57,648 --> 00:35:58,564
What?

500
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:00,314
Get out.

501
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:04,606
Leave.

502
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:20,398
You hid Kavya in that
shady Elephanta Hotel?

503
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,523
Then smuggled her out
on a stolen motorcycle

504
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:25,189
and bought tickets to Bombay?

505
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:26,814
Who told you all this?

506
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:28,564
You're cool, man.

507
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,648
You stole a bike.

508
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:33,273
I didn't steal it!
And it was a scooter, not a bike.

509
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:37,856
How do you go from a man
like that to somebody who's into--

510
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:38,898
Cork!

511
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:40,648
It's cork. With an R!

512
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:42,064
R for rascal.

513
00:36:42,273 --> 00:36:43,856
Keep quiet for some time.

514
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:55,648
Potty?

515
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:58,148
Did you just relieve
yourself in Grandpa's toilet?

516
00:37:20,064 --> 00:37:23,023
I'm sorry for your loss,
<i>Appam (pancakes)!</i>

517
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:25,148
Really?

518
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:31,981
They still look at us the same way.

519
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:38,314
What could they be discussing?

520
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,064
That... Look at this Bengali's guts,

521
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:44,148
he's back with stolen goods.

522
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,856
Me? A stolen good?

523
00:37:58,148 --> 00:38:02,898
If I'd known Anirudh would
become so handsome after ten years,

524
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,106
I'd have never called
him a cheap musician.

525
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:17,398
Oh, he must look so good naked.

526
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:21,231
He would look so good on my hammock.

527
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:23,981
He'd recite Tagore's poems

528
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:26,939
while lying on the sunset orange cushions.

529
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:27,814
Sure.

530
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:32,314
All my aunts fantasize about you all day.

531
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:35,148
On sunset orange cushions.

532
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:49,314
(speaks in Tamil)

533
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:50,648
What?

534
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:53,939
Look at your shameless daughter laugh.

535
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:57,898
Is this a funeral or a wedding?

536
00:38:58,064 --> 00:39:00,898
What do you mean by 'your daughter'?

537
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:03,814
It's all your fault, Savitri.

538
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:08,356
If you hadn't been wearing
that sexy lingerie that night,

539
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:09,856
it wouldn't have come to this.

540
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,898
I was only wearing it. Who took it off?

541
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,148
By the way,
if you hadn't run away with me...

542
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:32,981
your photo would've been up here as well.

543
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:37,564
And I'd get my share
of this massive house too.

544
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,648
This relic is still here?

545
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,398
Does it even work now?

546
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:48,064
Who knows.

547
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:07,398
<i>[Old film song playing]</i>

548
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:15,939
Softly. They're sleeping.

549
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:20,898
I still remember all the moves!

550
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:23,314
Remember the video?

551
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:25,106
The lovers were dancing

552
00:40:25,148 --> 00:40:26,773
with malnourished cows in the background.

553
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:28,814
I know. Why cows?

554
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:32,773
Such simpler times.

555
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,689
Life was so easy.

556
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:38,148
Easy for you, you mean.

557
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,231
I risked my life every time
I came in through this window.

558
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,606
Why don't you change the frame?

559
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,773
Doesn't the bed feel small?

560
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:55,314
Has it been changed?

561
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:58,939
No.

562
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,356
It's the same one.

563
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,231
But I guess...

564
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:06,481
When did we ever sleep on it?

565
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:16,148
Kavya, you just got here...

566
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,876
don't start right away, please.

567
00:42:19,856 --> 00:42:21,106
You can fight later.

568
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:27,398
What did I do?

569
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:30,439
You never pick a side, Ma.

570
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:32,356
You didn't attend my wedding

571
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,523
but sent me your sari secretly.

572
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:38,731
Why are you so scared of him?

573
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:44,314
Kavya, do you know what
we were dealing with here?

574
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:47,959
Your father is such a
respected person in society

575
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:51,939
...so many questions.

576
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,106
Your father really loves you, Kavya.

577
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:58,606
You know that.

578
00:42:59,273 --> 00:43:00,689
He could have shown me some of his love.

579
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:02,731
You go to Karthik's house for Diwali,

580
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,814
fly eighteen hours straight every year.

581
00:43:04,898 --> 00:43:05,856
Every year!

582
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:08,814
Have you visited me even
once in the last twelve years?

583
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:10,898
And it's a two-hour flight to Bombay, Ma.

584
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:12,481
Fine.

585
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,425
Have you ever invited him?

586
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:17,023
I haven't told him not to come either.

587
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:23,155
Sometimes I really wish you both could see

588
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:25,148
how similar you both are.

589
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:28,773
Dad and I?

590
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,606
Yes.

591
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:30,856
No chance!

592
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,439
The director said,
he knew I was perfect for the role,

593
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:35,273
when I fell off that chair!

594
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:38,356
He was looking for that rawness, you know.

595
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:40,939
I told you, you'd get the role.

596
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:43,273
We'll celebrate once I'm back. Okay?

597
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:47,189
Hey, I just called to check how you were.

598
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:50,981
You're always sitting on my head.

599
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:52,356
What?

600
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:53,439
Really.

601
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:54,481
Always.

602
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:56,648
Say it in English?

603
00:43:57,356 --> 00:43:59,606
You are always on my mind.

604
00:44:01,523 --> 00:44:03,606
Stop murdering Hindi!

605
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:06,773
See, you're missing me too.

606
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,981
Of course I miss you.

607
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:13,273
You are also 'always sitting on my head'.

608
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:16,773
What about the pregnancy test?

609
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:18,981
Yeah, I got one.

610
00:44:19,648 --> 00:44:20,523
And?

611
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:23,148
I haven't taken it yet.

612
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:26,939
Look, Nora...

613
00:44:27,689 --> 00:44:29,148
no matter what, I'm there.

614
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:31,106
We'll figure it out. Okay?

615
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:33,273
Hey, photographer...

616
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:34,481
Hey, dentist.

617
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,273
Do you think I'm bull-headed?

618
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:38,689
Bull-headed means...

619
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:42,106
stubborn, right?

620
00:44:42,273 --> 00:44:43,689
Not bad. Full marks.

621
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,523
I mean nobody can tell
you what to do but...

622
00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:49,231
Bull-headed?

623
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:51,189
Never.

624
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:52,829
I listen, don't I?

625
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,167
I'm open-minded, right?

626
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:57,814
Sure, you listen but then

627
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,939
you go ahead and do exactly what you want.

628
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:04,106
Otherwise we'd have been
on a beach in Cuba by now,

629
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:05,856
sipping on coconut rum.

630
00:45:06,023 --> 00:45:07,898
Really, Ani? Really?

631
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:10,981
What will we do if it's positive?

632
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:12,814
How will we figure it out?

633
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,209
And if it's negative?

634
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:16,314
What then?

635
00:45:16,395 --> 00:45:18,311
If it's negative, we'll do nothing.

636
00:45:18,606 --> 00:45:19,481
Exactly.

637
00:45:19,898 --> 00:45:21,231
That is what I'm scared of.

638
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:23,856
We'll keep doing 'nothing' forever.

639
00:45:25,648 --> 00:45:28,523
I just don't like it here.

640
00:45:29,314 --> 00:45:30,606
You want me to come there?

641
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:32,398
Yeah, right.

642
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,125
Then this will become my funeral as well.

643
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,333
Huh..You'll say nothing
and refuse to listen.

644
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,231
Is there any coffee left?

645
00:45:41,898 --> 00:45:42,731
No.

646
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:51,148
It's cold.

647
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:55,481
At least both of you are still together...

648
00:45:56,148 --> 00:45:57,273
Happy to see that.

649
00:45:57,731 --> 00:45:58,981
What? Why?

650
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,273
We thought this boy was a phase,

651
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:04,939
like when you had chopped off your hair.

652
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:05,648
Remember?

653
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:07,523
You thought our marriage was a phase?

654
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,023
Akka (Sister),

655
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:12,314
when did you realize that he's the one?

656
00:46:12,398 --> 00:46:13,648
I don't remember.

657
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,981
You broke off ties with
the entire family for him

658
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:19,106
and you don't remember?

659
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:24,356
He doesn't look like the
'love at first sight' type.

660
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:27,148
Hey, CRS... you should see me in a tuxedo.

661
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:29,731
Tell us, Akka.

662
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:31,689
Let me tell you my version.

663
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:33,481
It was raining heavily.

664
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:37,898
Kavya forcefully locked
me in Grandpa's study...

665
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,792
then she leapt up on
Grandpa's mahogany study table

666
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,875
and with a swift swish of her hand,
threw all the books on the floor!

667
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:48,023
She wore the stethoscope
and called me seductively...

668
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:50,773
like this... like this...

669
00:46:50,856 --> 00:46:52,523
Obviously he's joking.

670
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,148
Fine. I'll tell you what really happened.

671
00:46:58,523 --> 00:47:01,356
On graduation day,
Dr. Kavya Ganeshan picked me up

672
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:03,009
on Grandpa's scooter.

673
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:03,965
Everyone knows.

674
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:06,939
Then you went to Hotel Elephanta
and broke that lamp post

675
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:07,856
and sang for her.

676
00:47:07,939 --> 00:47:09,273
She was driving the scooter?

677
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:10,439
Yes.

678
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:13,564
And then we ordered beer and onion rings.

679
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:17,356
With the last onion ring,
she came to me and...

680
00:47:20,814 --> 00:47:22,189
What are you saying?

681
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:24,023
She proposed to you?

682
00:47:24,148 --> 00:47:25,064
Obviously.

683
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:26,273
What a badass!

684
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,106
What did you do?

685
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:30,523
He ate the ring...

686
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:31,564
with chilli sauce!

687
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:35,356
Karthik's flight is landing at midnight.

688
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:38,314
Anirudh was telling us a story.

689
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,314
It's a great story, Uncle.

690
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,773
On graduation day,
when Kavu akka became a doctor--

691
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:43,814
Dentist.

692
00:47:44,773 --> 00:47:45,856
She's a dentist.

693
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:59,542
Uncle, do you know whose
teeth she worked on last week?

694
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:01,898
Who?

695
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:03,393
The famous Amitabh Bachchan.

696
00:48:03,477 --> 00:48:04,352
Wow!

697
00:48:04,663 --> 00:48:06,622
The most valuable set of teeth in India.

698
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:08,102
Does Jaya Bachchan also accompany him?

699
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:10,893
What about his daughter-in-law Aishwarya?

700
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:13,227
Do her teeth also need cleaning?

701
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:14,518
And superstar Rajinikanth?

702
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,310
He doesn't need any dentist.

703
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,227
He cleans his teeth with dynamite!

704
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,060
Poothankurissi Doraiswamy Ramaiyer,

705
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:28,893
left for heaven at 2:47 p.m.

706
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:30,602
Heavenly abode, sir.

707
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,310
Okay.

708
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,727
Poothankurissi Doraiswamy Ramaiyer,

709
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:38,977
left for his heavenly abode at 2:47 p.m.

710
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,560
on Saturday afternoon.

711
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:43,768
His medical legacy
is being carried forward by

712
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:45,810
his three sons, two daughters

713
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:47,935
and nine grandchildren.

714
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,435
Please specify - eight
doctors and one dentist.

715
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:52,768
Don't write that.

716
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,268
Use your common sense.
Are you an idiot?

717
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,268
So no dentist?

718
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,393
Yes, dentist.

719
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:03,477
Kavya, go and see if
Aunt Sudha wants more coffee.

720
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:04,893
How much more coffee will she drink?

721
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:07,102
Let her make her own coffee!
I'm not going anywhere.

722
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,893
See, no respect for elders!

723
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,435
What is this obsession with respect, Appa?

724
00:49:12,518 --> 00:49:13,977
There are other kind
of feelings too, you know.

725
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,810
This fixation with 'respect',

726
00:49:15,893 --> 00:49:18,060
has left no space
in your heart for 'love'.

727
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:19,602
We are not disrespecting anyone.

728
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:20,643
Excuse me!

729
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:22,643
This is between my daughter and me.

730
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,393
-What--
-Sir...

731
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,810
I can come back later.

732
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:27,435
Where are you going?
Sit down.

733
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:31,310
Can I copy-paste my Grandma's obituary?

734
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,685
-She was also a nurse...
-He sells corks.

735
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:34,977
Why are you asking him?

736
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,143
Why?
Can't Ani have an opinion?

737
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:39,393
He's part of the family
whether you like it or not.

738
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,768
Savitri, please tell your daughter
that this is not the time and place to--

739
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:44,268
Talk to me.
I'm standing right in front of you.

740
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:45,935
-Lower your voice.
-I will not!

741
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:46,893
Lower!

742
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:50,102
Have you ever listened to me?

743
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:51,560
This is why I shout.

744
00:49:52,227 --> 00:49:53,893
Both of you stop this.

745
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,560
We have guests at home.

746
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:58,102
I still can't understand
how selfish you still are.

747
00:49:58,352 --> 00:50:00,102
Why has the family gathered here?

748
00:50:00,643 --> 00:50:01,685
For Grandpa.

749
00:50:01,893 --> 00:50:04,893
Why is Karthik struggling to get here?

750
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,560
For Grandpa.

751
00:50:08,727 --> 00:50:10,102
But, congratulations.

752
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:13,102
You somehow managed to make
even <i>this</i> about yourself.

753
00:50:13,268 --> 00:50:14,102
Good!

754
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:18,727
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some arrangements to make.

755
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:20,768
Sure, just walk away.

756
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,102
What else can you do?

757
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,102
Kavya...

758
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:35,602
Kavya. Kavya.

759
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:45,352
Give me the keys.

760
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:49,560
Pulli will get reprimanded, Kavu paapa.

761
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,852
Go slow, Ganeshan.
What are you doing?

762
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:52,685
Why don't you get off?

763
00:50:52,768 --> 00:50:53,893
Okay, look in front.

764
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:06,352
What's wrong with cork?

765
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,060
Exactly.
This is my sales pitch.

766
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:10,602
Cork never sinks.

767
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:12,810
It is light but sturdy.

768
00:51:12,977 --> 00:51:16,477
Come hail, come storm,
it's impossible to make it sink.

769
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:18,560
The thing about cork is...

770
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,018
Ani, please!

771
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,018
Err...Ganeshan, where are we headed?

772
00:51:25,727 --> 00:51:26,727
Fine...

773
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:39,893
Welcome home, Ganeshan.

774
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:55,227
Thank God you came, Banerjee.

775
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:57,477
Even after all these years, Appa still...

776
00:51:58,102 --> 00:52:00,102
-I just don't get--
-Let it be.

777
00:52:01,893 --> 00:52:05,435
That grumpy Poothankuresi
Ramaiyer Ganeshan will never change.

778
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:20,560
For whatever it's worth,

779
00:52:20,685 --> 00:52:21,977
I'm proud of you, Ganeshan.

780
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,060
I'm proud of you too, Banerjee.

781
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,560
Me?

782
00:52:28,102 --> 00:52:29,602
What have I achieved?

783
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:31,560
You... survived.

784
00:52:32,685 --> 00:52:33,935
One needs guts for that, Banerjee.

785
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,685
You gave up your music and dreams

786
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,310
to take care of your family.

787
00:52:39,602 --> 00:52:42,268
You took care of your sisters,
took care of your dad's business.

788
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:45,560
I wouldn't have been able to do all this.

789
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:48,310
Dad had done so much for us....

790
00:52:49,268 --> 00:52:50,893
And then he was suddenly... gone.

791
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:55,768
This stupid cork company was his legacy.

792
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,060
It was his name on the board.

793
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:02,268
This is all I can do, Ganeshan...

794
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:03,768
taking care of things.

795
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:07,893
Thank God.

796
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:11,060
-Thank you.
-Welcome, sir.

797
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,963
That doesn't sound romantic but...

798
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:15,505
it's not nothing.

799
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,041
You miss dad a lot, don't you?

800
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:23,463
If he were here today,

801
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:25,547
he, too, would have
been very proud of you.

802
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:37,213
Don't spoil the mood
with a bad joke. Please.

803
00:53:37,713 --> 00:53:39,130
This time it was really good.

804
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,126
You mean, a <i>good</i> bad joke?

805
00:53:50,422 --> 00:53:53,047
God, my head is reeling.

806
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:57,672
I'd forgotten how much
we used to laugh together.

807
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:01,172
And I'd forgotten how
easy it was to make you laugh.

808
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:12,922
Keep it in your pocket. Quick.

809
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,130
Mend your ways, Banerjee.

810
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:15,172
We are forty now.

811
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:17,963
Thirty-eight... don't kill the mood.

812
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,463
Don't fight now.

813
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:22,422
We don't fight, Banerjee.

814
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:31,797
There was a time when
we fought over everything.

815
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:34,672
We fought with your family.

816
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:36,213
We fought to get married.

817
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:37,213
Correct.

818
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:38,963
We fought to get the house.

819
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:41,422
We'd fight over every little thing.

820
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:45,172
Now I don't even remember
when we fought last.

821
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,547
Why don't we fight anymore?

822
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:51,797
Are you upset because we don't fight?

823
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Of course.

824
00:54:54,797 --> 00:54:55,838
One should fight.

825
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,088
Fights keep a relationship alive.

826
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,672
We stopped talking.
We stopped fighting.

827
00:55:04,755 --> 00:55:06,297
We stopped having sex.

828
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,213
Banerjee.

829
00:55:27,213 --> 00:55:28,213
Oh no.

830
00:55:29,005 --> 00:55:30,755
This look of yours is very dangerous.

831
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:34,255
Last time you looked at me this way,
we eloped and got married.

832
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:38,838
What is it going to be this time,
Banerjee?

833
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:57,922
<i>โช Without you, my love โช</i>

834
00:55:58,005 --> 00:55:59,672
<i>โช I will die... โช</i>

835
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:02,088
<i>โช Come to me, you're my life โช</i>

836
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:04,547
<i>โช Without you, my love โช</i>

837
00:56:04,713 --> 00:56:06,297
<i>โช I will die... โช</i>

838
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,880
<i>โช Come to me, you're my life โช</i>

839
00:56:09,755 --> 00:56:12,797
<i>โช I had to come to you, my love โช</i>

840
00:56:12,922 --> 00:56:16,047
<i>โช My heart led you to me โช</i>

841
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,047
<i>โช Without you, my love โช</i>

842
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,713
<i>โช I will die... โช</i>

843
00:56:19,797 --> 00:56:22,172
<i>โช Come to me, you're my life โช</i>

844
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:26,130
<i>โช I had to come to you, my love โช</i>

845
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:29,630
<i>โช My heart led you to me โช</i>

846
00:56:29,713 --> 00:56:32,922
<i>โช I had to come to you, my love โช</i>

847
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:36,380
<i>โช My heart led you to me โช</i>

848
00:56:53,255 --> 00:56:59,463
<i>โช I know very well, my love โช</i>

849
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:06,380
<i>โช The road ahead will be difficult โช</i>

850
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:09,963
<i>โช We will overcome these
difficulties with a smile โช</i>

851
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:12,380
<i>โช Come to me, my love โช</i>

852
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:16,463
<i>โช I had to come to you, my love โช</i>

853
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,672
<i>โช My heart led you to me โช</i>

854
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,338
Relax, Ganeshan.

855
00:57:25,713 --> 00:57:27,755
No one will steal that old scooter.

856
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,630
Pulli will get it. Don't worry.

857
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:42,672
Ganeshan.

858
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,172
We always see a full moon in films.

859
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:52,130
How come we got stuck with half a moon?

860
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:55,338
You know, Banerjee...

861
00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:00,505
As a child,
I thought I was the moon's favorite.

862
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:08,213
And that's why it always
keeps an eye on me.

863
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:11,713
You know, like...

864
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:15,880
my personal...

865
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:20,047
Personal spotlight.

866
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:24,630
Banerjee,

867
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:25,630
Climb up.

868
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:27,422
Climb up.

869
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,630
Banerjee.

870
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:39,547
Climb down.

871
00:58:43,338 --> 00:58:44,130
Hands up!

872
00:58:44,422 --> 00:58:45,838
Don't shoot, Ganeshan.

873
00:59:01,463 --> 00:59:04,213
Why are we sneaking into the house?

874
00:59:07,338 --> 00:59:08,755
Slow...

875
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:18,422
Ganeshan.

876
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,880
This is how it feels to
enter through the front door

877
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,297
like an official son-in-law!

878
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:27,380
Mapillay sir.

879
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:39,005
What are you doing, Ganeshan?

880
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,630
People might wake up.

881
00:59:43,422 --> 00:59:45,172
We're now allowed to do this, right?

882
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,917
What is allowed Banerjee? What is allowed?

883
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:56,005
What is allowed?

884
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:04,422
Kavya!

885
01:00:13,922 --> 01:00:14,838
Appa.

886
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:16,130
Karthik?

887
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:18,672
Kavya?

888
01:00:20,005 --> 01:00:21,213
What's going on?

889
01:00:33,819 --> 01:00:37,944
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mumbai's
Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.</i>

890
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:40,152
<i>You may now use your mobile phones.</i>

891
01:00:40,777 --> 01:00:45,777
<i>The seatbelt sign is still switched on,
for your safety.</i>

892
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:49,652
Just landed.

893
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,319
I know.

894
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,985
Ani, relax.

895
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:02,777
I'm not stalking you.

896
01:01:03,277 --> 01:01:05,235
I can hear the flight announcements.

897
01:01:06,694 --> 01:01:07,777
Of course.

898
01:01:10,485 --> 01:01:12,652
I'm just tired.

899
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,194
Is it okay if we meet tomorrow?

900
01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:19,319
I've made fish curry for you.

901
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,319
Can I have it tomorrow, please?

902
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,735
Just landed.

903
01:01:25,777 --> 01:01:27,694
The flight was really delayed.

904
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,360
Is it okay if we meet tomorrow?

905
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:36,777
What about the test...?

906
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,069
Negative.

907
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,569
Let's cook something.

908
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:14,902
You just need an excuse...

909
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,485
This is the only vegan dish I know.

910
01:02:25,927 --> 01:02:27,219
I'll make the rice.

911
01:02:38,136 --> 01:02:38,844
Coming up...

912
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:42,969
my grandmother's famous recipe...

913
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,761
Eggplant la poppy seeds.

914
01:02:50,677 --> 01:02:53,386
Oh, the joy of <i>posto</i> (poppy seeds)...

915
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:56,552
You'll miss it when I stop making it.

916
01:02:58,344 --> 01:02:59,719
Who misses eggplants?

917
01:03:31,302 --> 01:03:32,136
Drink?

918
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:33,552
Bad idea.

919
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:43,552
While cooking <i>posto</i>,
the trick lies in the timing.

920
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,875
What a strange name... <i>posto</i>.

921
01:03:49,136 --> 01:03:52,511
Like a sexy way of saying 'come here'.

922
01:03:53,261 --> 01:03:54,386
Posto...

923
01:03:57,844 --> 01:03:59,719
It sounds like a French name, ignoramus!

924
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:04,677
Oh, gourmet chef Banerjee.

925
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:06,594
I get it.

926
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,719
Cooking aubergine!

927
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:14,969
General Posto.

928
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:21,511
General Posto...

929
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:58,292
I'm starving.

930
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:01,719
Me too.

931
01:05:14,594 --> 01:05:16,427
Chilli sauce makes everything better.

932
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,042
Sometimes you don't realize
how much you miss something

933
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,291
till you have it again.

934
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:36,594
What?

935
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:54,011
Are vegans allowed
to eat chicken after sex?

936
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,625
How come you suddenly turned vegan?

937
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:12,802
Do you know Chicken
65 originated in Tamil Nadu?

938
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:17,708
It used to be item number 65
on the menu of a popular restaurant.

939
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:19,761
It had a complicated name,

940
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,719
so people started calling it Chicken 65.

941
01:06:23,052 --> 01:06:23,886
Cool, isn't it?

942
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:25,469
Come on.

943
01:06:25,927 --> 01:06:27,636
You guys are always taking
credit for everything.

944
01:06:28,802 --> 01:06:31,011
Kabaddi, <i>murukku</i>, Sridevi, Rajinikanth...

945
01:06:31,136 --> 01:06:34,844
Hey, Rajinikanth is a Tamil superstar!

946
01:06:35,386 --> 01:06:38,052
-Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, he's a Maharashtrian.
-Yeah, whatever.

947
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,001
Beer is not good for health.

948
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,208
We should only order wine.

949
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,209
Do you even like wine?

950
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:54,719
Then?

951
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:00,250
Cheers!

952
01:07:00,386 --> 01:07:01,261
Beers!

953
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:09,511
Sir, there's a Ms. Rosie here to meet you.

954
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:12,000
I told her you're busy, but she insisted.

955
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:19,594
You look busy.
Should I come back?

956
01:07:21,677 --> 01:07:22,469
Come.

957
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:25,302
Please come.

958
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:31,969
What are you doing here?

959
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,344
What are YOU doing here?

960
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:35,886
This is my office...

961
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,719
And why are you in office?

962
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:41,083
You said you'd meet
me right after you return.

963
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,261
Your phone was off all bloody night!

964
01:07:44,844 --> 01:07:45,677
Come.

965
01:07:45,969 --> 01:07:47,219
Please come.

966
01:07:49,344 --> 01:07:50,219
This way.

967
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:57,511
Try to understand, Nora.

968
01:07:57,802 --> 01:08:00,552
Her grandfather has passed away.
They were very close

969
01:08:00,636 --> 01:08:03,761
Where did this grandfather
suddenly come from?

970
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,250
Never heard of him before!

971
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:10,344
Why would we discuss
my wife's grandfather?

972
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,638
Oh, so now she's your 'wife'?

973
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,261
She has always been my wife.

974
01:08:20,886 --> 01:08:22,719
Nora, listen...

975
01:08:33,386 --> 01:08:34,427
Let's go watch a film.

976
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:38,261
What?

977
01:08:39,594 --> 01:08:40,427
You and me.

978
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,125
Like a proper date.

979
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:48,719
Let's watch a film today.

980
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:57,219
Fine.

981
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,136
My favorite photographer.

982
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:07,886
My missing dentist.

983
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:09,761
The door, please.

984
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:19,052
All okay?

985
01:09:20,136 --> 01:09:23,386
My family can get a bit much but...

986
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:26,802
I'm just tired.

987
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,167
No one sees me this way.

988
01:09:33,886 --> 01:09:35,511
You just make me look so...

989
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:38,011
You are beautiful.

990
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,084
Come to New York with me.

991
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,636
New York? Now?

992
01:09:43,844 --> 01:09:44,802
In three weeks.

993
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,068
It's Diwali in three weeks, Vik.

994
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,833
There's always something. Isn't there?

995
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,427
The lawyer has sent the papers.

996
01:10:13,136 --> 01:10:15,261
I can't believe that
we're actually on a date.

997
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,084
Like a normal couple.

998
01:10:20,886 --> 01:10:22,552
...wearing normal clothes.

999
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,719
You looked like a
fire engine this morning...

1000
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:37,136
I wish something bad happens to her.

1001
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:42,886
Who? Kavya?

1002
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:46,459
I don't want her to come
under a bus or anything...

1003
01:10:46,636 --> 01:10:48,052
but you know...

1004
01:10:49,469 --> 01:10:52,136
if she were to get chicken
pox for a couple of months...

1005
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,876
or if her doctor dad were
to go to jail for tax fraud.

1006
01:11:01,542 --> 01:11:03,625
Must you go back tonight?

1007
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:07,886
Not at all.

1008
01:11:11,969 --> 01:11:15,469
I'll call and tell her that
I'll be working late tonight.

1009
01:11:18,844 --> 01:11:21,927
If it's mutual consent,
the Judge will send you to a counselor.

1010
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:25,583
Then there's the 12-18 weeks period.

1011
01:11:25,969 --> 01:11:27,677
Here I think they call it the...

1012
01:11:28,677 --> 01:11:29,719
'harmony period'?

1013
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:31,052
...something like that.

1014
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:34,136
How many marriages have you ruined?

1015
01:11:34,469 --> 01:11:35,344
I do my homework.

1016
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:42,136
Kavya, it's okay to cheat you know.

1017
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,719
Put some cheese on your salad if you want.

1018
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:45,958
I'll still love you.

1019
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:47,844
<i>Get lost!</i>

1020
01:11:54,802 --> 01:11:57,011
I'll probably need to take this.

1021
01:11:58,344 --> 01:11:59,261
It's Mum.

1022
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:00,719
What's up?

1023
01:12:01,219 --> 01:12:02,386
Why are you speaking in Tamil?

1024
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:03,344
Actually...

1025
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,302
be quick.

1026
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:07,802
Sorry, Ganeshan.

1027
01:12:08,302 --> 01:12:10,302
I will be working late today.

1028
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:15,584
I have to close the Japanese deal.

1029
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:19,148
I'll eat with Mapuskar
and spend the night here.

1030
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:21,719
Okay, sure.

1031
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,136
Remember Lata from my clinic?

1032
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,136
It's her birthday today.

1033
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:31,344
We're planning a surprise for her.

1034
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:33,386
I'll eat here as well.

1035
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:34,802
Okay.

1036
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,250
So what's there for dinner?

1037
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:42,719
We'll probably order Chinese food.

1038
01:12:43,469 --> 01:12:44,302
Oh nice.

1039
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:45,802
So will we.

1040
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,511
Chicken 65?

1041
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:49,761
That's a good idea.

1042
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:52,052
Chicken 65 is the best idea.

1043
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:55,844
Wasn't it delicious the last time?

1044
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:03,552
You know what...

1045
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,625
I think it was the best
Chicken 65 of our lives.

1046
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:08,761
Really?

1047
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,136
We've had better, haven't we?

1048
01:13:14,594 --> 01:13:15,719
Let's have it again.

1049
01:13:16,427 --> 01:13:17,302
Sure.

1050
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,625
This time it might be even better...

1051
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:01,802
Hi.

1052
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:31,177
So...

1053
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:37,261
Mapuskar let you leave?

1054
01:14:38,302 --> 01:14:39,761
And Lata's birthday?

1055
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:42,667
It's past midnight...

1056
01:14:45,511 --> 01:14:46,761
Happy Birthday, Lata!

1057
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:55,750
Banerjee...

1058
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,833
I look different now, don't I?

1059
01:15:02,552 --> 01:15:03,386
What do you mean?

1060
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,417
I've changed, haven't I?

1061
01:15:09,902 --> 01:15:11,319
Your temper is not as bad.

1062
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:13,719
I mean in the way I look...

1063
01:15:14,796 --> 01:15:16,463
You saw me now, right?...

1064
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,665
I see you everyday.

1065
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:20,625
Not this way...

1066
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,684
My laugh lines are visible now...

1067
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,667
Look closely.

1068
01:15:37,823 --> 01:15:38,990
They are visible.

1069
01:15:42,844 --> 01:15:44,552
That means I'm looking old.

1070
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:45,833
No.

1071
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,708
It means you like to laugh a lot.

1072
01:15:54,886 --> 01:15:55,677
And me?

1073
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,719
You?

1074
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,261
You haven't changed a bit.

1075
01:16:06,221 --> 01:16:08,638
You still make the same sound when you...

1076
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,109
you know, when you...

1077
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:16,500
What sound?

1078
01:16:20,052 --> 01:16:22,886
When you get very excited, you...

1079
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:25,761
make sound like...

1080
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:34,416
Just like a pressure cooker.

1081
01:16:36,886 --> 01:16:39,261
Which pressure cooker
in the world sounds like that?

1082
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:42,594
Since when does all this make you angry?

1083
01:16:42,677 --> 01:16:44,261
I don't make these sounds at all.

1084
01:16:53,469 --> 01:16:54,469
Maybe...

1085
01:16:55,719 --> 01:16:57,927
like an electric kettle...

1086
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:10,719
<i>โช What will it say, what will it do... โช</i>

1087
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:12,927
<i>โช Without a care in the world โช</i>

1088
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:16,136
<i>โช This heart is indeed a fool โช</i>

1089
01:17:17,636 --> 01:17:19,719
<i>โช It'll go to that place โช</i>

1090
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,052
<i>โช It's told not to chase โช</i>

1091
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:25,427
<i>โช You see this fool โช</i>

1092
01:17:26,136 --> 01:17:28,427
<i>โช Writing paper tales โช</i>

1093
01:17:28,552 --> 01:17:31,469
<i>โช Singing out of tune scales โช</i>

1094
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:34,427
<i>โช Of forgotten days โช</i>

1095
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:38,969
<i>โช This spoilt, little child โช</i>

1096
01:17:39,052 --> 01:17:43,511
<i>โช Just wants to run wild
And it does what it wants โช</i>

1097
01:17:43,594 --> 01:17:45,552
<i>โช This foolish heart... โช</i>

1098
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,958
Are you having an affair?

1099
01:17:51,344 --> 01:17:52,719
Remember Lata from my clinic?

1100
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:54,011
It's her birthday.

1101
01:17:54,092 --> 01:17:56,217
We're planning a surprise for her.
I'll eat dinner with them.

1102
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:58,052
I'll be working very late...

1103
01:17:58,427 --> 01:18:00,719
have to close the Japanese deal.

1104
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:02,219
I'll eat with Mapuskar.

1105
01:18:11,594 --> 01:18:13,761
<i>โช This foolish heart... โช</i>

1106
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,552
<i>โช This foolish heart... โช</i>

1107
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:25,219
Can we take it from the top, please?

1108
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:29,886
...we're all running.

1109
01:18:29,969 --> 01:18:31,302
Running from ourselves.

1110
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:33,011
Running from our lives.

1111
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,584
Only the city stands still.

1112
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:40,802
Photographer Vikram Sehgal
captures this stillness in the...

1113
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:44,167
Kavya?

1114
01:18:47,052 --> 01:18:47,969
Kavya.

1115
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:49,927
What happened?

1116
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,458
You fell asleep. Again.

1117
01:18:55,886 --> 01:18:57,719
No, I was listening...

1118
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,875
just shut my eyes for a bit.

1119
01:19:00,177 --> 01:19:03,594
I've just been so tired
these past few days.

1120
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:06,552
Please read. I'm listening.

1121
01:19:07,344 --> 01:19:08,969
What was the last thing you heard?

1122
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:13,469
That bit about running.

1123
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:15,917
How running is good for health

1124
01:19:16,136 --> 01:19:21,052
and everyone must run these days...

1125
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,542
Affair? With who?

1126
01:19:23,469 --> 01:19:24,302
With my wife?

1127
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:25,302
Are you?

1128
01:19:26,844 --> 01:19:28,469
You won't believe it, Nora...

1129
01:19:29,469 --> 01:19:31,219
I'm playing football with the Japanese.

1130
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:32,177
Football?

1131
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:33,761
Since when did you start
playing football, Ani?

1132
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,719
Yes, Takashi... Pass...

1133
01:19:35,886 --> 01:19:39,011
Arigato.

1134
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:40,511
Nobu San...

1135
01:19:40,636 --> 01:19:44,636
[makes up some Japanese words]

1136
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,177
Aannnddd Goal!

1137
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:47,761
-Ani?
-I'll call you back.

1138
01:19:47,844 --> 01:19:49,844
<i>โช This foolish heart โช</i>

1139
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:58,594
<i>โช This foolish heart โช</i>

1140
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:18,636
His monstrous claws appear after sunset.

1141
01:20:19,302 --> 01:20:22,136
Don't scream! Or they'll wake up

1142
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:33,708
Let me get this straight...

1143
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:37,583
First, you cheated on your wife
with your mistress.

1144
01:20:37,802 --> 01:20:39,386
Don't call her a 'mistress.'

1145
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:40,750
I detest that word!

1146
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:44,011
And now you're cheating on your mistress

1147
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,125
with your wife?

1148
01:20:45,344 --> 01:20:46,844
Stop calling her a 'mistress.'

1149
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:50,011
I really don't know what to do, Aditi.

1150
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:52,750
Just tell her that you're
in love with someone else, dada.

1151
01:20:53,927 --> 01:20:56,677
I wish I knew who to say this to.

1152
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,333
Just give me a minute.

1153
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:25,964
May I speak to Dr. Ganeshan please?

1154
01:21:26,045 --> 01:21:27,003
Dr. Ganeshan?

1155
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:29,500
She has already left for the day.
Can I take a message?

1156
01:21:30,247 --> 01:21:31,913
No. Thank you.

1157
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:36,177
<i>The number you're calling is unavailable...</i>

1158
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:40,136
Excuse me.

1159
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:42,844
Could you please step aside?

1160
01:22:43,261 --> 01:22:44,427
This is my spot.

1161
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:49,250
I mean I live here.
That's my space.

1162
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,208
Floor?

1163
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:44,594
Same.

1164
01:24:00,412 --> 01:24:01,871
Diwali is special, isn't it?

1165
01:24:40,761 --> 01:24:42,677
Hasn't Diwali arrived early this year?

1166
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:51,000
Let's spend Diwali by ourselves this time.

1167
01:24:52,011 --> 01:24:53,386
Like old times.

1168
01:24:57,344 --> 01:24:59,219
Am I dying, Ganeshan?

1169
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:03,344
Hiding my blood reports from me?

1170
01:25:10,177 --> 01:25:15,636
<i>โช Let's go, You and Me โช</i>

1171
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:22,386
<i>โช To that open sky where we โช</i>

1172
01:25:22,594 --> 01:25:25,844
<i>โช Can spread our wings like birds โช</i>

1173
01:25:26,386 --> 01:25:32,469
<i>โช Let's see if we can wrap
ourselves into the night โช</i>

1174
01:25:34,552 --> 01:25:39,802
<i>โช In a blanket of stars โช</i>

1175
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:45,136
<i>โช And sing tara tara ta โช</i>

1176
01:25:45,261 --> 01:25:46,386
Ganeshan,

1177
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:50,802
your moon is still stalking you.

1178
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:10,667
Ani Banerjee?

1179
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:12,050
Sign please.

1180
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,626
-Sign here.
-What's this?

1181
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:20,583
Who sent this?

1182
01:26:20,969 --> 01:26:22,302
Ms. Rosie...

1183
01:26:24,761 --> 01:26:25,677
Good day, sir.

1184
01:26:26,011 --> 01:26:27,719
Are you just going
to leave me here and go?

1185
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,500
Happy Diwali, sir.

1186
01:26:29,917 --> 01:26:30,959
Let's go.

1187
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:32,709
Hey...

1188
01:26:57,136 --> 01:26:58,552
Mom? Dad?

1189
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:00,292
I mean Dr. Ganeshan...

1190
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:02,219
I didn't know you were coming...

1191
01:27:06,384 --> 01:27:07,300
The door...

1192
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,792
...the wind slammed it shut.

1193
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,875
Don't you have the keys?

1194
01:27:14,011 --> 01:27:14,844
Sorry.

1195
01:27:15,302 --> 01:27:17,011
-It's okay.
-Let me take the suitcases.

1196
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,416
-It's okay--
-No, let me.

1197
01:27:24,177 --> 01:27:26,177
Mom, please call Kavya.

1198
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:27,292
Of course.

1199
01:27:36,886 --> 01:27:37,802
Piano?

1200
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:49,497
Hey, what are you doing?

1201
01:27:55,719 --> 01:27:56,677
Hi, Appa.

1202
01:27:57,832 --> 01:27:58,665
Kavya...

1203
01:28:01,052 --> 01:28:02,302
What happened?

1204
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:15,302
Appa...

1205
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:20,792
It's a full-size piano, Nora.

1206
01:28:21,469 --> 01:28:22,636
Not a keychain.
I can't even hide it!

1207
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,136
<i>Why will you hide it?
I just wanted to gift it to you.</i>

1208
01:28:26,153 --> 01:28:28,194
We'll get to Washington on 27th,

1209
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:32,292
but we need to sort out
Grandpa's Will before that.

1210
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,000
Yes.

1211
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:35,375
The lawyer is from Bombay.

1212
01:28:37,052 --> 01:28:38,719
So you're not really here to visit me.

1213
01:28:38,956 --> 01:28:40,122
You're here for work.

1214
01:28:40,236 --> 01:28:42,528
But we're here now, aren't we?

1215
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,261
Why didn't you call me?

1216
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,625
I would have come to the airport.

1217
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,125
I'll call you later.

1218
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:48,625
Kavya's parents are here.

1219
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,375
What? Why?

1220
01:28:57,802 --> 01:29:02,427
<i>โช There you stood, by the canteen โช</i>

1221
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:06,500
<i>โช I was lurking, almost unseen โช</i>

1222
01:29:07,844 --> 01:29:10,094
Mom wanted to see our wedding photos.

1223
01:29:10,175 --> 01:29:13,175
There aren't too many, so...

1224
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:16,094
Come sit, Kavya.

1225
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,750
<i>โช I'm the one who made the mistake โช</i>

1226
01:29:17,844 --> 01:29:20,802
<i>โช And got stuck with you โช</i>

1227
01:29:20,927 --> 01:29:25,969
<i>โช All the hearts I had to break โช</i>

1228
01:29:26,052 --> 01:29:30,344
-You look beautiful.
<i>โช -Why didn't I just listen to my family? โช</i>

1229
01:29:30,427 --> 01:29:35,511
<i>โช This story of you and me
is older than the movies โช</i>

1230
01:29:35,594 --> 01:29:37,844
<i>โช I'm crazy about you โช</i>

1231
01:29:38,261 --> 01:29:40,011
<i>โช And I'm crazy about me too! โช</i>

1232
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:54,636
<i>โช I'll follow you around day and night โช</i>

1233
01:29:54,761 --> 01:29:58,761
<i>โช And cook Chinese for you on weekends โช</i>

1234
01:29:58,802 --> 01:30:00,511
<i>โช No matter how it tastes โช</i>

1235
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:03,552
<i>โช I'll say, 'it's delicious' โช</i>

1236
01:30:03,636 --> 01:30:07,302
<i>โช This boy, he's handsome and smart.
Oh, how lucky I am โช</i>

1237
01:30:11,658 --> 01:30:13,200
You recorded a football match over this?

1238
01:30:13,281 --> 01:30:14,239
No, no...

1239
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,653
I don't know which tape this is.

1240
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:17,459
Come on, Ani.

1241
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,416
It says 'Salsa Class' on the tape,
how would I know...

1242
01:30:22,511 --> 01:30:23,719
This is...

1243
01:30:23,761 --> 01:30:24,844
Why are you getting so angry?

1244
01:30:25,011 --> 01:30:27,011
Do you even remember
the last time we watched this?

1245
01:30:27,136 --> 01:30:28,511
This is our only copy.

1246
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:30,833
Is this the World Cup semi-finals?

1247
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:42,833
Batman.

1248
01:30:43,927 --> 01:30:44,719
What?

1249
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,667
Your dad is like Batman.

1250
01:30:47,969 --> 01:30:50,469
His alarm goes off when
someone touches his daughter!

1251
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,261
And he appears out of thin air!

1252
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:56,625
The only year we wanted
to spend Diwali on our own.

1253
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:58,583
Feels like our college days...

1254
01:30:59,505 --> 01:31:00,588
we're 40 now...

1255
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:02,296
38!

1256
01:31:07,838 --> 01:31:09,296
Where's the AC remote?

1257
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,213
On the bedside table, Appa.

1258
01:31:14,713 --> 01:31:15,630
Good night.

1259
01:31:19,505 --> 01:31:20,755
Batman returns!

1260
01:31:22,213 --> 01:31:23,213
I told you

1261
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:26,291
Poothankuresi Ramaiyer Ganeshan is Batman.

1262
01:31:33,098 --> 01:31:34,807
Who sent the piano?

1263
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:48,724
-Hello?
-Ani, it's the first dress rehearsal.

1264
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:50,292
Can you come to the theatre?

1265
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,255
Now?

1266
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,667
I'm leaving for work now...

1267
01:31:54,005 --> 01:31:54,838
Please.

1268
01:31:55,505 --> 01:31:57,380
Everyone... Ready?

1269
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:09,380
<i>โช What came to me in this dream โช</i>

1270
01:32:09,463 --> 01:32:12,463
<i>โช Can I tell you? โช</i>

1271
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,588
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

1272
01:32:16,588 --> 01:32:21,671
<i>โช I've brought all my love โช</i>

1273
01:32:21,755 --> 01:32:24,713
<i>โช To your doorstep โช</i>

1274
01:32:25,171 --> 01:32:27,671
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

1275
01:32:27,755 --> 01:32:30,046
<i>โช Don't make me wait โช</i>

1276
01:32:30,171 --> 01:32:31,713
<i>โช Come to me this once โช</i>

1277
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:35,171
<i>โช Come and fall into my arms โช</i>

1278
01:32:35,255 --> 01:32:41,380
<i>โช I'm right here but, where are you? โช</i>

1279
01:32:42,755 --> 01:32:47,796
<i>โช What came to me in this dream โช</i>

1280
01:32:47,921 --> 01:32:50,838
<i>โช Can I tell you? โช</i>

1281
01:32:51,338 --> 01:32:53,713
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

1282
01:33:07,505 --> 01:33:15,588
<i>โช I have stayed up nights waiting for you โช</i>

1283
01:33:15,838 --> 01:33:17,380
<i>โช Where are you? โช</i>

1284
01:33:17,588 --> 01:33:18,421
Ani!

1285
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:20,088
Wait, Ani...

1286
01:33:22,255 --> 01:33:23,505
Wait, Ani...

1287
01:33:24,838 --> 01:33:27,046
You didn't like it?

1288
01:33:27,421 --> 01:33:28,880
Were the violins too much?

1289
01:33:29,213 --> 01:33:31,880
The troupe has been
practicing for a whole month!

1290
01:33:35,005 --> 01:33:35,505
Ani.

1291
01:33:35,588 --> 01:33:37,338
Why are you using this song, Nora?

1292
01:33:39,546 --> 01:33:40,921
Without even asking me...

1293
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,546
Ani, I love this song.

1294
01:33:43,713 --> 01:33:45,505
I wanted the world to hear your song.

1295
01:33:45,588 --> 01:33:47,671
I don't want anyone to hear it.
No one!

1296
01:33:50,671 --> 01:33:52,338
You don't know anything about this song.

1297
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:55,838
This is the ONE thing

1298
01:33:56,671 --> 01:33:59,255
that belonged to me.

1299
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:04,671
Why on earth did you
send a piano to my house?

1300
01:34:06,505 --> 01:34:09,463
I told you,
I'll speak to her after Diwali.

1301
01:34:10,088 --> 01:34:11,546
Couldn't you wait for a few more days?

1302
01:34:11,838 --> 01:34:13,338
Did you have to send it now?

1303
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:16,755
I just wanted to do something for you.

1304
01:34:16,838 --> 01:34:18,380
Don't. Please don't do anything.

1305
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,463
Don't sing my songs.

1306
01:34:22,546 --> 01:34:24,255
Don't send a piano to my house.

1307
01:34:24,338 --> 01:34:25,588
Please don't do anything!

1308
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:40,679
You think I want to do this shit?

1309
01:34:48,545 --> 01:34:53,211
I'm tired of finding
ways to keep you close to me.

1310
01:34:57,755 --> 01:34:59,380
I don't know what to do

1311
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,630
to hold on to you.

1312
01:35:11,255 --> 01:35:13,463
I know I'm a bit crazy...

1313
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:16,958
I behave childishly, but

1314
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:26,296
...all this madness
is only for you, Anirudh.

1315
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:31,875
I don't know how to live without you.

1316
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,417
The play opens next week...

1317
01:35:44,792 --> 01:35:46,542
and I'm just not prepared.

1318
01:35:57,255 --> 01:35:58,880
You're going to be a star, Nora.

1319
01:36:04,255 --> 01:36:06,630
And I will be cheering
for you from the last row.

1320
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:09,796
Not the last row, Anirudh.

1321
01:36:10,921 --> 01:36:13,380
I want you in the front row.

1322
01:36:13,588 --> 01:36:15,630
I want to tell everyone,

1323
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:18,458
'Guys, meet Mr. Ani Banerjee.

1324
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:23,625
He'd rehearse lines with
me every morning before work.'

1325
01:36:29,542 --> 01:36:32,084
Are you currently a ghost
or am I allowed to touch you?

1326
01:37:11,088 --> 01:37:12,088
Ganeshan...

1327
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:20,546
Kavya ma'am?

1328
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,671
-Hello?
-Sorry, Vikram sir?

1329
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:25,213
I couldn't get through your phone

1330
01:37:25,667 --> 01:37:27,792
that's why I called Kavya ma'am.

1331
01:37:29,588 --> 01:37:32,880
Will it be just your name on
the registration papers of the house

1332
01:37:33,005 --> 01:37:34,838
or should I add Kavya madam's name too?

1333
01:37:38,671 --> 01:37:39,630
Hello?

1334
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:42,791
Vikram sir?

1335
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:47,083
Vikram sir?

1336
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:50,244
Hello...

1337
01:37:51,755 --> 01:37:52,588
Hello...

1338
01:37:55,213 --> 01:37:56,130
Vikram sir?

1339
01:37:58,605 --> 01:37:59,647
Vikram sir?

1340
01:38:02,088 --> 01:38:04,046
Add Kavya's name.

1341
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:05,588
Alright.

1342
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:08,338
Congratulations, sir.

1343
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,005
This Diwali will be a
special one for both of you.

1344
01:38:12,421 --> 01:38:15,380
I'll send the keys
over to your studio, sir.

1345
01:38:15,463 --> 01:38:16,505
Happy Diwali.

1346
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:21,417
What happened?

1347
01:39:54,671 --> 01:39:57,255
Ani, just pass me the chilli sauce.

1348
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,130
Hi.

1349
01:40:25,989 --> 01:40:27,031
What happened?

1350
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,875
Why are we back here?

1351
01:40:30,046 --> 01:40:31,713
I'll have to rush back soon.

1352
01:40:32,296 --> 01:40:34,588
Dad is coming to the clinic today. Alone.

1353
01:40:35,588 --> 01:40:37,213
I'm already quite stressed.

1354
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,875
I have something to show you.

1355
01:40:42,755 --> 01:40:44,630
I got just one day to do this, madam.

1356
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:52,083
Your favorite couch on the left...

1357
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,624
for your early morning filter coffee.

1358
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:58,541
And this is your blue wall

1359
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,500
matching the color of your sea.

1360
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:07,500
And here you go, our Bombay specialty...

1361
01:41:07,588 --> 01:41:10,505
the beautiful, Bombay sea.

1362
01:41:12,088 --> 01:41:13,380
What's going on, Vik?

1363
01:41:18,921 --> 01:41:19,921
A blender?

1364
01:41:21,667 --> 01:41:26,459
A special, state-of-the-art,
long-lasting blender.

1365
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,875
One that the sea won't ruin easily.

1366
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:35,541
See, I figured it all out.

1367
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:38,660
Open it.

1368
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,833
'Very distress sale, madam'.

1369
01:41:56,588 --> 01:41:58,213
Isn't this what you wanted?

1370
01:42:07,213 --> 01:42:08,588
I don't know, Vik.

1371
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:10,505
I don't know.

1372
01:42:12,046 --> 01:42:14,588
What do you want from me, Kavya?

1373
01:42:29,421 --> 01:42:32,088
You know,
I've been running all my life Kavs.

1374
01:42:35,546 --> 01:42:38,755
I don't know if I've ever
believed in the idea of a home.

1375
01:42:44,255 --> 01:42:45,796
I've chased after...

1376
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:48,505
moments and

1377
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:52,167
things and people.

1378
01:42:54,213 --> 01:42:59,588
I've clicked and framed and
lived in every city in the world

1379
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:02,255
but none of them felt like home.

1380
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:05,416
Not even New York.

1381
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,250
Then I met you.

1382
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:24,088
You ruined my life.

1383
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,792
And now I'm done...

1384
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:37,500
I'm done wandering,

1385
01:43:38,255 --> 01:43:39,880
I'm done chasing.

1386
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:42,880
I'm done running.

1387
01:43:48,046 --> 01:43:50,630
I feel homesick when I'm not with you.

1388
01:43:54,296 --> 01:43:55,505
So this is it.

1389
01:43:56,588 --> 01:43:58,338
This is what I want.

1390
01:43:59,046 --> 01:44:01,671
Right here. Right now.

1391
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:03,546
With you.

1392
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,667
Won't you stay here with me?

1393
01:44:13,848 --> 01:44:16,182
I don't know what...

1394
01:44:16,421 --> 01:44:19,880
Just move in here with me, Kavs.

1395
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:23,125
Maybe we won't work out.

1396
01:44:23,338 --> 01:44:25,838
But maybe, just maybe...

1397
01:44:25,921 --> 01:44:28,588
we continue to be amazing.

1398
01:44:30,338 --> 01:44:32,630
We will never know until we try.

1399
01:44:38,588 --> 01:44:42,838
Mujhe chhodke mar jao (speaking in Hindi).

1400
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,005
'<i>Mar jao</i>' means to die.

1401
01:44:53,671 --> 01:44:57,588
You mean '<i>mat jao'</i>... don't go.

1402
01:45:00,005 --> 01:45:02,046
Please <i>mat jao</i>...

1403
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:21,171
Keep the key until Diwali.

1404
01:45:25,713 --> 01:45:27,505
And then?

1405
01:45:29,796 --> 01:45:31,046
You decide.

1406
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,546
Sorry I'm late, Dad.

1407
01:45:47,005 --> 01:45:48,171
Where were you?

1408
01:45:49,792 --> 01:45:50,958
Dr. Ganeshan...

1409
01:45:52,338 --> 01:45:54,880
Kavya, your 2 p.m. appointment
is waiting for you in Room No. 5.

1410
01:45:55,005 --> 01:45:56,463
She specially asked for you.

1411
01:45:57,713 --> 01:45:59,505
It'll take me 15-20 minutes.

1412
01:45:59,588 --> 01:46:00,588
I'll wait.

1413
01:46:03,755 --> 01:46:05,505
Her name is Rosie. I'll be back.

1414
01:46:05,588 --> 01:46:06,546
Thanks.

1415
01:46:07,005 --> 01:46:07,880
Hi, Rosie.

1416
01:46:09,588 --> 01:46:11,005
Routine cleaning?

1417
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:13,588
Any other issues?

1418
01:46:18,005 --> 01:46:19,588
Can you rinse for me, please?

1419
01:46:30,921 --> 01:46:32,588
What do you do, Rosie?

1420
01:46:36,703 --> 01:46:40,078
Nothing seems to be going my way today.

1421
01:46:43,796 --> 01:46:45,005
Sorry about that.

1422
01:46:46,421 --> 01:46:47,338
Let's see...

1423
01:46:48,421 --> 01:46:49,630
Open your mouth please.

1424
01:46:52,564 --> 01:46:53,605
Wider.

1425
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:09,713
Sorry?

1426
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:26,005
He is going to leave you.

1427
01:47:26,713 --> 01:47:27,588
What?

1428
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:31,588
Anirudh. He's going to leave you.

1429
01:47:36,505 --> 01:47:38,088
I've paid online.

1430
01:47:39,546 --> 01:47:40,421
Thank you.

1431
01:48:04,921 --> 01:48:05,838
What happened?

1432
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:08,921
I'll drive. Give.

1433
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:17,921
Where are we going?

1434
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,380
Why do you always drive so slowly, Appa?

1435
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:29,171
Right or left?

1436
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,588
I feel like I'll die
of old age in this damn car!

1437
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:39,463
Turn left.

1438
01:48:40,588 --> 01:48:41,588
Left!

1439
01:48:41,671 --> 01:48:42,713
Stop it, Kavya!

1440
01:48:51,546 --> 01:48:54,588
I feel like such a failure, Dad.

1441
01:48:55,296 --> 01:48:56,796
You were right...

1442
01:48:58,005 --> 01:48:59,713
no matter how hard I try,

1443
01:49:00,213 --> 01:49:03,005
I'm such a goddamn failure in what I do.

1444
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:07,046
I'm a failure, Dad.

1445
01:49:17,588 --> 01:49:19,005
You and your Bengali...

1446
01:49:20,838 --> 01:49:22,171
you are planning to...

1447
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:24,421
To separate?

1448
01:49:28,921 --> 01:49:29,838
Perhaps.

1449
01:49:34,088 --> 01:49:35,588
I don't know. I mean...

1450
01:49:37,546 --> 01:49:38,796
I have no clue.

1451
01:49:43,696 --> 01:49:46,446
Why couldn't you just
show me some love, Dad?

1452
01:49:50,902 --> 01:49:53,777
All my life I've been
so greedy for love that

1453
01:49:55,171 --> 01:49:56,588
if I don't get it,

1454
01:49:58,005 --> 01:49:59,796
I just go take it wherever I can.

1455
01:50:11,130 --> 01:50:12,588
How do you do it, Dad?

1456
01:50:14,552 --> 01:50:15,593
Mum and you...

1457
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:20,208
every single day for so many years.

1458
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,380
What's the secret?

1459
01:50:26,842 --> 01:50:28,426
There's no secret at all.

1460
01:50:29,546 --> 01:50:30,671
None at all.

1461
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:35,755
You just keep showing up every day.

1462
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,463
Do you know when I drive slowly?

1463
01:50:49,994 --> 01:50:51,869
When you are in the car.

1464
01:51:11,213 --> 01:51:13,380
What should I get for
both of you from the US?

1465
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,796
Nothing.

1466
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:21,213
[indistinct chatter]

1467
01:51:27,671 --> 01:51:28,588
Bye.

1468
01:52:00,796 --> 01:52:01,713
Rosie?

1469
01:52:03,421 --> 01:52:04,546
Seriously, Ani?

1470
01:52:04,588 --> 01:52:05,421
Rosie?

1471
01:52:06,588 --> 01:52:07,171
What...

1472
01:52:07,296 --> 01:52:10,046
Who the hell has an affair
with a girl named Rosie?

1473
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:18,624
That's not her real name.

1474
01:52:20,296 --> 01:52:24,046
She's doing a play in which her character

1475
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:25,546
is named Rosie.

1476
01:52:25,588 --> 01:52:26,713
That's it?

1477
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:30,005
Wow!
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1478
01:52:30,588 --> 01:52:31,838
Case closed.

1479
01:53:09,755 --> 01:53:13,630
She came to my clinic herself
to tell me that you're leaving me

1480
01:53:13,713 --> 01:53:16,338
because my husband is such a coward--

1481
01:53:16,421 --> 01:53:17,588
Damn you, Ganeshan!

1482
01:53:22,751 --> 01:53:24,085
I'm the coward here?!

1483
01:53:27,542 --> 01:53:31,292
You're the one who's gone and bought a
house with someone else. What about that?

1484
01:53:33,588 --> 01:53:34,880
Your estate agent had called...

1485
01:53:37,167 --> 01:53:38,833
'My heartiest congratulations to you,

1486
01:53:38,933 --> 01:53:40,724
Kavya ma'am and some Vikram sir.'

1487
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:49,875
I didn't know about the house...

1488
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:52,667
He told me today.

1489
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:55,921
Who is he?

1490
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:02,349
How does it matter?

1491
01:54:03,088 --> 01:54:04,171
Classic Ganeshan.

1492
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:08,130
You're the one always deciding
what matters and what doesn't.

1493
01:54:08,213 --> 01:54:11,130
Stop calling me Ganeshan.
I'm your wife, not a security guard!

1494
01:54:17,757 --> 01:54:19,382
What does he call you?

1495
01:54:20,005 --> 01:54:20,796
What?

1496
01:54:21,255 --> 01:54:23,213
When he f***s you, what does he call you?

1497
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,255
Do you really want to know?

1498
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:27,630
Yes, please. I want to know.

1499
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,130
He just says he loves me.

1500
01:54:36,463 --> 01:54:38,046
Yes, walk away.

1501
01:54:38,917 --> 01:54:40,709
You're just like your Appa.

1502
01:54:40,792 --> 01:54:43,250
No, no... why will I walk away?

1503
01:54:43,421 --> 01:54:44,838
It's a big day for us.

1504
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:47,588
Finally we're doing something together,
even if it's fighting.

1505
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:49,171
Couple goals. Woohoo!

1506
01:54:49,338 --> 01:54:50,546
What don't we do together?

1507
01:54:50,588 --> 01:54:51,505
Really?

1508
01:54:51,921 --> 01:54:54,463
After five full years,
we managed to travel out of Bombay - for?

1509
01:54:54,625 --> 01:54:56,667
For a funeral!

1510
01:54:56,794 --> 01:54:58,252
I'm sorry.

1511
01:54:58,333 --> 01:55:02,042
I'm extremely sorry we
can't go skiing in Switzerland.

1512
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:04,421
Because I have to run this house.

1513
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,880
The business is struggling.

1514
01:55:06,005 --> 01:55:07,088
I have to pay the EMIs.

1515
01:55:07,213 --> 01:55:09,296
I pay the EMIs as well!
This is my house too.

1516
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:10,463
Oh please!

1517
01:55:11,338 --> 01:55:13,046
You don't even turn off the lights.

1518
01:55:13,171 --> 01:55:14,088
Lights?

1519
01:55:15,546 --> 01:55:17,838
Are we going to fight
over the electricity bill now?

1520
01:55:17,921 --> 01:55:18,880
Fine.

1521
01:55:19,671 --> 01:55:21,421
I'll switch off all the lights.

1522
01:55:21,505 --> 01:55:26,296
Sit in the dark and eat
your disgusting eggplant.

1523
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,338
If this was a problem,

1524
01:55:31,588 --> 01:55:33,713
why have you lied all these
years saying you like eggplant?

1525
01:55:34,338 --> 01:55:35,588
Because that's marriage.

1526
01:55:36,005 --> 01:55:37,755
One needs to lie.
And I did, too!

1527
01:55:38,005 --> 01:55:42,588
I hate your 'eggplant รก la poppy seeds'.

1528
01:55:46,921 --> 01:55:50,046
And I hate your stainless steel utensils.

1529
01:55:50,171 --> 01:55:54,213
All this steel makes the
kitchen look like a hardware store!

1530
01:55:54,375 --> 01:55:56,250
What's wrong with stainless steel?

1531
01:55:59,545 --> 01:56:00,836
I don't know.

1532
01:56:03,463 --> 01:56:06,338
I don't even know
what to call you anymore.

1533
01:57:09,821 --> 01:57:10,904
Why, Ani?

1534
01:57:12,917 --> 01:57:15,125
Why did you leave everything?

1535
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:19,750
After your dad passed away,
not just music,

1536
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:22,499
you left everything.

1537
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:28,917
Your madness,
your irritating cooking habits,

1538
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:33,668
taking time out for me... for us,

1539
01:57:33,833 --> 01:57:36,459
being happy, laughing out loud...
you gave it up all.

1540
01:57:36,546 --> 01:57:37,671
I had to.

1541
01:57:42,252 --> 01:57:44,294
Everything changed after Dad passed away.

1542
01:57:46,213 --> 01:57:47,671
I had to change too.

1543
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,588
And the factory--

1544
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:54,046
The damn factory!

1545
01:57:55,208 --> 01:57:58,374
You became obsessed with the factory, Ani.

1546
01:57:59,005 --> 01:58:01,005
You'd return home after I was asleep.

1547
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:02,421
Every day.

1548
01:58:03,588 --> 01:58:04,838
I missed you.

1549
01:58:08,917 --> 01:58:11,000
Even though we shared a room

1550
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:14,542
you appeared so distant.

1551
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:19,666
Can you even imagine
that kind of loneliness?

1552
01:58:25,046 --> 01:58:27,130
You weren't the same Ani who I -

1553
01:58:27,255 --> 01:58:28,921
What did you want me to do about it?

1554
01:58:30,417 --> 01:58:31,500
What did you want me to do?

1555
01:58:36,188 --> 01:58:37,688
I don't feel like laughing,

1556
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,417
I couldn't hold on
to the old Ani inside me...

1557
01:58:40,505 --> 01:58:41,755
I had to let him go.

1558
01:58:47,505 --> 01:58:48,796
You changed, Ani.

1559
01:58:51,046 --> 01:58:52,463
And you didn't.

1560
01:58:54,713 --> 01:58:55,796
What?

1561
01:58:57,046 --> 01:58:58,505
You did not change, Kavya.

1562
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:04,671
Life changes and that changes people.

1563
01:59:06,266 --> 01:59:08,349
But you just refused to change.

1564
01:59:23,713 --> 01:59:26,088
Why didn't you talk to me?

1565
01:59:29,645 --> 01:59:31,604
You didn't talk to me either.

1566
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,042
I just felt so trapped.

1567
01:59:43,027 --> 01:59:46,360
Why should I return to
that emptiness every night?

1568
01:59:59,255 --> 02:00:00,880
Her name is Nora.

1569
02:00:02,505 --> 02:00:04,296
She likes me as I am...

1570
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:07,541
clumsy, broken,

1571
02:00:09,292 --> 02:00:11,917
burdened with responsibilities...

1572
02:00:13,375 --> 02:00:15,458
plain and boring Ani.

1573
02:00:18,447 --> 02:00:20,655
You know the best thing about her...

1574
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:24,416
she <i>needs</i> me.

1575
02:00:26,292 --> 02:00:28,750
I needed you too, Ani.

1576
02:00:33,625 --> 02:00:35,833
...back then, maybe.

1577
02:00:38,838 --> 02:00:40,588
You gave up on me, Kavya.

1578
02:00:45,111 --> 02:00:47,652
You gave up on yourself, Ani.

1579
02:00:54,833 --> 02:00:57,499
Is that why you got the abortion?

1580
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:59,505
What?

1581
02:01:01,583 --> 02:01:03,708
We could have been a proper family.

1582
02:01:05,505 --> 02:01:07,713
That's not fair.

1583
02:01:09,005 --> 02:01:11,213
We both agreed, Ani.

1584
02:01:11,546 --> 02:01:13,130
It's what you decided.

1585
02:01:29,542 --> 02:01:31,625
The last few months felt like--

1586
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:35,000
...if only we could
press the reset button and

1587
02:01:35,088 --> 02:01:37,463
things would go back to the way they were.

1588
02:01:41,458 --> 02:01:42,583
If only...

1589
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:48,250
Life has become so complicated, isn't it?

1590
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,917
Now there are others involved too.

1591
02:01:58,046 --> 02:02:02,338
Who knows, in six months...

1592
02:02:03,588 --> 02:02:07,796
we might again go back
to only talking about

1593
02:02:08,213 --> 02:02:12,005
the AC, garbage bags
and anti-allergy medicines...

1594
02:02:19,255 --> 02:02:24,088
Sometimes love isn't enough.

1595
02:02:55,671 --> 02:02:59,921
<i>โช The two shores, they parted ways โช</i>

02:04:21,505 --> 02:04:25,171
<i>โช Pens its stories on the sea โช</i>

1611
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:32,755
<i>โช I try to reason โช</i>

1612
02:04:33,671 --> 02:04:38,255
<i>โช But the heart, it doesn't listen โช</i>

1613
02:04:38,338 --> 02:04:42,796
<i>โช The dawn we once shared โช</i>

1614
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,630
<i>โช Got lost in the night โช</i>

1615
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:52,588
<i>โช The two shores, they parted ways โช</i>

1616
02:04:52,630 --> 02:04:57,588
<i>โช And the river lost its way โช</i>

1617
02:05:00,588 --> 02:05:04,796
<i>โช The two shores, they parted ways โช</i>

1618
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,796
<i>โช And the river lost its way โช</i>

1619
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:19,921
<i>โช The stories of this heart โช</i>

1620
02:05:20,255 --> 02:05:24,921
<i>โช Cannot be captured in words โช</i>

1621
02:05:25,130 --> 02:05:29,921
<i>โช These moments, they have let us down โช</i>

1622
02:05:30,046 --> 02:05:34,296
<i>โช They sit quietly, teary-eyed โช</i>

1623
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:39,213
<i>โช And the life that we once shared โช</i>

1624
02:05:39,296 --> 02:05:44,130
<i>โช Has suddenly become lifeless โช</i>

1625
02:05:44,630 --> 02:05:48,880
<i>โช The two shores, they parted ways โช</i>

1626
02:05:49,005 --> 02:05:53,796
<i>โช And the river lost its way โช</i>

1627
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:58,713
<i>โช The two shores, they parted ways โช</i>

1628
02:05:58,796 --> 02:06:02,630
<i>โช And the river lost its way โช</i>

1629
02:06:24,796 --> 02:06:25,713
-Bye.
-Bye.

1630
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,171
Happy holidays.

1631
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:28,255
Hello?

1632
02:06:28,338 --> 02:06:29,380
Hi, Kavya.

1633
02:06:29,708 --> 02:06:30,583
Hi.

1634
02:06:31,005 --> 02:06:32,338
I just wanted to let you know

1635
02:06:32,421 --> 02:06:34,380
The paperwork for the house is ready.

1636
02:06:34,708 --> 02:06:37,708
The new owners want possession next week.

1637
02:06:38,005 --> 02:06:39,005
That's nice.

1638
02:06:39,583 --> 02:06:44,542
The money from the sale will
be equally divided between the two of you.

1639
02:06:44,979 --> 02:06:45,895
Great.

1640
02:06:46,255 --> 02:06:47,588
-Bye.
-Thank you, Swati.

1641
02:06:47,833 --> 02:06:48,833
I'll see you tomorrow.

1642
02:06:56,468 --> 02:06:57,635
Taxi.

1643
02:08:40,417 --> 02:08:41,458
<i>Happy Diwali, Kavya.</i>

1644
02:08:46,163 --> 02:08:47,246
Happy Diwali.

1645
02:08:48,736 --> 02:08:49,777
<i>The house is now...</i>

1646
02:08:51,083 --> 02:08:52,874
I know.

1647
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,792
<i>Where are you?</i>

1648
02:08:58,171 --> 02:09:02,921
By the way, I watched your Rosie's film...

1649
02:09:03,463 --> 02:09:06,546
Hate to admit, she's quite good.

1650
02:09:06,917 --> 02:09:09,417
<i>She'll be a superstar.</i>

1651
02:09:10,958 --> 02:09:15,167
I'd see her photos on
Instagram and in magazines.

1652
02:09:16,083 --> 02:09:17,333
<i>Bloody stalker.</i>

1653
02:09:20,338 --> 02:09:22,588
<i>Anyway, that chapter is closed now.</i>

1654
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:24,255
I know.

1655
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,546
Read about that too.

1656
02:09:27,588 --> 02:09:30,463
I'm so sorry it didn't
work out between the two of you.

1657
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:31,671
<i>Sure, liar!</i>

1658
02:09:33,208 --> 02:09:35,166
<i>You're not sorry at all.</i>

1659
02:09:35,755 --> 02:09:37,588
She loved you a lot.

1660
02:09:39,541 --> 02:09:42,875
<i>Sometimes love isn't enough.</i>

1661
02:09:47,338 --> 02:09:49,588
I thought of calling you...

1662
02:09:50,042 --> 02:09:51,542
several times.

1663
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:55,208
I wasn't sure if you'd
want to speak to me.

1664
02:09:55,421 --> 02:09:57,838
I would want to talk to you
all my life, Kavya.

1665
02:10:01,625 --> 02:10:02,792
Get lost!

1666
02:11:00,833 --> 02:11:03,458
How is your hot photographer?

1667
02:11:05,288 --> 02:11:06,621
Don't know.

1668
02:11:07,046 --> 02:11:10,713
Must be shooting dilapidated
buildings somewhere in the world.

1669
02:11:14,668 --> 02:11:15,876
What do you mean?

1670
02:11:19,588 --> 02:11:23,838
Lata said that you were
in Europe for six months.

1671
02:11:23,921 --> 02:11:25,380
I thought you'd gone with him.

1672
02:11:25,588 --> 02:11:27,921
Well, I did go to Europe.
But alone.

1673
02:11:30,994 --> 02:11:32,244
I knew it...

1674
02:11:33,977 --> 02:11:36,060
I knew you weren't fully happy...

1675
02:11:37,463 --> 02:11:38,713
I felt it.

1676
02:11:48,046 --> 02:11:48,796
What?

1677
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:52,463
I missed you, Ganeshan.

1678
02:12:02,833 --> 02:12:04,374
Banerjee...

1679
02:12:08,755 --> 02:12:10,338
pass me the chilli sauce.

1680
02:12:22,046 --> 02:12:23,130
Open it for me.
