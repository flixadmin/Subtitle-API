1
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:56,170
He's here!

2
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,082
- Professor Perlman!
- Welcome! Welcome!

3
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,490
- Thank you so much for having me.
- So nice to meet...

4
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,830
Oh, my goodness!
You're... you're bigger than your picture.

5
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,540
Well, I couldn't get all of my in the photo.
It's a problem.

6
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,936
- Mrs. Perlman.
- Anella.

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,460
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.
Thank you for having me in your home.

8
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,890
Elio!

9
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,450
You must be exhausted.

10
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,547
Ah... what gave me away?

11
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,509
Absolutely! Absolutely.
Every single one of these will...

12
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,410
Elio, Oliver.
Oliver, Elio!

13
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,200
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you. Elio.

14
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:06,863
- You must be exhausted!
- A little bit.

15
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,070
Come! Come! Come!

16
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,840
May I bring your things up to your room?

17
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,931
- Err.... sure. Yeah.
- My room?

18
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,010
Follow him.

19
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,415
You're very welcome here.

20
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,510
Yes.

21
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:21,393
Our home is your home.

22
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,047
Hello.

23
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,601
Hi.

24
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:03,418
My room is now your room.
I'll be next door.

25
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:10,146
We have to share the bathroom.

26
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,436
It's my only way out.

27
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:06,190
We're being called for dinner.

28
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,768
Sorry.

29
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,729
We're being called for dinner.

30
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,461
Yeah. Um...

31
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,343
I'm probably gonna pass.
Would you make an excuse for me to your mother?

32
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,654
Thanks, man.

33
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,657
So this is your old room, huh?

34
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,190
Thanks.

35
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,351
Later.

36
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,630
- Wow!
- Ah...

37
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:09,570
- Look at this!
- Arrh.

38
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,661
Good morning, professor.
Good Morning!

39
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,550
Back from the dead.

40
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,950
- Was I out that long?
- It seemed like it, huh.

41
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:15,600
How are you?

42
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,422
Ah! Well, rested now.
Thank you.

43
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,332
I'm glad. 
Would you like some er... espresso?

44
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,829
I would love some.
Thank you very much.

45
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,270
This looks amazing. But...

46
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,220
I didn't take your seat. Did I?

47
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,690
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay. Please.

48
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,910
Did you... did you recover from your trip?

49
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,936
Er... I did, yeah. Big time. Thank you.

50
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,776
I could show you around.

51
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,090
That'd be great! Thank you.

52
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,836
Um... is there a... is there a bank in town?
I'd love to start an account while I'm here.

53
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,410
Let me do it.

54
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,599
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:48,275
- Ah... it happens to the best of us.
- No problem?

56
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,290
None of our residents has ever had
a local bank account.

57
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,666
- Really?
- Um.

58
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,864
Should I take him to Mount Dovie?

59
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,170
I think they're
closed for summer vacation.

60
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,550
You can try the.... Crema.

61
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,780
Crema?

62
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,418
Thank you.

63
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,280
Is this your orchard?

64
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,770
These are Annella's trees.

65
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,390
Oh wow.

66
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Peaches, cherries and apricots.

67
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,389
- Pomegranate, melograno.

68
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,985
Have another egg.

69
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,320
How stupid.

70
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,720
No, no, no.

71
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,130
Now I know myself too well.
If I have a second I'm just going to have a third...

72
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,055
and then a fourth, and then you're just
going to have to roll me out of here.

73
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,870
Delicious.

74
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,950
Darling?

75
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,590
Thank you.

76
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,228
Should I get him on Kieser's bike?

77
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,349
What does one do around here?

78
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,950
Wait for the summer to end.

79
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,336
Yeah?

80
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,620
What do you do in the winter?
Wait for summer to come?

81
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,396
Well...

82
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,390
We only come here for Christmas
and some other vacations.

83
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,990
- Christmas? I thought you were...
- Easter as well.

84
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:26,519
I thought you were Jewish.

85
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,276
Well, we are Jewish. But also...

86
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,605
American, Italian and French, somewhat.

87
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,986
An atypical combination.

88
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:38,230
Besides my family, you're probably the only
other Jew to set foot in this town.

89
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,947
I'm from a small town in New England...

90
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:43,242
I know what it's like to be the odd Jew out.

91
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,274
So, what do you do around here?

92
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:52,418
I read books, transcribe music,
swim at the river.

93
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,504
Go out at night.
I don't know.

94
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,821
Sounds fun.

95
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,624
Alright, buddy.
Thanks for the help.

96
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,313
Oops... sorry!
Sorry about that.

97
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,013
That's alright.

98
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:16,108
Right. Later.

99
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,742
What do you have there?

100
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,347
That should all be...

101
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:34,794
What is this?

102
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:39,307
These are...
the continuation of these Archeology Department...

103
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,766
Yes. Yes. These are Archeology.

104
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,147
Yeah, those are Archeology.
And this... the rest of these should be History.

105
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,849
- Ah. Okay.
- Alright. Apricot juice.

106
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:47,294
Yeah.

107
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,237
- Take some.
- Thank you.

108
00:11:58,927 --> 00:11:59,278
Aahh!

109
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:01,727
Help yourself to some more.

110
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:06,450
The word "apricot" comes from the Arabic,

111
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,287
it's like the words algebra, alchemy, alcoholic,

112
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:13,958
derives from an Arabic noun
combined with the Arabic article "al" before it.

113
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:19,088
The origin of our Italian
"albicocca" is "al-barquq".

114
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:22,258
It's amazing that today in Israel
and in many Arab countries,

115
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:26,370
the fruit's referred to by a totally different name...
mishmish.

116
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:29,281
I may have to disagree with you there, Professor.

117
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,742
Arrh?

118
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,385
I'm going to talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second. Umm...

119
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:37,465
You're right in the case of most of the Latin words
do find their origins in Greek words.

120
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,605
However, in the case of apricot,
is a little bit more of a complicated journey.

121
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,666
Ahh... How so?

122
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,239
Arr... well, here the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

123
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:50,236
The Latin word being "praecoquum" or "pre-coquere";
so it's "pre-coque" or "pre-reque" as you know...

124
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,536
to be precocious or premature.

125
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,870
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed "praecox",

126
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,954
which became "prekokkia",
which then became "berikokki",

127
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:03,681
which is how the Arabs
took "al-baquq".

128
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,852
It's courtesy of Philology 101.

129
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,282
Flying colors.

130
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,203
He does this every year.

131
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,917
It's about drink time.
Let's go here.

132
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:31,417
How do you know about this place?

133
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,535
Right on time!

134
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,334
- What's the matter? Are you alright?
- Cool.

135
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,674
- Pinch a nerve?
- I'm okay.

136
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,609
Here. Hold this!

137
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,954
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

138
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,848
Hey! Hey? Come here.
See... that's the problem!

139
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,832
You're too stressed.
You just got to relax a little bit.

140
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,772
I am relaxed.

141
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,900
Marzia, come here for a minute.

142
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,930
Back me up here.

143
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,590
Feel that. Right there.
It's too tight, right?

144
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
- He needs to relax.
- Oliver!

145
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:37,423
Later.

146
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,012
You should relax more.

147
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Okay, guys! Ready?

148
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Red wine.

149
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,750
I don't think he's arrogant.

150
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,510
Just watch, this is how he'll say
goodbye to us when the time comes.

151
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,131
With his... "later!"

152
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,450
Meanwhile, we'll have to
put up with him for six long weeks.

153
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,600
Won't we, darling?

154
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,380
I think he's shy.
You'll grow to like him!

155
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,900
What if I grow to hate him?

156
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,500
Hey, Elio!

157
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,110
Play something.

158
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,655
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

159
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,460
Hey!

160
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,210
What are you doing?

161
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:44,258
Reading.

162
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,036
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

163
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,500
- I have allergies.
- Yeah, me too. Maybe the same one.

164
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,418
Why don't you and I go swimming?

165
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,368
Right now?

166
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,498
Yeah... Come on! Let's go.

167
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,766
Do we have to go right now?

168
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,870
- I'll go get changed.
- Okay.

169
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,920
- Meet you downstairs.
- Um-hm.

170
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,813
See you downstairs.

171
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,555
- Elio, what are you doing?
- Reading my music.

172
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,714
No, you're not.

173
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
- Thinking, then.
- Yeah.

174
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
About what?

175
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,050
It's private.

176
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,983
- You're not going to tell me?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

177
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:27,450
He's not going to tell me
what he's thinking about.

178
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,450
Elio!

179
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,950
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

180
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,679
More apricot juice.

181
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,580
Sounds nice.

182
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,228
I thought you didn't like it.

183
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,016
Play it again, would you?

184
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,757
Follow me.

185
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:59,009
- That sounds different. Did you change it?
- I changed it a little bit.

186
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:00,690
Why?

187
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:05,116
I was playing it the way Liszt would have played it,
if he'd... altered Bach's version.

188
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,910
- Play that again!
- Play what again?

189
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,300
The thing you played outside.

190
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,400
Oh, you want me to play
that thing I played outside?

191
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,916
- Please.
- Arrh.

192
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
I can't believe you changed it again!

193
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,200
- Oh, I've changed it a little bit.
- Yeah! Why?

194
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,450
I just played it the way Busoni would have played it,
if I he'd... altered Liszt's version.

195
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,700
And what is wrong with Bach?
The way Bach would have played Bach?

196
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,120
Bach never wrote it for the guitar...

197
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,165
- In fact, we're not even sure if Bach wrote ..
- Forget I asked!

198
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,079
It's Young Bach. He dedicated it to his brother.

199
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,753
"I was too HARSH when I told him
I thought he hated Bach."

200
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,771
"I thought he didn't like ME."
"Oliver, Oliver."

201
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,361
- Hey, Professor.
- Hello!

202
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,906
Sit down here, please.

203
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,731
- Be honest. How bad is it?
- I think your insights here are persuasive, but...

204
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,431
Ciao.

205
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:01,792
- Elio!
- Hum...

206
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Are you sleeping?

207
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,900
I was.

208
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,292
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

209
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,000
- Wait.
- What?

210
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:13,916
I can't hear you.

211
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,140
For the early Greeks, Heidegger contends,
this underlying hidness is constitutive of the ways beings are...

212
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,970
not only in relation to themselves,
but also in relation to other entities general.

213
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:39,076
In other words, they do not construe hiddenness merely,
or primarily, in terms of entities relations to human beings.

214
00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:41,700
Does that make ANY sense to you?

215
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:46,514
It doesn't make any sense to me.
And I don't think it makes any sense to your dad, either.

216
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,300
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

217
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,210
That might be the kindest thing
anybody's said to me in months.

218
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,924
Kind?

219
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:02,052
Yep. Kind.

220
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,202
- Elio!
- Hey.

221
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:32,961
- Hey! Marzia.

222
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,850
Come on.

223
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
We almost had sex last night.

224
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,900
Marzia and me.

225
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,387
Why didn't you?

226
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,100
I don't know.

227
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,100
Well... you know it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

228
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:21,100
All I had to do was find the courage to...

229
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,700
reach out and touch.

230
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
She would have said yes.

231
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,168
Well... try again later.

232
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,900
Try what later?

233
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,600
I just heard from the people in Sirmione.
They say they've come up with something.

234
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,765
Oh... fantastic!

235
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,700
I'm going there today.
Would you like to come along?

236
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,125
I would love to.
Thank you.

237
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,800
Can I come too?

238
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:44,816
Arrh... on the condition you remain silent.

239
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,700
Silent, as in he has too many opinions...

240
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,921
or silent as in, just not telling anybody
what amazing thing you've dug up?

241
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,800
Well... nothing has been dug up,
it's what has been brought up...

242
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
out of the water.

243
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,055
Dad always sits in front,
with Anchise to navigate.

244
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,771
She seems to like you a lot.

245
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,700
She's more beautiful than she was last year.

246
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,502
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

247
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,699
Great body.

248
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,200
You trying to to get me to like her?

249
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,400
What would be the harm in that?

250
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:35,600
No harm.

251
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,712
I just typically like to grow those things
on my own, if you don't mind.

252
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,534
Just don't play at being a good host.

253
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,313
What's going on, boys?

254
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,400
Oliver, come.

255
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,900
Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

256
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,700
What? ... What?

257
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,373
<i>... and then another thousand...</i>

258
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:16,939
<i>then add five score.</i>

259
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:21,425
<i>The point of dissension is whether
it's named for a poem...</i>

260
00:34:21,462 --> 00:34:23,189
<i>or... the man himself.</i>

261
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,300
- Oh... Dr. Rosa!
- Welcome!

262
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,388
- Look who's here.
- Oh.

263
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,700
He's grown a bit, huh?

264
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,450
And this is Oliver.

265
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,634
Hey, boys!

266
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,248
<i>The ship went down in 1827

267

<i>And gossip has it this statue was

268

<i>Contalto Adelaide Malanotte.</i>

269
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,564
<i>There were four known sets

270
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
<i>This fellow is at number three.</i>

271
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,945
<i>The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,</i>

272
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,940
<i>But um... one of the more philistine
of the Parmesia popes melted them down...</i>

273
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,532
<i>and had them recast
as a particularly voluptuous Venus.</i>

274
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,205
Do you want to go for a swim
before we head back?

275
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,637
Elio!

276
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,551
Oliver!

277
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,684
- Hey! Hey!
- I have to go!

278
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,502
Goodness!

279
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,600
- Are you going too?
- No, no. I should stay and do some work on my book...

280
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,669
Oh, come on!
How about a drink to celebrate the day?

281
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
- Okay, maybe just one.
- Alright!

282
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,450
Marzia?

283

but that some things stay the same...</i>

287
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,850
Darling, have you seen my Heptameron?

288
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:41,661
It's in German.

289
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:49,101
I don't remember where we left off, but...

290
00:42:49,112 --> 00:42:51,263
I think you'll like this one.

291
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,005
So... I'll translate, heh.

292
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,350
<i>"A handsome young knight is madly in love with a princess...</i>

293
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,350
<i>and she too, is in love with him...</i>

294
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,418
<i>although she seems not to be entirely aware of it.</i>

295
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,800
<i>Despite the friendship... Freundschaft...</i>

296
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:28,200
<i>that blossoms between them, or...</i>

297
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:32,530
<i>perhaps because of that very friendship...</i>

298
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,344
<i>the young knight finds himself so...</i>

299
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,450
<i>though humbled and speechless...</i>

300
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:46,650
<i>that he is totally unable
to bring up the subject of his love.</i>

301
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:51,800
<i>Then, one day, he asks
to the princess, point blank:</i>

302
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,212
<i>'Is it better to speak or to die?'</i>

303
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,141
I'll never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

304
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,540
I doubt that.

<i>Hey...
Eli-belli...</i>

306
00:44:24,636 --> 00:44:28,500
You do know that you can always talk to us?

307
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,400
My mom's been reading this 16th century French romance.
.

308
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,600
She read some it of to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

309
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,350
Is it about the knight who doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

310
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,050
Right.

311
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,220
So does he or doesn't he?

312
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,166
"Better to speak," she said.

313
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,422
But she's on her guard.

314
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,719
She senses a trap somewhere.

315
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,110
So does he speak?

316
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,474
No.

317
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:11,480
He fudges.

318
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:16,113
It figures.
He's French.

319
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:27,298
- I gotta go to town in a litle bit to pick some things up.
- Oh, I can go. I'm not... doing anything today.

320
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,488
Then why don't we go together?

321
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:31,588
Right now?

322
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,186
Yeah.

323
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,850
Right now.

324
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,400
Unless, of course, you have
more important business going on.

325
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:40,146
(mumbles mockingly in reply)

326
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,450
Mind if I put this in your bag?

327
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,181
Yes, please.

328
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,458
I fell... just coming home the other day
and I... scraped myself pretty badly.

329
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:18,650
Anchise insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

330
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,717
I think it helped.

331
00:46:44,286 --> 00:46:47,799
Hold it for a second, would you?

332
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,474
- Want one?
- Sure.

333
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,601
Not bad, huh?

334
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,750
Not bad at all.

335
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,700
I thought you didn't smoke.

336
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:42,544
I don't.

337
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,750
It's World War II, huh?

338
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,000
Ah, no... this is World War I.

339
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,150
He has to be at least 80 years old
to have know any of them.

340
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:56,854
I've never even heard of the Battle of Piave.

341
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,050
The Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

342
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,049
A hundred and seventy thousand people died.

343
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,350
Is there anything you don't know?

344
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,562
I know nothing, Oliver.

345
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:17,650
Well... you seem to know more
than everyone else around here.

346
00:48:17,702 --> 00:48:22,627
If you only knew how little I know
about the things that really matter...

347
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,928
What things that matter?

348
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,504
You know what things.

349
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,064
Why are you telling me this?

350
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,828
Because I thought you should know.

351
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,499
Because you thought I should know?

352
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,865
Because I wanted you to know?

353
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:01,773
Because I wanted YOU to KNOW.

354
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:07,887
Because I wanted you to know.

355
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,733
Because I wanted you to know.

356
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,373
Because there's no-one else
I can say this to but you.

357
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,218
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

358
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:46,463
Don't go anywhere.
Stay right here.

359
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,313
You know I'm not going anywhere.

360
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,900
They mixed up all my pages.

361
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:22,422
I'm going to have to retype this whole thing.

362
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,270
I'm not going to have anything to work on this afternoon.
This is going to set me back a whole day.

363
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,150
Damn it.

364
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,750
I shouldn't have said anything.

365
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,200
Just pretend you never did.

366
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,528
Does that mean we're on speaking terms,
or not really?

367
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,000
It means we can't talk about those kinds of things.

368
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,185
Okay?

369
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,385
We just can't.

370
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,450
Hey!

371
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,433
- Ready?
- Let's go.

372
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,649
Pretty much.

373
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,114
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

374
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,300
<i>Il Duce.</i>

375
00:52:41,479 --> 00:52:43,521
That's Italy.

376
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Come on!

377
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,450
This is my spot.

378
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,250
It's all mine.

379
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,532
I come here to read.

380
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,614
I can't tell you the number of books I've read here.

381
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,650
Oh my God, it's freezing!

382
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,572
The spring is in the mountains.

383
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,095
<i>Two Alpi Orobie.</i>

384
00:54:10,169 --> 00:54:12,715
The water comes straight down from there.

385
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,350
I like the way you say things.

386
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,700
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

387
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,995
So you won't... I guess.

388
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:52,324
Are you really that afraid of what I think?

389
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:07,600
You're making things very difficult for me.

390
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,647
I love this, Oliver.

391
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,151
What?

392
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,999
Everything.

393
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,374
Us you mean?

394
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,071
Ah... it's not bad.

395
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,405
It's not bad.

396
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,150
Better now?

397
00:56:47,728 --> 00:56:51,916
Uh-uh.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

398
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,372
- We should go.
- Why?

399
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:57,251
I know myself, okay?
And we've been good.

400
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,500
We haven't done anything to be ashamed of.
And that's a good thing.

401
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,540
I want to be good.

402
00:57:02,618 --> 00:57:04,157
Okay?

403
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,690
Am I offending you?

404
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:21,553
Just don't.

405
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,353
I think it's starting to get infected.

406
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,465
Stop at the pharmacist on the way back?

407
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,235
Excellent idea.

408
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,834
Elio?

409
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,012
Elio!

410
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:23,086
Are you alright?

411
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,606
Sit for a second.

412
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,433
If you insist.

413
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,189
- It was not my fault, right?
- No.

414
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,687
I am a mess.

415
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,093
Well... the kitchen table sure is.

416
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,171
Arrgh... where did you learn that?

417
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,360
My Bubba used to do this for us
when we were sick.

418
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:59,017
Trust me, it helps.

419
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,560
- I used to have one of these.
- Used to?

420
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,655
- Yeah.
- How come you never wear it?

421
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,204
My mother says we are
Jews of discretion.

422
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:19,495
- I guess that works for your mother.
- Funny witch.

423
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:28,407
- Arrgh! You'll fucking kill me if you do that.
- Well, I hope not.

424
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,300
- Oh hey, are you leaving?
- Where is Elio?

425
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:44,500
He's inside. He had a bit of a nose bleed
during lunch and he's just resting.

426
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:45,920
- Oh, right?
- Yeah.

427
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,654
Okay, I'll be right back in a minute.
Don't go anywhere.

428
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,240
Traitor.

429
01:06:17,905 --> 01:06:19,720
Traitor.

430
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,580
Of course it is! Do not you see?

431
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:27,800
Because...

432
01:09:56,361 --> 01:10:00,311
<i>"Please don't avoid me. It kills me."
"I can't stand thinking you hate me."</i>

433
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:02,784
<i>"Your silence is killing me."
"I'd sooner die than know you hate me."</i>

434
01:10:02,822 --> 01:10:05,103
<i>"I am such a pussy."</i>

435
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:09,746
Way over the top!

436
01:10:18,755 --> 01:10:23,904
<i>"I can't stand the silence."
"Need to speak to you."</i>

437
01:10:45,577 --> 01:10:48,422
Did someone have a good night last night?

438
01:10:54,422 --> 01:10:56,759
Well, you must be tired then.

439
01:10:56,888 --> 01:11:00,838
- Or were you playing poker too?
- I don't play poker.

440
01:11:01,866 --> 01:11:06,298
Several hundred color slides of our boxer and
the others like him arrived yesterday from Berlin.

441
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:08,877
- Oh.
- We should start cataloging them.

442
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:12,360
- That'll keep us busy till lunch, I imagine.
- Sure.

443
01:11:14,644 --> 01:11:17,321
- Oh beautiful, aren't they?
- Mmm.

444
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:20,500
They're all so incredibly sensual.

445
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:23,811
Because these are more Hellenistic
than fifth century Athenian.

446
01:11:24,177 --> 01:11:27,871
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

447
01:11:29,177 --> 01:11:35,814
- Prax...iteles.
- Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

448
01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:02,296
<I>"Grow up.
I'll see you at midnight."</i>

449
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:15,230
<I>"Grow up.
I'll see you at midnight."</i>

450
01:12:17,377 --> 01:12:20,533
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.

451
01:12:20,644 --> 01:12:23,963
Not a straight body in these statues,
they're all curved.

452
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:31,127
Sometimes impossibly curved, and so... nonchalant.
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

453
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:35,182
As if they're daring you to desire them.

454
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:45,302
<i>... they have to be interpreted.</i>

455
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:56,321
Don't forget Issac and Mounir are coming up for dinner.

456
01:12:56,355 --> 01:12:57,911
Also known as "Sony and Cher".

457
01:12:57,911 --> 01:12:59,735
Okay...

458
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:02,444
I'd like you to wear that shirt they gave you for your birthday.

459
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,780
No.

460
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:07,502
- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
- I'm sorry, but it's too big. It's too big.

461
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,994
- Come on.

462
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:09,727
- It looks ridiculous on me.
- It would make them so happy.

463
01:13:09,743 --> 01:13:13,613
I'll try it on for Oliver. If Oliver thinks I look
like a scarecrow in it, I'm not wearing it.

464
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:15,236
Oliver?

465
01:13:16,422 --> 01:13:19,753
- Hey, what time have you got?
- It's two.

466
01:13:24,244 --> 01:13:28,237
- Well, later.
- Later.

467
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:41,066
Mafalda.

468
01:13:51,592 --> 01:13:53,411
- Hi.
- Hi.

469
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,400
Thanks.

470
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:28,621
- How are you?
- I'm good.

471
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:30,159
- Good to see you.
- It's great to see you.

472
01:17:38,394 --> 01:17:39,874
- Ah, no, no. I have to go.

473
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:42,958
- Okay.
- Have a good night.

474
01:17:49,423 --> 01:17:51,826
This right here...

475
01:17:51,841 --> 01:17:55,124
is the brand new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.

476
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,630
It looks wonderful.

477
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,658
- I can't put it on now, they've already met me.
- Yes, you can.

478
01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:06,951
It will look like a put-up job.
Papa, it will look like a put-up job.

479
01:18:07,051 --> 01:18:11,484
- No misbehaving tonight. No... no laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

480
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:14,668
You're too old not to accept people for who they are.
What's wrong with them?

481
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,832
What's wrong with them?
You call them "Sony and Cher" behind your back.

482
01:18:17,932 --> 01:18:19,900
That's what Mom calls them!

483
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:23,310
This only person that refects badly on is you.

484
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,165
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

485
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:31,400
If you know as much about economics at Mounir's age...

486
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:33,529
you'll be a very wise man indeed.

487
01:18:33,564 --> 01:18:36,384
And a... and a... and a credit to me.

488
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,345
Now... now, just get into this! You...

489
01:19:43,799 --> 01:19:45,209
Sorry, I have to go to bed.

490
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:46,824
Sorry, I am so tired.

491
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:48,411
Thank you.

492
01:19:50,768 --> 01:19:53,911
- Elio?
- Uh... thank you.

493
01:19:53,945 --> 01:19:55,345
Good night.

494
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:57,494
- Good night.
- Good night.

495
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:03,095
Do I know you?

496
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,220
<i>Thank you again for everything.</i>

497
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,893
I'm glad you came.

498
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,945
I'm nervous.

499
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,212
I like what you've done with the place.

500
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:10,442
It's nice.

501
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:39,217
Are you okay?

502
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,795
Are you okay?

503
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:14,100
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, please.

504
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:15,534
What are you doing?

505
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,669
Nothing.

506
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,823
Does it make you happy?

507
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,430
You're not going to get a nose bleed on me, are you?

508
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:36,717
I'm not getting...

509
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:08,216
Off, off, off, off, off!

510
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,300
Just pull it!

511
01:25:15,204 --> 01:25:17,049
Or I'll pull it.

512
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,500
Oliver...

513
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:34,632
Call me by your name and I call you by mine.

514
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,400
Elio.

515
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:42,056
Oliver.

516
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,244
Elio.

517
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,682
Oliver.

518
01:26:48,714 --> 01:26:50,314
Elio.

519
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,402
Did we make a noise?

520
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,560
Nothing to worry about.

521
01:27:06,612 --> 01:27:09,300
I don't know, Mafalda always looks for signs.

522
01:27:09,336 --> 01:27:12,395
We know she's not going to find any.

523
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:22,151
You wore that shirt the first day you were here.

524
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,520
Will you give it to me when you go?

525
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,322
Let's go swimming.

526
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:32,474
Are you going to hold what happened last night against me?

527
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,855
No.

528
01:30:42,795 --> 01:30:44,272
Hey there.

529
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:46,562
Come here!

530
01:30:51,129 --> 01:30:53,274
Take your trunks off!

531
01:31:08,225 --> 01:31:11,053
Well, that's promising.
You're hard again.

532
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:13,606
Good!

533
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:58,780
Professor, I got your note.
Er... thank you for reminding me.

534
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,573
I'm gonna go into town
and pick up those typed pages today.

535
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:03,329
So maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

536
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,678
Later.

537
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,415
We'll look them over later, before you leave.

538
01:32:09,415 --> 01:32:10,215
Okay.

539
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:12,418
So...  later!

540
01:32:12,543 --> 01:32:14,461
Later!

541
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,446
Oliver!

542
01:32:37,735 --> 01:32:39,752
You're not sick of me yet?

543
01:32:39,922 --> 01:32:43,003
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.

544
01:32:45,743 --> 01:32:48,834
I'll...   I'm gonna...   I'll go.

545
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:53,049
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

546
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:56,337
I don't know.

547
01:32:56,879 --> 01:32:59,729
Of course, you don't know.

548
01:33:00,425 --> 01:33:03,029
I don't want you to regret anything.

549
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:06,957
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have... messed you up.

550
01:33:07,432 --> 01:33:09,692
- I don't want either of us to pay for this.
- No, I...

551
01:33:09,767 --> 01:33:12,527
It's not like I'm gonna tell anyone... you...

552
01:33:12,802 --> 01:33:15,187
You're not going to be in any trouble.

553
01:33:15,273 --> 01:33:17,924
That's not what I'm talking about.

554
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:31,539
Are you happy I came here?

555
01:33:37,003 --> 01:33:40,285
I would kiss you if I could.

556
01:38:43,434 --> 01:38:45,385
What did you do?

557
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:46,924
Nothing!

558
01:38:56,352 --> 01:38:58,034
I see...

559
01:38:58,035 --> 01:39:00,145
You've moved onto the plant kingdom already.

560
01:39:00,188 --> 01:39:01,983
What's next? Minerals?

561
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:05,360
I suppose you've already given up animals.
You know that's me.

562
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:08,749
I'm sick, aren't I?

563
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,460
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

564
01:39:13,631 --> 01:39:14,540
Please don't do that.

565
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,594
- Do you want to see something sick?
- Please don't do that.

566
01:39:16,609 --> 01:39:18,862
- Do you want to see something sick?
- Please don't do this.

567
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:21,911
Hey! Please don't do this.

568
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,852
Why are you doing this to me?

569
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:28,938
Why are you doing this?

570
01:39:28,938 --> 01:39:30,147
You're fucking hurting me.

571
01:39:30,147 --> 01:39:33,016
Then don't fight.

572
01:39:54,505 --> 01:39:56,347
Sorry.

573
01:39:56,382 --> 01:39:58,287
It's okay.

574
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:22,002
I don't want you to go?

575
01:40:24,827 --> 01:40:27,446
God, we wasted so many days.

576
01:40:27,872 --> 01:40:29,123
Why didn't you give me a sign?

577
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:30,582
- I did!
- You didn't give me a sign?

578
01:40:30,582 --> 01:40:32,780
- I did!
- When?

579
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:35,279
Remember when we were playing volleyball...

580
01:40:35,307 --> 01:40:37,843
and I touched you?

581
01:40:38,382 --> 01:40:42,669
Just to show you, that I liked you...

582
01:40:42,887 --> 01:40:45,597
and the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

583
01:40:45,681 --> 01:40:46,565
I'm sorry.

584
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:50,689
No, that's fine.
I just decided I should keep my distance.

585
01:40:51,103 --> 01:40:53,452
I don't know.

586
01:40:56,901 --> 01:41:00,216
I come out here for
hours almost every night.

587
01:41:00,571 --> 01:41:02,930
I didn't know that.

588
01:41:04,575 --> 01:41:06,892
That's funny.  I didn't...

589
01:41:06,992 --> 01:41:08,528
I felt that...

590
01:41:08,746 --> 01:41:12,898
- Yeah, I know what you thought.
- Stop. Stop.

591
01:41:49,954 --> 01:41:54,665
"For Oliver.
  From Elio."

592
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:05,452
Elio!

593
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:25,890
I had to work.

594
01:42:30,452 --> 01:42:33,496
Yeah... I do not know.
I just er...

595
01:42:46,343 --> 01:42:49,847
I'm... I'm not your girl?

596
01:43:10,826 --> 01:43:13,754
Oliver has to go
to Bergamo for a few days.

597
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:14,755
Oh?

598
01:43:15,039 --> 01:43:17,548
Research at the university.

599
01:43:17,916 --> 01:43:20,521
And he'll fly home from Linate.

600
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:23,892
What about Elio?

601
01:43:25,633 --> 01:43:31,287
I mean maybe it could be nice for the two of them...
 to get away for a couple of days, no?

602
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,659
What do you think?

603
01:43:39,021 --> 01:43:40,716
You know you are our favorite student.

604
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:42,501
- You must come back.
- Are you sure you're not just saying that?

605
01:43:42,524 --> 01:43:43,400
Oliver!

606
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,697
Thank you very much, Professor.

607
01:43:46,778 --> 01:43:48,579
Ah, man.

608
01:43:49,865 --> 01:43:51,450
Please. Please.
Come back soon!

609
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:54,543
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

610
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,867
You're welcome.

611
01:43:57,748 --> 01:43:58,890
Well...

612
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:01,259
- Thank, you guys, so much.
- Oh, of course.

613
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:04,730
Oliver, Oliver.
Come back!

614
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:07,030
Come here. Come here.

615
01:44:07,049 --> 01:44:10,061
It's been amazing.
Thank you, guys.

616
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:11,270
Well...

617
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:12,638
Later, Perlmans.

618
01:44:12,721 --> 01:44:15,473
Later.
Later, later, later.

619
01:44:15,516 --> 01:44:17,050
- Ciao!
- Ciao.

620
01:44:17,053 --> 01:44:18,453
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci.

621
01:44:18,894 --> 01:44:19,961
- Ciao!
- Ciao!

622
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:27,912
Tell Elio to call when you get there.

623
01:44:31,156 --> 01:44:32,958
Oh no!

624
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,000
What?

625
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:04,820
Nothing.

626
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:05,560
What?

627
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:06,620
Nothing.

628
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,980
Oh, God!

629
01:47:51,165 --> 01:47:52,260
Come on.

630
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,120
This

631
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:09,120
Did you hear that?

632
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,736
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

633
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:14,880
No, no.

634
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,053
It's this way, come on!
You're missing it.

635
01:48:18,545 --> 01:48:20,145
Come on.

636
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:29,060
Hey guys. Don't stop.

637
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,980
This... this... you. You are...

638
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:43,720
Oh...

639
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:27,160
What did she say?

640
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,500
Did you get your passport?

641
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,200
Hello!

642
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,440
How are you?

643
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:01,360
Good.

644
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,622
You missed your dinner.

645
01:57:25,885 --> 01:57:27,678
So...

646
01:57:29,223 --> 01:57:30,480
Welcome home!

647
01:57:30,944 --> 01:57:32,746
Thanks.

648
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,560
Did Oliver enjoy the trip?

649
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,668
Yeah...  I think he did.

650
01:57:38,383 --> 01:57:41,459
You two had a nice friendship.

651
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:44,113
Yeah.

652
01:57:50,042 --> 01:57:53,510
You're too smart not to
know how rare...

653
01:57:54,562 --> 01:57:58,848
how special, what you two had was.

654
01:58:00,092 --> 01:58:03,080
Oliver was Oliver...

655
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,300
- Oliver may be very intelligent, but...
- No, no, no.

656
01:58:13,392 --> 01:58:16,578
He was more than intelligent.

657
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,920
What you two had...

658
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:23,760
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

659
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:26,200
He was good.

660
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:30,891
You were both lucky
to have found each other, because...

661
01:58:31,476 --> 01:58:34,413
you, too, are good.

662
01:58:40,365 --> 01:58:43,348
- I think he was better than me.
- Arrrhh...

663
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:46,369
I think he was better than me.

664
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:51,322
- I'm sure he'd say the same thing about you.
- Yeah?!

665
01:58:51,422 --> 01:58:53,060
He'd say the same thing?!

666
01:58:53,781 --> 01:58:56,610
Which flatters you both.

667
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:01,862
You know, when you least expect it...

668
01:59:02,624 --> 01:59:07,089
nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.

669
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:13,485
Just... remember, I'm here.

670
01:59:20,247 --> 01:59:23,205
Right now, you may not want to feel anything...

671
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,008
Maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

672
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:28,280
And ah...

673
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:33,886
maybe it's not to me
you want to speak about these things, but ah...

674
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:38,962
feel something, you obviously did.

675
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:45,084
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

676
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:48,340
Maybe more than a friendship.

677
01:59:48,767 --> 01:59:51,708
And I envy you.

678
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:56,840
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

679
01:59:57,454 --> 02:00:01,468
And pray their sons land on their feet. But...

680
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:05,959
I am not such a parent.

681
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:11,630
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster...

682
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:15,430
that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty.

683
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:21,230
And have less to offer each time
we start with someone new.

684
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:24,000
But to make yourself feel nothing...

685
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,830
so as not to feel anything...

686
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:30,760
What a waste!

687
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:41,830
Have I spoken out of turn?

688
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:47,630
Then I'll say one more thing.

689
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:52,600
It'll clear the air.

690
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:55,630
I may have come close...

691
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:59,667
but I never had
what you two have.

692
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:02,560
Something always...

693
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:04,560
held me back...

694
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:09,300
or stood in the way.

695
02:01:11,591 --> 02:01:15,560
How you live your life
is your business. Just...

696
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:18,500
remember...

697
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,946
Our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once.

698
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:25,000
And...

699
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:28,160
before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

700
02:01:28,744 --> 02:01:30,800
And... as for your body...

701
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:34,760
there comes a point when no-one looks at it...

702
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:39,600
much less wants to come near it.

703
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:41,600
Right now...

704
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:45,030
there's sorrow...

705
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,030
pain.

706
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,560
Don't kill it...

707
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,829
and with it, the joy you felt.

708
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:08,660
Does mom know?

709
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:16,130
I don't think she does.

710
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:30,800
Ooh... Latkes. (pancakes!

711
02:04:12,189 --> 02:04:14,189
(telephone rings)

712
02:04:14,702 --> 02:04:16,525
I'll get it.

713
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,030
<i>Elio?</i>

714
02:04:22,130 --> 02:04:23,600
<i>Are you there?</i>

715
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:24,830
Hi.

716
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:26,200
<i>It's me.</i>

717
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:27,500
How are you?

718
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:30,551
- <i>I'm good... good. How are you?</i>
- I'm good.

719
02:04:30,651 --> 02:04:31,960
- <i>How are your parents?</i>
- They're fine.

720
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:33,830
<i>Good.</i>

721
02:04:35,246 --> 02:04:37,500
I miss you.

722
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:42,130
<i>I miss you, too.
Very much.</i>

723
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:46,560
<i>I have some news.</i>

724
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,960
You.... news?

725
02:04:50,930 --> 02:04:52,930
Are you getting married?

726
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:54,800
I suppose...

727
02:04:56,500 --> 02:05:00,300
<i>I might be getting married next spring... yeah.</i>

728
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,560
You never said anything.

729
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:11,300
<i>It's been off and on for two years.</i>

730
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:15,960
That's wonderful news.

731
02:05:16,330 --> 02:05:18,700
<i>Do you mind?</i>

732
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:26,600
- Oliver!
- Oliver!

733
02:05:26,682 --> 02:05:27,682
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

734
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,760
When are you planning on coming back?

735
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,514
<i>I wish I was.</i>

736
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:34,130
You caught us in the process
of choosing the new you.

737
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:35,260
for next summer.

738
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:38,200
- And guess what...  he's a she!
- <i>Oh, right.</i>

739
02:05:38,208 --> 02:05:41,860
<i>Well,  speaking of news,
I'm calling to tell you guys I got engaged.</i>

740
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:44,300
- Arrrh... wonderful!
- Ohh...

741
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,530
- Congratulations!
- Mazel tov!

742
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:48,700
- Congratulations, Oliver.
- <i>Thank you. Thanks.</i>

743
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:50,600
Listen, we'll leave you...

744
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:52,360
We'll... we'll let you speak to Elio.

745
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:54,460
- Happy Hanukkah!
- Happy Hanukkah!

746
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:56,730
Bye, sweetheat.

747
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:06,400
They know about us.

748
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,130
<i>I figured.</i>

749
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:12,560
How?

750
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:15,960
<i>Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.</i>

751
02:06:16,330 --> 02:06:18,630
<i>He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.</i>

752
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,130
<i>Almost like a son-in-law.</i>

753
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:24,900
<i>You're so lucky.</i>

754
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:29,600
<i>My father would have carted me off
to a correctional institution.</i>

755
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:33,030
Elio?

756
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:40,497
<i>Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio,
Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio...</i>

757
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:46,300
<i>Oliver!</i>

758
02:06:46,930 --> 02:06:51,000
<i>I remember everything.</i>

759
02:10:53,641 --> 02:10:55,713
Elio?

760
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,262
Elio?
