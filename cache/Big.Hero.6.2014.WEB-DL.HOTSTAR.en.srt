00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,198
Come here, come here, come here.

168

You're going to love this.

169
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,002
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,

170
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:00,564
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

171
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:03,095
super-heated to 500 Kelvin,
and...

172
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,312
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

173
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:10,768
It's so pink.

174
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,613

179
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,700
"Honey Lemon"?
"Go Go"? "Wasabi"?

180

with the nicknames.

183

my real face and body.

187

The name's Fred.

188
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,614

but by night...

192

No, no, no, I'm not a student.

193
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,591
But I am a major science enthusiast.

194
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,735
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

195
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,699
that can turn me into a
fire-breathing lizard at will.

196
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,036
But she says that's "not science."

197
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,220
It's really not.

198
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,878
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

199
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:04,711
I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either.

200

- Is it?
- Nope.

205

HONEY LEMON: What?

206
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,872
FRED: Tingly fingers?
WASABI: Never gonna happen.

207

FRED: Hey, what about
a growth serum, huh?

208
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:20,056
So, uh, what have
you been working on?

Your personal
healthcare companion.

220
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:05,212
I was alerted to the need

221
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,546
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

224
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,534
Physical or emotional?

225
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,793
I will scan you now.

228
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:26,500
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

229
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,108
I suggest
an anti-bacterial spray.

230
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

231
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,644
What's in the spray, specifically?

232
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,635
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

233
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:35,903
(CLICKS TONGUE)
That's a bummer.

234
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,169
I'm actually allergic to that.

235
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:39,167
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

236
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:41,391
You do have a mild allergy to

237
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,612
peanuts.

238
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,232
Hmm. Not bad.

239

You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:49,827
Uh-huh. Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

241
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:53,360
This chip is what
makes Baymax, Baymax.

243
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,152
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

244
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,294
Looks like
a walking marshmallow.

- No offense.
- BAYMAX: I am a robot.

246
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,170
I cannot be offended.

- Titanium skeleton?
- TADASHI: Carbon fiber.

251
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,916
Right. Even lighter. (GASPS)

252

Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

Oh, machined them
right here, in-house.

Well then,
I'm satisfied with my care.

261

He's going to help
a lot of people.

262
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,117
Hey, what kind of battery
does it use?

263
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,224
Lithium ion.

264
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,953
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

265

his career in bot-fighting.

Well, kind of serious.

00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,132
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

988
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:20,197
- Yes! It's a bird!
- No!

989
00:50:20,423 --> 00:50:22,235
The guy in the mask
was carrying something

990
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,493
with this symbol on it.

991
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:26,685
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

992
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:28,369
Apprehend him?

993
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:29,822
We don't even know who he is.

994
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:31,515
I have a theory.

995
00:50:32,815 --> 00:50:34,473
WASABI: "Dr. Slaughter, MD"?

996
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:36,582
Actually,
millionaire weapons designer,

997
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:38,004
Malcolm Chazzletick.

998
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:39,453
"The Annihilator"?

999
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:43,064
Behind the mask,
industrialist Reid Axworthy.

1000
00:50:43,863 --> 00:50:47,094
"Baron von Destruct"?
Oh, just get to the point!

1001
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:48,391
Don't you guys get it?

1002
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,737
The man in the mask who attacked us

1003
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,237
is none other than...

1004
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:53,839
<i>Voilà!</i>

1005
00:50:53,953 --> 00:50:55,110
Alistair Krei.

1006
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:56,763
- What?
- FRED: Think about it.

1007
00:50:56,984 --> 00:50:58,140
Krei wanted your microbots,

1008
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,248
and you said no.

1009
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:01,780
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

1010
00:51:02,086 --> 00:51:04,705
HIRO: There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

1011
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,655
Then who was that guy in the mask?

1012
00:51:06,882 --> 00:51:08,387
(STAMMERING) I don't know.

1013
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:10,490
We don't know anything about him.

1014
00:51:10,718 --> 00:51:12,867
BAYMAX:
His blood type is AB-negative.

1015
00:51:13,096 --> 00:51:14,330
Cholesterol levels are...

1016
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,597
Baymax, you scanned him?

1017
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,548
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

1018
00:51:18,736 --> 00:51:20,045
Yes! (LAUGHS)

1019
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,502
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

1020
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:25,192
Uh, you'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

1021
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:28,216
That might take, I don't know, forever.

1022
00:51:28,442 --> 00:51:29,795
No, no, no, no. I...

1023
00:51:29,938 --> 00:51:31,935
I just have to look for another angle.

1024
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:33,513
Got it!

1025
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:35,624
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

1026
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:38,039
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

1027
00:51:40,987 --> 00:51:42,754
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

1028
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:45,215
I need to upgrade all of you.

1029
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:46,479
Upgrade who, now?

1030
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,081
Those who suffer a loss require support

1031
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,932
from friends and loved ones.

1032
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:53,379
(LAUGHS) Oh, okay,
I like where this is heading!

1033
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:55,954
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

1034
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,455
Hiro, we want to help,

1035
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,525
but we're just us.

1036
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:00,783
No.

1037
00:52:00,974 --> 00:52:04,008
You can be way more.

1038
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,345
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

1039

You guys, do you feel this?

1041
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,865
Our origin story begins.

1044
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:21,386
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

1045
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:24,615
We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.
