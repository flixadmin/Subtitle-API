00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,130
<i>Hi, I'm Don Hahn, I'm
the producer of</i> Lion King.

2
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:23,132
<i>I'm Rob Minkoff,
director</i> of The Lion King.

3
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,301
<i>And Roger Allers, director of</i> Lion King.

4
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,220
HAHN: <i>And we're here to
perform the top 40 hits for you.</i>

5
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:30,890
<i>No, we're here to comment for
you on the making</i> of The Lion King.

6
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,850
<i>Kind of share some of
our experiences with you,</i>

7
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,602
<i>right here in your own living room.</i>

8
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:38,565
MINKOFF: <i>The project started,
actually, as</i> King of the Jungle.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,319
<i>And the original concept was to
do a picture in Africa about lions,</i>

10
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:45,988
<i>but no one at the time knew
what the story was gonna be.</i>

11
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:50,701
HAHN: <i>Then it kind of evolved
from there into being an original story,</i>

12
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:51,994
<i>which is unique for us.</i>

13
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,288
<i>Usually we do stories based on fairytales</i>

14
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:56,165
<i>or novels or bits of literature.</i>

15
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:00,963
<i>But</i> Lion King <i>was unique in that
it was completely out of thin air.</i>

16
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:04,341
<i>Even though it was informed
by a little bit of</i> Hamlet,

17
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,009
<i>little bit of Old Testament Bible stories</i>

18
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:09,429
<i>like Joseph or Moses, that kind of thing.</i>

19
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:10,847
MINKOFF: <i>Originally, in
the opening of the picture</i>

20
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:12,057
<i>we were going to have a dialog scene</i>

21
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,309
<i>to introduce the characters,
to introduce baby Simba,</i>

22
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:17,229
<i>introduce Rafiki as the shaman
coming to bless the child.</i>

23
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:18,939
ALLERS: <i>Right. Actually, we had scenes</i>

24
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:21,066
<i>of animals walking to Pride Rock.</i>

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,234
<i>And then we had Zazu talking about,</i>

26
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:23,860
<i>"Everybody, get in the line.
Get in the line.</i>"

27
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:26,780
<i>There was so much chatter,
and at that time also, Rafiki,</i>

28
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:28,824
<i>no one knew who Rafiki was.</i>

29
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:31,368
<i>But when we heard Hans' version</i>

30
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:35,497
<i>of how he Africanized</i> Circle
of Life, <i>we all just went crazy.</i>

31
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,291
HAHN: <i>In four minutes of music,</i>

32
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,209
<i>Elton John and Tim Rice, God bless them,</i>

33
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:44,132
<i>created this beautiful…
What became an anthem for the movie</i>

34
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:48,261
<i>that defined the spirit of the
movie and the theme of the movie.</i>

35
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:51,973
MINKOFF: <i>In the shot where
we rack focus from the ants</i>

36
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,225
<i>in the foreground to the
zebras in the background,</i>

37
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:57,937
<i>that was the concept from the storyboard,</i>

38
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,731
<i>where we were literally
trying to do something</i>

39
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:01,774
<i>that's very common
in a live action picture</i>

40
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:05,069
<i>but is very rarely seen or never
seen in an animated picture,</i>

41
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:08,323
<i>which is literally to use the
focal length of the camera.</i>

42
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:11,409
<i>But in our case we have to
replicate what that might look like</i>

43
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,912
<i>under these circumstances
where it's artificially done.</i>

44
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:16,372
<i>And yet gives you that sort of sense</i>

45
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:19,376
<i>that you're really
looking at a real world.</i>

46
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:23,130
HAHN: <i>The whole fly-in scene
where you reveal the African savanna</i>

47
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:24,465
<i>and you see Pride
Rock for the first time,</i>

48
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,386
<i>Pride Rock is kind of
like the castle for the lions,</i>

49
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:32,097
<i>is all done in one continuous shot.
It's all done in one.</i>

50
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:34,391
<i>You go from this vast
overview of the savanna</i>

51
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:37,561
<i>into a close-up of
Mufasa without cutting.</i>

52
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,897
<i>Now, the great thing with
this shot of Rafiki coming up,</i>

53
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:43,901
<i>it gives you the feeling of sunlight
filtering through the characters.</i>

54
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:46,570
<i>And it's all the great
CAPS magical tricks</i>

55
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:50,074
<i>that you can do with special
effects, animation and graphics.</i>

56
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,661
MINKOFF: <i>Or the clouds which are
actually a flat two-dimensional painting</i>

57
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:55,788
<i>which is skewed by the computer.</i>

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,457
ALLERS: <i>"Skewing" means
it kind of stretches it out.</i>

59
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,708
HAHN: <i>And always when
we previewed the film,</i>

60
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,252
<i>I remember going to the
Pasadena theater for the first time</i>

61
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:05,799
<i>where we previewed it, and little
Simba turns around for the first time,</i>

62
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:09,386
<i>-always was a surefire</i> "aw."
-MINKOFF: <i>It's an "aw shucks" moment.</i>

63
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,138
HAHN: <i>And the funny
thing about</i> Circle of Life,

64
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:13,181
<i>it's a great stand-alone piece</i>

65
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:15,517
<i>because without giving
anything about the movie away,</i>

66
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:19,104
<i>it kind of gives you a sense of
epic scale in Africa and all that stuff.</i>

67
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:20,689
<i>And it went out in November.</i>

68
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,232
<i>Six months before the movie was released.</i>

69
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,274
MINKOFF: <i>That's right, exactly,</i>

70
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:24,651
<i>and the thing that we
were all so worried about</i>

71
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,986
<i>was that nobody would know
what the title of this movie was,</i>

72
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,905
<i>because they hadn't heard it before.</i>

73
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,281
<i>That was a big concern.</i>

74
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,659
HAHN: <i>"Do you think people are gonna go?"</i>

75
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>Here's something that
the folks in the theater</i>

76
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,912
<i>probably would never care about.</i>

77
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:37,831
<i>But we really cared about
trying to get all the clouds</i>

78
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:39,499
<i>in the background to match speed.</i>

79
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,295
MINKOFF: <i>There are
several different paintings</i>

80
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,841
<i>of Pride Rock that we had
to match from one to the next.</i>

81
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:49,593
ALLERS: <i>The cliff he stands
on, because you get so close to it,</i>

82
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,595
<i>was painted really large
so that when you got close</i>

83
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:55,182
<i>the detail was clear for
the large movie screen.</i>

84
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:59,186
<i>But had to be shrunk down to fit
onto Pride Rock, so all those things.</i>

85
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,605
<i>How many levels do you think we had?</i>

86
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,023
<i>How many background levels?</i>

87
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:05,526
MINKOFF: <i>Too numerous
to mention at this point.</i>

88
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,278
ALLERS: <i>Those are the sort
of things people like to hear</i>

89
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,863
<i>-but we don't remember them.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Yeah.</i>

90
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,656
HAHN: <i>That's one of the great
things about the CAP system,</i>

91
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,578
<i>which is our fancy computerized
animation production system,</i>

92
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:19,373
<i>where you can put together
seemingly endless levels of animation</i>

93
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,209
<i>and backgrounds, and
clouds and effects and things,</i>

94
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,796
<i>and sandwich them together
without being limited by reality</i>

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,798
<i>because it's all done
in a digital universe.</i>

96
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:30,218
MINKOFF: <i>Right, it is the
ultimate multi-plane camera.</i>

97
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,804
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>We're rarely limited by reality.</i>

<i>Ah, the mouse.</i>

101
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,695
<i>Great scene by Brian Ferguson.</i>

102

<i>-I think it's interesting…</i>
-ALLERS: <i>No, he gave us… Sorry.</i>

103
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,240
MINKOFF: <i>I was just
gonna say that it's interesting</i>

104
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,575
<i>that the very first line of dialog</i>

105
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,244
<i>you hear in the movie
is, "Life's not fair.</i>"

106
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,122
HAHN: <i>Yeah, 'cause there was
no dialog in the opening song at all.</i>

107
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:02,793
You see, I… Well, I shall never be king.

108
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,839
MINKOFF: <i>So in that introductory scene,</i>

109
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:09,175
<i>where we've got all the
characters talking for the first time,</i>

110
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:13,137
<i>we've got Scar, who was
animated by Andreas Deja.</i>

111
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:15,556
HAHN: <i>And Zazu, who was
animated by Ellen Woodbury.</i>

112
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,849
<i>What's amazing about Ellen is</i>

113
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,644
<i>I've never seen anybody get into
a character as much as she would.</i>

114
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,938
<i>She would flap around the
studio and pretend she was a bird.</i>

115
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:26,234
<i>She'd do all the research you could
possibly imagine on a hornbill bird.</i>

116
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,695
You'll lose more than that when
the king gets through with you.

117
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,365
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

118

what a guy he was, huh?</i>

119
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:37,912
MINKOFF: <i>Sure was.</i>

120
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,413
HAHN: <i>It's funny,
'cause I think both Jeremy</i>

121

<i>and Rowan Atkinson who plays Zazu here,</i>

122
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,750
<i>they were really reluctant
about lending their voices</i>

123
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,045
<i>to an animated character,
because a lot of who they are</i>

124
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,298
<i>is their persona and their
personality and their appearance.</i>

125
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,760
<i>And so we had to record a
test and animate something</i>

126
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,971
<i>so they could see how their
characters started to come to life,</i>

00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,472
<i>and then they were seduced by it.</i>

128
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,475
MINKOFF: <i>Actually, I heard an
interesting story from Jeremy's agent,</i>

00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,353
<i>who said that they were having
dinner together at Morton's restaurant,</i>

<i>This is one of the biggest pieces

HAHN: <i>You'd never know.</i>

137
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:19,997
<i>It's interesting about art
direction, things like lighting</i>

138
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:22,249
<i>that you never notice or think
of as an audience perhaps,</i>

139
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,835
<i>but there's a real light direction in
the mouth of the cave that comes in,</i>

140
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,797
<i>and our effects animators put
tone mattes on the characters</i>

141
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,174
<i>so that there's a sense of
light and dark on the character</i>

142
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,302
<i>to create a light direction.</i>

00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,639
<i>Nice growl.</i>

145
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,267
ALLERS: <i>That was always
tough, trying to get the lion growl</i>

146
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:43,563
<i>to sort of interface with James's dialog.</i>

147
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:47,233
<i>Because I remember in some of
the sessions, he would do these…</i>

148
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,193
<i>"Is that a challenge?"</i>

149
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,779
HAHN: <i>Well, Mark Mangini,
again, who did some of the growls</i>

150
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,364
<i>for the Beast in</i> Beauty and the Beast,

151
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,575
<i>had put together real
tiger and animal growls</i>

152
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:58,703
<i>with dialog in</i> Beauty, <i>and he used a
little bit of that same technique here,</i>

153
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:00,580
<i>where he could play a little animal growl</i>

154
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:04,751
<i>underneath James Earl's
voice and get a sense of animal.</i>

155
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:07,755
What am I going to do with him?

156
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,423
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

157
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,507
Zazu!

158
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,135
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

159
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:15,304
you could take him out and beat him.

160
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:19,266
ALLERS: <i>Now, the scenes coming up really
were inspired by our trip to Africa.</i>

161
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,810
<i>I mean, these are practically photographs</i>

162
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,479
<i>that we brought back with us.</i>

163
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:26,399
<i>I remember standing out in this field.</i>

164
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:31,612
HAHN: <i>I was standing in this field,
watching the rain drifting across.</i>

165
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:33,572
ALLERS: <i>It's a great place.</i>

166
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:38,369
<i>Huge expanses where the weather
can be so separate in different parts…</i>

167
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,955
MINKOFF: <i>Originally, this
scene, the lightning scene</i>

168
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,748
<i>-was done without this tree.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>That's right.</i>

169
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:44,291
MINKOFF: <i>We had to add
this tree when we came back</i>

170
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,378
<i>to add Rafiki into the sequence.</i>

171
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:48,797
HAHN: <i>We did a preview where
Rafiki wasn't as present in the movie</i>

172
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:52,509
<i>as we would like, and so we put
him into this sequence at a later date.</i>

173
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,260
MINKOFF: <i>And added
the idea of the icon as well.</i>

174
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,512
<i>The Simba icon that he was drawing,</i>

175
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:58,139
<i>which actually carries through
thematically through the whole piece.</i>

176
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,100
<i>Of course he does have…</i>

177
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:03,311
<i>What was the thing about this?
The pink? The pink chalk?</i>

178
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,438
<i>Is it pink in his…</i>

179
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:08,525
ALLERS: <i>Yeah, if you
look, the color is different</i>

180
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,485
<i>in the bowl than it is on what he paints</i>

181
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,696
<i>on the thing. Another little mistake.</i>

182
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:17,283
Dad! Dad!

183
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,785
HAHN: <i>One thing we found
out about lions really early</i>

184
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,829
<i>is they just sleep all the time.</i>

185
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,455
<i>And this is our sleeping lion scene.</i>

186
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:24,624
-MINKOFF: <i>They sleep together, too.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

187
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,461
MINKOFF: <i>It's interesting how they,
in the king and queen's throne room</i>

188
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:29,630
<i>we've got basically everyone else.
It's a commune.</i>

189
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:32,675
HAHN: <i>Because in nature it's
usually one lion and many lionesses.</i>

190
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,511
<i>Or occasionally, brothers rule a
pride, which is what this story is about.</i>

191
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,514
-ALLERS: <i>Right.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Interesting.</i>

192
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,599
You promised.

193
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,059
MINKOFF: <i>And Jonathan
was really incredible, too.</i>

194
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:45,730
<i>We went through so many
audition tapes of child actors</i>

195
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:50,776
<i>to find Jonathan who had
such a great natural ability to act</i>

196
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,653
<i>and had such an interesting quirky voice.</i>

197
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:54,155
ALLERS: <i>Yeah, he was terrific.</i>

198
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,990
MINKOFF: <i>And he's also on
the cover</i> of Tiger Beat <i>magazine.</i>

199
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:58,374
<i>-I think that's important to note.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

200
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:01,246
MUFASA: Look, Simba.

201
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:05,291
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

202
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:06,918
Wow.

203
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:08,670
A king's time…

204
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,590
HAHN: <i>This shot is amazing
because it's a camera dolly</i>

205
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:14,384
<i>around the character, which is
very unconventional in animation.</i>

206
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:18,722
<i>And to do it, we actually started
with kind of a computer framework</i>

207
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:22,017
<i>to show how the camera might
move around these characters.</i>

208
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:25,353
ALLERS: <i>Yeah, we built a very
simple model of Mufasa and Simba</i>

209
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,522
<i>on the cliff and rotated around</i>

210
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,858
<i>so that the animator
would have an underpinning,</i>

211
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,860
<i>an understructure to
put his animation on.</i>

212
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,445
-HAHN: <i>It was Chris Wahl, wasn't it?</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Yeah.</i>

213
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,572
HAHN: <i>And Chris followed
that computer guideline</i>

214
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,282
<i>so you get, in that final scene,</i>

215
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,950
<i>a feeling that the
camera's actually moving</i>

216
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:41,161
<i>around the characters, which is great.</i>

217
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,705
<i>It helps that sense of
reality and mood and place.</i>

218
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,041
MINKOFF: <i>That's the kind
of thing we are trying to do</i>

219
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,795
<i>throughout the whole picture,
was take you into the image.</i>

220
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,214
HAHN: <i>Yeah, have more of
a sense of cinematography.</i>

221
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,382
-MINKOFF: <i>Exactly.</i>
-HAHN: <i>I always loved this shot.</i>

222
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,927
<i>The idea of sound effects,
you hear a little grass</i>

223
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,429
<i>with the antelope running through,
and you get the huge perspective</i>

224
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,389
<i>of antelope in the foreground
and then middle ground,</i>

225
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:04,560
<i>and then they show up way in the
distance towards the end of the shot.</i>

226
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:07,021
ALLERS: <i>I was just gonna
say not in an animation way,</i>

227
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,731
<i>but just in terms of a scripting way,</i>

228
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,568
<i>the idea of having Mufasa talk about</i>

229
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,114
<i>that they eat other animals
was really important to me.</i>

230
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,991
<i>I always thought this
is a really great idea.</i>

231
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,661
<i>I thought it would be great
to ennoble the whole idea</i>

232
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,872
<i>of the balance of life,</i>

233
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:27,416
<i>the prey-predator and
how it's all connected.</i>

234
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,878
<i>Remember the joke we had at
one point where he was saying,</i>

235
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,256
<i>"And we're all connected
in the great circle of life."</i>

236
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,175
<i>And we had an antelope
off in the distance.</i>

237
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,095
<i>"Isn't that right, Joe?"
"Right you are, Mufasa.</i>"

238
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,806
<i>"Catch you later, Joe.</i>"
<i>"Not if I can help it.</i>"

239
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,808
HAHN: <i>Then he takes off in the distance.</i>

240
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,852
<i>There was a song here at one time.
There was a big…</i>

241
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,145
MINKOFF: <i>Oh.</i>

242
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,646
-To Be King.
-HAHN: To Be King,

243
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,106
<i>which was Dad's day out.</i>

244
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,276
<i>In the storyboard, and in the original
outline, it always said, "Dad's day out.</i>"

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,695
<i>And it was a male-bonding
day between dad and son.</i>

246
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,948
<i>But it just never quite fired up.
You never believed Mufasa</i>

247
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,660
<i>out there in the woods,
singing and dancing.</i>

248
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,913
<i>Here comes my favorite
character in the film.</i>

249
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,582
<i>This little sweet groundhog</i>

250
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,866
<i>who always in previews
got the biggest laugh.</i>

251
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,963
ALLERS: <i>He was going
to be a naked mole rat,</i>

252
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,464
<i>but we couldn't get
the thing to look right.</i>

253
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,216
HAHN: <i>But we couldn't get the rights.</i>

254
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,135
<i>-He had a tough agent.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>It's true.</i>

255
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,803
ALLERS: <i>We would
have lost our</i> "G" <i>rating.</i>

256
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,805
HAHN: <i>But it's funny underground humor.</i>

257
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,931
MINKOFF: <i>It is.</i>

258
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,725
<i>-It's a throwback to World War II.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

259
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,852
<i>And</i> Hogan's Heroes.

260
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,730
MINKOFF: <i>Yes, and this line.
Setting up the hyenas.</i>

261
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,648
<i>Remember? We had a different line there.</i>

262
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,443
HAHN: <i>It was a transitional scene
trying to not only set up the hyenas,</i>

263
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,695
<i>but get you led back to
Scar and what he's doing.</i>

264
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,030
MINKOFF: <i>Right.</i>

265
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,657
<i>This was also one of the
very earliest scenes done.</i>

266
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,410
ALLERS: <i>That's the first scene,
wasn't it, of Scar by Andreas?</i>

267
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,662
MINKOFF: <i>Yeah. First scene animated.</i>

268
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,331
HAHN: <i>There's a neat
lighting thing going on here, too,</i>

269
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,416
<i>because whenever you see
young Simba, he's out in the sunlight</i>

270
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,877
<i>and looking out over
the vast Pride Lands.</i>

271
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,671
<i>And then whenever you see Scar,
he's under the overhang of the cliff,</i>

272
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:57,343
<i>in the shadows, symbolically
being the nasty one.</i>

273
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,553
<i>Gary Trousdale storyboarded this scene.</i>

274
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:02,348
<i>It's funny because you never
see the storyboard drawings,</i>

275
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:05,601
<i>but it's always the point of departure
for what the scene ultimately looks like.</i>

276
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:09,521
<i>And so Gary's attitudes and the
way this whole scene was boarded out</i>

277
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,982
<i>started long before the animation.</i>

278
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,653
MINKOFF: <i>That's Simba, who
was animated by Mark Henn.</i>

279
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:19,823
HAHN: <i>And Scar animated by Andreas Deja.</i>

280
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,701
<i>It's really great to see two great
animators acting with each other.</i>

281
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,371
<i>This is one of the purest
scenes where you can see that.</i>

282
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,874
<i>Two great guys who
know what they're doing,</i>

283
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,128
<i>with great voices to work
with, just acting like crazy.</i>

284
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,757
ALLERS: <i>What's interesting is that

MINKOFF: <i>In the design
process we usually start with</i>

291
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:53,942
<i>a conception of the
character from the imagination.</i>

292
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,902
<i>And once we actually attach a voice to it</i>

293
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,446
<i>and hire the actor and
start recording that actor,</i>

294
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,075
<i>then the lead animator of that
character takes on that character</i>

295
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,246
<i>and literally starts to work with
it and define it and refocus it.</i>

296
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,624
<i>And a lot of times they are so
influenced by the look of the actor</i>

297
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,296
<i>that it can't help but manifest
itself in the final design.</i>

298
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,842
HAHN: <i>I love this shot where
Simba is running down the hill</i>

299
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:20,803
<i>past the lionesses
basking in the dapple light.</i>

300
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,555
<i>It seems simple, but I remember</i>

<i>everybody trying to
get the dapple light right</i>

302
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:28,477
<i>because sunlight filtering through
trees in animation ain't so easy.</i>

303
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:31,439
<i>So, getting the effects animators
to work together with the art director</i>

304
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:33,733

305
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:38,571
ALLERS: <i>This all came from a
pre-production sketch by Andy Gaskill.</i>

00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,615
<i>He was just exploring
different environments of</i>

307

<i>where the lions would live,
and he did this beautiful thing</i>

<i>of the lions sleeping on a dappled ledge.</i>

309
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:51,251
<i>And we pretty much just lifted it
right off and stuck it right in the film.</i>

310

HAHN: <i>We should talk about Niketa
a little bit. We never mentioned her.</i>

313

And we ended up with Niketa,</i>

314
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,266
<i>who was really natural.
I think that was her forte.</i>

315

<i>She was just herself and brought
so much edge and character to Nala.</i>

<i>It was great.</i>

317
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:13,065
MINKOFF: <i>It's actually interesting…</i>

318
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,858
<i>I was gonna say that
it's interesting because</i>

319
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:18,153
<i>one of the issues we had
to deal with in this film was</i>

320
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,989
<i>it was taking place in Africa,
and although it was animated,</i>

321
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:25,035
<i>how are we gonna cast the characters
in terms of their ethnic background?</i>

322
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:28,205
<i>So, we had James Earl Jones,
who's obviously African-American,</i>

323
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:33,419
<i>and we have him with a son
who is Matthew Broderick,</i>

324
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,546
<i>who is obviously not African-American.</i>

325
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,174
<i>And yet we have Niketa
Calame who is African-American,</i>

326
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:40,843
<i>growing up to be Moira Kelly who is not.</i>

327
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,429
<i>So, we had this big jumble and big mix-up</i>

328
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:45,223
<i>of characters and things.</i>

329
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,643
<i>And what was interesting about
this film is that we could really</i>

330
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:53,731
<i>literally be color blind as
far as it not mattering at all.</i>

331
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,691
<i>It was really about
who the character was,</i>

332
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:58,775
<i>who the performer was and
what they brought to the character.</i>

333
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:01,489
HAHN: <i>It's almost a nice
commentary on how everyone's voice</i>

334
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,866
<i>blended together to
create this piece of theater.</i>

335
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,660
MINKOFF: <i>Also we have
Jonathan Taylor Thomas</i>

336
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,538
<i>as the voice actor for Simba,</i>

337
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:11,249
<i>and when we go into the song
he becomes Jason Weaver.</i>

ALLERS: <i>Right.
Yeah, who played Michael Jackson.</i>

339
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,799
HAHN: <i>The other thing going
into</i> Can't Wait to Be King,

340
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:21,593
<i>it was one of the first
songs that came in.</i>

341
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:24,138
<i>And it was meant to be
kind of a peppy upbeat</i>

342
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,848
<i>kids' point of view of Africa.</i>

343
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:28,809
<i>But the challenge was always to
try to reflect that in the art direction.</i>

344
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:32,521
<i>And our production designer
Chris Sanders took that challenge on</i>

345
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:34,606
<i>and created a look for this song</i>

346
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,067
<i>that was pretty unique
to the rest of the film.</i>

347
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,820
MINKOFF: <i>Right, it was supposed
to be really literally from Simba's</i>

348
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:43,740
<i>point of view, so the idea
was to evoke brighter colors</i>

349
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:46,785
<i>and bolder patterns and shapes</i>

350
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,079
<i>so that it would feel more childlike.</i>

351
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,832
<i>And interestingly, because we
knew we had this departure to make,</i>

352
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,918
<i>in terms of going
from reality to fantasy,</i>

353
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:58,089
<i>we decided to bring the audience
there by a very, very abrupt change</i>

354
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,633
<i>so that they would be aware, literally,</i>

355
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:04,304
<i>of the change of tempo and tone and idea.</i>

356
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:07,516
HAHN: <i>The idea during
the kind of the trees going by</i>

357
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,267
<i>is you got Simba and Nala
chasing in one direction,</i>

358
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:12,145
<i>and you have all these palm trees
panning by in the other direction.</i>

359
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:15,398
<i>And the idea was to try
to make them strobe by</i>

360
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:17,692
<i>and subconsciously
do this little hula thing.</i>

361

rhino butt, a guaranteed laugh.</i>

actually they gave us a little template.</i>

364
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:29,120
<i>CGI worked out a little
template for the log in the river,</i>

365
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:33,042
<i>again to help us move the characters
through a moving camera point of view.</i>

366

HAHN: <i>I love that transition
between the ripples in the water</i>

367
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,128
<i>into zebra stripes, too,</i>

368
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:38,297
<i>those kinds of things
that you can do in a song</i>

369

by with at other places.</i>

370
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,260

problems, too, is if we had taken</i>

371
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:45,137
<i>the animals from</i> The Circle of Life

372

-…it <i>would look really terrible.</i>

374
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:53,479
<i>So we had to go more stylized to
allow the animals more free reign</i>

375
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:56,274
<i>to be silly and comic.</i>

African artwork and textiles</i>

<i>and patterns and fabrics, and

<i>The ending shot of this

hornbill trapped under a rhino's butt.</i>

<i>it's all elephant graveyard,
moody and mysterious.</i>

MINKOFF: <i>You see all that
dust moving in the foreground,</i>

<i>which is actually done
by a computer program.</i>

who worked on our movie named</i>

<i>Randy Fullmer, who kind of corralled
all this. His job is artistic coordinator,</i>

in our scene planning department</i>

<i>and moving through

<i>Scott Santoro was the head of
our special effects department,</i>

416
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:48,513
<i>and normally with special effects
you think of rocket ships and laser guns</i>

<i>and big explosions,
which is absolutely true.</i>

418

have the kind of side of it that's</i>

<i>lighting and shadow and subtlety.</i>

420

<i>so in a sequence like this

<i>it's loaded with shadows and
tone mattes and lighting effects</i>

<i>on all these characters

<i>Not a fun task, but, boy,</i>

become very three-dimensional.</i>

437
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,198
MINKOFF: <i>You can also see in
terms of like what the CAP system does,</i>

438
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:49,659
<i>when Zazu's bill goes
from yellow to orange,</i>

<i>there's a blend happening
between those two colors</i>

440

<i>which was something that
we're able to do with a computer.</i>

HAHN: <i>That you couldn't
have done five years ago.</i>

<i>If this were</i> Fantasia <i>back in the '40s,</i>

<i>you would have airbrushed all that,</i>

444

around and been very fragile.</i>

MINKOFF: <i>This is great. I remember
one day we were working on the movie,</i>

Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella,</i>

reds and stuff on the screen.</i>

<i>That's the great thing about animation</i>

477
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,583
HAHN: <i>These got to be
really complex scenes in here</i>

478
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,752
<i>'cause you had six characters
on the screen, on and off,</i>

HAHN: <i>I remember we
experimented with real animal growls</i>

489
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:50,324
<i>and young cubs sound like kittens almost.</i>

490
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,576
<i>This is like a grizzly
bear, mixed with a tiger,</i>

492
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,624
MINKOFF: <i>One of the big
challenges of doing</i> The Lion King

493
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,376
<i>was the fact that it
was an all-animal story</i>

494
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,836
<i>as opposed to many of the
other pictures we've done recently</i>

<i>which were primarily human based.</i>

496
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:07,717
<i>So the entire staff of
animators had to learn</i>

497
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:10,929
<i>how to do four-legged animals.</i>

498
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,806
HAHN: <i>They went to the
zoo, they went to Africa.</i>

499
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,183
<i>They really lived with these animals.</i>

500

ALLERS: <i>There was lots of research done.</i>

513
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,549
<i>We studied films. We went to Africa,</i>

HAHN: <i>The audience related to this
scene perhaps more than any other</i>

here's an interesting one</i>

<i>during the whole course of this sequence</i>

this pink sunset setting</i>

just two backgrounds.</i>

-HAHN: <i>A dark one and a light one.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>And then you just added…</i>

544

ALLERS: <i>pinkness or blueness to it.</i>

545
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:11,052
MINKOFF: <i>It was a percentage.
We would have it mostly on the pink</i>

546
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:14,472
<i>and then we would increase
the percentage on the starry night</i>

547
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,766
<i>as we decreased on the pink sky.</i>

548
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,227
HAHN: <i>It's also the
point in the movie where</i>

549
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,979
<i>we start to introduce the star metaphor,</i>

550

<i>which then became very
important later in the film.</i>

551
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:27,568
MINKOFF: <i>Yes, that was actually
an invention of Jim Capobianco.</i>

HAHN: <i>Yeah. It was nice.</i>

553
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,490
<i>There needed to be a
way to express the idea of</i>

<i>forefathers, generations gone by,</i>

555

<i>in a way that was somewhat
spiritual and had a link somehow</i>

<i>to the generations gone by.</i>

557

ALLERS: <i>And of course this piece
of scoring was not the original piece.</i>

piece of score for this whole area.</i>

-ALLERS: <i>We used it in another place.</i>

00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,491
<i>Is that true? It is true.</i>

568
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:16,202
-ALLERS: <i>Yeah.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Yes.</i>

569
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:20,457
HAHN: <i>if any of you listening are
astronomers, you can please call us.</i>

570
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,834
MINKOFF: <i>Although you're
not supposed to be able</i>

571
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:24,335
<i>to see the constellation Leo</i>

572
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,172
<i>-from East Africa.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>From the Equator?</i>

573
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:28,506
-HAHN: <i>Apparently.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Really?</i>

574
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,300
-HAHN: <i>That's what somebody told me.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>I bet you could.</i>

575
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:32,636
<i>-Anyway.</i>
-HAHN: <i>I'm no astronomer.</i>

576
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:41,687
BANZAI: Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

577
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,733
It's not funny, Ed.

578
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,320
MINKOFF: <i>Jim Cummings' laugh.</i>

579
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,155
HAHN: <i>Jim Cummings' laugh,
a little more turbulence mist</i>

580
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,573
<i>coming up from the…</i>

581
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:56,785
MINKOFF: <i>But no tone mattes
because we had to cut back.</i>

582
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,745
-ALLERS: <i>That's right.</i>
-HAHN: <i>We ran out of money.</i>

583
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,206
ALLERS: <i>No, there were
places throughout the movie</i>

584
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,416
<i>where you have to cut back.</i>

585
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,834
<i>And so you have to pick those moments</i>

586
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,878
<i>where it's not going to conflict.</i>

587
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:08,672
MINKOFF: <i>But interestingly
we used that shadowing process</i>

588
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:10,758
<i>so that at the bottoms of the characters,</i>

589
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:14,428
<i>it falls off into shadow, so it
does give it a dimensional effect.</i>

590
00:26:14,512 --> 00:26:17,765
HAHN: <i>One of the things I
think Andy Gaskill wanted to do</i>

591
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,517
<i>with this sequence was</i>

592
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,602
<i>make it kind of a
geothermically unstable place,</i>

593
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:24,021
<i>so you get really
theatrical curtains of steam</i>

594
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:26,024
<i>rising up from cracks in the Earth.</i>

595
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:28,400
MINKOFF: <i>And because, as you
know, when we were making this film</i>

596
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:30,736
<i>we went through the
Northridge earthquake.</i>

597
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,741
HAHN: <i>The big Northridge earthquake,
which is incorporated into this song.</i>

598
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,912
MINKOFF: <i>We survived
floods, fires, a riot.</i>

599
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:41,874
HAHN: <i>A plague of locusts.</i>

600
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,961
<i>And commissary food, all
during the making of this film.</i>

601
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:49,298
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us.
I mean, you're our pal.

602
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,759
HAHN: <i>Here comes a meat gag.</i>

603
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:54,845
MINKOFF: <i>Yes, very
controversial meat gag.</i>

604
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,556
<i>We weren't sure whether we
could actually show meat on screen.</i>

605
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,766
-HAHN: <i>Can you show meat?
-Can you show zebra meat on screen?</i>

606
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,685
<i>We decided that if it was striped…</i>

607
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,271
-HAHN: <i>It was funny, then.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Somehow it was funny.</i>

608
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:06,106
<i>Although it had to look like a ham.</i>

609
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,859
-HAHN: <i>Like a cartoon ham.</i>
<i>-It's the</i> Tom and Jerry <i>cartoon ham.</i>

610
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:10,993
HAHN: <i>Yeah, it's kind of a Tex Avery ham.</i>

611
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:13,071
<i>And here they're like eating neck ties,</i>

612
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:16,116
<i>so you don't really feel
like they are eating meat.</i>

613
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,284
<i>See, there goes a necktie.</i>

614
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,035
MINKOFF: <i>And the meat used to be pinker.</i>

615
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,289
<i>-We grayed it down.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>We had to gray it down.</i>

616
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,748
MINKOFF: <i>Which of
course made it look rancid.</i>

617
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:24,041
ALLERS: <i>Like rotten meat.</i>

618
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,918
-HAHN: <i>Which was even worse.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Which was much more</i>

619
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:27,545
<i>appealing and PC.</i>

620
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,755
HAHN: Be Prepared
<i>is the big villain song.</i>

621
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,342
<i>And Jeremy Irons, boy, he
went through lots of rehearsal,</i>

622
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,761
<i>and an eight-hour
session at a studio one day</i>

623
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,097
<i>to come up with the vocals for this song.</i>

624
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:39,515
<i>-He did great.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>He did great.</i>

625
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,269
<i>But by the end of the day,
he had blown out his voice.</i>

626
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:46,647
HAHN: <i>Most people don't think of
Jeremy Irons as a singer, but he was.</i>

627
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,985
<i>He, early in his career, played
John the Baptist in</i> Godspell,

628
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,111
<i>in the West End in London.</i>

629
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:56,115
<i>So he really did start out as a
singer and performs well in this one.</i>

630
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,826
<i>When this song came
in from Elton and Tim,</i>

631
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,369
<i>it was called</i> Thanks to Me.

632
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:02,998
<i>And the lyrics were, "Thanks
to me it's goodbye Mufasa.</i>

633
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:05,667
<i>"Thanks to me little Simba's
gone bad,</i>" <i>or something like that.</i>

634
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,753
-ALLERS: <i>"Little Simba needs prayers.</i>"
-HAHN: <i>Needs prayers, yeah,</i>

635
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:11,298
<i>and it was great, but
as the story evolved,</i>

636
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:15,177
<i>we wanted the notion that
Scar was plotting behind…</i>

637
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,345
ALLERS: <i>It was actually
in a different place.</i>

638
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:17,429
HAHN: <i>Right.</i>

639
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:20,682
ALLERS: <i>Originally, it was much
longer after the hyenas were waiting</i>

640
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,559
<i>to take over, and Scar
was putting them off.</i>

641
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,394
MINKOFF: <i>It was also
after Mufasa was killed.</i>

642
00:28:24,478 --> 00:28:26,313
ALLERS: <i>Right, it was
long after Mufasa was killed,</i>

643
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:28,523
<i>and we were feeling like, "What?
It's so late.</i>"

644
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,068
<i>It makes much more
sense to have a plotting song</i>

645
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,362
<i>and really get the juices
going for this takeover,</i>

646
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:36,407
<i>-so we moved it up earlier.</i>
-HAHN: <i>The melody stuck.</i>

647
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,327
<i>This is a track that Hans
Zimmer did in a weekend.</i>

648
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:43,039
<i>"We left his studio on a Friday night
and said, "Hans, give us a kind of</i>

649
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:46,751
<i>"fun, sinister, Cirque Du Soleil thing.</i>"
<i>In fact, I don't think we even said that.</i>

650
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:48,169
<i>I think we just left him alone.</i>

651
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,755
<i>And he came back with,
basically, what you hear today.</i>

652
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,382
MINKOFF: <i>Carnival in hell was one of our…</i>

653
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,384
HAHN: <i>Carnival in hell was the brief..</i>

654
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:56,719
<i>He came back on Monday
morning and played this for us,</i>

655
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,221
<i>and we were pretty amazed.</i>

656
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,057
<i>And then one of our great
storyboard artists, Jorgen Klubien,</i>

657
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,810
<i>took the material, and
he and Andy Gaskill,</i>

658
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:06,562
<i>our art director, were
inspired by Leni Riefenstahl.</i>

659
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:09,232
<i>Kind of fascist documentary stuff.</i>

660
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:13,069
<i>And thought maybe we could layer
the idea of Scar as the fascist dictator</i>

661
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:16,280
<i>on this whole dynamic of the movie here.</i>

662
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:18,324
ALLERS: <i>Well, the idea is when
we introduced the yellow lights,</i>

663
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:21,953
<i>was to give you the colors
of, like, an old news reel.</i>

664
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:25,916
<i>So that we colored everything in
kind of these old browny yellows.</i>

665
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,503
<i>Like dirty old yellows and
black, like an old news reel.</i>

666
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:30,587
HAHN: <i>Especially for mud.</i>

667
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:32,798
MINKOFF: <i>This scene, in the
director's cut, we should replace this.</i>

668
00:29:32,882 --> 00:29:34,675
HAHN: <i>Yeah, a lot of debate
about this scene in previews,</i>

669
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,969
<i>whether it was appropriate,</i>

670
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:41,223
<i>and how much we would lean in
the direction of this kind of fascist,</i>

671
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:43,267
<i>fascism-on-parade kind of thing.</i>

672
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:46,478
<i>And here it kind of turns
into that bacchanal in hell,</i>

673
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:50,190
<i>carnival, Mardi Gras
in a graveyard feeling.</i>

674
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:51,692
<i>And the earthquake.</i>

675
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:55,946
<i>This was based on Rob's backyard
during the earthquake, actually.</i>

676
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,282
<i>It's funny, on the early
demos of this song,</i>

677
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,118
<i>both Rob and Roger and I, all of us sing.</i>

678
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:03,913
<i>And so for a long time
when we were workshopping</i>

679
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,582
<i>and trying to get through these songs,</i>

680
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,042
<i>-we were the hyenas.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>That's right.</i>

681
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,419
<i>-Tim Rice sang Scar's part.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Beautifully.</i>

682
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:11,046
ALLERS: <i>And the three
of us were the hyenas.</i>

683
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,465
MINKOFF: <i>That's right.
In fact, I think we've survived as hyenas.</i>

684
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,550
ALLERS: <i>There's some of our laughing.</i>

685
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:17,635
<i>Some of our laughing
is still on the soundtrack.</i>

686
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,888
HAHN: <i>And this is all samples.</i>

687
00:30:19,972 --> 00:30:22,057
<i>Hans Zimmer sitting at
the keyboard in his studio</i>

688
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:24,341
<i>with sample sounds,
playing this whole thing.</i>

689
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:31,983
MINKOFF: <i>This shot.
Those moving shadows over the cliffs.</i>

690
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,570
HAHN: <i>Cloud shadows
moving across the Serengeti.</i>

691
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:38,323
<i>This is another Mark Henn
and Andreas Deja scene.</i>

692
00:30:39,658 --> 00:30:41,993
<i>Mark animating Simba,
and Andreas animating Scar.</i>

693
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,661
ALLERS: <i>And it just
shows you what you can do</i>

694
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:45,623
<i>with a great vocal performance.</i>

695
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:48,626
<i>And no props, these
characters have no props.</i>

696
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,420
<i>They can't hold things in their
hands, they're standing on their hands.</i>

697
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,839
HAHN: <i>They have no opposable thumb.</i>

698
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:55,007
MINKOFF: <i>The other thing, I think,</i>

699
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:57,176
<i>that's interesting to note is
some of the very long scenes.</i>

700
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,429
<i>What we tried to do is stay on
the characters and stay on a shot,</i>

701
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:02,306
<i>rather than over-cutting things</i>

702
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,518
<i>to really give you a chance
to be with the characters,</i>

703
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:10,064
<i>to let them perform and get
across what they were doing.</i>

704
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:12,650
HAHN: <i>Another tip of the
hat to Jeremy Irons, I think.</i>

705
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:16,529
<i>In a recording session, he would
give us 10 and 15 and 20 takes</i>

706
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:19,865
<i>on a different color
of the line every time.</i>

707
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:23,702
<i>And then our editor, Tom Finan,
would work with the directors</i>

708
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:26,706
<i>and put a performance together
that sounded very cohesive.</i>

709
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,626
<i>But Jeremy was terrific.</i>

710
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:34,632
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

711
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:39,136
Simba, it's to die for.

712
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:42,556
MINKOFF: <i>Actually, the thing we're
really trying to do in this sequence is,</i>

713
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,059
<i>we've got several storylines going
on, we have to set different things up.</i>

714
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:49,062
<i>And it was important to actually keep
the thread moving throughout each,</i>

715
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:53,108
<i>so that, again, you were carried
through sort of in a seamless way.</i>

716
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:56,611
HAHN: <i>And this leads us into
probably the centerpiece of the movie,</i>

717
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,447
<i>certainly the turning point of the
movie, the wildebeest stampede,</i>

718
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:02,409
<i>which was originally
storyboarded by Thom Enriquez,</i>

719
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:05,705
<i>in a career-long move.</i>

720
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:09,584
<i>Thom took probably a year and a half,
almost his whole career on the movie,</i>

721
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:13,254
<i>to do the stampede, and then we
turned it over to the CG department,</i>

722
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:16,257
<i>the computer graphics
department, with their animators</i>

723
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,926
<i>and technical directors, and
they were the ones responsible</i>

724
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,764
<i>for bringing the wildebeest
stampede to life on the screen.</i>

725
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,517
MINKOFF: <i>In this movie,
they did the wildebeests,</i>

726
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,979
<i>they did the turning Pride Rock,</i>

727
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:34,108
<i>and they also did the water
from</i> Can't Wait to Be King.

728
00:32:34,192 --> 00:32:36,235
HAHN: <i>It's the same kind of
effects you would see in the ballroom</i>

729
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,112
<i>of</i> Beauty and the Beast <i>or
the flying carpet in</i> Aladdin,

730
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:41,908
<i>that kind of unique character
situation that can only be handled</i>

731
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:43,284
<i>with the help of a computer.</i>

732
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:45,787
<i>Scott Johnston was our CGI supervisor,</i>

733
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:48,081
<i>and he wrangled this whole thing,</i>

734
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:51,043
<i>and it really was a project that
took the full three years of production</i>

735
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:54,129
<i>for what amounts to about six
or seven minutes on the screen.</i>

736
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:56,298
MINKOFF: <i>What's really
amazing is that all of those beasts</i>

737
00:32:56,382 --> 00:33:00,552
<i>are really based on a singular run cycle</i>

738
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:02,846
<i>that was created by the CGI department.</i>

739
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,808
<i>Then they added on
different behaviors like bucks</i>

740
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:09,186
<i>-and kicks, and different things.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Head shakes.</i>

741
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,480
HAHN: <i>Changing leads.</i>

742
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:13,106
MINKOFF: <i>Yeah, but the
program that they invented</i>

743
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,900
<i>was something called an avoidance program</i>

744
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:17,736
<i>where they would send the wildebeest,
literally moving towards each other,</i>

745
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,656
<i>but they would always
turn away at the last minute.</i>

746
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,493
<i>So they really replicated
what a real stampede would do.</i>

747
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:27,330
<i>Which is, you've got
thousands of beasts running,</i>

748
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:29,832
<i>and they're going to constantly
try to avoid each other,</i>

749
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,627
<i>so you're getting a complete
sense of what it would look like.</i>

750
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,046
ALLERS: <i>It's interesting because
the reason they did that is because</i>

751
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,509
<i>the computer does not recognize
what is three-dimensional objects.</i>

752
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:43,429
<i>The computer would have the actual
beast crossing in and out of each other</i>

753
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,390
<i>like ghosts if they didn't do this.</i>

754
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:48,184
<i>So, in order to have them
not occupy the same space,</i>

755
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:51,229
<i>they did that program, which again,</i>

756
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:54,274
<i>underlines the natural
behavior of these beasts.</i>

757
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:55,441
<i>It's odd.</i>

758
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,026
HAHN: <i>It's the first time
for us we really tackled</i>

759
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,821
<i>flesh and blood characters
being animated by the computer.</i>

760
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,532
<i>And the reason the computer graphics guys</i>

761
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,495
<i>did it this way is it would be
impossible to actually sit down and draw</i>

762
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:09,540
<i>tens of thousands of wildebeest
storming through a gorge.</i>

763
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:11,041
ALLERS: <i>And for Jonathan Taylor Thomas,</i>

764
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,376
<i>when we were doing all of this,</i>

765
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,671
<i>him falling this way and that
way, we actually had to pick him up</i>

766
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:18,632
<i>and fling him around the
recording studio so we could get</i>

767
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:19,801
[EXCLAIMS]

768
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:21,510
<i>These screams and yells out of him.</i>

769
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:23,095
MINKOFF: <i>That was the very first scene</i>

770
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,848
<i>that was put in color,
Zazu hitting the wall.</i>

771
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:27,224
HAHN: <i>That's a really
interesting little scene,</i>

772
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:31,437
<i>it just goes by so fast, but the
camera dollies from left to right</i>

773
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:33,480
<i>on the sea of wildebeests.</i>

774
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:37,651
<i>And it goes by really fast, but it's
actually a very sophisticated scene</i>

775
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:41,947
<i>because what you're seeing is
the entire herd is running at you</i>

776
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:45,409
<i>and changing perspective as the
camera dollies to follow Mufasa,</i>

777
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:47,620
<i>as Mufasa doubles back to save Simba.</i>

778
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:49,122
MINKOFF: <i>Again, that's
something that would be very</i>

779
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,457
<i>simple to do in live action,</i>

780
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:54,502
<i>but in animation you really have
to go out of your way to replicate it.</i>

781
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:57,088
HAHN: <i>The combination of the
computer-generated wildebeest,</i>

782
00:34:57,172 --> 00:35:00,508
<i>and the hand-drawn
animation, all the Simba, Mufasa</i>

783
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:02,719
<i>and Scar artwork, of course,
would have been drawn by hand.</i>

784
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:04,846
<i>And then the effects
animators putting in shadows,</i>

785
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,515
<i>the turbulence dust on top of it,</i>

786
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,267
<i>put together with a
hand-painted background,</i>

787
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:11,102
<i>created a pretty amazing effect.</i>

788
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,980
<i>And then Hans Zimmer wrote a
piece of score for here that was…</i>

789
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:15,231
<i>I remember the night
we went over to his studio</i>

790
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:16,399
<i>and heard it for the first time,</i>

791
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,276
<i>it was probably one of the
most powerful pieces of music</i>

792
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,736
<i>-I had ever experienced.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Yeah.</i>

793
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,282
HAHN: <i>Musically here, Hans
went to South Africa and London,</i>

794
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:26,034
<i>and a lot of the voices you're
hearing on the track here</i>

795
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:29,538
<i>are a combination of London
choral group singing with</i>

796
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:34,544
<i>the South African singers, to give
you a really panicked kind of soundtrack.</i>

797
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:37,254
<i>This was a big debate
here, trying to figure out</i>

798
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:40,383
<i>how Simba should or shouldn't
see the death of his father,</i>

799
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:42,468
<i>-to try to sidetrack Simba enough.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>That's why we had him</i>

800
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:46,013
<i>climbing the cliffs so there was rocks,
so he didn't see it during all of this.</i>

801
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:48,140
-HAHN: <i>It was crucially…
-These scenes coming up here.</i>

802
00:35:48,224 --> 00:35:50,184
<i>-…important that he not see it.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Right.</i>

803
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:52,269
<i>'Cause then the guilt trip wouldn't work.</i>

804
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:53,771
MINKOFF: <i>And this scene, which we decided</i>

805
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,689
<i>was one of our longer scenes,</i>

806
00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:58,818
<i>we decided we really
wanted to hold on this shot</i>

807
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:01,362
<i>and allow Simba to
move through this whole</i>

808
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:05,574
<i>sense of three-dimensional
space to really believe in.</i>

809
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:08,412
<i>That's really the way you convey
space in animation is, you have to allow</i>

810
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:12,333
<i>the character to move within
the three dimensions that exist.</i>

811
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:18,547
HAHN: <i>Scene coming up, where
Simba confronts the body of his father.</i>

812
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:23,218
<i>We spent a lot of time in story
and previewing and discussion.</i>

813
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:26,054
<i>And we animated several versions of it.</i>

814
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:29,057
<i>Mark Henn went through
anguish trying to get this to be</i>

815
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:33,353
<i>the right mixture of pathos and
emotion, to make this moment work.</i>

816
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:36,773
<i>It's a tribute to all the
craftsmen coming together,</i>

817
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:40,318
<i>'cause you have the staging that
the layout people did so beautifully,</i>

818
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:44,448
<i>and certainly the direction that
makes it a very poignant moment.</i>

819
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:51,038
ALLERS: <i>And Jonathan's
acting in this part.</i>

820
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:55,001
HAHN: <i>For a while we thought,
"Should we try real animal sounds?"</i>

821
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:59,839
ALLERS: <i>Oh, God, that's right.
We recorded the whimperings of lion cubs.</i>

822
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:01,382
HAHN: <i>'Cause we thought,
"That will be really sad.</i>"

823
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:02,633
<i>You know how you feel
when there's an animal…</i>

824
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:03,885
ALLERS: <i>And the
whimperings of Frank Welker.</i>

825
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:07,054
HAHN: <i>Frank Welker is a
very talented voice artist in town,</i>

826
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,599
<i>and came in and
whimpered for a half hour.</i>

827
00:37:09,683 --> 00:37:12,560
<i>We thought, this is going to be really
sad, and we cut it in and it wasn't.</i>

828
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,896
-ALLERS: <i>It was weird.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Because even though</i>

829
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,899
<i>these are lions, it's a very human story.</i>

830
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,025
<i>And then Rob came in one day,</i>

831
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:21,777
<i>he saw a</i> Rescue 911
<i>or something, I remember,</i>

832
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:23,529
<i>and you were talking about the woman</i>

833
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:26,199
<i>whose daughter fell into a
swimming pool or something,</i>

834
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:29,745
<i>and was running around going,
"Help, please, somebody help me!"</i>

835
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:32,956
<i>And that kind of
panicked attitude you have</i>

836
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,249
<i>when you don't know where to turn,</i>

837
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:38,337
<i>and you're just shouting for help,
but there maybe isn't any help,</i>

838
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:42,466
<i>and that kind of spawned the
idea of Simba running around.</i>

839
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,511
<i>He knows it's hopeless, but he's
still looking for maybe that last chance</i>

840
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,304
<i>that his father could be alive.</i>

841
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:50,474
MINKOFF: <i>It's one of the
most sensitive issues in the film</i>

842
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,559
<i>is, literally, dealing with the death.</i>

843
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,394
<i>Whether or not to
deal with it off screen,</i>

844
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:56,271
<i>which is a choice they made in</i> Bambi.

845
00:37:56,355 --> 00:38:00,359
<i>And we decided to go
purposefully the opposite direction,</i>

846
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:04,196
<i>for the specific reason to allow
Simba to confront the issue of death</i>

847
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,116
<i>in a very real, personal
and immediate way.</i>

848
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,451
ALLERS: <i>Especially because
this is going to be his issue</i>

849
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:12,288
<i>that he has to deal with
for the rest of the picture.</i>

850
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:18,169
HAHN: <i>The whole idea of Simba's guilt
materialized a little later in the game.</i>

851
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,463
<i>-It wasn't an original notion.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>No.</i>

852
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:24,801
HAHN: <i>That Scar would actually
wind Simba up to make Simba believe</i>

853
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,137
<i>that his father's death was
actually somehow his fault.</i>

854
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,223
<i>But as the story developed,
that became pretty central.</i>

855
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,142
ALLERS: <i>It was really necessary
because we always had a problem with,</i>

856
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:34,894
<i>"Why doesn't Simba go back home?"</i>

857
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:37,438
<i>When he ran away,
and was gone for a while,</i>

858
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:39,232
<i>we were always up against the problem</i>

859
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:42,485
<i>of what motivates him to stay away?</i>

860
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,988
HAHN: <i>Simba's just
having a bad day, you know.</i>

861
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,781
<i>If it's not one thing it's another.</i>

862
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:50,744
MINKOFF: <i>It's also interesting to think
how these stories track in terms of time.</i>

863
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,455
<i>-Because it's very condensed.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

864
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,915
MINKOFF: <i>This is all two days.</i>

865
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,849
HAHN: <i>The beginning of this
movie takes place in two days.</i>

866
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,217
<i>This is interesting, this whole area
of the movie was actually animated</i>

867
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,011
<i>-flopped or reversed.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>From right to left.</i>

868
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,805
HAHN: <i>Simba was escaping
from the right to the left.</i>

869
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,393
<i>And then as the movie was up
on reels, pretty deep in the process,</i>

870
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,396
<i>"the guys looked at each other
one day and said, "You know,</i>

871
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,692
<i>"we've established the
Pumbaa and Timon jungle"</i>

872
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,611
<i>"is always off on screen right."</i>

873
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,406
<i>"But here Simba's escaping to the left."</i>

874
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,783
<i>So this whole chunk was flopped.</i>

875
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,663
<i>-All this.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>But actually it really isn't.</i>

876
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,917
<i>I think it was completely unnecessary. In
fact, now that I think about it, I think</i>

877
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,004
<i>-we should go back the other way.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Well, okay.</i>

878
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:46,384
<i>Whoopi's so interesting.
We recorded her separately from Cheech,</i>

879
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:49,095
<i>and the one time we got them
together, they were great together,</i>

880
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,806
<i>but most of the time we
record them separately,</i>

881
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,892
<i>yet it still sounds like they're
in the same room together.</i>

882
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,226
<i>-I don't know how that works.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Yeah.</i>

883
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,353
MINKOFF: <i>I think
that's actually something</i>

884
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,562
<i>people aren't aware of as much</i>

885
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,106
<i>is that we do almost
all the actors separately.</i>

886
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,777
<i>And we have to basically bring
it all together in the editing room.</i>

887
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:06,863
HAHN: <i>Now we see Simba
clearly escaping to screen right,</i>

888
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:09,741
<i>where later we'll find Pumbaa and Timon.</i>

889
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,995
MINKOFF: <i>But are they on the right?</i>

890
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,833
-HAHN: <i>There was a song here once.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Yes.</i>

891
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,919
<i>It was a reprise of</i> Be Prepared.

892
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,754
MINKOFF: <i>Which we do
use musically, don't we?</i>

893
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:22,922
ALLERS: <i>No, we don't use it even.</i>

894
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,090
-MINKOFF: <i>Not at all?</i>
-ALLERS: <i>No.</i>

895
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,634
HAHN: <i>There was once imagined a reprise</i>

896
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,552
<i>of Scar's song</i> Be Prepared <i>here,</i>

897
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:32,556
<i>as Scar ushers the hyenas in,</i>

898
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,851
<i>seemed to be a bit too much
of a stage wait or something.</i>

899
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,770
ALLERS: <i>It was too lively to the mood.</i>

900
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:40,231
<i>You needed to come down from the death,</i>

901
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,150
<i>from all that activity, you
needed to have that low point.</i>

902
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,946
MINKOFF: <i>It was also rubbing
the audience's nose in the death.</i>

903
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,281
HAHN: <i>We showed the
movie at the AMC in Burbank,</i>

904
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:53,037
<i>and it was a preview for
Michael and Roy Disney.</i>

905
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:56,498
<i>"Michael's big thing after
seeing the movie is, "I love Rafiki,</i>

906
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:58,959
<i>"he's a great character, and
you get what he is in the movie,"</i>

907
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:01,128
<i>"but you just don't see him
enough, you don't see his character"</i>

908
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:02,921
<i>"threaded through the movie enough."</i>

909
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,632
<i>So, a lot of moments,
particularly this one</i>

910
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:08,301
<i>where he's mourning
over the loss of Simba,</i>

911
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,764
<i>kind of come out of
rebuilding from that preview.</i>

912
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:14,315
<i>There used to be a sequence in here,</i>

913
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:15,809
<i>if I could just ruminate,</i>

914
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,770
<i>where Simba was lost and
alone in the inhospitable waste.</i>

915
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:21,440
<i>There was a little sequence
where he was out on the sand dunes,</i>

916
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:22,816
<i>and he was walking in the desert.</i>

917
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,067
MINKOFF: <i>Kind of</i> a
Lawrence of Arabia <i>thing.</i>

918
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:28,280
<i>And we simplified it by using
the icon of Simba as a transition</i>

919
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:30,490
<i>to the apparently dead
Simba, so you don't know,</i>

920
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:33,494
<i>so you think, "Boy, this
hasn't just been a bad day.</i>"

921
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,414
<i>-I mean, this has been…</i>
-HAHN: <i>This has been a bad day.</i>

922
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,168
<i>Now, interestingly enough, these
vultures used to be characters.</i>

923
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,335
-ALLERS: <i>That's right.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Yeah.</i>

924
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:42,503
HAHN: <i>Long ago.</i>

925
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,672
MINKOFF: <i>But we tried a bunch
of different kinds of vultures.</i>

926
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:46,632
HAHN: <i>We tried vultures as newscasters.</i>

927
00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:48,509
MINKOFF: <i>We had the old Yiddish vultures.</i>

928
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:50,386
HAHN: <i>We had the
radio announcer vultures.</i>

929
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,181
ALLERS: <i>It was all black
humor, they were all talking about,</i>

930
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:54,474
<i>"Hey, kid, you might as well give up."</i>

931
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:56,392
<i>"We're ready for you.
We're going to eat you."</i>

932
00:41:56,476 --> 00:41:57,727
HAHN: <i>"It's not looking
so good for you, is it?"</i>

933
00:41:57,811 --> 00:41:58,853
-ALLERS: <i>Yeah.</i>
-[ALL LAUGHING]

934
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:02,815
HAHN: <i>And it was, like, a scene played
out with these vultures as characters.</i>

935
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,776
<i>And it was very funny, really funny.</i>

936
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,237
<i>It was too funny, and it kind of stole
the thunder from Pumbaa and Timon.</i>

937
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:11,866
<i>And so, we knew the audience had
to be rooting for Pumbaa and Timon,</i>

938
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,162
<i>and we introduced these vultures
which we would never pay off later,</i>

939
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,289
<i>so we ended up just
making them real vultures.</i>

940
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:19,166
-ALLERS: <i>Make them sinister.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

941
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,503
MINKOFF: <i>Now, the funny story is
that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella</i>

942
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:26,882
<i>came in to audition in
New York as hyenas.</i>

943
00:42:26,966 --> 00:42:30,845
ALLERS: <i>I think Nathan also came
in and auditioned for Zazu's role.</i>

944
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:34,737
MINKOFF: <i>So, when we were in Los
Angeles listening through all the tapes,</i>

945
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:36,934
<i>we were trying to figure out who
Timon and Pumbaa should be,</i>

946
00:42:37,018 --> 00:42:40,521
<i>and we listened to Nathan
and Ernie's hyena audition,</i>

947
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:43,398
<i>and it was so funny.
They were so funny together.</i>

948
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:46,068
<i>They played together so well and
seemed so familiar with each other</i>

949
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:48,695
<i>and so friendly, that we said,</i>

950
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:50,739
<i>"Wouldn't it be great if they
were Timon and Pumbaa?"</i>

951
00:42:50,823 --> 00:42:53,660
ALLERS: <i>Even the lines they
were reading as hyenas were perfect.</i>

952
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:55,245
MINKOFF: <i>They were talking about whether</i>

953
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:57,288
<i>they should attack
and eat the wildebeest.</i>

954
00:42:57,372 --> 00:43:00,542
<i>And one of the hyenas as
the voice of Nathan Lane said,</i>

955
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,837
<i>"What'll it be? One meal now,
or years of feasting in the future?"</i>

956
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:07,340
ALLERS: <i>And Ernie replied, "One
meal now, definitely one meal now.</i>"

957
00:43:07,424 --> 00:43:09,592
MINKOFF: <i>And we thought,
"That's Timon and Pumbaa.</i>"

958
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:11,761
HAHN: <i>Mike Surrey and Tony Bancroft,</i>

959
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:14,389
<i>the two animators that
animated Timon and Pumbaa,</i>

960
00:43:14,473 --> 00:43:18,184
<i>were Timon and Pumbaa, they
embraced them in every way.</i>

961
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:21,271
MINKOFF: <i>Originally, actually,
in the earlier version of the story,</i>

962
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:23,481
<i>Timon and Pumbaa used to be children</i>

963
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:26,276
<i>who grew up with
Simba in the Pride Lands.</i>

964
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,070
<i>One of the things we decided to
change was to make them outcasts,</i>

965
00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:30,613
<i>so that when Simba was exiled,</i>

966
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:33,993
<i>he'd have some friends who
could take him under their wing.</i>

967
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:35,578
ALLERS: <i>And actually Gary Trousdale,</i>

968
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:38,831
<i>who boarded the earliest
version of these two characters,</i>

969
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:41,792
<i>came up with the idea of
Pumbaa's delicate condition.</i>

970
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:45,921
<i>Because he came up with the
joke, "Hey, kid, pull my horn.</i>"

971
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:47,798
<i>And that's what led us off on that whole…</i>

972
00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:49,091
<i>"Pull my tusk!"</i>

973
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:53,095
<i>And that's what led us off on this
idea that he has a little problem.</i>

974
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:54,930
HAHN: <i>He has an occasional indiscretion.</i>

975
00:43:55,014 --> 00:43:57,683
It's, "You got to put
your past behind you."

976
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:02,146
Look, kid, bad things happen, and
you can't do anything about it, right?

977
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,232
MINKOFF: <i>Of course, this gets into
our issue about guilt and responsibility.</i>

978
00:44:05,316 --> 00:44:08,819
<i>And which led us to the idea
of the song</i> Hakuna Matata,

979
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:10,779
<i>which originally was called</i>
The Warthog Rhapsody

980
00:44:10,863 --> 00:44:12,072
<i>and covered a whole different idea.</i>

981

<i>I think in the casting process,</i>

thing came from our guide in Africa.</i>

1394
01:03:47,651 --> 01:03:50,154
<i>It's kind of a little schoolyard chant.
It actually means something.</i>

<i>"It means," Thank you very

Rafiki does explain in the movie.</i>

01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:58,371
ALLERS: <i>A little bit.</i>

1399

MINKOFF: <i>It's interesting actually,</i>

1400
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:02,083
<i>because we took that "Asante Sana" idea,</i>

1401
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,210
<i>that was one of the very first
things that we talked about,</i>

1402
01:04:04,294 --> 01:04:07,880
<i>once we knew we wanted to make
Rafiki this crazy shaman character.</i>

1403
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:10,383
<i>And originally we had him using that</i>

1404

<i>in the blessing of Simba at
the beginning of the movie,</i>

1405

<i>But we ended up
using it in this location,</i>

1410
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:27,734
<i>which made a lot more sense
to do it to literally be annoying.</i>

1411
01:04:28,735 --> 01:04:30,779
ALLERS: <i>I think these
scenes of Rafiki are great.</i>

1412
01:04:30,863 --> 01:04:33,324
<i>James Baxter is the animator of Rafiki</i>

1413

<i>and one of the great
animators at the studio.</i>

1414
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:37,494
HAHN: <i>He really is. It's interesting</i>

1415
01:04:37,578 --> 01:04:39,746
<i>'cause James animated
Belle, in</i> Beauty and the Beast,

1416
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:43,333
<i>and he animated Roger Rabbit.</i>

1417
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,878
<i>It's interesting because
animators can crawl into the skin</i>

1418
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:47,004
<i>of so many different characters,</i>

1419
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:50,465
<i>so for somebody to animate Belle
and to turn around and animate Rafiki,</i>

1420
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:53,802
<i>it shows you the kind of vast
range that animators can have,</i>

1421
01:04:53,886 --> 01:04:57,014
<i>and certainly James is amongst the best.</i>

MINKOFF: <i>Okay, so
this is Simba going into…</i>

1423
01:05:01,018 --> 01:05:02,102
<i>It's interesting 'cause
what we talked about</i>

1424
01:05:02,186 --> 01:05:07,691
<i>is this whole twisted, gnarled vine area</i>

1425
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:10,152
<i>was sort of to reflect
Simba's unconscious mind</i>

1426
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:13,323
<i>that he was literally going
back, peeling through the layers,</i>

-ALLERS: <i>Right.</i>

<i>Where he had buried and suppressed
that whole thing about his father.</i>

<i>So he's going through therapy.</i>

1431

HAHN: <i>To counterpoint to the
scene earlier when he was cub,</i>

<i>when he was actually
escaping from his homeland</i>

1458
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:43,039

<i>and Scott Santoro and Ed Coffey</i>

1462
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,551
<i>and a lot of the effects
animators then took those roughs</i>

1463
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:58,096
<i>and turned them into cloud

were trying to do with the ghost scene</i>

1466
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,564
<i>was to bring Mufasa
in as a negative shape</i>

<i>and then slowly transition,</i>

1468

<i>so that the lighting effects

<i>and eventually describe him
as a three-dimensional form,</i>

1470
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,575
<i>up until the sort of climactic scene</i>

1471

<i>where you finally see Mufasa
in a more dimensional, real state.</i>

HAHN: <i>You know, we
recorded James Earl Jones</i>

01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,168
<i>in a really interesting
way for this scene.</i>

1474
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:31,255
<i>Because his voice is such an
instrument, a musical instrument.</i>

1475
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,592
<i>And our sound designer

five microphones around his head,</i>

<i>which was quite a shot.</i>

1482
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,190

1493
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:17,177
<i>we actually opened
up a little after that line,</i>

1494
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,805
<i>because the audiences
would just roar with…</i>

<i>And so, we ended up
adding more animation there</i>

all the rest of the lines.</i>

01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:10,877
<i>just a wonderful feeling
of Africa and music.</i>

1531
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:14,297
ALLERS: <i>Originally, there were
several traveling shots we just combined,</i>

1532
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:17,926
<i>we eliminated a lot and just
combined two into that one scene.</i>

1533
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,761
HAHN: <i>This is kind of like the…</i>

1534
01:10:19,845 --> 01:10:22,555
<i>Simba coming back to his hometown,
but all the buildings are burned out,</i>

1535
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,807
<i>the old house where he
grew up is all derelict now.</i>

1536
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:27,727
MINKOFF: <i>It's kind of an apocalyptic
vision is basically what this is.</i>

1537
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,730
<i>Well, it's post-apocalyptic.</i>

1538
01:10:35,528 --> 01:10:36,654
HAHN: <i>And again in a scene like this</i>

1539
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:40,950
<i>the music carries a lot
of the emotional message.</i>

1540
01:10:41,034 --> 01:10:43,410
MINKOFF: <i>Of course, we had to explain</i>

1541
01:10:43,494 --> 01:10:47,164
<i>how the hyenas caused
the drought, you know.</i>

1542
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:49,500
-HAHN: <i>Well, metaphorically speaking…</i>
-ALLERS: <i>It's a symbolic thing.</i>

1543
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:52,211
HAHN: <i>A King Arthur type
metaphor, you might say.</i>

1544
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:53,337
ALLERS: <i>Precisely.</i>

1545
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:55,631
HAHN: <i>With the good king,
comes the good weather.</i>

1546
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:56,882
<i>With the bad king…</i>

1547
01:10:56,966 --> 01:10:59,301
MINKOFF: <i>What is it?
That the king restoreth the land.</i>

1548
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:00,386
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Absolutely.</i>

1549
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,971
MINKOFF: <i>When the king
is removed from the land,</i>

1550
01:11:02,055 --> 01:11:03,639
<i>the land dies, it withers.</i>

1551
01:11:03,723 --> 01:11:06,433
HAHN: <i>I remember these
layouts were problematic because,</i>

1552
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:08,310
<i>early on, they didn't have
many burned-out trees,</i>

1553
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:11,146
<i>and yet there's this huge fire
sequence at the end of the film.</i>

1554
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,148
<i>We were wondering, "What
the heck is burning here?</i>"

1555
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:15,486
<i>"Is Pride Rock made
out of coal or something?"</i>

1556
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:17,696
I see nothing funny about this.

1557
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,824
Timon! Pumbaa! What are you doing here?

1558
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:23,034
At your service, my liege.

1559
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:26,830
Aww!
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?

1560
01:11:27,247 --> 01:11:28,248
Yes, Timon.

1561
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:30,292
<i>It's a good sort of colloquial gag.</i>

1562
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,717
<i>-A fixer-upper.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Real estate gag, yeah.</i>

1563
01:11:33,253 --> 01:11:36,464
MINKOFF: <i>We generally try
to keep it a little bit timeless</i>

1564
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:40,218
<i>and non-specific to
the contemporary life,</i>

1565
01:11:40,302 --> 01:11:42,178
<i>but we couldn't resist that joke.</i>

1566
01:11:42,262 --> 01:11:44,597
<i>We've got some more moving clouds.</i>

1567
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:49,019
ALLERS: <i>Oh, yeah, the
clouds are moving from here on.</i>

1568
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:53,898
<i>Well, this, originally, what's
coming up, was just a little soft shoe,</i>

1569
01:11:53,982 --> 01:11:55,692
<i>"and we thought," No, it's too tame.</i>

1570
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:58,237
<i>"What can we come up with
that's funnier than a soft shoe?"</i>

1571
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:59,864
MINKOFF: <i>Basically, we sat in a room…</i>

1572
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:02,074
<i>This was also another
late-at-night meeting.</i>

1573
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:03,701
<i>But we sat in a room
and I think Don said,</i>

1574
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:07,163
<i>"Hey, let's do a luau.</i>"

1575
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:09,457
<i>"What a great idea.</i>"
<i>We used the Hawaiian war chant,</i>

1576
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:11,167
<i>and we got together with the writers,</i>

1577
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:15,129
<i>Irene wrote a pass
of lyrics to that song,</i>

1578
01:12:15,213 --> 01:12:16,297
<i>and then when we got
ready to pitch the song,</i>

1579
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:17,381
<i>that was the best part.</i>

1580
01:12:17,465 --> 01:12:18,466
HAHN: <i>We were really worried about</i> it…

1581
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,801
MINKOFF: <i>I brought in my ukulele.
'Cause I have a ukulele.</i>

1582
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:22,345
<i>Which is, you know, not normal.</i>

1583
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:23,721
<i>But I have a ukulele,
I brought it in to work,</i>

1584
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,139
<i>and found a guy who knew how to play it</i>

1585
01:12:25,223 --> 01:12:27,516
<i>and knew the Hawaiian war chant,
so we brought him into the pitch,</i>

1586
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,727
<i>and at the appropriate moment,
he was supposed to leap up</i>

1587
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:31,604
<i>with the ukulele in hand
and started strumming,</i>

1588
01:12:31,688 --> 01:12:33,856
<i>as Don Hahn leapt over to
the Sparkletts water bottle</i>

1589
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:36,902
<i>to begin tapping out
the rhythm of the song.</i>

1590
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:40,436
<i>I was gonna do the Timon part, and
Roger was gonna do Pumbaa's part…</i>

1591
01:12:41,282 --> 01:12:42,783
<i>And we did this pitch
and by the end of it,</i>

1592
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:46,328
<i>they were rolling.
They were busting a gut.</i>

1593
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,210
HAHN: <i>This is kind of
Sarabi walking the gauntlet.</i>

1594
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:57,673
ALLERS: <i>He sees Mom.</i>

1595
01:13:02,052 --> 01:13:04,971
HAHN: <i>Russ Edmonds did Sarabi.</i>

1596
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:06,181
<i>Andreas did Scar.</i>

1597
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:10,060
MINKOFF: <i>We constructed
an interesting beat in the story</i>

1598
01:13:10,144 --> 01:13:12,604
<i>to sort of convey a lot of information,</i>

1599
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:16,942
<i>to allow us to have Simba come
in to the scene as an aggressor,</i>

1600
01:13:17,027 --> 01:13:19,278
<i>which he wouldn't do normally
because there's no reason for him</i>

1601
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:23,116
<i>to necessarily attack Scar immediately.</i>

1602
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,286
<i>He's only heard hearsay from
Nala that Scar's done wrong.</i>

1603
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:31,207
<i>So Scar ends up hitting Sarabi</i>

1604
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:34,441
<i>to sort of justify why Simba can
actually come in on the attack.</i>

1605
01:13:34,836 --> 01:13:36,922
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1606
01:13:39,466 --> 01:13:41,300
HAHN: <i>You notice the whiskers on Simba?</i>

1607
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:42,844
<i>You know, all those
whiskers had to be drawn</i>

1608
01:13:42,928 --> 01:13:45,179
<i>-on a separate piece of paper.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>That's right.</i>

1609
01:13:45,263 --> 01:13:47,390
HAHN: <i>Because they had
to be colored separately</i>

1610
01:13:47,474 --> 01:13:48,474
<i>from the rest of the character.</i>

1611
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:49,684
MINKOFF: <i>And originally
we were gonna have</i>

1612
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:52,729
<i>whiskers on the lionesses, too.</i>

1613
01:13:52,854 --> 01:13:55,004
-HAHN: <i>But we didn't.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>But we didn't.</i>

1614
01:13:55,315 --> 01:13:58,236
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1615
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:03,490
HAHN: <i>I like this 'cause
Scar kind of is crazy now.</i>

1616
01:14:03,574 --> 01:14:06,577
<i>He's going mad.</i>

1617
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:09,788
MINKOFF: <i>If you're doing a scene,
for example, at the end of the picture,</i>

1618
01:14:09,872 --> 01:14:12,541
<i>where the hyenas are lit up by lightning,</i>

1619
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,001
<i>so you're not seeing
the physical lightning,</i>

1620
01:14:14,085 --> 01:14:18,672
<i>but you're seeing the effects of it,
the way the light affects the rock,</i>

1621
01:14:18,756 --> 01:14:22,176
<i>the only piece of artwork
that's drawn is a shadow.</i>

1622
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,887
<i>Is actually one still
frame of the shadow.</i>

1623
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:29,600
<i>-And the light setting of the piece…</i>
-ALLERS: <i>And the tone…</i>

1624
01:14:29,684 --> 01:14:31,018
MINKOFF: <i>The tone on the character…</i>

1625
01:14:31,102 --> 01:14:32,644
<i>Okay, the shadowed side of the character,</i>

1626
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:36,440
<i>plus the cast shadow on the rock.</i>

1627
01:14:36,524 --> 01:14:39,152
<i>And you're literally dialing up and down</i>

1628
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:44,199
<i>the settings so that the light
gets brighter and dimmer.</i>

1629
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:46,743
<i>But that's the only extra
piece of artwork you've got</i>

1630
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:48,244
<i>in a scene like that.</i>

1631
01:14:48,328 --> 01:14:50,163
HAHN: <i>It's nice. The sound
effects kind of play in here, too,</i>

1632
01:14:50,247 --> 01:14:52,540
<i>'cause you see the clouds
encroaching and then you hear…</i>

1633
01:14:52,624 --> 01:14:55,502
<i>You begin to hear the thunder
coming in the surrounds,</i>

1634
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:57,170
<i>and then by the time
you're into the fight,</i>

1635
01:14:57,254 --> 01:14:58,755
<i>the lightning storm's
right on top of you,</i>

1636
01:14:58,839 --> 01:15:00,799
<i>so it punctuates the fight.</i>

1637
01:15:03,468 --> 01:15:06,137
<i>And this whole little section
was kind of courtroom drama-like.</i>

1638
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:08,223
<i>I think that was the
conceit when it was laid out.</i>

1639
01:15:08,307 --> 01:15:10,391
-MINKOFF: <i>Simba on trial.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Simba on trial, you have a jury.</i>

1640
01:15:10,475 --> 01:15:12,644
<i>-Scar plays the judge here…</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>No, Scar's F. Lee Bailey.</i>

1641
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:16,815
HAHN: <i>F. Lee Bailey pacing up and
down, grilling him about where he was.</i>

1642
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:20,445
It's not true.

1643
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:23,197
Tell me it's not true.

1644
01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:27,910
-It's true.
-You see? He admits it!

1645
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:29,662
Murderer!

1646
01:15:29,996 --> 01:15:32,873
MINKOFF: <i>This scene is actually
done with two flat backgrounds,</i>

1647
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:35,209
<i>or rather a background
and a foreground element,</i>

1648
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:40,589
<i>and the characters are literally
animated to be turning in place.</i>

1649
01:15:40,673 --> 01:15:42,758
<i>To simulate a camera move</i>

1650
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:45,845
<i>that swings the camera 360
degrees around the characters.</i>

1651
01:15:46,512 --> 01:15:49,557
…and now everyone knows why!

1652
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:52,476
HAHN: <i>Now, this scene
is interesting 'cause,</i>

1653
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,019
<i>like many other moments in the film,</i>

1654
01:15:54,103 --> 01:16:00,485
<i>it sets up a parallel to exactly the
geography and the scenes where</i>

1655
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,738
<i>Mufasa and Scar were
interacting back at the stampede.</i>

1656
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:05,448
<i>In fact, the fire down below,</i>

1657
01:16:05,532 --> 01:16:08,535
<i>the lightning's now set the
whole Pride Lands ablaze,</i>

1658
01:16:08,619 --> 01:16:10,078
<i>and the fire is moving left to right</i>

1659
01:16:10,162 --> 01:16:12,289
<i>just like the wildebeest
stampede was moving left to right,</i>

1660
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:16,710
<i>so you create a lot of
visual imagery about</i>

1661
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:19,129
<i>the relationship between Scar and Simba,</i>

1662
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:22,132
<i>much like the imagery
between Scar and Mufasa earlier,</i>

1663
01:16:22,216 --> 01:16:24,593
<i>and now a very literal
flashback to that moment.</i>

1664
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:29,931
<i>And the art direction's
gone completely mad here.</i>

1665
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:33,143
<i>It's turned completely red.</i>

1666
01:16:33,227 --> 01:16:35,645
MINKOFF: <i>Actually, what's
interesting about this sequence is that,</i>

1667
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:38,148
<i>typically, the climactic sequence</i>

1668
01:16:38,232 --> 01:16:41,903
<i>takes the longest to
resolve, in terms of story.</i>

1669
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:43,654
<i>It begins at the very beginning,</i>

1670
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:46,324
<i>but until you've worked out
all the beats and story points</i>

1671
01:16:46,408 --> 01:16:48,576
<i>throughout the whole course of the movie,</i>

1672
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,078
<i>you don't really know what
it is you have to pay off,</i>

1673
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:54,749
<i>so this sequence went through
more changes I think, probably,</i>

1674
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:56,459
<i>than any other sequence.</i>

1675
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:58,169
<i>Took the longest to produce, too.</i>

1676
01:16:58,253 --> 01:17:02,048
<i>It was probably one of the
last sequences to be finished.</i>

1677
01:17:03,383 --> 01:17:05,968
HAHN: <i>Coming up is my
favorite ninja-Rafiki moment.</i>

1678
01:17:06,052 --> 01:17:07,429
ALLERS: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1679
01:17:09,139 --> 01:17:11,515
HAHN: <i>We spent a lot of time
trying to get the right ninja sounds.</i>

1680
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:14,101
<i>Robert Guillaume did some.</i>

1681
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:16,103
<i>We had Pat Pinney come
in, and other people</i> to…

1682
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:17,188
ALLERS: <i>We had some kung fu people.</i>

1683
01:17:17,272 --> 01:17:21,026
HAHN: <i>Kung fu people to give
us some nice ninja moments.</i>

1684
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:30,452
MINKOFF: <i>But it's also
important in a sequence like this</i>

1685
01:17:30,536 --> 01:17:32,788
<i>to have a pay-off, for
each of the characters,</i>

1686
01:17:32,872 --> 01:17:36,208
<i>so we tried to construct a
comedy moment for each character.</i>

1687
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:38,502
ALLERS: <i>It was fun to be
able to put these guys together.</i>

1688
01:17:38,586 --> 01:17:39,795
<i>They hadn't been
together for the whole film.</i>

1689
01:17:39,879 --> 01:17:42,714
MINKOFF: <i>We had a much
longer scene with these characters,</i>

1690
01:17:42,798 --> 01:17:44,800
<i>once they got into the
cave, which of course…</i>

1691
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:47,386
HAHN: <i>We thought, "Wouldn't it
be funny to put the three hyenas,</i>"

1692
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:50,847
<i>"Pumbaa, Timon and Zazu,
all in one high comedy scene.</i>"

1693
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:52,307
ALLERS: <i>Right, and
originally Pumbaa got them</i>

1694
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:53,934
<i>out of the scene, out of trouble,</i>

1695
01:17:54,018 --> 01:17:56,395
<i>by resorting to flatulence.</i>

1696
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:58,689
-MINKOFF: <i>Using his secret weapon!</i>
-ALLERS: <i>His secret weapon!</i>

1697
01:17:58,773 --> 01:18:01,734
HAHN: <i>And he cleared the cave,
and then the last one out was Zazu.</i>

1698
01:18:01,818 --> 01:18:05,947
<i>Who said, "You should
have let them kill me. Oh!"</i>

1699
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,244
HAHN: <i>A lot of this fire
coming up is turbulence fire</i>

1700
01:18:11,328 --> 01:18:14,580
<i>in the same method
that creates the smoke.</i>

1701
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:16,916
<i>Turbulence was discovered
kind of as an accident, wasn't it?</i>

1702
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,127
<i>It was like galvanized rubber, you know.</i>

1703
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:21,003
<i>They were looking at a monitor one day</i>

1704
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:22,588
<i>and these interesting
patterns were appearing,</i>

1705
01:18:22,672 --> 01:18:27,260
<i>and they kind of got into it
and found, "Oh, this is an effect.</i>"

1706
01:18:27,344 --> 01:18:30,096
<i>"This is something we can actually
harness and use in our movies."</i>

1707
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,515
ALLERS: <i>Randy Fullmer
was really instrumental</i>

1708
01:18:32,599 --> 01:18:34,267
<i>in pulling these things together,</i>

1709
01:18:34,351 --> 01:18:36,978
<i>when we were putting
together the fight against the fire,</i>

1710
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:38,396
<i>against the fire background,</i>

1711
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,065
<i>where all of a sudden one of
the things came back wrong.</i>

1712
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,443
<i>It was just absolutely weird,</i>

1713
01:18:42,527 --> 01:18:43,986
<i>the colors were all blown out,</i>

1714
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:45,446
<i>but we all looked at it and said,</i>

1715
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:47,072
<i>"Now, there's something
interesting about this.</i>"

1716
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:49,116
<i>It had kind of a flame-like look.</i>

1717
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,077
<i>So Randy researched
where the problem came from,</i>

1718
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:56,582
<i>and we actually wound up using
it for flame effects in the climax.</i>

1719
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,251
MINKOFF: <i>Basically,
they would design a block,</i>

1720
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:03,297
<i>a literal sort of
marbled cake, if you will,</i>

1721
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:06,800
<i>that slices would be taken
through and photographed,</i>

1722
01:19:06,884 --> 01:19:08,260
<i>and as each slice was removed,</i>

1723
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:11,263
<i>you would see a differing
image of that turbulence.</i>

1724
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:14,933
<i>So the shapes morph and
modulate from one to the next,</i>

1725
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:18,395
<i>so it gives you the feeling of
just a random and organic pattern.</i>

1726
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:22,817
HAHN: <i>The embers is a
really cool computer trick</i>

1727
01:19:22,901 --> 01:19:25,904
<i>where the CGI guys
create these little embers</i>

1728
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:27,822
<i>that actually turn in space
and are very dimensional,</i>

1729
01:19:27,906 --> 01:19:30,784
<i>so on the big screen they look
quite real and they glow hot.</i>

1730
01:19:30,868 --> 01:19:34,078
<i>And then you have levels
of churning smoke behind,</i>

1731
01:19:34,162 --> 01:19:37,999
<i>which is a combination of
drawn artwork and turbulence</i>

1732
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,293
<i>and diffusion put over the top of it,</i>

1733
01:19:40,377 --> 01:19:43,379
<i>to really create the
inferno feeling down below.</i>

1734
01:19:43,463 --> 01:19:46,216
MINKOFF: <i>This was sort
of an interesting experiment,</i>

1735
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,345
<i>trying to achieve that
kind of slow motion effect</i>

1736
01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:52,379
<i>that, again, you can do in live action.</i>

1737
01:19:53,223 --> 01:19:57,436
<i>And we had to simulate that by literally
dissolving from one frame to the next.</i>

1738
01:19:58,353 --> 01:19:59,729
<i>And that scene where he kicks him off,</i>

1739
01:19:59,813 --> 01:20:02,358
<i>there's an inter-cut of
about eight frames or so.</i>

1740
01:20:02,442 --> 01:20:03,442
<i>-Eleven frames.</i>
-HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

1741
01:20:03,526 --> 01:20:05,861
<i>Of Simba kind of gritting his
teeth before he kicks him off.</i>

1742
01:20:05,945 --> 01:20:08,405
MINKOFF: <i>Exactly, that's right,
that's the one that we added.</i>

1743
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:09,824
<i>It was the very last
scene that we animated…</i>

1744
01:20:09,908 --> 01:20:12,785
HAHN: <i>It was added, like, a
month before the movie came out.</i>

1745
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:15,037
<i>We previewed it and it just
seemed like something was missing.</i>

1746
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:19,208
<i>And it was a conscious
expression on Simba's face,</i>

1747
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:20,876
<i>he was gonna kick this guy's butt.</i>

1748
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,212
<i>And that was a little eight-frame
scene that was lodged in there,</i>

1749
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,632
<i>and kind of cemented
that section of the movie.</i>

1750
01:20:26,257 --> 01:20:27,883
That's what I heard.

1751
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:29,260
Ed?

1752
01:20:30,929 --> 01:20:35,850
ALLERS: <i>I always liked that we had
Scar done in by his minions, you know.</i>

1753
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:40,396
-HAHN: <i>He was foisted on his own…</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Hoisted on his own petard.</i>

1754
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,780
HAHN: <i>A Shakespeare thing.</i>

1755
01:20:46,236 --> 01:20:48,155
ALLERS: <i>And then the rains came.</i>

1756
01:20:50,991 --> 01:20:53,952
<i>All of this heavy, heavy
effects work going on in here.</i>

1757
01:20:54,036 --> 01:20:57,581
<i>Glowing embers, rain, fog.</i>

1758
01:21:04,672 --> 01:21:06,506
MINKOFF: <i>There's
Zazu saying a line, which…</i>

1759
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,425
ALLERS: <i>Says, "Your majesty.</i>"

1760
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:10,427
<i>Which then we took out
because we wanted it to be silent.</i>

1761
01:21:10,511 --> 01:21:13,179
HAHN: <i>Yeah, it kind of broke
the magic of the moment, but…</i>

1762
01:21:13,263 --> 01:21:15,765
ALLERS: <i>You can play it back and</i> go…
[IMITATES SNEEZE] <i>If you want to.</i>

1763
01:21:15,849 --> 01:21:17,392
HAHN: <i>If you like to lip sync
along at home you can say,</i>

1764
01:21:17,476 --> 01:21:19,626
<i>"Your Majesty,</i>" <i>along
with Zazu right there.</i>

1765
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:27,570
<i>Here's Rafiki pointing to the throne.</i>

1766
01:21:38,873 --> 01:21:42,502
<i>I always saw this as kind
of the Arthur-Merlin moment.</i>

1767
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:48,758
It is time.

1768
01:21:50,051 --> 01:21:52,428
ALLERS: <i>Actually, I think
we have a Don Hahn scene.</i>

1769
01:21:52,512 --> 01:21:55,139
-HAHN: <i>Roger and Rob, and even Don…</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Don, that's right.</i>

1770
01:21:55,223 --> 01:21:58,768
<i>…have animated scenes in this film.
It's our Alfred Hitchcock turn.</i>

1771
01:21:58,852 --> 01:22:02,146
ALLERS: <i>It's the close-up
of Simba's feet walking up.</i>

1772
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:03,230
<i>And there it is.</i>

1773
01:22:03,314 --> 01:22:05,264
HAHN: <i>There it is. Thank you, everyone.</i>

1774
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:12,074
<i>There was a whole
another ending of the movie.</i>

1775
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:16,453
ALLERS: <i>Yeah, where Timon and
Pumbaa brought the baby bugs and…</i>

1776
01:22:16,537 --> 01:22:19,289
HAHN: <i>They had a nice little
birthday present for the new little cub,</i>

1777
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:20,374
<i>and it was a little bug.</i>

1778
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:23,085
MINKOFF: <i>It was the same
general concept, just done differently.</i>

1779
01:22:23,169 --> 01:22:25,837
ALLERS: <i>Right, it was the goop on
the forehead from Rafiki and all that.</i>

1780
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:27,339
MINKOFF: <i>We thought we
needed another comedy pay-off</i>

1781
01:22:27,423 --> 01:22:28,548
<i>for each of the characters.</i>

1782
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:30,467
ALLERS: <i>And it was just too long.</i>

1783
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:34,179
<i>It was too tedious, and we felt
like, "Let's go out in a big way,</i>"

1784
01:22:34,263 --> 01:22:35,597
<i>and we came up with the idea of,</i>

1785
01:22:35,681 --> 01:22:39,851
<i>"Let's end it like we've cut
back in after all the ceremony"</i>

1786
01:22:39,935 --> 01:22:41,520
<i>"to the moment where
everyone is cheering."</i>

1787
01:22:41,604 --> 01:22:42,980
HAHN: <i>It's a curtain call, almost.</i>

1788
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:44,691
<i>Because, when Simba roars,
that's the end of the movie,</i>

1789
01:22:44,775 --> 01:22:47,485
<i>-and you're going for your handbag.</i>
-ALLERS: <i>That's right.</i>

1790
01:22:47,569 --> 01:22:50,029
MINKOFF: <i>It's also nice to get
that little curtain call of the characters</i>

1791
01:22:50,113 --> 01:22:51,614
<i>standing out there on Pride Rock.</i>

1792
01:22:51,698 --> 01:22:53,366
<i>That was one of the
reasons we changed it.</i>

1793
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:56,703
<i>Because when we started,
we started on the cub,</i>

1794
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:58,371
<i>and it wasn't clear who the parents were.</i>

1795
01:22:58,455 --> 01:23:00,206
<i>It wasn't clear which cub this was.</i>

1796
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,375
<i>So to begin with Simba and
Nala standing on the rock,</i>

1797
01:23:02,459 --> 01:23:04,669
<i>and then introduce Rafiki and the cub…</i>

1798
01:23:04,753 --> 01:23:07,631
HAHN: <i>It also ended up
with a wide shot of Pride Rock.</i>

1799
01:23:07,756 --> 01:23:09,966
<i>A lot like</i> Circle of Life <i>ended up.</i>

1800
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:11,551
<i>You know, with the big establishing shot.</i>

1801
01:23:11,635 --> 01:23:14,303
<i>And that just seemed so right since
you were intimate with their characters</i>

1802
01:23:14,387 --> 01:23:17,056
<i>and all our heroes are there
together to introduce the cub,</i>

1803
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,558
<i>to just say, "Let's end
on the next generation.</i>

1804
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:21,936
<i>"And here's Fluffy, Simba's
and Nala's new little cub.</i>

1805
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,063
<i>- "Let's just end on Fluffy.</i>"
-ALLERS: <i>Right.</i>

1806

HAHN: <i>I was surprised, just looking at
it again, how many callbacks there are,</i>

1807
01:23:27,735 --> 01:23:30,821
<i>even little things like the way
Pumbaa and Timon bust up the vultures</i>

1808
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:33,532
<i>is the same way they run
in and bust up the lionesses</i>

1809
01:23:33,616 --> 01:23:35,200
<i>and the hyenas.</i>

1810
01:23:35,284 --> 01:23:38,037
<i>And the way Mufasa and
Sarabi are at the beginning,</i>

1811
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:40,122
<i>is the way Simba and Nala are at the end,</i>

1812
01:23:40,206 --> 01:23:43,625
<i>and cub Simba running off to the jungles</i>

1813
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:45,586
<i>is the same as adult Simba coming back,</i>

1814
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:47,755
<i>and, you know, how many
callbacks are in the movie</i>

1815
01:23:47,839 --> 01:23:51,967
<i>to try and knit it together in
that kind of circular theme.</i>

1816
01:23:52,051 --> 01:23:53,761
MINKOFF: <i>Exactly.</i>

1817
01:23:53,845 --> 01:23:55,262
-HAHN: <i>It's interesting.</i>
-MINKOFF: <i>Yeah.</i>

1818
01:23:55,346 --> 01:23:56,972
HAHN: <i>I also didn't
realize, looking at it again,</i>

1819
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,433
<i>how much of an
effects tour de force it is.</i>

1820
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:01,185
<i>If you took out the effects animation,</i>

1821
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:05,690
<i>whether it be the shadows or the
rain or the reflections, or the fire,</i>

1822
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,776
<i>it would be greatly diminished.</i>

1823
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,070
<i>There's so many unsung
heroes in the animation process,</i>

1824
01:24:10,154 --> 01:24:12,573
<i>-and certainly…</i>
-ALLERS: <i>Absolutely.</i>

1825
01:24:12,698 --> 01:24:16,284
<i>The effects tell some of the story.
It's impossible to get around it.</i>

1826
01:24:16,368 --> 01:24:20,705
<i>I mean, Mufasa's ghost,
reflections in the water,</i>

1827
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,791
<i>the Pride Lands ablaze,</i>

1828
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:26,169
<i>so much of it tells you
information you need to know</i>

1829
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:29,047
<i>about what the context of the movie is.</i>

1830
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:30,799
<i>It would be impossible
to tell without it.</i>

1831
01:24:30,883 --> 01:24:31,883
HAHN: <i>Yeah.</i>

1832
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:33,718
MINKOFF: <i>A lot of.. This is really…</i>

1833
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,553
<i>Animated films are about the process</i>

1834
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,263
<i>as much as anything else.</i>

1835
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:39,641
<i>And there always comes a
point where you have to finish,</i>

1836
01:24:39,725 --> 01:24:45,647
<i>you have to end your
relationship with any piece of this.</i>

1837
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:51,695
<i>And every time you commit to it,
every time it becomes sort of solidified,</i>

1838
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:53,823
<i>and you know, there's always a sense of</i>

1839
01:24:53,907 --> 01:24:55,157
<i>is it all that it could be,</i>

1840
01:24:55,241 --> 01:24:57,159
<i>could we have done
something better with it?</i>

1841
01:24:57,243 --> 01:24:58,994
<i>And some pieces, of course, you feel,</i>

1842
01:24:59,078 --> 01:25:00,371
<i>"You know, we succeeded pretty well.</i>"

1843
01:25:00,455 --> 01:25:01,705
<i>And of course, there's
other pieces where you say,</i>

1844
01:25:01,789 --> 01:25:03,374
<i>"You know, maybe we
could have gone for it.</i>"

1845
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,792
HAHN: <i>It's tough.
It's knowing when to stop,</i>

1846
01:25:04,876 --> 01:25:06,836
<i>because it's never about money either,</i>

1847
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,588
<i>it tends to be more about time,
because the meter is ticking,</i>

1848
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:11,841
<i>the release date's set, you
have a movie to turn out,</i>

1849
01:25:11,925 --> 01:25:15,136
<i>and it's always in many
cases, compromise.</i>

1850
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,012
<i>And I think we were
fortunate in a lot of cases</i>

1851
01:25:17,096 --> 01:25:18,180
<i>not to have to compromise,</i>

1852
01:25:18,264 --> 01:25:22,351
<i>and, again, people like Randy
Fullmer and certainly Andy Gaskill,</i>

1853
01:25:22,435 --> 01:25:26,565
<i>helped us craft a look of the
movie that was pretty seamless.</i>

1854
01:25:26,649 --> 01:25:27,691
ALLERS: <i>They took us through places</i>

1855
01:25:27,775 --> 01:25:29,943
<i>where we had to cut back because of time.</i>

1856
01:25:30,027 --> 01:25:34,906
<i>And found other solutions
that would help us through it,</i>

1857
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:39,286
<i>that would soften the absence, you know.</i>

1858
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:42,205
<i>Like, for example, if we couldn't
do the certain effect in that one area,</i>

1859
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:46,001
<i>they'd come up with another
solution that would be a simpler effect,</i>

1860
01:25:46,085 --> 01:25:49,421
<i>and yet it would keep
the production value up.</i>

1861
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:51,548
<i>Their contribution is incredible.</i>

1862
01:25:51,632 --> 01:25:54,259
<i>So, you never had that sense
where you're riding along the movie,</i>

1863
01:25:54,343 --> 01:25:57,805
<i>and all of a sudden…</i>
[EXCLAIMS] <i>It takes a production dip.</i>

1864
01:25:57,972 --> 01:26:01,141
<i>There was a lot of creative
monkeying going on back there,</i>

1865
01:26:01,225 --> 01:26:04,394
<i>in those colored model stations.</i>

1866
01:26:04,478 --> 01:26:06,188
HAHN: <i>That's a really good point.</i>

1867
01:26:06,272 --> 01:26:07,648
<i>Well, it's interesting
because a lot of people think</i>

1868
01:26:07,732 --> 01:26:10,401
<i>our characters and a lot of our
films are created by computer,</i>

1869
01:26:10,485 --> 01:26:12,153
<i>but nothing could be
further than the truth.</i>

1870
01:26:12,237 --> 01:26:15,907
<i>Because it's artists who have
always driven these movies</i>

1871
01:26:15,991 --> 01:26:17,742
<i>and certainly who have made</i> Lion King.

1872
01:26:17,826 --> 01:26:21,037
<i>So, in a way, animation's still
created the old-fashioned way</i>

1873
01:26:21,121 --> 01:26:22,580
<i>where somebody sits
down at a drawing board</i>

1874
01:26:22,664 --> 01:26:24,415
<i>with a pencil or a paint brush</i>

1875
01:26:24,499 --> 01:26:29,295
<i>and draws or paints animation
or a background by hand.</i>

1876
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:31,923
<i>We use computers then heavily
in the post-production process</i>

1877
01:26:32,007 --> 01:26:34,133
<i>to sandwich all those
hand-done elements together</i>

1878
01:26:34,217 --> 01:26:36,135
<i>to create the final frames.</i>

1879
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:38,930
<i>And we also use computers
in an area called CGI,</i>

1880
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:43,100
<i>or computer graphics imagery, to
animate or create things on a screen</i>

1881
01:26:43,184 --> 01:26:47,063
<i>that you couldn't possibly do by
hand like the wildebeest stampede.</i>

1882
01:26:47,147 --> 01:26:48,774
<i>And the other thing I
find interesting, too, is,</i>

1883
01:26:48,858 --> 01:26:51,235
<i>we were talking about
how around the world</i>

1884
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,445
<i>these movies are put together, that you</i>

1885
01:26:53,529 --> 01:26:57,199
<i>literally have lines that cut together

1886

<i>where one word was sung in New York,</i>

1887

<i>another was done in Los Angeles,</i>

1888
01:27:00,828 --> 01:27:02,537
<i>the chorus was recorded in London,</i>

1889
01:27:02,621 --> 01:27:04,623
<i>and the music was done in Santa Monica.</i>

<i>You know, it's spread
out all over the place,</i>

questions that we're always asked is,</i>

1894
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:19,179
<i>"How do you direct an animated film?"
And the thing is</i>

1895
01:27:19,263 --> 01:27:20,555
<i>rather than in a live action film</i>

1896
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,642
<i>where you have all of your
elements together at one moment</i>

1897
01:27:23,726 --> 01:27:25,626
<i>to work with, to put them all on film,</i>

1898
01:27:25,728 --> 01:27:29,274
<i>in animation you're
literally picking up elements</i>

1899
01:27:29,358 --> 01:27:31,943
<i>scattered from all
sorts of different places.</i>

1900

<i>And you're taking all the
bits and pieces of the puzzle</i>

1901
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:36,322
<i>and putting them together,</i>

1902
01:27:36,406 --> 01:27:38,992
<i>and as a director that's
pretty much what your job is.</i>

<i>Managing, designing, juggling
