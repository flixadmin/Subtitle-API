1
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:48,012
Wireless crackling
with instructions.

2
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,409
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

3
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,107
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

4
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,002
It's always crowded here.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,308
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

6
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,306
Look at that... you scum!

7
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,210
You get awesome chicken
on the left here.

8
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,578
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

9
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,640
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

10
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,072
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

11
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,613
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,503
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

13
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,413
Boss is in a bad mood today.

14
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,278
He's pissed with everyone.

15
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,240
His wife must've screamt at him

16
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,203
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

17
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,043
he forgot to take his wife
shopping for their anniversary.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,904
She got so upset she cancelled
their dinner reservations.

19
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,246
We can handle the
toughest of criminals easily...

20
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,346
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,505
So true, Ma'am.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,080
That's why Morey is
taking the day off tomorrow.

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,876
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,535
Yes, Ma'am.

25
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,403
How is your younger
one studying?

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,045
Wonder when she studies!

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,541
She's always glued
to the TV or the computer.

28
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:27,673
That reminds me...

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,671
Hello.

30
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,938
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

31
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,169
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,341
I can hear the TV.

33
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,178
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,040
- Have you got it?
- What?

35
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:42,668
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,872
I was speaking to Jafar.

37
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:45,738
<i>OKZiY-</i>

38
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,435
Better get done with
your revision till I am back.

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:48,941
Okay, bYe-

40
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,905
Have you fed them?

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,941
They are getting a royal treatment.

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,507
Morey, is feeding them
cheese since the afternoon.

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,937
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,111
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

45
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,810
These guys love cheese.

46
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,237
Our surveillance team
is already there, right?

47
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,810
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

48
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,070
Shinde...

49
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,271
The baby's crying...

50
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,677
oh my God!

51
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,443
You son of a...

52
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:54,568
Get up!

53
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,769
Bloody rascal!

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,040
Only a mouse can get
another mouse out of his hole.

55
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,044
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,009
We are not going to shoot you.

57
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:07,941
Please, Ma'am...

58
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,814
I don't have orders to shoot you,
you scum.

59
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,973
I have to take you in alive.

60
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,306
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,672
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:23,182
God knows who else is hiding
inside for a threesome.

63
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,038
Get him!

64
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,211
You son of a...

65
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,509
You have dodged us
four times before.

66
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,110
You think we'll let
you escape so easily?

67
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,238
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

68
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,235
Take him away!

69
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,176
Giving refuge to
rats spreads plague.

70
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,979
Rehman, you should be
thankful to me.

71
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,805
You could at least
make love one last time.

72
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,277
Jafar was all set
to spoil it for you.

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,939
You are ragging me,
aren't you, Ma'am?

74
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,237
Sir's call.

75
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,805
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

76
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,344
Yes, we are taking
him to the station.

77
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,670
I had ordered you to
get him out and nab him...

78
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,403
...not barge right inside the chawl.

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,910
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

80
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,073
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

81
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,043
We would have arrested
him again if he escaped.

82
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:35,805
But who would be responsible...

83
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,277
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,904
We had taken precautions, Sir.

85
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,779
Taking rats along
was your precaution?

86
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,173
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

87
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,278
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,112
Yourjob is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

89
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,738
Someone please take
Sir's wife for shopping.

90
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,369
Go home, Ma'am.

91
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,078
Meera has asked you
to come early, right?

92
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,270
If we don't get this
rascal's paperwork right...

93
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,478
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

94
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,735
No chance, Ma'am.

95
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,535
We'll keep the papers
ready by morning.

96
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,576
You have a look at it.

97
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,337
<i>OKZiY-</i>

98
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,539
Sorry, I am late again.

99
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,509
It's okay.

100
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,004
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

101
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,837
Sorry...

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,343
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

103
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:08,273
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

104
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:09,838
For me?

105
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,745
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

106
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:16,946
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

107
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:17,768
Yes.

108
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,914
Happy birthday to you...

109
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,005
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

110
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,677
Happy birthday m you.

111
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,510
This is for Meera.

112
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,478
And for me? Come on...

113
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:53,003
Fast, fast, fast.

114
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,937
And this is for you.

115
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,903
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

116
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,047
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

117
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,146
Wear these goggles
and ride a bike in style...

118
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:27,777
Hey, hey!

119
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,105
If I look like John Abraham,
then girls will chase me.

120
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:32,534
Show me something else.

121
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,838
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

122
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,470
I have a lot of variety.

123
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,610
Try this one.

124
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,107
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

125
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,477
He was a cop just like you.

126
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,941
Roam around in style with these.

127
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,780
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

128
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,414
Ma'am, I also have
a Sunny Leone style goggle.

129
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,744
But that one doesn't have a glass.

130
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,473
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

131
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,569
But don't worry Ma'am.

132
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,045
I know exactly
what you are looking for.

133
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,839
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

134
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,407
What the hell is going on there?

135
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,405
Go check Morey.

136
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,546
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the crime branch.

137
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,203
Why do we need to get into it?

138
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,575
Morey, we are from
the crime branch later.

139
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,335
We are cops first. Let's go.

140
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:26,434
Let's go.

141
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,136
Ma'am, goggles...

142
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,540
How dare they celebrate
Valentine's Day!

143
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,836
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

144
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:55,477
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do ourjob.

145
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:56,845
Get lost!

146
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:01,510
Only one of us can
do ourjob right now.

147
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,812
And right now, I am on duty.

148
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,472
So, you stop working
and let me work.

149
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,774
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

150
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,002
You guys keep going!

151
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,373
Last warning.

152
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,078
You and your bloody last warning!

153
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,902
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,070
Stan counting, Morey.

155
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:20,344
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

156
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,169
Section 147 - rioting.

157
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,404
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

158
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,874
Section 504 - intentional
insult with intent...

159
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,139
...to provoke breach of peace.

160
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,847
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

161
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,541
Get up!

162
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,806
Two more sections left. Get up!

163
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,880
Section 188 - disobedience
to order given by public servant.

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,976
And Section 353 - assault
or criminal force...

165
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,639
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

166
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,208
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

167
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,413
Jafar, did you get
record the video?

168
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,475
Yes, Ma'am.

169
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,276
Make sure your boss
gets my name right.

170
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,746
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,975
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

172
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,701
Unit 3.

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,770
Do whatever the hell you want!

174
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,635
Get lost!

175
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,901
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

176
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,211
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

177
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,311
No, no. Give it for thirty.

178
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,739
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

179
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,073
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

180
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,407
<i>OKZiY-</i>

181
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:34,836
Pyaari!

182
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,007
Pyaari! Come here!

183
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,272
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

184
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,274
Here's a twenty... thirty...

185
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,270
Pyaari, come quickly!

186
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,278
Coming!

187
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:45,704
Keep the change.

188
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:49,543
Pyaari, get in.

189
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,635
How are you?

190
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,735
There it is.

191
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,876
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

192
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,572
Iam going to treat
both of you this Friday.

193
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,203
Really? Why?

194
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,273
It's my birthday.

195
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,041
- Really?
- No.

196
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,574
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

197
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:14,734
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

198
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,011
Very smart.

199
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,845
If the whole of India
will celebrate...

200
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,777
...then even we must too, right?

201
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,874
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

202
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,935
Kaalakhatta.

203
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,205
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

204
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,408
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

205
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,203
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

206
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:33,673
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

207
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:34,577
Me too.

208
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,207
You too? Same pinch.

209
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,544
What a stroke of luck
it was that I found you!

210
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,571
Remember how you were standing
at the railway station?

211
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,681
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

212
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,744
Aunty, but you met me, right?

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,237
My Ganpati selected you for me.

214
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,470
And me?

215
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,202
You, I have selected myself!

216
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,138
Shivani, please put
these eye drops for me.

217
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,342
Just a second. I am on my last set.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,671
Again?

219
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,676
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

220
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,569
What happened?

221
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,137
Your Kaku never lets
me work out in peace.

222
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,134
Really.

223
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,143
Why are there so many
boxes of cake in the fridge?

224
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,571
There will be one more today.

225
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:34,268
Why?

226
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,269
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

227
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,946
Its been three days,
ljust can't find her.

228
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,010
So a new cake every day?

229
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,313
We can't feed her a stale
cake on her birthday, can we?

230
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:46,710
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

231
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:47,502
Very good.

232
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,137
Yes, Jafar.

233
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,634
I'll handle that.

234
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,436
You keep the charge sheet ready.

235
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,608
I'll come in some time.

236
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,911
Yes, Jafar.

237
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,770
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

238
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:08,636
Who are you?

239
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,705
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

240
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,271
Who is Shivani Aunty?

241
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,207
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

242
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,241
Did you find her?

243
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,546
- Who?
- Her.

244
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:28,136
Who's her?

245
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,003
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

246
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,637
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

247
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,405
I thought since you are
a cop you might have found Pyaari.

248
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,371
Who let these kids inside?

249
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:45,909
What's wrong with her?

250
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,112
She's missing since
the last four days.

251
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,541
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

252
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,104
These kids wander off sometimes.

253
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,513
But they come back
in a couple of days.

254
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,211
Pyaari didn't come
back till last evening...

255
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,069
...so we filed a missing complaint.

256
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,002
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

257
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,271
This is D. N. Nagar...

258
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,569
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,001
When did you see her last?

260
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,041
Four days back.

261
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,701
I want to meet these kids.

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,308
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

263
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,274
She was with us
three days ago. And...

264
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,474
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

265
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,269
Kids get lost but
they also come back.

266
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,744
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

267
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:26,039
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

268
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,041
I haven't seen her after that.

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,479
I saw her when I came
in the morning.

270
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,801
Don't know where she
disappeared later.

271
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,576
She was carrying her bag of books.

272
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,508
I even asked her
where she was going.

273
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,540
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,844
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

275
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,009
One cup of tea

276
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,537
Since when do you
have your stall here?

277
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,575
What's the matter Ma'am?
ls anything wrong?

278
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,010
Just answer my question.

279
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,140
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

280
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,213
You won't have to pay,
if you work for me.

281
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:08,975
What's the job?

282
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,971
You have to keep an
eye on this shelter home.

283
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,941
Who comes in, who goes out.

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,207
You want me to be
an informer, right?

285
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,870
You are very smart, huh?

286
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:25,407
A girl called Pyaari
is missing from here.

287
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,407
Give me all the
information you can get.

288
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,272
Clear?

289
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,501
Write my number down.

290
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,274
9-8-2...

291
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,413
Meera, are you ready?

292
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,213
I have made your
favourite breakfast today.

293
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,507
Sharda Bai, one more
cup of tea please.

294
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,236
Yes, Sir.

295
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,209
Let me comb your hair today.

296
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,940
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

297
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,008
You need a good hair-cut.

298
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,213
We'll go to a posh salon
in Bandra this Sunday...

299
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,876
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

300
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,671
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

301
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:02,874
Pyaari is missing since five days.

302
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,169
And we are behaving
as if it never happened.

303
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,744
She has been kidnapped.

304
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,608
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,001
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

306
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:23,675
There's no network inside.

307
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,302
So he comes out to take his calls.

308
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,604
Something about dealings...

309
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,069
He bought a new cell
phone a few days ago.

310
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,513
He is obsessed with
clicking snaps on his phone.

311
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,801
He has clicked mine too.

312
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,071
Where would he be right now?

313
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,178
Ogling at girls outside
Chaaya restaurant.

314
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,070
Kapil!

315
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,372
What are you up to?

316
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,608
Nothing much.
I wasjust heading home.

317
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,741
Heading home? I'll drop you.

318
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,171
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

319
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,810
It's no bother. Come, sit.

320
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,811
Come.

321
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,172
Come sit.

322
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,804
Half our life is spent
waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

323
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:39,143
Whose call is it? Answer it.

324
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,341
It's from home.
lam going home anyway.

325
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,336
Your family is missing you, huh?

326
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,310
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

327
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,108
Anyway...

328
00:20:58,267 --> 00:20:59,302
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

329
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,102
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,439
Take a good one.

331
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,443
Done? Show me.

332
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,035
What a phone you have there!

333
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,068
Ma'am, take a look.

334
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:11,745
Latest mobile.

335
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,735
WOW!

336
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,179
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

337
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,878
Peanuts!

338
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,373
We should also quit
ourjobs and join an NGO.

339
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,943
Pick little girls
from the shelter home...

340
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,674
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

341
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,805
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

342
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,906
Don't play dumb. We know.

343
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:47,538
Jafar, let's start his
interrogation here itself.

344
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:52,308
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

345
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:53,472
Good idea, Ma'am.

346
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,937
Speak up. Who do you work for?

347
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:01,044
I don't understand what
you are talking about, Sir.

348
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,512
Why are you stretching it?

349
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,175
We are in an 'instanf era.

350
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,204
The quicker you answer,
the quicker you get home.

351
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:09,945
Come on speak up.

352
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,237
On whose instructions
did you kidnap Pyaari?

353
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:13,236
Where is she?

354
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,972
Speak up, you scum!

355
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,544
He's just pretending.

356
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,210
You are messing with my head now!

357
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,002
Are you done?

358
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,946
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

359
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,338
There they are!

360
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,840
Morey, call the control
room and get reinforcement.

361
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:40,843
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

362
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,411
Morey keep his mobile.

363
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:51,741
Move aside!

364
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,237
Move!

365
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,608
The other shooter.

366
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,941
Jafar, this matter
is getting complicated.

367
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:34,907
Damn!

368
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:38,912
Pyaari, where are you my child!

369
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,801
Come here.

370
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,135
Move.

371
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,603
Stop fooling around, guys!

372
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,371
Come on.

373
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,074
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

374
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,213
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

375
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,174
Will you rip it or should I?

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,809
- Come on.
- No, please no!

377
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,011
Come here.

378
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,073
No!

379
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:16,975
Get her.

380
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,544
Come on. Stand straight, you!

381
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,972
Iam telling you for the last time.

382
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,479
Don't do this to me.

383
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:02,911
Please!

384
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,041
Easy, Mattu!

385
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,742
Take it off!

386
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,640
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

387
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,037
In spite of you around?

388
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,511
Don't you find anyone
else to pick on!

389
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:29,945
Put her in No. 2.

390
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,001
Baby Doll!

391
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:35,005
Come here to Papa. Come.

392
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,001
Hey!

393
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:43,615
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

394
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,501
Are you insane?!

395
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,336
Who will you kill
with that splinter?

396
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,544
Myself. I will slash myself.

397
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,638
Don't slash your wrists.

398
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:54,975
It'll hurt more
and will take more time.

399
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:57,973
Loretta School, Kolkata, huh?

400
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,335
Her school is very famous.

401
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,937
I was in Hindu College.

402
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:06,344
Dropped out in the second year.

403
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,040
But that I can help you with.

404
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:11,602
No really.

405
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,477
If you really want to die
then cut this vein of your neck.

406
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,537
It'll be quick and
it'll be painless.

407
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,479
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

408
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,405
Because you have seen me.

409
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:27,668
What's her name?

410
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:29,239
Mrunal.

411
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,706
Mrunal, now it leaves
us with two options.

412
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,041
You either work for me...

413
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,437
Don't come, don't come.

414
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,670
Chill. It's okay.

415
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,743
Or I will have to kill you.

416
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:46,903
What were you about to do?

417
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:50,677
Yeah. lwould have
also done the same.

418
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,069
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

419
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,470
It would have taken
5-7 days for you to die.

420
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,912
In front of all the girls.

421
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,704
Is that what you want?

422
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,210
But what to do?

423
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,177
A bit of drama is required
to control so many of you.

424
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,402
And that leaves us
with our last option.

425
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,169
If you want to stay alive...

426
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,871
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

427
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,179
You are quite hot, you know.

428
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,511
I can get you the best clients.

429
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:26,276
5 star hotels, fine dining,
beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

430
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,778
Think about it.

431
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:35,012
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

432
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,344
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

433
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,140
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

434
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:30,907
Put her in No. 1

435
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:37,146
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

436
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,978
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

437
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,769
Look at this.

438
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,838
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

439
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,208
All the notorious ones together?

440
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,272
Ma'am most of them are
members of the Ali Gang.

441
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:53,439
This one is Balu Kotian...

442
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,204
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

443
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,576
Go back.

444
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:00,677
Just a moment.

445
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:04,772
This...

446
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,876
Who's this?

447
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:11,869
I have never seen him before.

448
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,209
Kapil loved to flaunt
his connections.

449
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,908
He's surely a member of some gang.

450
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,141
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

451
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:28,045
To pick up a girl so smoothly,
and then shoot him...

452
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,876
Only an organized gang
can operate with such finesse.

453
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,041
There is one man,
who keeps track of such things.

454
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,474
Is this a new style
of interrogation?

455
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,835
Feed meat and extract information?

456
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:53,875
Tell me, Rehman,
is anything free in life?

457
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,205
If everylhing was without a price...

458
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:57,639
...then would you
have become a gangster?

459
00:29:58,933 --> 00:29:59,638
You are right.

460
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:09,204
Do you know him?

461
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:12,502
Are you kidding me?

462
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,472
You want me to be an
informer at my stature?

463
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,509
You idiot!

464
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,769
When I had come to arrest you...

465
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,204
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

466
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,543
And now you talk about stature?

467
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,881
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

468
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:31,238
Katyal.

469
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,205
He is Sunny Katyal.

470
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,277
He's not from Mumbai.

471
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,544
He started operating here
around three years ago.

472
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,642
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

473
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,407
But the real dough comes from
drugs and trafficking.

474
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,639
Whenever a girl between
8 to 18 years disappears...

475
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,843
more often than
not he is involved.

476
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,205
You can call him
the wholesaler of trafficking.

477
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,879
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

478
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,844
Why is he not on our radar yet?

479
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:13,140
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

480
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,778
It's impossible to crack
how he smuggles drugs and girls.

481
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,939
How do the other
gangs let him operate?

482
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:21,306
He is a very smart man.

483
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:23,007
Keeps everyone happy.

484
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:24,773
Has no enemies.

485
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,574
But I have a strong doubt that
he is not the brain behind all this.

486
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,140
There is someone
bigger supporting him.

487
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,009
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

488
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,810
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

489
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:47,007
Thanks for the meat.

490
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:55,771
Katyal.

491
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,271
Sunny Katyal.

492
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,373
I want to know about
every message...

493
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:00,768
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

494
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,137
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

495
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:05,512
I want to know everylhing.

496
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,234
Got it?

497
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,101
Yes, Ma'am.

498
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,077
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

499
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:34,505
I want it clear.

500
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,543
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

501
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:16,080
The crime branch people
have made my life hell.

502
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,002
I think they'll very soon
monitor me in the loo!

503
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,504
How did they get to know about you?

504
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,338
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

505
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,303
I just know that they are
behind my life with a vengeance.

506
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:27,376
What will you do now?

507
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,010
Iam thinking of talking
to the commissioner.

508
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,275
Moron!

509
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,878
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

510
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:35,272
Then please tell
me what I should do.

511
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:38,273
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

512
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,876
Throw some money at him.

513
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:41,837
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

514
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:42,638
It's some woman.

515
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,441
She has a track record
of not accepting bribes.

516
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,439
Woman? Tell me her name.

517
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,746
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the crime branch.

518
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,744
Do one thing.

519
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:55,638
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

520
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,807
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

521
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,874
Where the hell am I sitting!

522
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,075
Just when some money
was on its way...

523
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,474
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

524
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:16,646
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

525
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:19,107
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

526
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,138
Yes.

527
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,607
The batch of girls
this time is superb.

528
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:28,207
Really?

529
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,443
What did he say?

530
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,747
He signed a 200,000 deal.

531
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,107
The foreigners loved the
service that our girls gave.

532
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,310
What is the status of the girls
from Bangladesh?

533
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:40,969
It's getting delayed.

534
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,943
The security at the border
has become very stringent.

535
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,108
It will take a week more.

536
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:49,940
You are very lenient with them,
Vakil Sir.

537
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,810
They are very prompt
at collecting their payments.

538
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,372
But when it comes to delivery,
a week's delay?

539
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:00,538
Not done.

540
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,071
What was her name?

541
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,571
Shivani Roy.

542
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,874
Wow! She's hot.

543
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,677
Let it be, Vakil sir.

544
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,203
You are too old to
deal with women like her.

545
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,879
I'll talk to her.

546
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,075
Tell Katyal to get
all information on her.

547
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,004
A week has passed
and no leads yet.

548
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,177
Either he is smart
or our information is wrong.

549
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,203
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

550
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,577
Let's wait for a few more days.

551
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,877
Iam sure he will
commit some mistake.

552
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,942
Come on. I have got dinner.

553
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:56,908
Hello?

554
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,606
You reached home, Ma'am?

555
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,608
Who's this?

556
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,608
Doesn't matter.

557
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,314
How come you picked dinner
from Aaswaad tonight?

558
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,074
Sharda bai didn't
come to work today?

559
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:08,342
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

560
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,307
- Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

561
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,311
Aunty, what have you got?

562
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,937
Someone else would
have been rattled.

563
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,603
Set the plates.
lam very hungry. Call Kaku.

564
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:17,141
Go, quick, quick.

565
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,944
Tell me.

566
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,539
Why are you watching me?

567
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,811
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

568
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:29,178
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

569
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:31,813
You sound like his son though.

570
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,239
How does it matter?

571
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,638
It's the same family.

572
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,476
The whole family seems twisted.

573
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,805
You are calling me from VOIP
so I can't trace your call?

574
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,277
To deal with a sharp
officer like you...

575
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,372
...one needs to be prepared, right?

576
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,510
No point tracing the IP address...

577
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,505
You won't find anything.

578
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:53,139
Enough bragging-

579
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,976
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

580
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,280
Stop watching my people
and quote your price.

581
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,075
I want my daughter back.

582
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:03,439
Daughter?

583
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,878
You have a daughter?

584
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:09,605
The girl you picked up
from the Andheri shelter home...

585
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:10,868
...is like my daughter.

586
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,311
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

587
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,711
It might have been possible
if you had asked earlier.

588
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,808
It's difficult now.

589
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,309
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

590
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,878
You are stretching this
a bit too much.

591
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,176
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

592
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,609
Let's do one thing.

593
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:40,679
There's a 35 story skyscraper
coming up in Wadala.

594
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:43,543
The top floor is yours.

595
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,309
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

596
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:52,739
Then tell me what you want.

597
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,808
I told you I want Pyaari back.

598
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,973
Shivani ji, you
aren't listening to me.

599
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,837
That girl has seen too much.

600
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:05,871
I don't take such
a risk in my business.

601
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,370
It's too late now.

602
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,341
Aunty, hurry UP!

603
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,111
Listen, kid.

604
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,737
I'll come hunting to
your house to rescue Pyaari.

605
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:18,672
But rescue I will.

606
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,475
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

607
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,737
Chill. Don't get worked up.

608
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,178
It doesn't suit you.

609
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,037
Anyihing else?

610
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:32,110
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

611
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,971
You need to think about it Junior.

612
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,538
I won't take too
long to reach Pyaari...

613
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,681
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

614
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,206
Okay, Ma'am.
You do yourjob and I'll do mine.

615
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,741
Let's just both do
what's best for business.

616
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,939
But I have to admit
it was fun talking to you.

617
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:54,971
Bye Ma'am.

618
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:02,116
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

619
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,280
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

620
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,643
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

621
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:10,638
How dare you touch me?

622
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,643
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

623
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:18,308
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

624
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,045
I will speak to the Human Rights
Organisations...

625
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,078
...and feed you to the dogs.

626
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,401
Sure.

627
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,105
- Jafar?
- Patil?

628
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:34,615
You feed us to the dogs
and we will feed you jalebis.

629
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:36,270
Jalebi?

630
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,249
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

631
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:44,441
I don't eat jalebis.

632
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:45,906
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

633
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:50,614
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

634
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:53,174
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

635
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,969
Eat.

636
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:06,745
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

637
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:14,146
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

638
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,603
She looks grown
but is just a child.

639
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:23,982
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

640
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:36,339
No!

641
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,039
I thought I'll celebrate
my birthday with Ganpati.

642
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,440
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

643
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,340
How are you?

644
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,602
- How old will you be?
- How old are you?

645
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,778
- Twelve.
- Me too.

646
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,635
You too?

647
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,341
Pyaari, come quickly.

648
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,706
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

649
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,970
What will you become
when you grow up?

650
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,270
An airplane driver.

651
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:09,202
What?

652
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,180
It's called a pilot,
not a driver, you fool!

653
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,542
Same thing.

654
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,705
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

655
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,547
Ma'am, have your ginger
tea and fix your mood.

656
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:34,904
Thank you, Jafar.

657
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,707
He's a seasoned player.

658
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,107
We stuffed him with
a kilo ofjalebis...

659
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,037
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

660
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,346
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

661
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,872
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

662
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:56,713
Ask Morey and Pawaskar
to continue later.

663
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,641
Don't let him sleep
even for a second.

664
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,744
Yes, Ma'am.

665
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,135
Thank you.

666
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,940
Iam coming. Two minutes.

667
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,939
Aunty, you are so late!

668
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,313
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

669
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,644
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

670
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,309
It won't hurt after
a couple of times.

671
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:01,475
Here...

672
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:03,539
...cupcake.

673
00:43:04,934 --> 00:43:06,345
For both of you.

674
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,971
Every girl gets it
after her first night.

675
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:11,709
Have it.

676
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,574
I too blew my past away
after my first night.

677
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:20,938
That's the only way to survive here.

678
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,279
Otherwise your life will be hell.

679
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:29,109
Come on, now blow the candle
and move on.

680
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:31,972
Come on.

681
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:41,914
It's a great idea to teach
that nosy cop a lesson.

682
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,874
But we'll have to
pay a fat price for it.

683
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:48,607
This guy will do ourjob for free.

684
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:50,877
Here.

685
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:53,141
Call Riyaz.

686
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,909
Tell him that this job must be done.

687
00:43:58,134 --> 00:43:59,841
Performance bonus guaranteed.

688
00:44:02,634 --> 00:44:08,312
Shivani ji, you will
stop nosing around after this.

689
00:44:10,334 --> 00:44:13,213
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

690
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,339
It's good that way.

691
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,405
Fear gets work done faster.

692
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,641
Morey... 21 missed calls!

693
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:44,805
Ma'am, come quickly.

694
00:44:45,134 --> 00:44:45,771
Why?

695
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,345
Ma'am, come quickly please.

696
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,804
Get the pervert doctor!

697
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,373
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

698
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:25,510
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

699
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:27,274
...of inappropriate behaviour.

700
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,506
Runa, that's my Kaku!

701
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,076
What's going on?

702
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:36,937
A few hours after the allegations...

703
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:39,214
...the members of
Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

704
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:44,277
mattacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

705
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,942
We had no intentions of
taking the law in our hands.

706
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,379
But the people are
fuming with anger...

707
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:53,513
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

708
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:56,138
The anger found its vent this way.

709
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,275
That doctor must be punished.

710
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,710
Please eat.

711
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,508
Hello?

712
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:47,838
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

713
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,974
Iam genuinely sorry
for what's happened.

714
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,610
In fact I even had tears
when I heard the news.

715
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,641
But I hope this doesn't
change things between us.

716
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:03,141
Because I am just
starting to like you.

717
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,540
There was nothing personal
about this, Ma'am.

718
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:09,540
It's just business.

719
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:13,069
Please don't harbour
any misunderstanding.

720
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:14,337
Please.

721
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:19,708
You know what, Junior,
I grew up in a village.

722
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,572
There was a dense
forest near my house.

723
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,743
That's why from early on
in life I knew animals very well.

724
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:33,280
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the crime branch.

725
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:36,513
To trap a mouse you
have to act like one.

726
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,775
To catch a dog you
have to think like one.

727
00:48:39,234 --> 00:48:41,339
To hunt a tiger you
have to become one.

728
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:43,538
You know what you are?

729
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:48,878
You are that poisonous
snake near the river...

730
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:55,085
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

731
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,378
You should have been with
the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

732
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,638
What are you doing
in the police force?

733
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,371
You are the one who's
about to be discovered, kid.

734
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,212
I don't know what your name is.

735
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,878
I don't know
where you are speaking from.

736
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,470
Who your boss is
or where you have kept Pyaari.

737
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,802
But I've figured your type

738
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:25,376
No matter how far you
try to stay away...

739
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:28,079
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

740
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,010
30 days.

741
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,736
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

742
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:37,841
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

743
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,939
Mark my words. 30 days.

744
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:59,548
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

745
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,543
You hear everylhing, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

746
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,641
Sir, first you don't give
me an opportunity to work...

747
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,010
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

748
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,541
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

749
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,379
Now you are making me drool.

750
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,840
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

751
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:19,240
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

752
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,376
That's awesome, Sir.

753
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,203
The contract for Taneja's
personal party must come to us.

754
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,970
Why should I get you the contract?

755
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,246
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

756
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:34,145
And as far as girls go,
look at the choice, Sir.

757
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,373
Film star or porn star.

758
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,204
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

759
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,669
Why should I get you the contract?

760
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:46,740
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

761
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,543
The list will obviously
begin with you, Sir.

762
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:53,408
And shame on me if you
have to tell me your list.

763
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,943
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

764
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:05,912
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

765
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,778
Darling, baby, come here.

766
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:09,839
Don't be shy. Come here.

767
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:13,571
Good girl.

768
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:16,646
Keep the tray here and
take Sir to the washroom.

769
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,444
Call me on Monday.

770
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,671
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

771
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:27,445
Don't forget, Sir!

772
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,071
Come, baby...

773
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,374
Hey, Mattu.

774
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:41,975
You really do appear out of nowhere!

775
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:43,438
I have been watching you.

776
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,171
How long does it
take to crack a deal?

777
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:46,710
Iam not selling water purifiers.

778
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,110
Iam trying to crack a deal
worth crores. It takes time.

779
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:51,005
If he doesn't call on Monday...

780
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:53,273
I swear I'll go to Katra
and sell religious CDs.

781
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,772
If this deal doesn't come through...

782
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:57,541
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

783
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,145
I am at it.

784
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,504
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

785
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,373
Okay. You crack this deal.

786
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:05,573
I'll send you to Mumbai
to look after our set up there.

787
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:06,710
Mumbai?

788
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:09,111
But Katyal is looking
after Mumbai, right?

789
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:11,735
Left... left... Very good.

790
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,940
Good Job.

791
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:16,210
You fool! Be careful.

792
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,008
The packet will break.

793
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:19,545
Be careful.

794
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,878
Guggu, will the car
be fixed by evening?

795
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:25,541
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

796
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:30,144
Hello, Vakil Sir.

797
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,602
This time the consignment is superb!

798
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:34,609
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

799
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,106
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

800
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,274
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

801
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,701
Should I fix her?

802
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,412
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

803
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:48,711
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

804
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:49,774
What should I do then?

805
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,577
Go underground for a few days.

806
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:53,442
One of my men will
come in the evening.

807
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,974
Go with him to the safe house.

808
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,510
He will make arrangements
for you there.

809
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,473
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

810
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,043
Don't crib so much!

811
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:03,309
Pack your bag and
be ready in the evening.

812
00:53:03,634 --> 00:53:05,045
Go with my man.

813
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,171
Bye.

814
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:10,776
Pour it in my mouth!

815
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:12,445
Get lost!

816
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,509
Iam surrounded by duck heads!

817
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,502
What's going on?

818
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:26,477
Vakil Sir has sent
such an atrocious car!

819
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:29,575
Good bye, Sir!

820
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,843
Hello? Hello?

821
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:43,247
The network conks off
at the slightest disturbance.

822
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:48,372
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

823
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:54,175
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

824
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,001
Hello?

825
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,443
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

826
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,471
Everylhing is bloodyjinxed!

827
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,910
Get out of the car.

828
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,269
Get out.

829
00:54:08,234 --> 00:54:09,508
Vakil Sir!

830
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:11,574
Get out of the car
or I'll shoot you.

831
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:13,644
Iam getting out!

832
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:16,437
Listen to me.

833
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:18,470
Why are you doing this? For money?

834
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:19,912
I'll give you double.

835
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,005
Move!

836
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:23,712
Listen to me once.

837
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,641
I'll give you all the money
you want right away.

838
00:54:26,734 --> 00:54:27,644
Your life will be made.

839
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:29,076
What's happening with me!

840
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,640
Isn't there a chance?

841
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,510
Vakil, what a way
to repay my loyalty!

842
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:41,807
Let me tell you one
thing before I die.

843
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:45,238
Don't ever be overtly
loyal to anybody in life.

844
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,976
It screws you.

845
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,878
Look at me.

846
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,140
Fifteen years...

847
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:08,036
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

848
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,238
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

849
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,840
What a business you guys run!

850
00:55:15,634 --> 00:55:16,806
May I ask you something?

851
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:21,075
How did you know about this?

852
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,173
Iam beginning to know
your boss a little bit.

853
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,046
He knew that if he didn't
pick you up I would have.

854
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:36,713
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

855
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,540
When you sat in the car,

856
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:41,410
Morey recognized that
your driver was Hanif's man.

857
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:44,677
Hanif has a brick factory
here in Kharegaon.

858
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:47,172
It makes it easier
to dispose bodies.

859
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:48,875
True.

860
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,068
I won't leave that rascal.

861
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,673
Nor will I.

862
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,602
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

863
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,178
Kid? Which kid?

864
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,570
Your boss.

865
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:03,575
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

866
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:04,939
What are you saying, Ma'am.

867
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:06,943
Vakil is at least
50 - 55 years old.

868
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:08,671
He is not a kid.

869
00:56:08,934 --> 00:56:10,004
You scum!

870
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,278
If you waste our time again...

871
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,108
...l'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

872
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,973
I swear by God I am not lying.

873
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:18,368
If I am lying...

874
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,610
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

875
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,780
Vakil got me to
Mumbai four years ago.

876
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:26,045
Iam working with him since then.

877
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:27,802
Keep talking.

878
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,272
I know Vakil very well.

879
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:30,643
He stays in Delhi.

880
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:31,344
Hello?

881
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:33,979
Damn! Katyal escaped.

882
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,005
H ow?

883
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,004
Hanif's man was found dead.

884
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:38,972
How did he die?

885
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,278
He was shot.

886
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,173
Where?

887
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,978
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

888
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,040
On the body.

889
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:50,180
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

890
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:54,306
He was shot in the head from behind.

891
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:55,875
Where did they find the dead body?

892
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:57,273
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

893
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:02,508
Hang up the other phone.

894
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,371
Hung UP-

895
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:09,446
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

896
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:10,975
But who saved him?

897
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:12,243
Who else?

898
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,509
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

899
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,973
It's time to send her another gift.

900
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,677
Congrats Ma'am.

901
00:58:04,467 --> 00:58:06,970
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

902
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,204
Every time you point
a finger at me...

903
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:11,378
...you will get this gift from me.

904
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:14,044
Your Kid.

905
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:39,543
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

906
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:01,704
Hello!

907
00:59:02,134 --> 00:59:04,444
I have left from the hotel.
lam going to office now.

908
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:08,375
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

909
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,436
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

910
00:59:18,733 --> 00:59:20,178
He was my senior in the institute.

911
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:22,140
We used to have
fun times those days.

912
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:24,313
He praises you very highly.

913
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,740
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like awild bull.

914
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,478
You know what.
Good officers like you...

915
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,302
- May I?
- Yes, come in.

916
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:36,975
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

917
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:40,613
Meet Sub-Inspector
Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

918
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,901
A very efficient officer.

919
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:43,173
Shivani Roy.

920
00:59:43,434 --> 00:59:45,641
- Ma'am... - Senior Inspector,
Mumbai Crime Branch.

921
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,602
She has come with information
on a huge child...

922
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,908
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

923
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,945
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

924
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:55,835
Thank you, Sir.

925
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,413
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

926
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,240
Your source? Here?

927
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:03,173
I have got him here
with Sinha Sir's help.

928
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,908
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

929
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:07,414
Ditto! This is exactly how he looks.

930
01:00:08,067 --> 01:00:10,570
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

931
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:13,408
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

932
01:00:13,934 --> 01:00:15,436
But nobody knows his real name.

933
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:17,808
He sometimes deals
as Devinder Pasricha.

934
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,035
Or opens an office
in the name of Aakash Pandey.

935
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:23,444
But he keeps no name
or office for more than six months.

936
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,370
We haven't heard of him ever.

937
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,438
He takes pride in that.

938
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,607
He always boasts that
he will never get arrested.

939
01:00:32,034 --> 01:00:33,570
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

940
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,145
Of course there is.

941
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:37,771
One is drugs and the other is girls.

942
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,272
And that too because
he is getting senile with age.

943
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,076
We can't go posing
as customers for girls.

944
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:46,675
He will be expecting me
to do something like this.

945
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,969
We'll have to play him
in such away...

946
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,647
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

947
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:56,710
Usually drug suppliers
deal only in one kind of drug...

948
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:59,072
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

949
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,471
If he has his way he'll sell
cough syrup as drugs.

950
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,704
He is that greedy.

951
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,612
As far as I know, Sodhi...

952
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,307
...South American drug
is hard to get, right?

953
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:09,513
Right. And even if you get it,
its very expensive.

954
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:13,742
That means a higher profit margin.

955
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,473
He will do anything for business.

956
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:22,178
If we can get this news to Vakil
that we are not buyers...

957
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,038
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

958
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,071
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

959
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:32,571
If he comes to know
then it is sure to reach Vakil.

960
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,309
But our drug supplier
should look genuine.

961
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,104
Why should we do it?

962
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,310
Because it's a question
of somebody's life Mbangwa.

963
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:51,410
But it's a matter of our life too.

964
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,838
And what if we get killed?

965
01:01:53,067 --> 01:01:54,341
Who will kill you?

966
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,409

No.

Listen to me Mboso.

Don't forget
you don't have any passport.

971
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,179
So either I will make
papers to deport you back...

972
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,175
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

973

You decide.

Five.

Five what?

Five kilos.

Are you crazy?

988
01:03:03,334 --> 01:03:06,747
I want 100 grams only.

I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

993
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:25,210
The whole material. Okay?

994

How much longer? Please hurry.

What should I tell Bob?

Who's Bob?

Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

998
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:42,105
He met those Nigerians.

999
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,737
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1000
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:47,979
Give me some onions.

1001
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,904
The material will be
good if Bob has checked it.

1002
01:03:51,434 --> 01:03:53,778
Besides the cricket season
is beginning from next month.

1003

How much longer?

1004

It's been a long time now.

1005
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:08,048

if someone demands girls...

01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:12,577
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

send someone as a customer.

Not to take any new customers?

1009
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:20,710
I said no.

1010
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:22,971
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1011

Taste from my plate
if you are in such a rush.

Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

I couldn't sleep wondering
how to kill you.

how you'll kill me?

else you want to say?

Now, I will show you what I can do.

...hid your family safely.

But now you can't harm me anymore.

1097
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,009
Because I am still alive.

1098
01:13:21,134 --> 01:13:23,114
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1099

Beware.

Don't chew. Swallow!

Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1103
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:49,239
You just have to eat this pellet.

1104
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,136
Even the grapes are here.

1105
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,109
Will you practice with grapes?

1106
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:55,377
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1107
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:57,239
You better!

1108
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,268
Open your mouth.

1109
01:13:58,367 --> 01:13:59,937
Give me some other work.

1110
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:03,108
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1111
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:06,506
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1112
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,237
- Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1113
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:11,508
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1114
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:13,180
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1115
01:14:13,234 --> 01:14:14,440
Yes, they are.

1116
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:15,774
You worry too much.

1117
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,274
By the way when are you
sending me to Mumbai?

1118
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:18,812
I'll take care of our set up there.

1119
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:21,545
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1120
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,874
6 girls are leaving for London
and 3 for Texas.

1121
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:27,744
Their domestic help visas
and documents are ready.

1122
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,936
Last time on the way
to the airport...

1123
01:14:30,034 --> 01:14:31,945
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1124
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,042
Remember?

1125
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,979
Is anyone else
going to die this time?

1126
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:37,172
No. This time Alka
has taken all precautions.

1127
01:14:37,234 --> 01:14:38,872
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1128
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,875
This time I have used
the safest coatings.

1129
01:14:41,267 --> 01:14:42,610
The pellets won't burst.

1130
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,108
Chill. Everylhing is under control.

1131
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:44,936
Yes.

1132
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,704
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1133
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,239
We must have only
the best in the party.

1134
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:51,505
- Alka.
- Yes.

1135
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:53,372
Have you sent our man
to the police headquarters?

1136
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:56,037
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1137
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,679
She will definitely go there.

1138
01:14:57,734 --> 01:15:00,044
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1139
01:15:00,867 --> 01:15:03,313
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1140
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,541
Angelina, baby...

1141
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:10,177
...what's wrong with you?

1142
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,906
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1143
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,171
She hasn't slept well last night.

1144
01:15:14,334 --> 01:15:16,712
Is your name Julia or Angelina?

1145
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:18,840
Julia...

1146
01:15:19,034 --> 01:15:21,310
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1147
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:26,481
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1148
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:28,645
Iamjust tired...

1149
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:31,704
Tired, huh?

1150
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:35,374
That's why you have this
strip of cloth on your forehead.

1151
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:37,836
I understand.

1152
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,477
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1153
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:43,477
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1154
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:44,509
No, no, no...

1155
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:46,874
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1156
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:50,380
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1157
01:15:52,034 --> 01:15:55,481
Please let her stay. Please.

1158
01:15:56,767 --> 01:15:58,610
- Come on.
- I am alright.

1159
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:01,914
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1160
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:10,674
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1161
01:16:13,267 --> 01:16:14,610
- H u rry.
- Yes.

1162
01:16:18,267 --> 01:16:19,109
Runa...

1163
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:21,742
Runa...

1164
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:25,304
Get her quickly!

1165
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,745
Runa... No! Runa!

1166
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,938
Take her away. Come on!

1167
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,108
Runa!

1168
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,310
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1169
01:16:43,834 --> 01:16:48,044
Shivani, don't stretch
this case too much.

1170
01:16:48,467 --> 01:16:50,970
We have got the man
we were looking for.

1171
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,408
But we didn't, Sir!

1172
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,841
The mastermind of this
syndicate is still roaming free!

1173
01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:58,010
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1174
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:01,339
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1175
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,004
And not just drugs...

1176
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:04,705
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1177
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:08,610
Shivani, trafficking is
altogether a different matter.

1178
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:12,038
We have a trafficking
department to investigate that.

1179
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,478
Department?

1180
01:17:15,234 --> 01:17:18,704
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1181
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,876
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1182
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:24,609
Sir, you don't need
the law to do something.

1183
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:25,871
You need intent.

1184
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,104
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1185
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:31,745
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1186
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:38,480
All these girls who need our
helpjust end up being 'that girl'.

1187
01:17:39,867 --> 01:17:41,540
No name, no ties.

1188
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,613
It's very easy to give up on them.

1189
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:48,844
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1190
01:17:49,034 --> 01:17:51,742
So one should get emotional
only after girls are raped?

1191
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:55,981
What's the point of holding a candle
march after everylhing's over?

1192
01:17:57,234 --> 01:17:59,942
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1193
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,513
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1194
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:05,246
But that doesn't mean that...

1195
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,007
...l forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1196
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,175
And that too after
being a police officer.

1197
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,544
You know what, Sir...

1198
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,709
The day our police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1199
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,408
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1200
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:21,309
Enough, Shivani!

1201
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:24,778
I agree that we have
arrested a drug dealer...

1202
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,272
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1203
01:18:27,901 --> 01:18:30,245
But now allow us
to take over from here.

1204
01:18:30,467 --> 01:18:31,502
Is that clear?

1205
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:32,844
Sir, why us all the time?

1206
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:35,345
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1207
01:18:35,967 --> 01:18:37,275
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1208
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:38,174
Thank you, Sir.

1209
01:19:20,034 --> 01:19:21,980
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1210
01:19:22,234 --> 01:19:24,544
I asked since when do you
drive an auto.

1211
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,409
Past four or five years.

1212
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:29,176
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1213
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:31,541
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1214
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:54,177
She escaped!

1215
01:20:28,434 --> 01:20:29,037
Hello?

1216
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:31,371
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1217
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,170
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1218
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,546
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1219
01:20:36,034 --> 01:20:39,174
We share the smallest
details of our life...

1220
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:42,448
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1221
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:44,709
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1222
01:20:44,901 --> 01:20:45,436
Correct!

1223
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:46,942
So Vakil will also
have someone like this.

1224
01:20:47,367 --> 01:20:48,937
Nobody came to claim his body.

1225
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,644
Because of fear of interrogation.

1226
01:20:51,034 --> 01:20:52,707
Tell me what's your point.

1227
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,537
Vakil must surely have someone.

1228
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:57,040
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1229
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,406
She will surely know
whom Vakil worked for.

1230
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,980
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1231
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,806
Whatever you found
on Vakil's body...

1232
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:09,345
...gun, pant, shin,
wallet, anything.

1233
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:10,307
Get everylhing.

1234
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,275
We'll definitely find a clue.

1235
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,169
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1236
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,774
How can get it out of office?

1237
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:19,474
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1238
01:21:20,467 --> 01:21:21,912
You will get me
in trouble Miss Shivani.

1239
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:25,771
I was so worried getting
these things out of office.

1240
01:21:26,367 --> 01:21:29,405
Honestly whatever
we are doing is illegal.

1241
01:21:30,367 --> 01:21:31,573
Always by the book.

1242
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:36,038
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1243
01:21:36,867 --> 01:21:40,041
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1244
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:43,780
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1245
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:44,911
Please, Ma'am.

1246
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,314
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1247
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,140
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1248
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:00,776
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1249
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,642
That's surprising.

1250
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:06,645
In an era of readymade,
this guy wore stitched clothes!

1251
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:08,142
Classic old school.

1252
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,706
Someone who stitches his trousers
and shirt form the same tailor...

1253
01:22:12,034 --> 01:22:14,071
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched from him.

1254
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:15,909
Where is Modern Tailors?

1255
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:17,469
- Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:20,138
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1257
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:21,836
- From here?
- Yes.

1258
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,640
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1259
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:29,344
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1260
01:22:30,234 --> 01:22:33,579
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1261
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:36,815
I know him for the past 23 years.

1262
01:22:37,234 --> 01:22:40,477
Was this an accident
or some police case?

1263
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,503
I don't know that.

1264
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:45,907
Myjob is to find out
if he has any relatives.

1265
01:22:47,034 --> 01:22:50,345
I don't know of any relatives.

1266
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,637
But there is a lady with
whom he was acquainted with...

1267
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:55,203
...for the past many years.

1268
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:01,444
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1269
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:05,908
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1270
01:23:06,867 --> 01:23:09,370
Then she should
know about his death.

1271
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:10,510
Where does she stay?

1272
01:23:10,967 --> 01:23:14,346
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1273
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:17,907
Yes?

1274
01:23:18,234 --> 01:23:19,212
Is Minu Rastogi here?

1275
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,337
Who are you?

1276
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:23,078
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1277
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:24,271
Please come in.

1278
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:26,736
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1279
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,740
Harish...

1280
01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:30,711
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1281
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:38,340
Get this medicine.

1282
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:40,775
Yes, Ma'am.

1283
01:23:41,134 --> 01:23:42,442
Please sit.

1284
01:23:44,134 --> 01:23:45,977
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1285
01:23:48,034 --> 01:23:49,035
I have diabetes.

1286
01:23:50,034 --> 01:23:52,378
My doctor has completely
banned sugar for me.

1287
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:54,477
You are young.

1288
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,305
- Here...
- Thank you.

1289
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:04,379
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1290
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,008
It's a long story.

1291
01:24:07,634 --> 01:24:10,274
I have a lot of time.

1292
01:24:12,201 --> 01:24:14,078
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1293
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:16,371
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1294
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:19,380
If I find it later,
you know I'll shoot you, right?

1295
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:20,136
Yes.

1296
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:22,847
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1297
01:24:25,434 --> 01:24:26,469
Go do your work.

1298
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:32,777
Actually...

1299
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,377
I hadn't sent Harish
to get medicine.

1300
01:24:38,367 --> 01:24:40,779
I had sent him to see
if there are cops outside.

1301
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,170
No, no, I have come alone.

1302
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:51,438
O God, strange are your ways!

1303
01:24:52,934 --> 01:24:56,108
The person my son is looking
for in the whole city...

1304
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,374
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1305
01:25:04,101 --> 01:25:08,572
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1306
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:12,709
What do you call him?

1307
01:25:13,267 --> 01:25:16,771
The kid.

1308
01:25:19,067 --> 01:25:20,011
This is his house.

1309
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:23,612
What's happening to you?

1310
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:25,243
Feeling dizzy?

1311
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,939
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1312
01:25:34,634 --> 01:25:37,205
Now you won't be capable
of doing anything.

1313
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:41,874
And my Karan will
be back in some time.

1314
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,646
You killed Vakil, right!

1315
01:25:49,034 --> 01:25:51,776
My Karan will torture you to death.

1316
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,171
What fun it'll be!

1317
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:11,339
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1318
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:17,702
Hey...

1319
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:22,502
I am Walt.

1320
01:26:25,034 --> 01:26:26,638
Actually my name is Karan.

1321
01:26:27,634 --> 01:26:29,773
But I have changed it to Walt.

1322
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:35,073
It's the name of the
hero in an English show.

1323
01:26:36,467 --> 01:26:38,447
So you did keep your promise.

1324
01:26:39,234 --> 01:26:41,510
You found me on the 27th day.

1325
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:44,306
That's amazing.

1326
01:26:47,134 --> 01:26:48,169
Congratulations!

1327
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:51,843
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1328
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,404
I'll just bring you to a state...

1329
01:26:55,467 --> 01:26:57,811
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1330
01:27:00,434 --> 01:27:01,435
You!

1331
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:23,478
Mom, what's for lunch?

1332
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:29,444
Are all the girls ready?

1333
01:27:29,801 --> 01:27:32,577
Alka, you are on what's app again!

1334
01:27:32,934 --> 01:27:34,242
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1335
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,075
I'll get them ready
in just five minutes.

1336
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:41,115
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1337
01:27:41,634 --> 01:27:45,446
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1338
01:27:45,867 --> 01:27:47,642
Honey, please. Thank you.

1339
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,574
Open your mouth...

1340
01:27:49,801 --> 01:27:50,779
Properly...

1341
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:53,344
Good girl!

1342
01:27:58,567 --> 01:27:59,568
That's good.

1343
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,676
And don't behave like a fool there.

1344
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:04,406
Be sexy!

1345
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:05,843
Good girl!

1346
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,675
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1347
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,638
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1348
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:13,341
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

1349
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:14,568
Thank you.

1350
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:16,641
Look at that.

1351
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,105
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1352
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,640
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1353
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:26,078
- And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1354
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:27,578
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1355
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:28,805
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1356
01:28:28,867 --> 01:28:30,107
She's very strong.

1357
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:32,677
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1358
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:35,375
Who is she?

1359
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:37,043
I don't know.

1360
01:28:37,801 --> 01:28:40,372
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1361
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:43,875
Is everyone ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1362
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:45,509
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1363
01:28:45,567 --> 01:28:47,240
Should I take them downstairs?

1364
01:28:47,334 --> 01:28:49,336
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1365
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,572
Everybody please wait and watch.

1366
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,378
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1367
01:28:53,567 --> 01:28:55,240
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1368
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:56,813
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1369
01:28:57,167 --> 01:28:57,941
Get out.

1370
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,837
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1371
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:03,209
She's not asking you.

1372
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:06,738
Julia, there's no movie
being shown here.

1373
01:29:07,834 --> 01:29:08,574
Go.

1374
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:10,373
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1375
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,071
Go!

1376
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:16,715
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1377
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,835
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1378
01:29:19,534 --> 01:29:23,505
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1379
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:26,844
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1380
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,313
Hold it Madam. Cool down.

1381
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:31,372
Get lost!

1382
01:29:31,567 --> 01:29:32,910
Listen girl!

1383
01:29:33,734 --> 01:29:36,943
I have been doing this since
before you were even born!

1384
01:29:37,301 --> 01:29:39,645
I know exactly how to
tame the likes of you!

1385
01:29:40,234 --> 01:29:41,372
Just untie my hands and see...

1386
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:45,680
...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

1387
01:29:46,101 --> 01:29:48,308
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1388
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,644
Don't hit the face.

01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:25,509
The whole arrangement
is especially for you.

1414

Thank you.

1415

Everylhing is ready, Sir.

Sir...

1417
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,501
Hi, good evening.

1418
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:32,803
Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

1419
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:36,443
- He will come at his own time.
- Oh yes. Of course!

1420
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:37,805
You first show me your arrangements.

1421
01:31:37,901 --> 01:31:39,278
- Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1422
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:42,576
Angie, baby, wait. Right
now he's just checking things out.

1423
01:31:42,934 --> 01:31:43,935
He'll come later.

1424
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:45,202
Come, Sir.

1425
01:31:45,234 --> 01:31:46,611
Security is very tight.

1426
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,743
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1427
01:31:49,067 --> 01:31:51,513
Only when there's no fear
of being photographed...

1428
01:31:52,067 --> 01:31:54,104
...can a person enjoy freely.

1429
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:57,972
Julia, come, baby.

1430
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:01,207
Come, come, for Sir.

1431
01:32:01,801 --> 01:32:03,246
Don't be shy. Sir...

1432
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,878
Girls get abducted
in our cities for free...

1433
01:32:14,601 --> 01:32:15,511
In broad day light.

1434
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:21,871
But when one guy sets up
a small organized business...

1435
01:32:22,367 --> 01:32:23,539
...and everyone gets upset!

1436
01:32:25,834 --> 01:32:27,643
Why did you do all of this?

1437
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:29,702
What did you get?

1438
01:32:33,634 --> 01:32:36,240
You women get personal too soon.

1439
01:32:38,534 --> 01:32:41,845
I agree that you are a cop,
from the crime branch.

1440
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,378
But to obsessively chase
just one criminal?

1441
01:32:44,467 --> 01:32:46,447
What kind of professionalism
is this?

1442
01:32:47,601 --> 01:32:48,807
Where did you learn this?

1443
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:50,843
Nonsense.

1444
01:32:52,634 --> 01:32:59,244
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1445
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,306
You know what I am saying,
Miss Shivani?

1446
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:07,075
The night is young.

1447
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:10,079
Stare at the ceiling
and scream your lungs out.

1448
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:11,936
Scream?

1449
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:18,305
Scream.

1450
01:33:29,134 --> 01:33:30,112
That's right.

1451
01:33:31,967 --> 01:33:32,968
There's no point.

1452
01:33:37,801 --> 01:33:39,246
Crime branch!

1453
01:33:51,067 --> 01:33:51,943
Sir has come.

1454
01:33:57,367 --> 01:33:59,472
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1455
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:00,839
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1456
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,072
- How are you?
- All good.

1457
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:03,908
Everylhing's ready for you.

1458
01:34:06,534 --> 01:34:07,512
Welcome, Sir!

1459
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:09,910
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1460
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:11,407
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1461
01:34:11,967 --> 01:34:12,672
Wait here.

1462
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:18,606
Come, Sir.

1463
01:34:20,067 --> 01:34:20,977
Come, Sir.

1464
01:34:21,234 --> 01:34:23,407
Tandon, have you checked
everylhing personally?

1465
01:34:23,534 --> 01:34:24,376
Yes, Sir.

1466
01:34:24,467 --> 01:34:26,743
You are bound to be happy
with the arrangements.

1467
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,301
Come, Sir.

1468
01:34:31,501 --> 01:34:33,037
- Everylhing's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1469
01:34:34,234 --> 01:34:35,338
Sir, to your left.

1470
01:34:43,834 --> 01:34:45,472
The arrangements look great.

1471
01:34:46,367 --> 01:34:48,904
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1472
01:34:49,234 --> 01:34:51,612
There's a special gift
for you in the suite upstairs.

1473
01:34:51,867 --> 01:34:53,471
You should check it
out if you are in the mood.

1474
01:34:53,967 --> 01:34:55,002
Everybody knows.

1475
01:34:55,434 --> 01:34:57,505
Be it the opposition or women...

1476
01:34:58,034 --> 01:35:00,241
...l am always in a mood to crush!

1477
01:35:01,334 --> 01:35:04,838
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1478
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,405
Hello!

1479
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,044
I have heard a lot about you.

1480
01:35:21,701 --> 01:35:22,304
You?

1481
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:25,538
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1482
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,307
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1483
01:35:29,967 --> 01:35:31,412
Iam sure even you do.

1484
01:35:32,334 --> 01:35:33,312
My hobby is this.

1485
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:36,544
Have you really come to rape me?

1486
01:35:36,967 --> 01:35:39,504
I don't know how
one pretends to rape.

1487
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:43,244
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1488
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,970
You want to rape me!

1489
01:36:05,034 --> 01:36:07,275
Get up! Come on!

1490
01:36:11,434 --> 01:36:12,606
Stop this party!

1491
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:14,209
Get out!

1492
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,435
What is happening?

1493
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:17,474
Walt, where the hell are you?

1494
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:18,838
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1495
01:36:18,967 --> 01:36:20,446
Where did she come from!

1496
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:21,901
She has lost it!

1497
01:36:24,534 --> 01:36:28,107
Karan Rastogi, do you want
this minister alive or not?

1498
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,370
Tandon! Do something, Tandon!

1499
01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:31,174
Mattu, wait!

1500
01:36:31,767 --> 01:36:33,713
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1501
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,403
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1502
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:38,575
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1503
01:36:39,101 --> 01:36:41,547
I want all the girls out.

1504
01:36:42,101 --> 01:36:43,978
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1505
01:36:44,234 --> 01:36:45,042
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1506
01:36:45,234 --> 01:36:46,110
Mattu, are you dead!

1507
01:36:47,034 --> 01:36:48,911
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1508
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:49,738
Hurry up!

1509
01:36:49,867 --> 01:36:50,777
Fast.

1510
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,310
Fast, girls! Fast!

1511
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:53,543
Hurry up, Alka.

1512
01:36:54,534 --> 01:36:55,569
- Pyaari, wait.
- Au nty.

1513
01:36:56,401 --> 01:36:57,311
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1514
01:36:57,467 --> 01:36:59,413
Give the key of the
mobile locker to Pyaari.

1515
01:36:59,634 --> 01:37:00,806
Give her the damn key.

1516
01:37:04,901 --> 01:37:06,107
You got the girls.

1517
01:37:06,534 --> 01:37:07,274
What else do you want?

1518
01:37:07,767 --> 01:37:08,370
You.

1519
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:09,877
You will come with me.

1520
01:37:13,901 --> 01:37:15,403
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1521
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,275
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1522
01:37:17,634 --> 01:37:20,114
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1523
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,107
Tell them that no one moves
from here till you get back.

1524
01:37:25,334 --> 01:37:27,314
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1525
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:28,045
You wait.

1526
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,537
Everybody, we have got
a bit of a situation.

1527
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:31,975
Iam going to son
it out and be right back.

1528
01:37:32,367 --> 01:37:33,846
Raise your hands! Move!

1529
01:37:34,801 --> 01:37:35,575
Move!

1530
01:37:36,967 --> 01:37:37,570
Come on.

1531
01:37:40,034 --> 01:37:41,911
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1532
01:37:46,034 --> 01:37:47,775
Damn! She has locked the door!

1533
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:49,405
Come on quickly.

1534
01:37:49,501 --> 01:37:51,344
Aunty, but the exit
is this side.

1535
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:52,509
We are not going out.

1536
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:53,769
°Pen <i>m</i>

1537
01:37:58,034 --> 01:38:00,105
Open! Get in.

1538
01:38:01,034 --> 01:38:03,105
Come on, girls. Get in.

1539
01:38:05,567 --> 01:38:06,204
Be there.

1540
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:09,645
Pyaari, close the door.

1541
01:38:11,267 --> 01:38:13,338
Lock the door. Lock it!

1542
01:38:24,501 --> 01:38:25,809
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1543
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:27,041
Get in!

1544
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:32,310
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1545
01:38:32,767 --> 01:38:35,771
You guys think we cops
are morons, right?

1546
01:38:38,601 --> 01:38:39,807
But how did you manage to do this?

1547
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,744
When I got the address
to your place...

1548
01:38:43,234 --> 01:38:45,271
...l had no clue
that it is your house.

1549
01:38:45,834 --> 01:38:49,281
- Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1550
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:51,979
In crime branch we are trained to...

1551
01:38:52,334 --> 01:38:56,339
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1552
01:38:56,767 --> 01:39:00,146
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1553
01:39:02,134 --> 01:39:03,306
Who else stays with her?

1554
01:39:03,501 --> 01:39:05,503
Her son and a servant.

1555
01:39:06,134 --> 01:39:07,112
How old is the son?

1556
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:08,745
Around 25-26.

1557
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:12,781
I was wondering what to do next
when I heard a sound.

1558
01:39:15,267 --> 01:39:17,770
Maybe God was trying
to tell me something.

1559
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,404
I had heard this Azaan before.

1560
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:22,744
But where?

1561
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,777
Then I remembered.

1562
01:39:25,301 --> 01:39:27,212
But you can't do any harm to me.

1563
01:39:27,901 --> 01:39:28,777
Because I am still alive.

1564
01:39:28,834 --> 01:39:30,575
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1565
01:39:31,334 --> 01:39:37,285
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1566
01:39:38,834 --> 01:39:40,643
But then who will take
a risk with you?

1567
01:39:40,967 --> 01:39:43,846
I began watching your house.

1568
01:39:44,267 --> 01:39:45,769
I spotted you the next day.

1569
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,640
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1570
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,839
But one look at your sly face...

1571
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,277
...and I knew it had to be you.

1572
01:39:53,967 --> 01:39:56,971
The first thing I did was
put a GPS tracker in your car.

1573
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,680
48 hours went by...

1574
01:40:06,201 --> 01:40:08,738
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1575
01:40:09,534 --> 01:40:10,774
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1576
01:40:11,067 --> 01:40:12,671
...and also the other girls.

1577
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,738
Even if we did arrest you,
what could we charge you with?

1578
01:40:17,734 --> 01:40:20,340
That's when I decided that
there's no point wasting time.

1579
01:40:20,634 --> 01:40:22,341
Now you yourself
will take me to Pyaari.

1580
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:26,545
I entered your house
but I was fully prepared.

1581
01:40:26,867 --> 01:40:29,074
Ijust had to make the move
at the right time.

1582
01:40:35,767 --> 01:40:37,644
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1583
01:40:37,968 --> 01:40:41,142
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1584
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,380
Pyaari, get the phone.

1585
01:40:45,534 --> 01:40:47,411
And what if I would have
killed you right then?

1586
01:40:49,234 --> 01:40:51,043
I had to take that risk.

1587
01:40:52,701 --> 01:40:55,375
Like I said,
I knew your type.

1588
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:58,011
You wouldn't kill
me that easily.

1589
01:40:58,467 --> 01:41:01,175
You would want to exploit me
like other women.

1590
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:05,374
I must give it to you. But what now?

1591
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:07,478
Sodhi, come.

1592
01:41:09,267 --> 01:41:12,714
The police will take at
least 25 minutes to get here.

1593
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:16,011
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1594
01:41:16,767 --> 01:41:20,305
And I am standing in
between you and your freedom.

1595
01:41:21,933 --> 01:41:23,606
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1596
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:28,347
Women... women...

1597
01:41:30,067 --> 01:41:32,206
Take everylhing personally, right?

1598
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:33,908
Come on.

1599
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:39,510
Let me see how far
on top a man can climb.

1600
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:41,306
As you wish.

1601
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:04,012
Au nty!

1602
01:42:14,201 --> 01:42:15,509
Get up! Get up!

1603
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,504
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1604
01:42:59,434 --> 01:43:03,712
You will me hit me a little
and then arrest me, right?

1605
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,537
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1606
01:43:10,634 --> 01:43:11,772
This is India.

1607
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:17,211
Over here,
if you have the right contacts...

1608
01:43:17,467 --> 01:43:20,710
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1609
01:43:22,201 --> 01:43:24,203
This is trivial in comparison.

1610
01:43:25,434 --> 01:43:28,142
So till then you
hit me and have fun.

1611
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,339
Hit me, Ma'am.

1612
01:43:31,367 --> 01:43:32,869
There is nothing else you can do.

1613
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:34,645
This is India.

1614
01:43:40,867 --> 01:43:43,006
This one thing you are right about.

1615
01:43:43,934 --> 01:43:44,878
This is India.

1616
01:43:45,501 --> 01:43:46,809
'This' is what goes on here.

1617
01:43:51,634 --> 01:43:55,480
These people sitting outside
will bury your crime?

1618
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,005
They can do it only if you
reach the police station.

1619
01:44:00,967 --> 01:44:04,813
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1620
01:44:05,067 --> 01:44:08,276
Here, if you don't want
to bother the court too much...

1621
01:44:08,434 --> 01:44:10,505
...issues can be settled this way.

1622
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:14,807
Get up!

1623
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:21,008
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1624
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,480
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1625
01:44:27,234 --> 01:44:28,076
Get up!

1626
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,741
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1627
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,970
What's your plan?

1628
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,072
Are you going to murder me?

1629
01:44:50,067 --> 01:44:51,637
In front of everyone?

1630
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:55,839
This is India.

1631
01:44:56,567 --> 01:44:59,070
In India, if 50 people
take the law in their hands...

1632
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:02,011
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1633
01:45:02,434 --> 01:45:04,175
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1634
01:45:17,701 --> 01:45:22,343
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1635
01:45:22,667 --> 01:45:27,673
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1636
01:45:37,867 --> 01:45:42,509
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1637
01:45:42,867 --> 01:45:47,748
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1638
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:52,450
Touch my heart and I promise
you will mean the world to me

1639
01:45:52,634 --> 01:45:55,114
But if you ever mess with me

1640
01:45:55,167 --> 01:45:57,738
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1641
01:46:00,234 --> 01:46:03,010
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1642
01:46:18,234 --> 01:46:23,115
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1643
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:27,976
I will in that same place
destroy your entire race

1644
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:32,646
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1645
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:35,478
But if you ever mess with me

1646
01:46:35,567 --> 01:46:38,173
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1647
01:46:40,634 --> 01:46:43,376
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1648
01:46:58,367 --> 01:47:03,441
In a skin or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1649
01:47:03,668 --> 01:47:08,617
I won't lead a life
full of fear and regret

1650
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:18,614
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1651
01:47:18,767 --> 01:47:23,614
I will break all shackles of rules
belonging to this world

1652
01:47:23,867 --> 01:47:28,441
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1653
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,978
But if you ever mess with me

1654
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,910
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1655
01:47:40,368 --> 01:47:43,281
Walt died on his way
to the hospital.

1656
01:47:43,768 --> 01:47:47,238
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1657
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:50,977
He revealed everylhing about Walt,

1658
01:47:51,067 --> 01:47:53,445
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1659
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:57,738
First, the girls made up
Minu's face.

1660
01:47:58,167 --> 01:47:59,441
And then God did.

1661
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:01,737
Minu later suffered
a paralysis attack.

1662
01:48:06,234 --> 01:48:09,044
Taneja survived
and is now in Tiharjail.

1663
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,970
His scarred face is an
amusement to most in the jail.

1664
01:48:18,234 --> 01:48:22,182
Today, we could bring back
the smile on Pyaari's face.

1665
01:48:22,467 --> 01:48:25,914
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1666
01:48:26,301 --> 01:48:29,305
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scat-free...

1667
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,806
must be stopped.

1668
01:48:31,167 --> 01:48:33,147
The Mardaani (Fighter)
that's hidden within...

1669
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,042
has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1670
01:48:36,501 --> 01:48:38,447
The war is still on.

1671
