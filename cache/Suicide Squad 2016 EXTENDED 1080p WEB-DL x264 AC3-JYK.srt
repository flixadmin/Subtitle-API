2
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,890
Chow time!

3
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,180
It's time!

4
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,650
Floyd, step up to
the door. Dinner time.

5
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,810
Only my friends call me Floyd.

6
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,200
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

7
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,000
What's that?

8
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,590
That is called loaf.

9
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,560
A loaf.

10
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,840
It's got a little bit
of pasghetti in there.

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,440
Toenails.

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,840
Rat shit.

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,560
Everything a growing
fella needs, like you.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,800
Come here. Can I tell you
something? Can I tell you a secret?

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,770
Yeah.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,450
One day...

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,280
Somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,070
And I'm gonna rain down
on you like the holy ghost.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,000
Man, you just threatened
a staff member.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,920
Yeah?

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,080
Yeah, you have.

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,560
Do something.

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,180
Let's have some fun.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,020
Whoop his ass!

25
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,760
Open the goddamn gate!

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,340
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,550
Sector C! Pull your heads out
of your ass! The boss is on deck!

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,770
Open it!

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,250
Bravo 14 open perimeter fence.

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,560
Stay back.

31
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,030
If she moves, fire
her up, all right?

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,900
You gonna come down
from there or what?

33
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,420
Yeah. Look at you.

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,330
You know the rules, hotness.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,740
You gotta keep off these bars.

36
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,770
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,250
Oh, my god.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,590
You are really in bad
shape upstairs, lady!

39
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,910
Gonna come in
here and tell me that?

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,880
Or are you too scared?

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,660
Come on, I'm bored.

42
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,110
I'm bored. Play with me.

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,660
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,070
No one's gonna play with you.

45
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,700
You sleep on the ground.

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,510
I sleep where I want, when
I want, with who I want.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,300
Oh, man. I love you.

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,350
Alpha one.

49
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,640
Hit her.

50
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,820
Come on, man. You're six
foot four. She's a tiny little girl.

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,330
You got a choice
tonight. What we got here?

52
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,230
We got chocolates,
strawberry or vanilla.

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,290
My job is to keep you alive until
you die. Do you understand that?

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,080
Spring break!

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,860
That is just a whole lot of
pretty in a whole lot of crazy.

56
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,740
The world changed when
Superman flew across the sky.

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,230
And then it changed
again when he didn't.

58
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,910
Remember.

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,870
And that is why I'm here.

60
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,520
Suicide squad.

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,070
Hello, Amanda.

62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,800
We lose a national hero...

63
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,390
But you sit there looking
like the cat that ate the canary.

64
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,730
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,680
It's taken some work.

66
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,730
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

67
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,350
There's rumors, Amanda that...

68
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,530
some of them have abilities.

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,540
The rumors are right.

70
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,200
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?

71
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,870
The human part.

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,180
We got lucky with Superman.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
He shared our values.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,650
The next Superman might not.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,080
You're playing
with fire, Amanda.

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm fighting fire with fire.

77
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,670
You are not gonna pitch us that Task
Force X project of yours again, are you?

78
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,150
Yes.

79
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,470
But this time,
you're gonna listen.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,140
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

81
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,580
Deadshot

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,800
Family â€” Daughter, ex-wife

83
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,670
He's the most wanted
hitman in the world.

84
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,870
Let's say he has
an elite clientele.

85
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,300
What?

86
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,800
Hey, Angelo.

87
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,250
This is the exterminator you
called for your rat problem.

88
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,760
My account's
looking a little thin.

89
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,760
No one gets paid until what
needs to get done gets done.

90
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,970
Nope. That's not the
rules. No money, no honey.

91
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,180
Whoa, here is
your boy right now.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,010
With about 20 of
his new best friends.

93
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm still seeing zeroes
over here, Angie.

94
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,300
Listen. Stop being
cute and do your job!

95
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh. They're taking
him outta the car now.

96
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,310
In about 30 seconds, your
window is gonna close forever.

97
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,490
Okay, okay, okay. Relax.

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,130
There was an accounting error.

99
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,780
We sent it.

100
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,640
Now double it for
being a dickhead.

101
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,960
You got 10 seconds.

102
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,920
We're not the kind of
people you play with.

103
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,790
Did you just... Did
you threaten me?

104
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,680
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

105
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,260
You son of a bitch.

106
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,770
Pleasure doing
business with you, Angie.

107
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,100
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

108
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,520
His is an 11-year-old
honor student in Gotham city.

109
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,710
His daughter.

110
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,190
So we watched her and waited.

111
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,560
You should talk to mama more.

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,220
Yeah, yeah, I know.

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,090
Mama stays in bed a lot.

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,310
Yeah. She's still
going out at night?

115
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,200
Dad, it's okay.

116
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,310
I can take care of her.

117
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,630
I know how to make pancakes now.

118
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,810
Hey babe, that's beautiful.

119
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,230
She's supposed to be
taking care of you, you know.

120
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,140
That's how that's
supposed to work.

121
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,140
I want you to come live with me.

122
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,210
All right? I came into some
resources. I'm gonna get us a spot.

123
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,540
It's gonna be nice, all right?

124
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,030
Mama says I can't live with
you because you kill people.

125
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,280
That's not true. That's
a lie. She's lying to you.

126
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,560
Daddy...

127
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,150
I know you do bad things.

128
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,390
Don't worry. I still love you.

129
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,070
Come on.

130
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,150
And you caught him?

131
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,270
Not me.

132
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,710
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham city.

133
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,630
I'mma figure this out.

134
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,300
All right?

135
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,440
It's over, Deadshot.

136
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,060
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

137
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,930
Daddy, please.

138
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,680
Zoe, move!

139
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,390
Please Daddy. Don't do it.

140
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,910
Please.

141
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,890
Don't do it.

142
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,090
All right.

143
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,990
I love you, Daddy.

144
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,170
So now we have the
man who never misses.

145
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,390
Where'd you put him?

146
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's just say. I put him in a
hole and threw away the hole.

147
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,140
Harley Quinn.

148
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,530
Accomplice to the
murder of Robin

149
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,610
ARKHAM

150
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,790
Before she ran off
and joined the circus...

151
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,390
she was known as
Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

152
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,400
A psychiatrist at Arkham asylum.

153
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,650
She was assigned
to the clown himself.

154
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,650
Dr. Quinzel.

155
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
You know, I live for
these moments with you.

156
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,860
What do you got?

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,150
I got you a kitty.

158
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,420
So thoughtful.

159
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,050
She thought she
was curing him...

160
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,740
but she was falling in love.

161
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,670
There is something you
could do for me, doctor.

162
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,690
Anything. I mean, yeah.

163
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,140
I need a machine gun.

164
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,250
A machine gun?

165
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,710
Talk about a workplace
romance gone wrong.

166
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,410
Get off me! Get...!

167
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,320
What do we have here?

168
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,780
I did everything you
said. I helped you.

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,220
You helped me by erasing my mind

170
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,610
what in memories I had!

171
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,550
Now,

172
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,540
you left me in a black
hole of rage and confusion.

173
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,310
Am I not the medicine
you practice, Dr. Quinzel?

174
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,490
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

175
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,980
What?

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,810
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

177
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,190
I'm just gonna hurt ya...

178
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,480
really, really bad.

179
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,060
You think so?

180
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,080
Well, I can take it.

181
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,110
I wouldn't want you to break
those perfect porcelain cap teeth

182
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,450
when the juice hits your brain.

183
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,530
La la. La la la.

184
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,100
They became the king
and queen of Gotham city.

185
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,430
And god help anyone who
disrespected the queen.

186
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,840
We finally meet.

187
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,720
He don't shake hands.

188
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,190
But sit down and have a drink.

189
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,250
Hey, J.

190
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,540
On behalf of everybody,
welcome back.

191
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,410
I wanted to come by and
personally say thank you.

192
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,510
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

193
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,800
Are you sweet talking me?

194
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,750
Ha. Ha. Ha.

195
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,020
I love this guy.

196
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,460
He's so intense!

197
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,180
You're lucky man.

198
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,490
You got a bad bitch.

199
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,870
Oh, that she is.

200
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,030
The fire in my loins.

201
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,390
The itch in my crotch.

202
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,410
The one, the only, the
infamous Harley Quinn!

203
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,410
Oh, come to Daddy.

204
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,990
- Puddin'!
- Oh yeah.

205
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,920
Listen..

206
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,000
You are my gift to this
handsome hunka hunka!

207
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,600
You belong to him now.

208
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,990
Well.

209
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,010
You're cute!

210
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,160
You want me?

211
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm all yours.

212
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,780
I don't want no beef.

213
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,080
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

214
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,720
- Why, what's wrong? You don't like me?
- You don't want no beef?

215
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,230
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

216
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,820
This is your lady.

217
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,880
Look...

218
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,860
Are you enjoying yourself?

219
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,260
No.

220
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,680
That's your lady, Joker.

221
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,920
- That's right.
- Yeah.

222
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,410
Yo, J.

223
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,120
And that was just the beginning.

224
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,840
Come on, puddin'. Do it!

225
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,650
Oh...

226
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,600
We have got company.

227
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,800
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

228
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,400
She's crazier than him.

229
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,600
And more fearless.

230
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,100
Stupid bat, you're
ruining date night!

231
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,770
Puddin'.

232
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,640
Puddin', I can't swim!

233
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,920
But the bat got her, too.

234
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,730
She's in the same
hole as Deadshot.

235
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,750
And then there's the Aussie.

236
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,380
Digger Harkness.

237
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,310
Or as the tabloids call
him. Captain Boomerang.

238
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,880
Captain Boomerang

239
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,060
Fetishes â€” <Font color="#ff80c0">Pink unicorns</font>

240
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,380
We're gonna be rich.

241
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah, you and me, mate.

242
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,320
Go and get the car.

243
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,290
He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.

244
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,940
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

245
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,560
Doesn't work well with others.

246
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,710
No honor among thieves, eh?

247
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,710
But he tangled with a
metahuman and lived to tell about it.

248
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,000
And have you heard of
the pyro kinetic homeboy?

249
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,350
How'd you catch him?

250
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,190
We didn't. He surrendered.

251
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,500
Chato Santana.

252
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,030
On the streets they
call him El Diablo.

253
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,980
This LA gangbanger thought
he was the king of the world...

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,530
until he lost his queen.

255
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,120
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

256
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,060
The security
video is incredible.

257
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,990
Oh, Jesus.

258
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,700
- What the hell is that?
- His name is Waylon Jones.

259
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,450
Evolution took a step
backwards with this one.

260
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,690
Yo, K.C! It's supper.

261
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,700
Go ahead, open that up, B.

262
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,210
Got something real
nice for you today, boy.

263
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,200
Hey boss, is it true he
chewed the dude's hand off?

264
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,620
Look at that, right
there, vulcanized rubber.

265
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,720
Give me that, Smitty.

266
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,840
Where you at?

267
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,830
Don't make me get you.

268
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,450
They call him Killer Croc.

269
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,090
There you are, are you hungry?

270
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,690
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.

271
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,000
What are you in
the mood for tonight?

272
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,130
I got a double cheese burger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.

273
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,500
Or a giant skinless goat?

274
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,370
He looked like a monster.

275
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,090
So they treated
him like a monster.

276
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,020
Then he became a monster.

277
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,000
He was chased out
of Gotham by the Bat.

278
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,800
Went searching for
sanctuary elsewhere.

279
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,770
He never found it.

280
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,500
I saved the best for last.

281
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,830
The Witch.

282
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,790
A witch?

283
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,430
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

284
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,060
A sorceress from another
dimension. Another world.

285
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,380
Archaeologist Dr. June Moone...

286
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,110
wondered into the wrong cave.

287
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,720
June...

288
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,840
She opened something
she shouldn't have...

289
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,810
releasing a metahuman more
powerful than any we've encountered.

290
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,150
The enchantress.

291
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,420
Enchantress aka Dr. June Moone

292
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,820
she inhabits
Dr. Moone's body now.

293
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,520
Where is this witch?

294
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,340
In my pocket.

295
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,750
Now tell him why she
won't turn you into a frog.

296
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,560
Some say the witch has
a secret buried heart...

297
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,150
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

298
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,230
So we searched the cave
where she turned up...

299
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,690
and we found her heart.

300
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,470
- That thing's her heart?
- Mmm.

301
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
She's vulnerable without it.

302
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,730
You want to put our national
security in the hands of...

303
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,040
witches, gangbangers,
and crocodiles?

304
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,590
Don't forget about
the Joker's girlfriend.

305
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,080
These are villains, Amanda.

306
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,180
What makes you think
you can control them?

307
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,050
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interests...

308
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,400
for the national security of the
United States is what I do for a living.

309
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,330
You take the finest special forces
officer this nation has ever produced...

310
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,240
Colonel Rick Flag.

311
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,930
Colonel Rick Flag.

312
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,660
Help me.

313
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,010
I assigned him to watch
Dr. Moone, and just as I hoped...

314
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,990
it got personal.

315
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,810
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

316
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,460
I have the witch's heart.

317
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,100
And Dr. Moone has his.

318
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,210
Now he'll follow my
orders as holy writ.

319
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,870
In a world of flying
men and monsters...

320
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,120
this is the only way
to protect our country.

321
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,400
The Pentagon â€” Washington DC

322
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:30,220
What if Superman had decided to fly down,
rip off the roof of the White House...

323
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,120
and grab the President of the United
States right out of the overall office?

324
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,230
Who would've stopped him?

325
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,800
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea...

326
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,520
Anthrax in our mail. We
got fluoride in our water.

327
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,580
But what happens if
the next Superman...

328
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,840
becomes a terrorist?

329
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,560
Amanda Waller
has a plan. Amanda.

330
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,530
I wanna build a team of some very
bad people who I think can do some good.

331
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

332
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,870
Not on my watch.

333
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,560
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

334
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,670
General, we run them covertly
non-attributed. Strictly need to know.

335
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,420
And if they get caught, we
throw them under the bus.

336
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,710
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.

337
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,980
Ours, or theirs.

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,400
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

339
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,470
You know we can't
control these people.

340
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,220
June, be strong.

341
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,750
Dr. Moone.

342
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,820
Enchantress.

343
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,860
Meet the enchantress.

344
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,860
Everything we know about
her, is in your briefing packs.

345
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,380
She's walked this
earth for a very long time

346
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,070
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

347
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,830
This meeting is-is
now a magic show?

348
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,580
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

349
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,610
Go get it, girl.

350
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,470
How about a little something from
the Weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

351
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,980
We've been chasing
these plans for years.

352
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,690
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

353
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,330
Thank you. We'd
like Dr. Moone back.

354
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,040
Enchantress.

355
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,760
Please. Please.

356
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm sorry. I can't-I
can't do that again.

357
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,690
Flag, get her out of here.

358
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,310
I move to...

359
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,490
authorize Amanda Waller to establish
Task Force X under the Argus program.

360
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,990
All right.

361
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,870
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

362
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,200
I know you do bad things.

363
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,410
Don't worry. I still love you.

364
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,630
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

365
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,820
How you doing, man?

366
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,930
Why don't you kiss her
ass? She's in charge.

367
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,130
Welcome, ma'am. How are you?

368
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,490
I'm here to assist
you in anyway.

369
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,280
Where are they?

370
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,930
Are you the devil?

371
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,770
Maybe.

372
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,520
Ain't you scared?

373
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,870
Why'd they put you down here?

374
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,570
I asked.

375
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,700
Open that gate.

376
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,440
Yo, ese.

377
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,510
Hola, amigo.

378
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,160
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

379
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,740
What's up? Hey, you
want some of this?

380
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,760
Come down here.

381
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,530
That ain't me.

382
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,660
That wasn't you?

383
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,540
Nah, they say it's
me, but that ain't me.

384
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,030
That guy's gone.

385
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,260
He's dead.

386
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,600
And yet, here you are.

387
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,400
Ma'am.

388
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,530
Let me try to talk to him.

389
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,860
You wanna die in here, buddy?

390
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,680
You got a real shot at
walking at the block again.

391
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,020
Have a nice cold
beer, a nice meal.

392
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,090
A women.

393
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,190
Look, man...

394
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,350
You ain't the first to ask, and
you ain't gonna be the last.

395
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,680
Ask what?

396
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,730
I'm a man, okay?

397
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,640
I ain't no weapon.

398
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,310
I'mmna die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

399
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,500
I've caused enough harm.

400
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,420
Bye.

401
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,730
All right, unlock him.

402
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,760
What?

403
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,840
You heard me.

404
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,150
You know what this man can do?

405
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,140
I'm here to find out.
Lose the restraints.

406
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,910
Thank you.

407
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,620
What? This uh...

408
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,410
cheerleading tryouts?

409
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,270
Let's go. Let's see
what you can do.

410
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,130
They say you
never missed a shot.

411
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,990
Prove it.

412
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,260
Now you got one in the chamber.

413
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,000
What cha' gonna do with it?

414
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,550
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey!

415
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,700
- Shit!
- Drop it.

416
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,100
Give me the word,
boss. I'll drop him.

417
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,830
Everybody calm down.

418
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,390
Griggs, tell your
men to stand down.

419
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,810
Tell them to put it down.

420
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,990
Stand down!

421
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,840
Colonel, for the record, this is
exactly what I was concerned about!

422
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,770
What's for dinner?

423
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,760
Ames, if this man shoots me...

424
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,530
I want you to kill him...

425
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,940
And I want you to go
clear my browser history.

426
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,110
See...

427
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,470
The firing pin is
filed down, right?

428
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,880
Mag full of dummy rounds.

429
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,040
If I pull the trigger,
nothing happens.

430
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,780
You're absolutely right.

431
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,710
Why would we give a loaded
weapon to an infamous hitman?

432
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,220
Go ahead, pull
the trigger. Empty it.

433
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,580
Don't empty nothing. You
don't even know this lady.

434
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,510
I've known you,
like, nine months.

435
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,420
Remember when I brought you
that cookie? That was a real cookie.

436
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,430
Aw, shit.

437
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,020
What?

438
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,500
Shit.

439
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,840
Oops.

440
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,210
Oh...

441
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,330
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

442
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,580
All right. Now you
know what you're buying.

443
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,410
Let me tell you
the price. First...

444
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,050
I want outta here.

445
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,270
Second, I want full
custody of my daughter.

446
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:30,990
All right?

447
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,390
And her mom can have
like... supervised visits.

448
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,280
But her stank ass
boyfriend can't come.

449
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,730
Darnell can't come.

450
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,600
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

451
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,460
Third, y'all gonna pay for my
daughter's whole education.

452
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,690
Best schools.

453
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,290
And then I want
her to go to college

454
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,210
like Harvard or Yale.

455
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,910
- Ivy league.
- Ivy league, yeah.

456
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,640
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mm-hm.

457
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,640
And if she can't cut it, and
her grades start slipping,

458
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,590
- I need you to white-people that thing.
- Mm-hm.

459
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,120
- You know how y'all do.
- Oh yeah.

460
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,130
You know, right? Okay.

461
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,480
Now that's my price.

462
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,240
But I'm concerned, 'cause I
don't see nobody writing shit down.

463
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,630
You're in no position
to make any demands.

464
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,210
Oh. I'm sorry.

465
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,130
You thought I
was talking to you.

466
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,310
No, errand boy.

467
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,940
I'm talking to your boss.

468
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,080
That's my price, sweetie.

469
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,990
You know what it is.

470
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,000
You notice these
are criminals? Mm.

471
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,490
They're psychotic antisocial
freaks. It makes no sense.

472
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,420
Let me hit the tier one
units and I'll build you

473
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,230
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

474
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,580
I mean, you need real
soldiers. Not these scumbags.

475
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,260
In World War 2, the US Navy
made a deal with the mafia

476
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,220
to protect it's ships
on the waterfront.

477
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,540
This ain't World War 2.

478
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,720
It's World War 3.

479
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,470
What are you really up to?

480
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,220
It's a "need to know", and, all you
need to know is you work for me.

481
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,990
That can change
with a phone call.

482
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,050
I have friends too, you know.

483
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,050
There you go. Call'em.

484
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,260
But without you minding
her, your lady friend stays here

485
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,580
strapped to a board in
a drug-induced coma.

486
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,070
They warned me about you.

487
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,900
My dumbass didn't
believe the stories.

488
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,210
Nobody does.

489
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,720
Where is she?

490
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,090
It's complex.
This is not just her.

491
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,020
Everybody's disappeared.

492
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,200
There's this new law, where if
you're a bad enough bad guy,

493
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,100
they stamp "terrorist"
on your jacket.

494
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,240
They send you to this
swamp in Louisiana.

495
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,890
A black site.

496
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,790
That's where she is.

497
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,760
So what do we do?

498
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,520
Bring the car around.

499
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,550
We're going for a drive.

500
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,820
Lester. Lester. Hit
me one more time!

501
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,560
And... Come on, man!

502
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,590
You gotta call upstairs and
tell them to float me another 10k.

503
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,010
- You got it?
- Hey.

504
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,150
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

505
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,000
Good job, man.

506
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,070
He's killing it.

507
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,270
Come on, man. Why am I here?

508
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,440
All right! Yeah! I'm
down. I get it, all right?

509
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,020
I've had a run of bad decks.

510
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,700
Not my fault.

511
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,860
All right?

512
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,720
Dude, this is real.

513
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,570
I had to stop these guys
from burning down your house

514
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,310
with your kids in it.

515
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,550
But, you're lucky.

516
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah, maybe. Why-why
do you think so?

517
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,900
Yo, slick. What's up?

518
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,610
Griggs. You are?

519
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,920
You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

520
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,170
Can I go, man? What
the hell's going on, man?

521
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,630
This is crazy.

522
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,960
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah,
blah-blah, blah-blah.

523
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,010
All of that chitchat
is gonna get you hurt.

524
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,660
Oh! My god.

525
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,530
I could tell you meant that.

526
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,230
Yeah.

527
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,220
You're gonna be my friend.

528
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,250
Enchantress.

529
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,950
Log time of death, 16:20

530
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,310
June?

531
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,500
- Let's get her down to the morgue.
- June?

532
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,180
June?

533
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,160
June.

534
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,810
June.

535
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,650
What did you do?

536
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,080
Shhh.

537
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,590
Okay.

538
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,070
Sister.

539
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,550
Brother.

540
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,420
Plus, it could be
the routing number.

541
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,020
Wanna go for drinks?

542
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
I got this.

543
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,470
Enchantress.

544
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,800
God damn it!

545
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,180
June... June!

546
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,670
June, I'm sorry.

547
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,050
June.

548
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,360
She... she went somewhere.

549
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,500
If you have to choose
between her or me...

550
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,180
Stop her.

551
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,750
Promise me you'll stop her.

552
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,400
Even if it kills me.

553
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,570
Sir?

554
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,230
Sir, you okay?

555
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,610
Can you breathe?

556
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,430
Did you take anything?

557
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,190
This is 21. Send
medical to my location.

558
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm a physician.

559
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,700
Roger. Bringing
medical to your location.

560
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,570
No pulse. Starting compressions.

561
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,010
Sir.

562
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,410
Midway City is under attack.

563
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,990
It's a non-human entity.

564
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,580
I think you know
what to do, sir.

565
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,190
Activate Task Force X
and get Amanda Waller

566
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,130
and her whole
circus on scene asap.

567
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,650
Yes, sir.

568
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,170
We're goin' live with
Task Force X. Pull 'em.

569
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,590
Prisoners, get down
on your knees. Now!

570
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,670
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

571
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,580
Hands up high!

572
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,140
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

573
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,970
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

574
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,060
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!

575
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,410
Damn it!

576
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,580
Open the gate!

577
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,380
Everybody, line
up for extraction.

578
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,760
Let's go! Let's move, move!

579
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,340
Yeah! Open the door! Let's go!

580
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,670
- Alright. Go! Go!
- Move it! Move it!

581
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,750
Hit him!

582
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,770
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

583
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,430
Where you at?

584
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,120
Whoa!

585
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,570
Is that the new guy?

586
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,330
What is that?

587
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,740
What is that?

588
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,380
- Who are you?
- Standby, arming device.

589
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,860
Who are you? I don't
know who you are.

590
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,930
- Device armed.
- Hey.

591
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,000
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

592
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,130
Injection successful.

593
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,280
Location verified.

594
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,580
Anybody who touches me is dead.

595
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,260
Anybody who tou... ahh!

596
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,320
Lady.

597
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,040
- Injection successful.
- Hey.

598
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,680
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

599
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,580
- Oh.
- Next!

600
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,730
Oh, you deaf. You
one of them deaf hoes.

601
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,370
- Oh.
- All right, all right. Come on.

602
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,250
Shut up, and get it done.

603
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,440
Weeee.

604
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,370
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

605
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,950
It's from Mr. J.

606
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,690
You gonna tell him
I took care of you?

607
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,870
You're so screwed.

608
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,800
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

609
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,000
Get off me! Get off me!

610
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,180
Harley, what do
you mean by that?

611
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,800
Harley!

612
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,830
Hey, I got a delivery. I have
a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss.

613
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,850
You're not on the access
list. I can't let you in. Sorry.

614
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,430
Hey, cool. Can I
leave it with you?

615
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,420
I'm way behind today.

616
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,080
Thank you. You're a good man.

617
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,810
Open up.

618
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,700
Just please, do
whatever they say.

619
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,080
Do whatever they
say. Just do it.

620
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,940
This look neat.

621
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,510
Light it up! Light
it up! Light it up!

622
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,120
He's right above us.

623
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,190
This is a mistake.
Rick, I can't do this.

624
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,710
- I can't...
- Listen. Listen.

625
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,610
There's no other way.

626
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,960
Just get it done.

627
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,490
Just get it done.

628
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,200
Enchantress.

629
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,800
Flag, talk to me. What'
going on down there?

630
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,320
Amanda, she bolted.

631
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,900
Say it again?

632
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,520
She bolted!

633
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,620
Shit!

634
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,110
Go!

635
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,980
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

636
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,270
I thought this was contained!

637
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,100
Pull everyone back
to the evacuation zone.

638
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,890
Guys, I need all three
of you, follow me please.

639
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,820
Anybody a universal donor?

640
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,910
Anybody with blood.

641
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,010
Bring those two over here.

642
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,750
Blunt trauma, right forehead!

643
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,710
This is the worst
day of my life.

644
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,920
All evacuees must report
to a FEMA representative.

645
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,150
What's going on in that city?

646
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,600
Those assholes here yet?

647
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,540
Yeah, they're here.

648
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,160
Alpha, bravo team, on me.

649
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,210
What the hell, Flag?

650
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,820
Unlock 'em.

651
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,240
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

652
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,820
How do you do?

653
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,040
Huh?

654
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,200
What was that?

655
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,620
I should kill everyone
and escape?

656
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,670
Sorry.

657
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,700
The voices.

658
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,230
I'm kidding. Jeez.

659
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,350
That's not what
they really said.

660
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,800
What do we got here?

661
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,980
12 pounds of shit
in a 10-pound sack.

662
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,040
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

663
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,000
Hey!

664
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,740
Hey, hey, hey...
What's going on, man?

665
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,050
Calm down.

666
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,310
Hey, one minute I'm playing
Mahjong with me Nanna...

667
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,620
then this red streak
hits me outta nowhere.

668
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,270
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

669
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,230
I was not.

670
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,590
Here comes slipknot...

671
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,690
The man who could
climb anything. Wonderful.

672
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,940
Have a good time, scumbag.

673
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,060
Straighten up.

674
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,280
She had a mouth.

675
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,350
Listen up!

676
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,040
In your necks...

677
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,330
Injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

678
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,030
It's the size of a rice grain but
it's powerful as a hand grenade.

679
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,670
You disobey me, you die.

680
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,450
You try to escape, you die.

681
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:29,540
You otherwise irritate or
vex me, and guess what?

682
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,740
You die.

683
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,920
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

684
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,770
Lady, shut up!

685
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,110
This is the deal.

686
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,980
You're going
somewhere very bad...

687
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,950
to do something
that'll get you killed.

688
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,090
But until that happens...

689
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,770
You're my problem.

690
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,230
So was that like a pep talk?

691
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,780
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

692
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,710
There's your shit.

693
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,270
Grab what you need for a
fight. We're wheels up in 10.

694
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,640
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

695
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,240
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

696
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,490
He's like the gold
standard, okay?

697
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,860
Triangle, bitch. Study

698
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,950
what?

699
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,810
Yo, get out of here.

700
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,830
Won't fit anymore?

701
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,490
Too much junk in the trunk?

702
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,780
Nah.

703
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,020
Every time I put this
on, somebody dies.

704
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,180
And?

705
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,780
I like putting it on.

706
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,380
Goody.

707
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,650
Something tells me a whole
lotta people are about to die.

708
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,950
Yeah, it's us.

709
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,600
We're being led to our deaths.

710
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,300
Speak for yourself, mate.

711
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,230
Hey, what's that crop on
your face? Does it wash off?

712
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,210
Hey, if you like a girl, can you
light her cigarette with your pinkie?

713
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,860
Because that
would be real classy.

714
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,530
Hey, y'all might wanna
leave old boy alone.

715
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,990
He could torch this whole joint.

716
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,300
Ain't that right, ese?

717
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,600
Ain't got nothing to
worry about from me.

718
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,310
I'm cool, homie.

719
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,170
Behold the voice of god.

720
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,230
For those of you who
don't know me officially...

721
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,610
My name is Amanda Waller.

722
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,280
There's an active terrorist
event in Midway City.

723
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,280
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1 and get them to safety.

724
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,190
I'm sorry.

725
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,000
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1?

726
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,890
The only person that
matters in the city,

727
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,460
the one person you can't kill.

728
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,690
Complete the mission, you
get time off your prison sentence.

729
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,670
Fail the mission, you die.

730
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,120
Anything happens
to colonel Flag,

731
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,700
I'll kill every
single one of you.

732
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,610
Remember, I'm watching.

733
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,590
I see everything.

734
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,770
There's your pep talk.

735
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,420
Compared to your
shit, she killed it.

736
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,000
So that's it?

737
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,280
What, we some kind
of suicide squad?

738
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,800
I'll notify your next of kin.

739
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,900
Alpha, bravo team. Mount up!

740
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,430
Your' late.

741
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,170
I was busy.

742
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,000
I beg you.

743
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,270
Please have mercy.

744
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,190
This is Katana.

745
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,600
She's got my back.

746
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,600
She can cut all of you in
half with one sword stroke...

747
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,060
Just like mowing the lawn.

748
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,590
I would advise not
getting killed by her.

749
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:48,200
Her sword traps the
souls of its victims.

750
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,390
Harley Quinn.

751
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,100
Nice to meet you.

752
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,350
Love your perfume.

753
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,080
What is that? The
stench of death?

754
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,150
Whoa. Easy, cowgirl.

755
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,770
Ain't that kind of
mission. Have a seat.

756
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,930
She seems nice.

757
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,910
I'm coming for you.

758
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,240
Shhh...

759
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,400
Hey.

760
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,450
Is he suppose to
be green like that?

761
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh. Party foul.

762
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,440
Not cool.

763
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,880
Ooo. Look at that pretty lights!

764
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,320
Are you guys seeing this?

765
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,270
What happened?

766
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,110
Terror attack.

767
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:05,360
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

768
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,530
You know, usual shit.

769
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,990
Right.

770
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,750
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

771
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,710
I don't know if they told
you... But I'm a hitman.

772
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,870
I'm not a fireman. I
don't save people.

773
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,910
Anything for a dollar, right?

774
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,860
You know the dark places,
too. Don't act like you don't.

775
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,030
I'm a soldier.

776
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,040
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

777
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,650
When the shooting
starts, and it will,

778
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,160
you'll cut and run.

779
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,320
6-1 is going down.

780
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,670
6-1 is going down hard.

781
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,540
Stand by. Drop the
ramp. Drop the ramp.

782
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,960
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

783
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,530
Go, go! Come on!

784
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,710
All right. All right.
All right. Relax.

785
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,320
What a ride!

786
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,450
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

787
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,420
Mind games.

788
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,110
- What's that?
- All this bomb in the neck crap.

789
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,830
That ain't real, mate

790
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,300
see, they're trying to trap
us with our own minds, right?

791
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,630
But you look around,
we're free, brah.

792
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,090
How do you know this?

793
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,680
Just trust me. I know,
all right? It's a con.

794
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,720
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

795
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,370
Question is, are you coming?

796
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:05,220
- Yeah.
- Smart.

797
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,780
Where're you going?

798
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,460
Hold your fire.

799
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,370
Sorry. It's what I do.

800
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,810
Nanite detonation control armed

801
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,360
Damn it.

802
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,590
Now that's killer app.

803
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:50,320
Okay. You wanna keep playing

804
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:53,580
the Hollywood squares version
of "I'll blow your freaking head off?"

805
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,350
Are you next?

806
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,320
You tripping, homie.

807
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,420
You next, Deadshot?

808
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,540
Did you just threatened me?

809
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,140
Oh, yeah.

810
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,030
He just threatened me.

811
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,940
Move.

812
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,880
You have a boyfriend?

813
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,760
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

814
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,490
Well, you better make it quick 'cause
he's gonna kill all of us one by one.

815
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,250
I'm gonna drop him, the sword
lady. 5 or 7 of these SEALs.

816
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,390
After that, I'm gonna
need some help, you down?

817
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,120
Always. What about
the shit in our necks?

818
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,920
Your friend's gonna help
us out with that, right?

819
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,780
You're my friend, too.

820
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,930
Stay evil, doll face.
Spread the word.

821
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,860
So, I'm thinking if we move
together we can kill all of these guys

822
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,290
and go our separate ways, yeah?

823
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,820
Sounds good.

824
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,530
Spread the word.

825
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,190
Psst, Hoy. Hoy.

826
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,710
We need your help, man.

827
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,390
When the time is right,

828
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,470
you hit Flag with a fireball,

829
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,240
he'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his final doom.

830
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,020
Then what?

831
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,780
Then we get out of here.

832
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,350
And do what?

833
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,460
What are you, a bloody socker?
Ease with all the questions.

834
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,910
Freedom, man.

835
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,880
Freedom, you
remember that, don't you?

836
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,120
We're criminals,
you know that, right?

837
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,830
Yeah, it's great.

838
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,590
Come on, do the bastard.

839
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,460
Hey, be careful.

840
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,190
- He eats people.
- Solemn mother superia, what?

841
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,400
He eats people for reals, homie.

842
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,840
He's a cannibal.

843
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,290
Ah.

844
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,660
No.

845
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,890
What did you say to him?

846
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,370
Nothing. Just having a laugh.

847
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,420
No worries.

848
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,130
I'm standing by for
follow on tasking.

849
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,930
C2, what is the
operational load of the PLS?

850
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,260
Boss, we got people up here.

851
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,150
I'm on my way.

852
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,750
Shit!

853
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,800
Amanda, we have
hostiles up ahead.

854
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,570
Flag, get out of there.

855
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,230
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

856
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,910
Copy that.

857
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,520
We're diverting.

858
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,150
Bump out second
squad two blocks east.

859
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,410
We'll pass through you,

860
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,940
continue north.

861
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,540
Take bravo two blocks east.

862
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,620
We'll leapfrog through
you once you're in position.

863
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,180
Copy that.

864
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,440
Hey.

865
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,040
I like these odds, mate.

866
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,360
You just say the word.

867
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,690
Yeah.

868
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,590
Come on.

869
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,120
Yeah. Uh.

870
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,930
Hold that thought.

871
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,020
Rick, why do
they look like that?

872
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,890
Stay cool.

873
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,290
What the hell are they?

874
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,920
You cut and run. I'll
blow your head off.

875
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,310
Damn it.

876
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:26,000
Hit 'em!

877
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,030
Huh.

878
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,190
Hey.

879
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,260
Get off me!

880
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,390
Get off me, you son of a...

881
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,870
Flag!

882
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,270
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

883
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,480
He dies, we die.

884
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,970
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

885
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,310
Backblast, clear!

886
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,510
Pinky.

887
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,360
That's how I cut and run.

888
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,530
Hey.

889
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,800
Hey, come on.

890
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,800
What? I saw it move.

891
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,760
See? It flinched. I think.

892
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,710
Hey. You were
some help, Princess.

893
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,730
It's better this way.

894
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,760
Trust me.

895
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,010
Oh, yeah. You're
the fire bloke. Eh?

896
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,510
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right, yeah. Hey.

897
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,280
Well, looky here.

898
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,990
It's fire!

899
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,580
The brief said terrorist.

900
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,250
- You want to start explaining this?
- If I told you, would you believe me?

901
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,320
- What are they?
- I don't know.

902
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,100
That's bullshit.

903
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,100
Thing is, he owned
a $3000 watch.

904
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,940
Is that a person?

905
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,890
It was.

906
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,640
Now it's not.

907
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,300
Hey, don't!

908
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,590
What?

909
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,910
We got a job to do.

910
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,790
We're moving.

911
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,240
Get your boys moving.

912
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,070
Let's go.

913
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,470
Waller, we are moving
on the objective.

914
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,720
We lost contact with
bravo, you got a visual?

915
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,890
Stand by. Anything
on the other squad?

916
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,010
No, ma'am.

917
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,680
Go-7, I need your sensors
in those coordinates.

918
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,950
Flag, it's a negative. They
were engaged when you were,

919
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,890
but we lost them.

920
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,720
Seriously?

921
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,290
What the hell is
wrong with you people?

922
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,650
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

923
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,630
Hey, Deadshot,
I've been thinking.

924
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,200
We don't come together, no
one walking out of here alive.

925
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,100
Mm. And?

926
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,250
These people respect
you, you got influence.

927
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,120
- What's your play right now?
- You're a man of your word, right?

928
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,740
I want my mission.

929
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,060
And you want your
life and your kid back.

930
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,880
You help me keep this
motley corporate in line,

931
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,060
I'll hook you up.

932
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,610
While there is
the puppet master,

933
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,210
- you ain't got shit to hook me up with.
- I got plenty of my own strings to pull.

934
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,060
You just get me to the
top of that target building

935
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:38,500
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo...

936
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:41,640
- And you're going to make sure I get paid?
- Yeah, you get paid.

937
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,930
You get paid and you
get your fresh start.

938
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,240
Take a knee.

939
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,230
Our body's at the
top of that building.

940
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,310
We get up there...

941
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,930
Pull them out of the
vault they're hiding in.

942
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:04,830
Helos extract us off the roof.

943
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:07,240
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

944
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,250
Flag, who's up there?

945
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,370
It's none of your concern.

946
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,820
- Do you know who's up there?
- Nope.

947
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:51,690
You...

948
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,870
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!

949
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,880
You, you, you are
a pain in the ass.

950
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:04,720
I have done everything your said,
every test, every trial, every initiation.

951
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,920
I have proved I love
you, just accept it.

952
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,710
Gada gada gada ga...

953
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:13,860
I am not someone
who is... loved.

954
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,660
I'm an idea,

955
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,680
state of mind.

956
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:25,070
I execute my will according
to my plan and you...

957
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:28,230
Doctor, are not
part of my plans.

958
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,480
Please let me in. I promise...

959
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,410
Let me in. I promise
I won't hurt you.

960
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,370
Promise? Promise?

961
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,750
Hey, dickface!

962
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:39,010
Mind screaming at your
bitch somewhere else.

963
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:42,670
I was going to say, "I
wouldn't do that if I were you."

964
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,110
Don't hurt me.

965
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,610
I'll be your friend.

966
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,300
Do it. Do, do, do, do, do it.

967
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:00,220
My heart scares you
and a gun doesn't?

968
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,770
DO IT!

969
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:11,550
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you're insane.

970
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:15,680
Go... away.

971
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,200
Harlet, you coming?

972
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,050
Why do you eat people?

973
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,370
Give me power.

974
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,100
Would you like to eat me?

975
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:48,960
- Hell, no.
- Aw, why not?

976
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,020
I don't want your crazy.

977
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,940
Says the guys who
lives in a sewer.

978
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,610
At least I know it's a sewer.

979
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,860
Oh, I get it.

980
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,220
Because it's like,
this is a sewer too.

981
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,190
Only with nice shops
and restaurants, right?

982
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,170
You hate mankind much?

983
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,540
Let me guess.

984
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:15,420
Mommy didn't take you to Chuck
E. Cheese on your 6th birthday.

985
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,830
I can recommend
a good therapist.

986
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,220
Why?

987
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,980
Because I'm bored.

988
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,010
I need a victim, a mind
to pry apart and spit in.

989
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:31,100
You just leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole, don't fall in.

990
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,880
And here's one now.

991
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:43,480
Japanese, female,
mid-twenties, 5 foot 5, good health,

992
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:46,880
athletic and...

993
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,830
an only child,

994
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:53,740
with deep-seated father issues.

995
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:59,110
Daddy wanted a son, so
she has to hide behind a mask.

996
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,970
I am not... hiding.

997
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,180
Yeah, that was gangster.

998
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,270
Harley, why don't you stop
acting like a drunken stripper.

999
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,510
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on then?

1000
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,040
Because...

1001
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,760
I smell a rat.

1002
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,030
If they don't blow
our heads off,

1003
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,810
we'll have to fight
our way out of this city.

1004
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,530
I need you to play nice
with the other children.

1005
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:33,450
And quietly return to my cage.

1006
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,270
Sure. Okay.

1007
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,920
Hey, that's okay.
Sellout, I get it.

1008
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:41,470
Like you. I know how
the world works, okay?

1009
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,050
And when it comes to the heart,

1010
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,250
everyone for themselves, right?

1011
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,420
Waller?

1012
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,920
We're about to enter the
building. Get that chopper ready.

1013
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,870
What you say we
get this over with?

1014
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,380
What the hell? Deadshot.

1015
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,900
Fall back.

1016
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,810
You mind if we tag along?

1017
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:43,840
Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

1018
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,920
Be a walk in the park.

1019
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,640
Easy peasy.

1020
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,020
Don't make me shoot you.

1021
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,070
God damn it. Harley!

1022
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,040
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

1023
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,340
I am close be ready...

1024
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:47,940
Hey, guys!

1025
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,110
Come on. Let's go.

1026
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,610
Ma'am.

1027
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:08,720
I got motion detectors
going off on the secure floors.

1028
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,920
Flag.

1029
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,590
- They're all around you.
- Hold.

1030
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:16,050
Use extreme caution.

1031
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,300
I don't like this, Flag.

1032
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,190
I don't like it either.

1033
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:27,700
Pussy.

1034
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,930
I will knock your ass out.

1035
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,340
I do not care
that you're a girl.

1036
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,100
They're after Flag again!

1037
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:26,690
Son of a bitch! Get off me!

1038
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,920
Circle up! Circle around him!

1039
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,570
Let me fight!

1040
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,790
You die, we die.

1041
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,840
Clear! Everyone move out.

1042
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,320
- Where've you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

1043
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,880
You know what? You
don't stand for shit.

1044
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,420
You ain't about shit!

1045
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,400
Don't touch me, man!

1046
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,450
- Don't touch you?
- Don't touch me!

1047
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,800
What you gonna do? I'm
touching you! I'm touching you!

1048
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,900
- Do something.
- Don't touch me!

1049
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:10,650
Do something!

1050
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,040
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah, I wanna see...

1051
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,430
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something!

1052
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,830
I was just trying
to get you there.

1053
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,990
Phil Jackson, we good, right?

1054
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:48,070
I knew you'd come through.

1055
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:50,480
That's shit crazy.

1056
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,580
Clear.

1057
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,080
I gotta work on my cardio.

1058
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,000
Question.

1059
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,170
Would you die for me?

1060
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,110
Yes.

1061
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,220
That's too easy.

1062
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,600
Would you...

1063
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,310
Would you live for me?

1064
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,770
Hm?

1065
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,330
Yes.

1066
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,490
Careful.

1067
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:56,960
Do not say this
oath thoughtlessly.

1068
01:15:58,230 --> 01:15:59,510
Desire becomes surrender.

1069
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,180
Surrender becomes power.

1070
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,150
You want this?

1071
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,020
I do.

1072
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,480
Say it.

1073
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,450
Say it. Say it.

1074
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:16,150
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty...

1075
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,650
Please.

1076
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,720
God, you're so...

1077
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,400
Good.

1078
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,130
Oh, relax.

1079
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,700
It's just me.

1080
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,530
You ever been in love?

1081
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,960
Nah, never.

1082
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,370
Bullshit.

1083
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:46,420
You don't kill as many people as
I've killed and still sleep like a kitten

1084
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:48,790
if you feel shit like love.

1085
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,250
Another textbook sociopath.

1086
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,940
Clear.

1087
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,460
Clear.

1088
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,510
- Nice.
- Clear the roof.

1089
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:04,530
Sweep for shooters so we
can bring in our aviation assets.

1090
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,120
Go to the roof.

1091
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,420
Just oh...

1092
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,500
Wait here.

1093
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,530
Please.

1094
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,220
I don't wanna gave this
dude a heart attack, okay?

1095
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,240
Aww. He's embarrassed of us.

1096
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,860
Hey, Flag.

1097
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:25,900
This dude better cure
cancer after all of this shit.

1098
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,970
You ready? Let's go.

1099
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,320
You wouldn't have
made it without them.

1100
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,360
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

1101
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,400
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

1102
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,970
Yeah, I told you to
get on the damn truck.

1103
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:45,770
Why did you stay?

1104
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,930
I was studying your girlfriend.

1105
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,560
She takes an average person...

1106
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,860
A yoga mom, an elderly retiree
and she turns them into a soldier

1107
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,390
who can take a
headshot and still fight.

1108
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,530
It's an instant army.

1109
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,880
How'd she do it, Flag?

1110
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:03,470
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

1111
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,610
I'll accept the consequences

1112
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,300
I am your consequence.

1113
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,670
You might need to be careful.

1114
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,120
They think we're
rescuing Nelson Mandela.

1115
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,670
I can take care of myself.

1116
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,560
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers.
- Yes, ma'am.

1117
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,090
Copy that.

1118
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,290
Hey man, I know
you can't hear me

1119
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,280
'cause you're trapped in your
temple of soldierly self-righteousness.

1120
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,660
But a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

1121
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,770
Oh, says the guy who
shoots people for money.

1122
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,180
My cards is on the table, man.

1123
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:35,390
It got done, didn't it?

1124
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,640
Damn. That is just...

1125
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:45,780
a mean lady.

1126
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,410
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

1127
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,140
And I'm the bad guy?

1128
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,080
That's gangsta.

1129
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,920
What?

1130
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,990
They weren't cleared
for any of this, any of it.

1131
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,260
I'm not judging. I've
buried a lot of mistakes too.

1132
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,490
No way.

1133
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,580
Let's go home.

1134
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,460
Yeah, let's go home.

1135
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,290
That sounds good. You
guys wanna go home?

1136
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,940
Or you wanna go back to prison?

1137
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,950
I'm not going back to prison.

1138
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,210
What I'm saying is...

1139
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:41,190
We kill the pair of 'em
now before they kill us.

1140
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,720
I got this.

1141
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:48,240
You all made it this far.

1142
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:52,730
Don't get high-spirited on
me and ruin a good thing.

1143
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,510
I like her.

1144
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,570
Savior 1-0, this
is ground element.

1145
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:22,210
Savior 1-0, how copy?

1146
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,980
Savior 1-0, the LZ's clear.

1147
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,930
Boss, they're not talking to me.

1148
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:37,100
Our bird's been jacked.

1149
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:39,540
Light it up!

1150
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,300
What? I got a
hickey or something?

1151
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,980
Professor, could
you pick up the pace?

1152
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,380
Disarmed.

1153
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,140
Now!

1154
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,950
Harley!

1155
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,500
Hello, baby.

1156
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,930
Kill her!

1157
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,600
Fail - safe mode.

1158
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:35,260
Her nanite's disarmed!

1159
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,680
Come on, baby.

1160
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,320
Deadshot...

1161
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,890
Shoot that woman, right now!

1162
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,850
She ain't do shit to me.

1163
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,820
You're a hitman, right?

1164
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,400
I got a contract.

1165
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,130
Kill Harley Quinn.

1166
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:07,950
Do it your freedom and your kid.

1167
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,180
Now she dead.

1168
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,350
I missed.

1169
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,410
Good one, mate.

1170
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,120
It's Waller.

1171
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,960
Savior 1-0's been
hijacked. Shoot it down.

1172
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:06,430
Roger that, ma'am. Going hot.

1173
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:15,430
Puddin'!

1174
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:22,140
You got all dressed up for me?

1175
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,690
Oh, you know I'd
do anything for you.

1176
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,810
By the way...

1177
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,350
I've got some grape soda on
ice, and a bear skin rug waiting.

1178
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,690
Yeah?

1179
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,910
Boss, we got a problem!

1180
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:41,330
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1181
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,200
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

1182
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,920
Let's do it.

1183
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,470
Target destroyed, ma'am.

1184
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:17,210
Thank you. Now
get me off this roof.

1185
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,580
Yes, ma'am. We're inbound.

1186
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,330
The Joker and Harley
Quinn are no more.

1187
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,680
You couldn't save her.

1188
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,870
Roger, I see you.

1189
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:42,350
Watch your step, ma'am.

1190
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,800
Standby, I'll send another helo!

1191
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,190
Waller's down.

1192
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,110
It's over.

1193
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:55,000
Ops just confirmed.
She's down, 1k west.

1194
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,230
Let's go get her.

1195
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,160
The mission's not over.

1196
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:09,520
Nah, it is for me.
We had a deal.

1197
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,810
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1198
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:00,400
Hey, guys. I'm back!

1199
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,810
I missed you all so much.

1200
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,100
We're glad you could make it.

1201
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,550
Hey, craziness.

1202
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:13,550
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1203
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:17,480
Now tell me how to
destroy your armies.

1204
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,090
Do your worst, bitch!

1205
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,870
So, let me guess.

1206
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:53,880
We're going to the swirling
ring of trash in the sky.

1207
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,990
You know, 'cause
why wouldn't we?

1208
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,170
When does this end, Flag?

1209
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,760
Load up. We're in for a fight.

1210
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:20,730
Top secret.

1211
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:30,630
You tell everybody, everything.

1212
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:33,100
Or me and you are
gonna go right now.

1213
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:40,570
3 days ago,

1214
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:44,110
a non-human entity
appeared in the subway station.

1215
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,590
Waller, we're almost there.

1216
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:50,730
So Waller sent me and a
woman with incredible abilities.

1217
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,110
Enchantress

1218
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,980
a witch.

1219
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:58,130
See, nobody could
get near this thing, but...

1220
01:30:58,150 --> 01:30:59,950
the witch could.

1221
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,660
Bomb's ready.

1222
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,280
Set for two seconds.

1223
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:06,540
You just press the
button and drop it.

1224
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:12,780
Needless to say the
whole thing was a bad idea.

1225
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,340
She bolted!

1226
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,020
Shit!

1227
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,260
And that's how she
escaped from Waller.

1228
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,750
So now you know.

1229
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:34,790
You can just kill
me right now but...

1230
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,820
I'm going to have a drink.

1231
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,970
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

1232
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:41,970
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1233
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,440
What's you having, KC?

1234
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,460
Bloody Mary, right?

1235
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:23,710
Rick goes to mind.

1236
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:26,390
KC, it's the end of the world.

1237
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:28,450
Have a drink with us.

1238
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:30,390
Beer.

1239
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:33,170
There he is. Give the man a "B".

1240
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,810
How about you, hot stuff?

1241
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,440
Water.

1242
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,370
That's a good idea, honey.

1243
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,890
Ninja, you want some sake?

1244
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,990
Whisky.

1245
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,730
What am I, twelve?

1246
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:06,640
Here's to honor among thieves

1247
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,570
I'm not a thief.

1248
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:13,000
Oh. She's not a thief.

1249
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,900
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.

1250
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,620
Well, we almost pulled it off.

1251
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:29,430
Despite what everybody thought.

1252
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:33,260
We weren't picked to
succeed, you know that, right?

1253
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,330
We were all chosen to fail.

1254
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:36,640
Yeah, I know that.

1255
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:40,480
Worst part of it is, they're gonna
blame us for the whole thing.

1256
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,190
And they can't have
people knowing the truth.

1257
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:44,900
We're the patsies.

1258
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,490
The cover-up.

1259
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,940
Don't forget,
we're the bad guys.

1260
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,700
So, you're going to tell us now
what your big deal with Flag was.

1261
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:02,310
Same thing Waller
offered me, to kill you.

1262
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,720
Chance to be a father.

1263
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:08,330
Chance to have a life
outside the shadows.

1264
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,480
I trusted Flag.

1265
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,600
Flag had you chasing a
carrot on a stick, homie,

1266
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,450
you don't know that?

1267
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:16,940
I love this guy.

1268
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:18,620
You played yourself, dog.

1269
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,840
Bitch, I'm having a drink.

1270
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:23,990
I'm... breathing fresh air.

1271
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:28,340
For 2 sweet seconds...

1272
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,010
I had hope.

1273
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,660
You had hope, huh?

1274
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:37,190
Hope don't stop the wheel
from turning, my brother.

1275
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,440
You preaching?

1276
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,820
It's coming back around for you.

1277
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,720
How many people you killed, man?

1278
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:46,720
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1279
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:49,370
You ain't ever whacked
down no women.

1280
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,380
No kids.

1281
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:54,900
I don't kill women or children.

1282
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,690
I do.

1283
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:01,630
See, I was born
with the devil's gift.

1284
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,920
I kept it hidden
most of my life, but...

1285
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:08,470
the older I got,
the stronger I got.

1286
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:10,820
So I started using it.

1287
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:13,400
For business, you know,

1288
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:15,520
the more power
on the street I got,

1289
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,760
the more firepower I got.

1290
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:18,060
Like that shit
went hand in hand.

1291
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,480
You know, one was
feeding the other.

1292
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:24,100
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1293
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,730
Except my old lady.

1294
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,660
You know, she
used to pray for me.

1295
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:33,260
You're welcome.

1296
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:37,220
Even when I didn't want it.

1297
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,310
Six die in arson fire.

1298
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,160
God didn't give me this.

1299
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,880
Why should he take it away?

1300
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,360
Hey.

1301
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,530
This is our home.

1302
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,050
You put that back
where you found it.

1303
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,820
I'm taking my kids to mom's.

1304
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:02,830
You ain't taking
my kids nowhere!

1305
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:04,840
See, when I get
mad, I lose control.

1306
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:06,590
You know, I just...

1307
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,440
I don't know what I do...

1308
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,250
Till it's done.

1309
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,490
And the kids?

1310
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,490
He killed them.

1311
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,490
Didn't you?

1312
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,530
Own that shit.

1313
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,250
Own it!

1314
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,750
What'd you think was
gonna happen, huh?

1315
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,570
Hey, Harley. Come on.

1316
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:01,520
What you were just...

1317
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,110
thinking you can
have a happy family...

1318
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:06,210
and coach little leagues
and make car payments?

1319
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:10,590
Normal is a setting on the dryer.
People like us, we don't get normal!

1320
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,080
Why is it always a knife fightâ€¦

1321
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:16,230
every single time
you open your mouth?

1322
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,230
You know, outside
you're amazing.

1323
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:25,360
But inside, you're ugly.

1324
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,320
We all are.

1325
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,580
We all are!

1326
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,640
Except for him.

1327
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,470
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1328
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:36,860
Not me, shorty.

1329
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:42,910
I'm beautiful.

1330
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,180
Yeah, you are.

1331
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:57,590
We don't want you here.

1332
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:08,120
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1333
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:10,930
Yeah.

1334
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:15,180
I never been with a witch
before. What's that like?

1335
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:21,420
Apparently that's why the
creatures chase him all the time.

1336
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,310
'Cause the witch
is scared of him.

1337
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:26,860
The only woman I
ever cared about...

1338
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,190
is trapped inside that monster.

1339
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:34,340
If I don't stop the witch,
it's over. Everything is over.

1340
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,120
Everything.

1341
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:40,620
You're free to go.

1342
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:57,330
Your daughter
writes you everyday.

1343
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,800
Every single day.

1344
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:20,250
You had these the whole time?

1345
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,030
You had letters from my
daughter the whole time?

1346
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,050
I'm gonna get you there.

1347
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,520
And you're gonna end this.

1348
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:36,320
I'm gonna carry
your ass if I have to.

1349
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,810
'Cause this shit is gonna
be like a chapter in the Bible.

1350
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:43,500
Everybody's gonna
know what we did.

1351
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,170
And my daughter is gonna
know that her Daddyâ€¦

1352
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,630
is not a piece of shit.

1353
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:00,000
I'll come.

1354
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:05,310
What?

1355
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:07,290
You got something better to do?

1356
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:08,780
Come on!

1357
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,120
Pussies.

1358
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:49,470
We think that thing's a weapon.

1359
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,770
Here, lower.

1360
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:01,030
We gotta take out the big one.

1361
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,330
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1362
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,390
There's a flooded tunnel...

1363
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:11,360
Leads right
underneath that building.

1364
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:16,010
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

1365
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:18,980
We get in it's face and distract
the hell out of that son of a bitch

1366
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,120
so the swimmers
can blow the bomb.

1367
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,080
That's how we take it out.

1368
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,970
I'm going with you.

1369
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:39,720
We got this.

1370
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,690
I'm not asking, bro.

1371
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,810
I live underground.

1372
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:51,000
Y'all are just tourists.

1373
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,990
The man who killed her
husband used that sword.

1374
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:22,170
His soul's trapped inside of it.

1375
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:24,150
She talks to him.

1376
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:26,180
Hey. Well...

1377
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,900
You know what they
say about the crazy ones.

1378
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,640
Huh?

1379
01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:40,370
Let's do this.

1380
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,020
You must really love this girl.

1381
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:27,410
And I thought love was
bullshit, getting serious.

1382
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:31,150
Desire, mutual benefit whatever.

1383
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:34,550
I mean, I get that,
but... actual love?

1384
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:37,320
I mean, I rated that with UFOs.

1385
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:40,700
A lot of believers, no proof.

1386
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,640
And then I met June.

1387
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:49,090
Do what you got to do.

1388
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,380
I got your back.

1389
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,920
You gonna fight with us?

1390
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,260
What if I lose control?

1391
01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:09,800
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1392
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,870
Duck in.

1393
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:39,820
Hey, everyone can see all
this trippy magic stuff right?

1394
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,410
Yeah, why?

1395
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,740
I'm off my meds.

1396
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:47,100
That's your old lady, huh?

1397
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,040
Yeah.

1398
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,380
Well, you need to
handle this shit, all right?

1399
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:52,640
Get up there, smack on her ass,

1400
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,280
tell her knock this shit off.

1401
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:56,490
I do not think that'd be wise.

1402
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,700
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1403
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:01,830
My boys will detonate
the bomb underneath him.

1404
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:08,760
You know, we should
get a drink sometime.

1405
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,950
I've been waiting
for you all night.

1406
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,330
Step out of the shadows.

1407
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:18,060
I won't bite.

1408
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,460
What the hell? Grab her.

1409
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:27,270
Why are you here?

1410
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:30,120
Because the soldier led you?

1411
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:32,050
And all for Waller?

1412
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,170
Why do you serve
those who cage you?

1413
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:37,540
I am your ally.

1414
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:40,270
And I know what you want.

1415
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:44,120
Exactly what you want.

1416
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,640
Normal

1417
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,980
normal.

1418
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:26,160
Baby.

1419
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,850
Baby. It's just a nightmare.

1420
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,520
It's just a bad dream.

1421
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,350
I'm here.

1422
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,210
Miss me?

1423
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:58,280
I'll put the kids to sleep and
then... maybe we can kick it?

1424
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:01,100
Yeah?

1425
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:06,190
I can't change what I
did. And neither can you!

1426
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:08,830
He married me.

1427
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,690
It's not real.

1428
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:13,250
I killed the bat.

1429
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,240
No, homie, you don't want that.

1430
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,010
What? I want that.

1431
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,840
She's trying to play games
with you, man. It's not real!

1432
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:21,480
He's right.

1433
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:23,470
It's not real.

1434
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,600
How long have you
been able to see?

1435
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:30,440
My whole life.

1436
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:33,080
You can't have them.

1437
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,790
These are my people right here.

1438
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,770
But it is our time.

1439
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:39,560
The sun is setting
and the magic rises.

1440
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:42,650
The metahumans
are a sign of change.

1441
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:44,150
Lady...

1442
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:46,970
You are evil!

1443
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:53,170
Oh, wow!

1444
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:57,600
Uh-oh.

1445
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:59,230
Who is this?

1446
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,350
It's gonna be bad!

1447
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:02,110
We should run.

1448
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:15,970
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1449
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:27,010
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1450
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:29,640
I'll do it! I'll get him there!

1451
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,820
I lost one family. I ain't
gonna lose another one.

1452
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:46,350
Look, think it through.

1453
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:47,820
I got this.

1454
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,190
Let me show you
what I really am.

1455
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,150
Over here!

1456
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:36,640
Go!

1457
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:52,300
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1458
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:54,920
Diablo, drive him
into the corner!

1459
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,480
- Get him mate.
- Come on.

1460
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:13,970
Yeah, do it!

1461
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:25,880
Diablo, get clear!
Get out of there!

1462
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:27,670
Blow it!

1463
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,880
Blow it.

1464
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:35,790
Now GQ, now.

1465
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:37,250
No!

1466
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:40,600
Everybody down!

1467
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,100
You next.

1468
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:23,260
My spell is complete.

1469
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:27,280
Once you and armies are gone, my
darkness will spread across this world.

1470
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:31,420
And it will be mine to rule.

1471
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:48,650
That was our main
satellite uplink.

1472
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:54,880
How did this witch even
know how to target this thing?

1473
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:57,240
It's a secret facility.

1474
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,660
You got a move here, Flag?

1475
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:06,310
We gotta cut her heart out!

1476
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:34,700
Where is she?

1477
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,230
I can't see her!

1478
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:38,760
While we're fighting,
that thing is laying waste

1479
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:41,060
to the whole damn world.

1480
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:49,620
Where is she?

1481
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:51,500
I don't know.

1482
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:57,800
Hey. Oh shit.

1483
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:04,620
Look out, look out!

1484
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:28,650
Uh-oh.

1485
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,280
Sorry.

1486
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:36,910
Flag!

1487
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,940
Enough!

1488
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:18,290
Of all who have faced me...

1489
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,210
You have earned mercy.

1490
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,890
For the last time...

1491
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:25,840
Join me...

1492
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:28,210
or die.

1493
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:32,600
I'm not much of a joiner but...

1494
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:35,480
maybe we should.

1495
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:37,060
Hey.

1496
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:38,980
She's trying to
take over the world.

1497
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:40,600
So?

1498
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,830
What's the world ever
done for us anyway?

1499
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,790
It hates us.

1500
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:47,200
Hey. Harley.

1501
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:51,650
Hey, lady?

1502
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:56,740
I lost my puddin'.

1503
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:00,380
But you can get him back, right?

1504
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,940
I can, my dear.

1505
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,740
Anything you want.

1506
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:09,870
You promise?

1507
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:12,410
Yes, child.

1508
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:16,030
You need only bow...

1509
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:20,290
and serve beneath my feet.

1510
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:27,660
I like what you're
selling, lady.

1511
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:32,110
There's only one teeny problem.

1512
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,140
You messed with my friends.

1513
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:43,050
Her heart's out!
We can end this.

1514
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:48,240
Hey, Croc!

1515
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,290
Harley!

1516
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:40,140
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

1517
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,160
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1518
01:56:45,610 --> 01:56:47,900
Daddy, I love you.

1519
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:50,690
Please, don't do this.

1520
01:57:45,110 --> 01:57:46,350
That was a great shot, man.

1521
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:48,780
Hey, I don't do hugs.
I'm not a hugger.

1522
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,830
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1523
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:01,150
Let me join my brother.

1524
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,300
Katana, no!

1525
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:09,920
Give me that.

1526
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,960
You bring June back.

1527
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:14,020
You bring her back.

1528
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,530
She's not coming back.

1529
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:17,560
I'll crush this.

1530
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:18,820
Do you hear me?

1531
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,830
You bring June
back or I'll crush this!

1532
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:23,120
Go ahead.

1533
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:26,480
You don't have the balls.

1534
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:20,000
Hey, Flag.

1535
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,580
June.

1536
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:41,240
She's gone.

1537
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:42,940
I thought I killed you.

1538
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:45,100
I thought I killed you.

1539
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,020
Y'all don't mind. I got me
a sewer to crawl back into.

1540
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,630
Yeah, and I got some business
to handle back in Gotham.

1541
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:55,580
I'm going to hotwire
a car, need a ride?

1542
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:56,820
Your ass is not driving.

1543
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:58,190
Why not?

1544
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:03,020
How are you not dead?

1545
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:05,700
We-we just saved the world.

1546
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:08,090
A "thank you" would be nice.

1547
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:10,080
Thank you.

1548
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:11,450
You're welcome.

1549
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:13,540
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1550
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:16,410
10 years off your
prison sentences.

1551
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:22,910
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1552
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,700
That can be arranged.

1553
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:29,510
An other requests?

1554
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:31,600
An Espresso machine.

1555
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:33,650
BET.

1556
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:36,820
10 years off a
triple life sentence?

1557
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:38,630
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

1558
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,820
or we're going to start
having some real fun.

1559
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:43,610
Why don't have some fun?

1560
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:56,050
You're trying to
figure out this length.

1561
02:00:56,070 --> 02:00:57,390
That's the hypotenuse.

1562
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,230
So you have to know this angle.

1563
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:02,300
Okay. So, if you're up here...

1564
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:03,780
- like in a building.
- Mm.

1565
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:07,040
And you shoot a man
down here on the street...

1566
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:09,790
That's how far the
bullet actually goes?

1567
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:12,150
Yeah. That's-that's right!

1568
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:13,860
You are so smart. Right.

1569
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:16,480
The hypotenuse, good one.

1570
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,340
So that would make you
have to know the angle

1571
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:21,770
between the building
and the sidewalk.

1572
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,240
You got to know that angle.

1573
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,710
You know, I mean, in real life

1574
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:26,270
you got-you got variables.

1575
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:27,690
You know, you got rifling twist.

1576
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:30,990
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1577
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:35,180
Some shots you'll even have to take
the curvature of the earth in with the...

1578
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:36,980
It's time.

1579
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:39,600
...wind effect.

1580
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:43,380
You know, there's a
lot... a lot of variables...

1581
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:45,420
in the street.

1582
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:50,710
I gotta go.

1583
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:53,350
Are you coming back?

1584
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:55,160
Yeah.

1585
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:57,810
I'm working it out. All right?

1586
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:02,910
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go without...

1587
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,780
without killing them all.

1588
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:06,410
Bring it in.

1589
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:11,150
I love you, Daddy.

1590
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:14,980
I love you.

1591
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:43,030
Hey! Let me out!

1592
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:44,980
Let me out of here right now!

1593
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:48,770
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1594
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:52,200
Let me out of here, darling, please.
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1595
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:55,770
Listen to me. Have you got a
car? Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1596
02:02:55,790 --> 02:02:57,570
Come on!

1597
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:45,250
Joker.

1598
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:53,800
Puddin'!

1599
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,280
Let's go home.

1600
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:12,730
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

1601
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:24,670
This is crown jewels
here, Mr. Wayne.

1602
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:27,700
And you do understand
my legal exposure.

1603
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:29,880
If anyone knew what
I've procured for you...

1604
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:34,580
Listen, I can keep a secret,
okay? What do you want?

1605
02:06:34,610 --> 02:06:37,310
People are asking
questions about Midway City.

1606
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:39,030
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1607
02:06:39,050 --> 02:06:42,590
And if they can get those
answers, my head will be on a pike.

1608
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:47,080
Consider yourself under
my protection, if you deliver.

1609
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:58,640
Moone, June

1610
02:06:58,670 --> 02:07:00,540
Allen, Barry.

1611
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:01,680
Curry, Arthur.

1612
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:04,840
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1613
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:08,650
I just like to make friends.

1614
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:11,220
That's the difference
between us.

1615
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:12,130
You believe in friendship.

1616
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:14,270
I believe in leverage.

1617
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:15,750
Goodnight.

1618
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:17,550
You look tired.

1619
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:20,540
You should stop working nights.

1620
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:23,350
You should shut it down,

1621
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:25,880
or my friends and
I will do it for you.
