How much longer must our citizens
suffer their incompetence?

169
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,022
This coming from a man
who takes money from criminals

170
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,401
in exchange for a license allowing them
to victimize innocent people.

171
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,697
And it is working.

172
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:23,989
Jim, why can't you see that I am not
here to destroy your beloved GCPD,

173
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,535
but to save it?

174
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,371
And through that, Gotham.

175
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,373
Your licenses are illegal,

176
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,001
and I will arrest anyone I find
who is issued one.

177
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,092
So sure your Boy Scout morality
can protect this city, Jim?

178
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,641
How well has that worked in the past?

179
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,846
Should I list the victims of
your antiquated righteousness?

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,852
Instead, let me make you a deal.

181
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,815
Find this Jonathan Crane
and lock him up within 24 hours

182
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,821
or admit to me, your subordinates,

183
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,399
and the people of Gotham

184
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,199
that you failed.

185
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,366
And allow me to clean this city up!

186
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,088
Good for you, Jim.

187
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,665
- Game on.

188
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,802
What are you doing here?

189
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,515
Have I taught you nothing?

190
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,768
I could've slit your throat
before you even saw me.

191
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,232
I found this on the door this morning.

192
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,655
Someone left this inside last night.

193
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,513
Thank you for coming, ladies.

194
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,897
No way.

195
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,977
I saw you die.

196
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,313
That so?

197
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,106
It is Gotham.

198
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,868
- Check for a pulse next time.
- I will.

199
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,320
Right after I slit your throat.

200
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,911
So what happened to you?

201
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,992
Long story.

202
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,213
Right now, all you need to know
is that I'm back.

203
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,333
And like the card says,

204
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,053
an opportunity awaits you.

205
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,638
A new beginning.

206
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,598
You sure you wanna get this close?

207
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,175
Please hear me out.

208
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,812
Not a day goes by
where I don't think about what I did.

209
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,941
If I could take it back,
trust me, I would.

210
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,653
I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.

211
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,572
Perhaps I'll finish the job this time.

212
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,734
I was jealous.

213
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,154
I was stupid.

214
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,156
I am sorry.

215
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,961
Kill me if you don't believe me.

216
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,755
So is this your place now?

217
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,761
This is our place.

218
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,384
Another club?

219
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,802
In Gotham?

220
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,637
How original.

221
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,102
It's not a club.

222
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,132

223
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,887
Like it or not,
every criminal in this city

224
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,933
is gonna go to him for a license
to mug, steal, or blow stuff up.

225
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,139
Those criminals are gonna need supplies,
and that is where we come in.

226
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,442
Not only will we be able to facilitate
these lowlifes,

227
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,316
but we'll also find out
what they're planning

228
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,692
and how it's going down.

229
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,240
But I will not go forward
without you both.

230
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,497
This is our way back on top.

231
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,242
No.

232

233
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,749
I will never be able to get back.

to the ground.

to stop you, Master Bruce.

And why not?

Because, as last night proved,
you are simply not ready.

Yeah, you can chuck a punch.
You can block one.

And that is precisely why
I am not stopping you, sir.

332
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:41,081
I distinctly remember saying you could
come if you kept your mouth shut!

333
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,797
You will need
an operating license, obviously.

334
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,382
Then pay a weapon tax...

335
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,092
- "Weapon tax"?
- And then,

336
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,678
perhaps, your little store can open.

337
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,480
Well, you don't ask for much
now, do you?

338
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,683
I am not asking for enough.

339
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,275
Let me be absolutely clear, Ms. Kean.

340
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,610
I will be keeping
a very close eye on you.

341
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,663
The first rumor I hear
about you and your little partners

342
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,537
making moves to contest me,
and Victor...

343
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,076
(GUN CLICKING)

344
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,710
...will end you
with your own merchandise.

345
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,291
Understood.

346
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,514
Couldn't have been cheap.

347
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,883
I'm sorry?

348
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,638
You lost your money on the Sirens club,

349
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,440
then went missing.
Rumor was you were dead.

350
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,648
And now you're back
with a brand-new fancy place.

351
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,480
Who paid for it?

352
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,203
You really think
I won't find out who it is?

353
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,157
(SIGHS)

354
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,701
I'm gonna take this.

355
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,185
Crane?

356
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,248
Do you believe in fate?

357
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,707
I didn't before today,

358
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,004
but you, sir, have made me a believer.

359
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,803
Of all the police in Gotham, it was you.

360
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,306
You came.

361
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,270
Jonathan.

362
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,902
What happened to you?

363
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,609
Well, first,

364
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,744
you killed my father.

365
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,197
Your father was insane.
He was trying to kill you.

366
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,032
He tried to help me.

367
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,660
Help all mankind.

368
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,962
- He was a murderer.
- He was a pioneer!

369
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,129
A genius!

370
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,218
He taught me
we can live our entire lives

371
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,594
imprisoned by our fears,

372
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,011
or we can embrace them.

373
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,774
You should know that better than anyone.

374
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,648
What will you see, I wonder.

375
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,445
What scares you the most?

376
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,709
What will you see, I wonder.

377
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,167
One of your victims, perhaps?

378
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,261
One of your victims?

379
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,006
What haunts you the most?

380
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,308
- (GROWLS)
- (WOMAN SCREAMING)

381
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,611
Lee.

382
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,407
I just...

383
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,042
I just want some...

384
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,118
God, no.

385
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,458
- What have you done?
- Don't touch me.

386
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,584
Let me go.

387
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,960
Please let me help you.

388
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,504
You've caused me so much pain.

389
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,341
I've suffered you long enough.

390
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,895
We could've been a family, had a child,

391
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,148
but you destroy everything you touch.

392
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,646
I just want

393
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,690
- peace.
- No.

394
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,280
Lee. No.

395
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,332
You can join her

396
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,708
to show her how much you truly love her.

397
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,294
Don't let her die hating you.

398
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,471
It's what she would want.

399
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,263
It's the only way to show her, love her.

400
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,938
Cut deep.

401
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,890
Cut deep. It's what she would want.

402
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,395
Cut deep and find peace.

403
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,693
Don't let her die.

404
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,147
- Follow her to death.
- No.

405
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,523
<i>She wouldn't say that.</i>

406
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,738
<i>She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

407
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:04,321
- Cut deep and find peace.
- No.

408
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,499
<i>She loves me. She loves me.
She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

409
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,574
No.

410
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,007
Crane? Where are you?

411
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,084
Crane?

412
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,799
How did you do it?

413
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,269
How did you defeat the toxin?
It's impossible!

414
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,347
I overcame my fear.

415
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,727
Liar.

416
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,445
You liar!

417
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,413
You can't just stop being afraid.

418
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,666
You can only become your demon
like I did.

419
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,745
No.

420
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,797
You have a choice, Jonathan.

421
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,501
And whatever your father was,
he didn't want this for you.

422
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,881
You need help.

423
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,099
My father thought that I was weak.

424
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,560
My whole life.

425
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,352
Scared little Jonathan.

426
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,725
Okay.

427
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,310
I can help you.

428
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,687
Let me help you.

429
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,948
But I'm not weak anymore.

430
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,621
And I will never go back
to being that boy.

431

(DISTANT LAUGHTER)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

434
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,137
Just around the corner.

435
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,104
I'm telling you, man.
He leaves the back gate open.

436
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,602
Ha-ha! It's gonna be too easy.

437
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,659
Well, well.

438
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,579
Seems we've caught our stalker.

439
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,340
And he made it way too easy.

440
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,669
Didn't know when he was being played.

441
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,129
Who are you, huh?

442
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,221
Some... Some Boy Scout?

443
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,301
He's just a kid.

444
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,979
Some kind of do-gooder?

445
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,601
Did I date your mom
and not call her back?

446
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,227
(ALL LAUGH)

447
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,522
Why you hassling us, kid?

448
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,117
I don't know, guys.
His face, it seems familiar.

449
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,739
You famous or something?

450
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,446
You know we got licenses for this, kid?

451
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,164
We're all above board.

452
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,917
- Penguin gets his share.
- That's right.

453
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,168
It's within our rights
to do anything we want to you.

454
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,082
Anything.

455
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,760
Look what you went and did.

456
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,596
You've seen my stash.

457
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,886
You've ticked off my boys.

458
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,730
Now, you're gonna die.

459
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,859
Wait.
I'm telling you, I know this kid's face.

460
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,277
Would you shut the hell up?

461
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,521
Hey, I'm telling you,
I've seen this dude.

462
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,814
Don't matter.

463
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,441
No matter who he is,

464
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,072
he's gotta go.

465

- (YELLS)
- (GUNSHOT)

466
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,374
Get up!

467
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,517
Think you're so slick, huh?

468
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,860
Now, I hate to tell you,
"I told you so," Master Bruce.

469
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:06,771
Up you get.

470
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,398
We gotta leave.

471
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,376
She said she's sorry.

472
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,579
She chose Nygma over me and Butch.

473
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,421
So? Nygma's a popsicle now.

474
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,132
Let's give her a chance.

475
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,550
Why do you want this so bad?

476
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:32,047
Because I'm sick and tired
of not being taken seriously.

477
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,637
All those selfish guys out there
who treat me like I'm stupid?

478
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,677
Alone, I can't do much about it.

479
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,222
With Barbara, maybe.

480
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,983
But with you and Barbara?

481
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,654
The three of us could give
all those creeps a run for their money.

482
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,147
I want in.

483
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,284
- Get out.
- No. Please, just hear me out.

484
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,658
No.

485
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,117
You're a Penguin stooge.

486
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,711
What? I hate that freak.

487
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,256
Oh, please, you guzzled down
his Kool-Aid. Beat it.

488
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,713
No one takes me seriously, either.

489
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,635
There's nothing
I wouldn't do to get back

490
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,462
at the men who treated me like garbage.

491
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,297
Nothing.

492
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,926
Not buying it.
You're working for Penguin.

493
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,352
Cool down, okay? I believe her.

494
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,887
Thank you.

495
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,389
Know what?

496
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,391
You're rude.

497
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,155
And you're about to get your skinny ass
kicked down the block.

498
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,440
I won't ask again.

499
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,317
Get out.

(DOOR CLOSES)

501
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,795
Get word to Barbara. I'll talk business.

502
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,667
But I'll need something in return.

503
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,295
GORDON: Crane?

504
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,551
- CRANE: The demon is here.
- Crane?

505
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,976
CRANE: The demon who haunts
and tortures you is here.

506
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,097
The one who poisoned your minds.

507
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,768
Destroy him and free yourself
from his tyranny.

514

- You could've been killed.
- But I wasn't.

515
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,099
That's 'cause I followed you.

516
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,063
I had it under control.

517

How am I supposed to support you
if you refuse

518

to accept the realities
of the situation?

No. Not at all.

Please come in.

525
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,667
Forgive me.

526
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,460
I should have called, but...

527
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,137
Well, I just couldn't stop thinking
about our last chat.

528
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,311
Wayne Enterprises were developing
a durable material

529
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,810
for military uniforms
when I worked there.

530
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,151
It is a thin Kevlar weave
with reinforced forearm protection.

531
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,990
The gloves have a faceted grip design

532
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,113
to help you cling to any surface.

533
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,321
The whole uniform
is extremely lightweight

534
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:30,452
and actually bulletproof to impacts
from 10 feet or more.

535
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,954
You know, for rock climbing.

536
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,125
Oh, and long-distance
radio communicators.

537
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,628
In case you two wish
to talk to each other

538
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,962
whilst climbing rock.

539
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,850
Well, I will not keep you.

540
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,855
I just didn't want to see you
get hurt again, Mr. Wayne.

541
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,433
Thank you, Mr. Fox.

542
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,230
I feel safer already.

543
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:06,533
Ladies. Thank you for returning.
I'm glad...

544
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,613
Not so fast.

545
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,579
I'll be needing proof of your sincerity.

546
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,127
Yes. Selena said you would
need something from me.

547
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,335
- You can have anything you like.
- Fine.

548
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:19,917
I'll take your hand.

549
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,795
My what?

550
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,265
Both Butch and I lost a hand due
to Penguin's Machiavellian war games.

551
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,145
I believe it's your turn.

552
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,606
- You didn't say anything about this.
- Quiet.

553
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,766
- Tabitha, I assure you...
- No more words.

554
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,191
Penguin cut off Butch's hand,
Nygma mine.

555
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,527
Now I take yours.

556
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:45,984
Fine.

557

If this is the only way
I can get you to trust me,

558
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,744
so be it.

559
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,187
Fine.

560
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,189

PENGUIN: Where is he?

564
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,474
We had a deal, Detective Gordon.

565
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,937
That you would apprehend Jonathan Crane.

566
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,857
You made a demand
in front of your cronies

567
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,855
in an attempt to undermine
me and this department.

568
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,698
There was no deal.

569
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,651
I spoke for all of
the citizens of Gotham

570
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,409
when I said that the GCPD
can no longer keep us safe.

571
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,790
How many of you are sick
of risking your lives every day

572
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,711
just to see criminals escape?

573
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,632
How many times has this very building
become a war zone?

00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,257
To police ourselves.

577
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,183
I will triple the wage
of any cop here who wants to work for me

578
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,140
in ensuring the safety
of this city's people.

579
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,976
The future is now.

580
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,611
Follow me into it.

581

Police yourselves.

582

He just wants to pay you
to look the other way.

583
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,569
Would you blame them if they did?

584
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,494
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

585
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,542
This is a war, not one battle.

586
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,913
If I would've went with you,
I would've lost them.

587
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,711
And we need them to win this war.

588
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,339
Now, you don't have to say nothing,

589
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,795
but I am buying you a drink.

590
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,821
Oh, no, not you. Leave!

591
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,069
You never paid
for the last stuff I gave you.

592
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,658
You make me smell perfume,
make me giddy. Cheap trick!

593
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,031
Out! Out!

594
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,082
I'm done with perfumes.

595
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,001
I'm here for the good stuff.

596
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,206
Don't know what you're talking about.
Leave! I'm closing up.

597
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,212
Word is you have potions here.

00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,846
Ancient, mystical potions
made by shamans all over the world.

599

- Combination?
- It's open.

608
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,861
Which ones make me stronger?

609
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,993
That's dangerous stuff.
It's too powerful for you.

610
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,915
It can get in your blood, your DNA.

You let me walk into
that nightmare alone.

617
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,949
Yeah, well, I figured it would take

618
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,402
more than a couple of loonies
to take you out.

619
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,405
Besides, I figured you and me
taking on Penguin

620
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,038
and the entire criminal underground
by ourselves wasn't the best idea.

621
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,128
So, what, you wanna sit here,
do nothing, get drunk?

622

- Is that your plan?
- Unless you got a better one.

What makes you think those cops
back there were wrong?

624
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,337
Are we really making a difference?

625
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,056
One worth risking our lives over?

626
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,979
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

627
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,731
Makes me miss Falcone.

628
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,270
I mean, I know he's a vicious bastard,
but he was... He was fair.

629
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,315
He ran the criminals in this city
with an iron fist. There was...

630
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,241
There was honor.

631
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,488
- No.
- What?

632
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,164
Do not mess with Falcone.

633

You killed his son, remember?
Italians do not forget that crap.

634
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,543
He must hate what Penguin's doing
as much as we do.

635
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,875
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

636
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,761
Yeah, well...

637
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,349
Like you said, we need an army.

638
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,342
